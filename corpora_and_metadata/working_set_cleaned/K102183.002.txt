my story and to lay before the public some more of my observations and hints this second volume is chiefly a further vindication of myself and the observations i add on subjects and matters of various kinds are such reflections as resulted from the reason and nature of things and were formed by a judgment free and unbiassed by any authority my own apology is the principal thing interspersed with real characters of several sorts and the additions to it are as many solid natural and delicate adventitious things as came in my way this is my book i write with modesty and i purpose to do good i

tuphloperogamia is the rev mr william thompson a junior fellow of trinity college dublin when i was a member of that university he was a man of the finest parts and learning and was remarkable for a temper so vastly happy that he was always called benign billy his paraphrase on job in blank verse is an admirable thing it is in my opinion far preferable to the ingenious broomes paraphrase on this sacred book  that is  go happy pair in strictest bonds allied whom nature joins and can alone divide it is thus their riches and their joys increase their cares grow lighter and they smile in peace  an apology for the married state    when i consider how happy i have been in the married state and in a succession of seven wives never had one uneasy hour that even a paradise without an eve would have been a wilderness to me that the woods the groves the walks the prospects the flowers the fruits the day the night all would have wanted a relish without that dear delightful companion a wife it amazes me to hear many sensible people speak with abhorrence of matrimony and insist upon it that wedlock produces so many troubles even where the pair have affection and sorrows so very great when they have no love for each other or begin to fail in the kind and obliging offices that it is contrary to reason to contract if we have a just regard to peace and satisfaction of mind and would avoid as much as possible the woes and bewailings of this turbid period if you have acquired the divine habits marriage may unhinge them it often forces even the pious into immoralities true unhappy are many a wedded pair years of calamity this engagement has produced to thousands of mortals it has made the most pious divines become very cruel as i could relate it has caused the most generous sensible men to murder the women they adored before they were their wives  the history of orlando and bellinda    this story has been told before by the tatler in his    d paper but as he has related only by hear say and was mistaken in several particulars the account i give of this extraordinary affair may be grateful to the reader  when i was a little boy in dublin between seven and eight mr eustace and his lady lived next door to my father in smithfield and the two families were intimate being a lively prating thing mrs eustace was fond of me and by tarts and fruit encouraged me to run into her parlour as often as i could this made me well acquainted in the house and as i was a remarker so early in my life i had an opportunity of making the following observations  orlando eustace was a tall thin strong man well made and a very genteel person his face was pale and marked with the smallpox his features were good and yet there was something fierce in his look even when he was not displeased he had sense and learning and with a large fortune was a generous man but passionate to an amazing degree for his understanding and a trifle would throw him into a rage he had been humoured in every thing from his cradle on account of his fine estate from his infancy to his manhood had been continually flattered and in every thing obeyed this made him opinionated and proud obstinate and incapable of bearing the least contradiction  bellinda coot his lady with whom he had been passionately in love was as fine a figure as could be seen among the daughters of men her person was charming her face was beautiful and had a sweetness in it that was pleasing to look at her vivacity was great and her understanding extraordinary but she had a satirical wit and a vanity which made her delight in showing the weakness of other minds and the clearness of her own conception she was too good however to have the least malice in such procedure it was human weakness and a desire to make her neighbors wiser unfortunately for her she was married to a man who of all men in the world was the unfittest subject for her quick fancy to act on  but notwithstanding this eustace and bellinda were for the most of their time very fond as she was formed in a prodigality of nature to show mankind a finished composition and had wit and charms enough to fire the dullest and most insensible heart a man of orlandos taste for the sex could not be without an inflamed heart when so near the transporting object of desire she was his delight for almost a year the dear support of his life he seemed to value her esteem her respect her love and endeavored to merit them by the virtues which fortify love and therefore when by his being short positive and unreasonable in his dictates as was too often his wont and on her being intemperate in the strong sentiments her imagination produced upon the occasion which was too frequently the case when they seemed to forget the apostles advice for a while that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently   pet i    and had strifes and debates which showed for the time they lasted that they were far from being perfect and entire wanting nothing then would her throwing her face into smiles with some tender expression prove a reconciling method at once till the fatal night this always had a power to soften pain to ease and calm the raging man  but poor at best is the condition of human life here below and when to weak and imperfect faculties we add inconsistencies and do not act up to the eternal law of reason and of god when love of fame curiosity resentment or any of our particular propensities when humor vanity or any of our inferior powers are permitted to act against justice and veracity and instead of reflecting on the reason of the thing or the right of the case that by the influence this has on the mind we may be constituted virtuous and attached to truth we go down with the current of the passions and let bent and humor determine us in opposition to what is decent and fit if in a state so unfriendly as this is to the heavenly and divine life where folly and vice are for ever striving to introduce disorder into our frame and it is difficult indeed to preserve in any degree an integrity of character and peace within  if in such a situation instead of laboring to destroy all the seeds of envy pride ill will and impatience and endeavoring to establish and maintain a due inward economy and harmony by paying a perpetual regard to truth that is to the real circumstances and relation of things in which we stand  to the practice of reason in its just extent according to the capacities and natures of every being we do on the contrary disregard the moral faculty and become a mere system of passions and affections without any thing at the head of them to govern them  what then can be expected but deficiency and deformity degeneracy and guilty practice this was the case of eustace and bellinda passion and ownwill were so near and intimate to him that he seemed to live under a deliberate resolution not to be governed by reason he would wink at the light he had struggle to evade conviction and make his mind a chaos and a hell bellinda at the same time was too quick too vain and too often forgot to take into her idea of a good character a continual subordination of the lower powers of our nature to the faculty of reason this produced the following scene  maria sister to bellinda returned one evening with a fiveguinea fan she had bought that afternoon and was tedious in praising some indian figures that were painted in it mrs eustace who had a taste for pictures said the colors were fine but the images ridiculous and despicable and her sister must certainly be a little indianmad or her fondness for every thing from that side of the globe could not be so excessive and extravagant as it always appeared to be  to this maria replied with some heat and eustace very peremptorily insisted upon it that she was right with positiveness and passion he magnified the beauties of the figures in the fan and with violence reflected so severely on the good judgment bellinda upon all occasions pretended to as he expressed it that at last her imagination was fired and with too much eagerness she not only ridiculed the opinion of her sister in respect of such things but spoke with too much warmth against the despotic tempers of selfsufficient husbands  to reverence and obey she said was not required by any obligation when men were unreasonable and paid no regard to a wifes domestic and personal felicity nor would she give up her understanding to his weak determination since custom cannot confer an authority which nature has denied it cannot license a husband to be unjust nor give right to treat her as a slave if this was to be the case in matrimony and women were to suffer under conjugal vexations as she did by his senseless arguments every day they had better bear the reproach and solitude of antiquated virginity and be treated as the refuse of the world in the character of old maids  this too lively though just speech enraged eustace to the last degree and from a fury he sunk in a few minutes into a total sullen silence and sat for half an hour while i stayed cruelly determining i suppose her sad doom bellinda soon saw she had gone too far and did all that could be done to recover him from the fit he was in she smiled cried asked pardon but twas all in vain every charm had lost its power and he seemed no longer man when this beauty stood weeping by his chair and said my love forgive me as it was in rallery only i spoke and let our pleasures and pains be hereafter honestly shared i remember the tears burst from my eyes and in that condition i went away it was frightful to look at eustace as he shook started and wildly stared and the distress his lady appeared in was enough to make the most stony heart bleed it was a dismal scene  this happened at nine at night and at ten orlando withdrew to bed without speaking one word as i was informed soon after he lay down he pretended to be fast asleep and his wife rejoicing to find him so as she believed in hopes that natures soft nurse would lull the active instruments of motion and calm the raging operations of his mind she resigned herself to slumbers and thought to abolish for that night every disagreeable sensation of pain but no sooner did this furious man find that his charming wife was really asleep than he plunged a dagger into her breast the monster repeated the strokes while she had life to speak to him in the tenderest manner and conjured him in regard to his own happiness to let her live and not sink himself into perdition here and hereafter by her death in vain she prayed he gave her a thousand wounds and i saw her the next morning a bloody mangled corpse in the great house in smithfield which stood at a distance from the street with a wall before it and an avenue of high trees up to the door and not in the country as the tatler says  eustace fled when he thought she was expiring though she lived for an hour after to relate the case to her maid who heard her groan and came into her room and went from dublin to a little lodge he had in the country about twenty miles from town the magistrates in a short time had information where he was and one john mansel a constable a bold and strong man undertook for a reward to apprehend him to this purpose he set out immediately with a case of pistols and a hanger and lurked several days and nights in the fields before he could find an opportunity of coming at him for eustace lived by himself in the house well secured by strong doors and bars and only went out now and then to an alehouse the master of which was his friend near it at last about break of day mansel chanced to find him and upon his refusing to be made a prisoner and cocking a pistol to shoot the officer of justice both their pistols were discharged at once and they both dropped down dead men eustace was shot in the heart and the constable in the brain they were both brought to dublin on one of the little lowbackd cars there used and i was one of the boys that followed the car from the beginning of jamesstreet the outside of the city all through the town eustaces head hung dangling near the ground with his face upwards and his torn bloody breast bare and of all the faces of the dead i have seen none ever looked like his there was an anxiety a rage a horror and a despair to be seen in it that no pencil could express    the apology for the married state continued    thus fell eustace in the   th year of his age and by his hand his virtuous beautiful and ingenious wife and what are we to learn from thence is it that on such accounts we ought to dread wedlock and never be concerned with a wife no surely but to be from thence convinced that it is necessary in order to a happy marriage to bring the will to the obedience of reason and acquire an equanimity in the general tenor of life of all things in this world moral dominion or the empire over ourselves is not only the most glorious as reason is the superior nature of man but the most valuable in respect of real human happiness a conformity to reason or good sense and to the inclination of our neighbors with very little money may produce great and lasting felicity but without this subservience to our own reason complaisance to company and softness and benevolence to all around us the greatest misery does frequently sprout from the largest stock of fortunes  it was by ungoverned passions that eustace murdered his wife and died himself the most miserable and wretched of all human beings he might have been the happiest of mortals if he had conformed to the dictates of reason and softened his passions as well for his own ease as in compliance to a creature formed with a mind of a quite different make from his own there is a sort of sex in souls and exclusive of that love and patience which our religion requires every couple should remember that there are things which grow out of their very natures that are pardonable when considered as such let them not therefore be spying out faults nor find a satisfaction in reproaching but let them examine to what consequences their ideas tend and resolve to cease from cherishing them when they lead to contention and mischief let them both endeavor to amend what is wrong in each other and act as becomes their character in practicing the social duties of married persons which are so frequently and strongly inculcated by revelation and natural reason and then instead of matrimonys being a burden and hanging a weight upon our very beings there will be no appearance of evil in it but harmony and joy will shed unmixed felicities on them they will live in no low degree of beatitude in the suburbs of heaven  this was my case wedlock to me became the greatest blessing a scene of the most refined friendship and a condition to which nothing can be added to complete the sum of human felicity so i found the holy and sublime relation and in the wilds of westmoreland enjoyed a happiness as great as human nature is capable of on this planet sensible to all the ties of social truth and honor my partner and i lived in perfect felicity on the products of our solitary farm the amiable dispositions of her mind cheerfulness good nature discretion and diligence gave a perpetual dignity and luster to the grace and loveliness of her person and as i did all that love and fidelity could do by practicing every rule of caution prudence and justice to prevent variance soften cares and preserve affection undiminished the harmony of our state was unmixed and divine since the primitive institution of the relation it never existed in a more delightful manner devoted to each others heart we desired no other happiness in this world than to pass life away together in the solitude we were in we lived hoped and feared but for each other and made it our daily study to be what revealed religion prescribes and the concurrent voice of nature requires in the sacred tie do so likewise ye mortals who intend to marry and ye may like us be happy as the instincts and passions were wisely and kindly given us to subserve many purposes of our present state let them have their proper subaltern share of action but let reason ever have the sovereignty the divine law of reason and truth and be as it were sail and wind to the vessel of life  our manner of living at orionlodge    two years almost this fine scene lasted and during that period the business and diversions of our lone retreat appeared so various and pleasing that it was not possible to think a hundred years so spent in the least degree dull and tedious exclusive of books and gardening and the improvement of the farm we had during the sine season a thousand charming amusements on the mountains and in the glens and valleys of that sweet silent place whole days we would spend in fishing and dine in some cool grot by the waterside or under an aged tree on the margin of some beautiful stream we generally used the fly and rod but if in haste had recourse to one of the little waterfalls and by fixing a net under one of them would take a dozen or two of very large trouts in a few minutes time  by a little waterfall i mean one of those that are formed by some small river which tumbles there in various places from rock to rock about four feet each fall and makes a most beautiful view from top to bottom of a fall there are many of these falling waters among the vast mountains of westmoreland i have seen them likewise in the highlands of scotland  glencrow waterfalls at glencrow half way between dumbarton and inverary there are some very fine ones and just by them one campbell keeps a poor inn there we were entertained with water and whisky oatcakes milk butter and trouts he took by the net at one of the little falls of a river that descends a prodigious mountain near his lone house and forms like what we have at ortonlodge a most beautiful scene several happy days i passed at this place with a dear creature who is now a saint in heaven  the great age and size of carp and tench in a fenny water near ortonlodge at other times we had the diversion of taking as much carp and tench as we pleased in a large standing fenny water that lies about two miles from the lodge in a glen and always found the fish of this water of an enormous size three feet long though the general length of fish of this species is eleven inches in our ponds this vast bigness must be owing to the great age of these fish i may suppose at least an hundred years for it is certain that in gardenponds which have for experiments sake been left undisturbed for many years the carp and tench have been found alive and grown to a surprising bigness  the state of carp and tench put into a pond by a gentleman of my acquaintance a gentleman my near relation who lived to a very long age put some fish of these species into a pond the day that colonel ewer at the head of seven other officers presented to the commons that fatal remonstrance which in fact took off the head of charles that is november  0      and in the year      seventynine years after on his return to that seat he found them all alive and near two feet and a half in length this demonstrates that fish may live to a very great age it likewise proves that they continue to grow till they are an hundred years old and then are the finest eating  another of our amusements during the summers bright day was the pointer and gun for the black cock the moor cock and the cock of the wood which are in great plenty on those vast hills charlotte was fond of this sport and would walk with me for hours to see me knock down the game till late in the evening we would wander over the fells and then return to our clean peaceful little house to sup as elegantly on our birds the black cock is as large as our game cocks description of the black cock and flies very swift and strong the head and eyes are large and round the eyes is a beautiful circle of red the beak is strong and black as the body the legs robust and red it is very high eating more so than any native in england except the fenortolan but in one particular it exceeds the fen birds for it has two tastes it being brown and white meat under a lay of brown is a lay of white meat both delicious the brown is higher than the black moor cock and the white much richer than the pheasant  the moorcock the moor cock is likewise very rare but is to be had sometimes in london as the sportsmen meet with it now and then on the hillyheaths not very far from town particularly on hindheadheath in the way to portsmouth it is as large as a good darking fowl and the color is a deep irongrey its eyes are large and fine as the black cocks but instead of the red circle round them it has bright and beautiful scarlet eyebrows  the cock of the wood the cock of the wood as unknown in london as the black cock is almost as large as a turkey but flies well the back is a mixture of black gray and a reddish brown the belly gray and the breast a pale brown with transverse lines of black and a little white at the tips of the feathers it has a large round head of the purest black and over its fine hazle eyes there is a naked space that looks like an eyebrow of bright scarlet it is delicious eating but far inferior to the black cock    as the great could do and with a harmony and unmixed joy they are for ever strangers to after supper over some little nectaredbowl we sweetly chatted till it was bedtime or i played on my flute and charlotte divinely sung it was a happy life all the riches and honors of the world cannot produce such scenes of bliss as we experienced in a cottage in the wilds of westmoreland even the winter which is ever boisterous and extreme cold in that part of the world was no severity to us as we had most excellent provisions of every kind in abundance and plenty of firing from the ancient woods which cover many of those high hills and two men servants and two maids to do whatever tended to being and to wellbeing to supply our wants and to complete our happiness  this softened the hard rough scene and the roaring waters and the howling winds appeared pleasing sounds in short every season and all our hours were quite charming and full of delight good tom fleming our friend did likewise enhance our felicity by coming once or twice a week to see us and staying sometimes two or three days in the summer time we also went now and then to visit him and if one was inclined to melancholy yet it was impossible to be dull while he was by his humor and his songs over a bowl of punch were enough to charm the most splenetic and make even rancour throw its face into smiles  the death of charlotte my friend tom fleming and others      aetat       two years as i have said this fine scene lasted and during that soft transporting period i was the happiest man on earth but in came death when we least expected him snatched my charming partner from me and melted all my happiness into air into thin air a fever in a few days snapt off the thread of her life and made me the child of affliction when i had not a thought of the mourner language cannot paint the distress this calamity reduced me to nor give an idea of what i suffered when i saw her eyes swimming in death and the throws of her departing spirit blessed as she was in the exercise of every virtue that adorns a woman how inconsolable must her husband be and to add to my distress by the same fever fell my friend tom fleming who came the day before my wife sickened to see us one of my lads likewise died and the two servant maids they all lay dead around me and i sat like one inanimate by the corpse of charlotte till friar fleming the brother of tom brought coffins and buried them all thus did felicity vanish from my sight and i remained like a traveller in greenland who had lost the sun  a reflection on death    o eloquent just and mighty death says raleigh it is thou alone puts wisdom into the human heart and suddenly makes man to know himself it is death that makes the conquenor ashamed of his fame and wish he had rather stolen out of the world than purchased the report of his actions by rapine oppression and cruelty by giving in spoil the innocent and laboring soul to the idle and insolent by emptying the cities of the world of their ancient inhabitants and filling them again with so many and so variable sorts of sorrows it is death tells the proud and insolent that they are but objects and humbles them at the instant makes them cry complain and repent yea even to hate their former happiness it is death takes the account of the rich and proves him a beggar a naked beggar which has interest in nothing but the gravel which fills his mouth it is death holds a glass before the eyes of the most beautiful and makes them see therein their deformity and rottenness and they acknowledge it  whom none could advise thou have persuaded what none have dared thou have done and whom all the world has flattered thou only have cast out of the world and despised thou have drawn together all the farstretched greatness all the pride cruelty and ambition of man all the powerful charms of beauty and covered it all over with these two narrow words hic jacet  nor is this all mighty death it is thou that leadest to the resurrection of the dead the dissolution of the world the judgment day and the eternal state of men it is thou that finishes the trial of men and seals their characters for happiness or misery for ever  be thou then death our morning and evening meditation let us learn from thee the vanity of all human things and that it is the most amazing folly to melt away time and misapply talents as the generality of reasonable beings do that we were not made men thinking rational beings capable of the noblest contemplations to spend all our thoughts and time in sense and pleasure in dressing feeding and sporting or in purchases building and planting but to prepare for a dying hour that when at the call of god we go out of the body not knowing whither we go we may like abraham travel by faith and trust to the conduct of the lord of all countries since we must die and thy power o death we see is uncontrolable since to the dust we must return and take our trial at the bar of almighty god as intelligent and free agents for under moral government and god is a perfectly wise and righteous governor the wickedness of the wicked will be upon him and the righteousness of the righteous will be upon him  since we must be numbered with the dead and our circumstances and condition indicate a future judgment surely we ought to remove our chief concern from this world to the other and transfer our principal regard to the immortal spirit that in the hour of agony a virtuous mind purity of conscience and good actions may procure us the favor of god and the guidance of his good spirit to the mansions of the blessed where new pleasures are for ever springing up and the happiness of the heavenly inhabitants is perpetually increasing this is the one thing needful death demonstrates that this world of darkness and error changes and chances is not worth fixing our heart on to secure our passage into the regions of perfect and eternal day should be the employment of immortal mortals     thus did i reflect as i sat among the dead with my eyes fastened on the breathless corpse of charlotte and i wished if it was possible to have leave to depart and in the hospitable grave lie down from toil and pain to take my last repose for i knew not what to do nor where to go i was not qualified for the world nor had i a friend or even an acquaintance in it that i knew where to find but in vain i prayed it was otherwise decreed i must go on or continue a solitary in the wild i was in the latter it was not possible for me to do in the state of mind i was in overwhelmed with sorrow and without a companion of any kind and therefore i must of necessity go to some other place i sold all the living things i had to friar fleming and locked up my doors my furniture linen clothes books liquors and some salt provisions instruments of various kinds and such like things i left in their several places there was no one to take them or probability that any one would come there to disturb them and perhaps some time or other the fates might bring me back again to the lone place though it was then a desolate silent habitation a striking memento of the vanity and precarious existence of all human good things yet it was possible that hearty friendship festivity and social life might once more be seen there the force and operation of casualties did wonders every day and time might give me even a relish for the solitude in a few years more thus did i settle affairs in that remote place and taking leave of my friend the friar with my lad o finn rode off  section ii collect thy powers divine and then drive off that evil thing called fear that slavish fiend let hope let joy thy bosom inmates be through life still cherished and in death held fast a gracious god loudspeaking to thy heart through all his works this truth inculcates still natures thy nurse and providence thy friend integrity with fearless heart ride on undaunted tread the various path through life day thoughts august        the authors departure from ortonlodge to try his fortune once more    the sun was rising when we mounted our horses and i again went out to try my fortune in the world not like the chevalier of la mancha in hopes of conquering a kingdom or marrying some great princess but to see if i could find another good country girl for a wife and get a little more money as they were the only two things united that could secure me from melancholy and confer real happiness to this purpose as the day was extremely fine and finn had something cold and a couple of bottles at the end of his valife i gave my horse the rein and let him take what way his fancy chose for some time he gently trotted the path he had often gone and over many a mountain made his road but at last he brought me to a place i was quite a stranger to and made a full stop at a deep and rapid water which ran by the bottom of a very high hill i had not been up before over this river i made him go though it was far from being safe and in an hours ride from that flood came to a fine rural scene  a delightful spot of earth among the fells of westmoreland    it was pastureground of a large extent and in many places covered with groves of trees of various kinds walnuts chestnuts and oaks the poplar the planetree the mulberry and maple there was likewise the phoenician cedar the larix the largeleafed laurel and the cytissus of virgil in the middle of this place were the ruins of an old seat overrun with shrubby plants the virginia creeper the boxthorn the jessamine the honeysuckle the periwinkle the birdweed the ivy and the climber and near the door was a flowing spring of water which formed a beautiful stream and babbled to the river we came from charming scene so silent sweet and pretty that i was highly pleased with the discovery  a description of basil groves the seat of charles henley esquire    on the margin of the brook under a mulberry tree i dined on something which finn produced from his wallet tongue and ham and potted black cock and having drank a pint of cider set out again to try what land lay right onwards in an hour we came to a large and dangerous watery moor which we crossed over with great difficulty and then arrived at a range of mountains through which there was a narrow pass wet and stony a long and tedious ride which ended on the border of a fine country at four in the afternoon we arrived on the confines of a plain about a hundred acres which was strewed with various flowers of the earths natural produce that rendered the glebe delightful to behold and was surrounded with groves the place had all the charms that verdure forest and vale can give a country in the center of this ground was a handsome square building and behind it a large and beautiful garden which had a low thick hollyhedge that encompassed it as the door of this house was not locked but opened by a silver spring turner i went in and found it was one fine spacious room filled on every side with books bound in an extraordinary manner globes telescopes and other instruments of various kinds were placed on stands and there were two fine writingtables one at each end of the library which had paper ink and pens in the middle of the room there was a readingdesk which had a short inscription and on it leaned the skeleton of a man the legend said  this skeleton was once charles henley esquire  amazed i stood looking on these things and wondered much at the figure of the bones tacked together with wires once to be sure the master of this grand collection of books and manuscripts and this fine room so sweetly situated in the center of distant groves this skeleton had a striking effect on my mind and the more so as it held a scroll of parchment on which was beautifully written in the courthand to appear more remarkable i suppose the following lines  fellowmortal whoever thou art whom the fates shall conduct into this chamber remember that before many years are passed thou must be laid in the bed of corruption in the dark caverns of death among the lifeless dust and rotten bones of others and from the grave proceed to the general resurrection of all to new life and vigor thou will most certainly be raised to be brought to a great account naked and defenseless thou must stand before the awful tribunal of the great god and from him receive a final sentence which shall determine and fix thee in an eternal state of happiness or misery  what an alarm should this be ponder my fellowmortal and remember god now commands men every where to repent because he has appointed a day in which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he has ordained whereof he has given assurance unto all men in that he has raised him from the dead  judge the world  judgment  the very found is solemn should it not deaden some part at least of your concern for things temporal and quicken your care and industry for the future life  ought it not to make us condemn before the dying hour our vanity and devotedness to bodily things and make us employ the greatest part of our time in the acquisition of wisdom and an improvement in virtue that when we appear at the sessions of righteousness a sacred knowledge a heavenly piety and an angelic goodness may secure us from eternal punishment and entitle us to a glorious eternity since a future judgment is most certainly the case and the consequence eternal damnation or salvation how contemptible a thing is a long busy life spent in raking through the mire of trade and business in pursuit of riches and a large estate or in sweating up the steep hill of ambition after fame and ambition or in living and dressing as if we were all body and sent into time for no other purpose than to adorn like idols gratify like brutes and waste life in sensuality and vanity  how contemptible and unreasonable is this kind of existence for beings who were created to no other end than to be partakers of a divine life with god and sing hallelujahs to all eternity to separate the creature from error fiction impurity and corruption and acquire that purity and holiness which alone can see god away then with a worldly heart away with all those follies which engage us like fools and madmen and let the principal thing be to follow the steps of our great master by patience and resignation by a charity and contempt of the world and by keeping a conscience void of offense amidst the changes and chances of this mortal life that at his second coming to judge the world we may be found acceptable in his sight  what a scene must this second coming be i saw says an apostle a great white throne and him that sat on it from whose face the earth and the heavens fled away and there was no place found for them and i saw the dead small and great stand before god and the books were opened and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books and the sea gave up her dead and death and hell delivered up their dead which were in them and they were judged every man according to their works the secret wickedness of men will be brought to light and concealed piety and persecuted virtue be acknowledged and honored while innocence and piety are set at the right hand of the judge and the righteous shall shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their father for ever and ever shame and confusion must sit upon the faces of the sinner and the ungodly damnation will stand before the brethren in iniquity and when the intolerable sentence is executed what inexpressible agonies will they fall into what amazement and excesses of horror must seize upon them  ponder then in time fellowmortal and choose to be good rather than to be great prefer your baptismal vows to the pomps and vanities of this world and value the secret whispers of a good conscience more than the noise of popular applause  since you must appear before the judgment seat of christ that every one may receive the things done in his body according to that he has done whether it be good or bad let it be your work from morning till night to keep jesus in your hearts and long for nothing desire nothing hope for nothing but to have all that is within you changed into the spirit and temper of the holy jesus wherever you go whatever you do do all in imitation of his temper and inclination and look upon all as nothing but that which exercises and increases the spirit and life of christ in your souls  let this be your christianity your church and your religion and the judgmentday will be a charming scene if in this world the will of the creature as an offspring of the divine will wills and works with the will of god and labors without ceasing to come as near as mortals can to the purity and perfection of the divine nature then will the day of the lord be a day of great joy and with unutterable pleasure you shall hear that tremendous voice awake ye dead and come to judgment in transports and full of honor and glory the wise and righteous will hear the happy sentence come ye blessed of my father inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world  this and the skeleton astonished me not a little and my wonder at the whole increased as i could find no human creature living nor discover any house or cottage for an inhabitant this i though exceeded all the strange things i had seen in this wonderful country but perhaps it occured at last there might be a mansion in the woods before me or somewhere in the groves on either side and therefore leaving the library after i had spent an hour in it i walked onwards and came to a wood which had private walks cut through it and strewed with sand they showed only light enough to distinguish the blaze of day from evening shade and had feats dispersed to sit and listen to the chorus of the birds which added to the pleasures of the soft silent place for about three hundred yards the walk i was in extended and then terminated in meadows which formed an oval of twenty acres surrounded by groves like the large plain i came from exactly in the middle of these fields part of which were turned into gardens there stood a very handsome stone house and not far from the door of it a fountain played on either side of the water was a gardenchair of a very extraordinary make curious and beautiful and each of them stood under an evergreen oak the broad leaved ilex a charming shade  a description of john henley esquire    in one of these chairs sat an ancient gentleman a venerable man whose hair was white as silver and his countenance had dignity and goodness his dress and manner showed him to be a person of fortune and distinction and by a servant in waiting it appeared he was lord of the seigneurie i was arrived at he was tall and graceful and had not the least stoop though he wanted but a year of an hundred i could not but admire the fine old gentleman  description of statia henley the granddaughter of john henley esquire    on the same chair next to him sat a young lady who was at this time just turned of twenty and had such diffusive charms as soon new fired my heart and gave my soul a softness even beyond what it had felt before she was a little taller than the middle size and had a face that was perfectly beautiful her eyes were extremely fine full black sparkling and her conversation was as charming as her person both easy unconstrained and sprightly  a conversation between john henley esquire and the author    when i came near two such personages i bowed low to the ground and asked pardon for intruding into their fine retirement but the stars had led me a wanderer to this delightful solitude without the least idea of there being such a place in our island and as their malignant rays had forced me to offend without intending it i hoped they would pardon my breaking in upon them  to this the old gentleman replied you have not offended sir i assure you but are welcome to the groves of basil it gives me pleasure to see you here for it is very seldom we are favored with any ones company it is hard to discover or make out a road to this place as we are surrounded almost by impassable mountains and a very dangerous morass nor can i conceive how you found the way here without a guide or ventured to travel this country as there are no towns in this part of the county there must be something very extraordinary in your case and as you mentioned your being a wanderer i should be glad to hear the cause of your journeying in this uninhabited region but first mr henley said as it is now near eight at night and you must want refreshment having met with no inn the whole day we will go in to supper he then arose and brought me to an elegant parlour where a table was soon covered with the best cold things and we immediately sat down every eatable was excellent and the wine and other liquors in perfection miss henley sat at the head of the table her grandfather over against her and placed me at her right hand between them both the young lady behaved in a very easy genteel manner and the old gentleman with freedom cheerfulness and good manners till nine this scene lasted and then mr henley again requested i would oblige him with an account of my travels in that part of the world this i said i would do in the best manner i could and while he leaned back in his easy chair and the beautiful statia fastened her glorious eyes upon me i went on in the following words  a summary of the authors history from the beginning of his   th year till his arrival at the groves of basil in      in the   th year of his age    i am an englishman sir but have passed the greatest part of my life in ireland and from the western extremity of it i came my father is one of the rich men in that kingdom and was for many years the tenderest and most generous parent that ever son was blessed with he spared no cost on my education and gave me leave to draw upon him while i resided in the university of dublin five years for what i pleased extravagant as i was in several articles he never set any bounds to my demands nor asked me what i did with the large sums i had yearly from him my happiness was his felicity and the glory of his life to have me appear to the greatest advantage and in the most respected character that money can gain a man  but at last he married his servant maid an artful cruel woman who obtained by her wit and charms so great an ascendant over him that he abandoned me to raise a young nephew this stepmother had to what splendour and power she pleased he had every thing he could name that money could procure and was absolute master of the house and land not a shilling at this time could i get nor obtain the least thing i asked for and because i refused to become preceptor to this young man and had made some alteration in my religion having renounced that creed which was composed nobody knows by whom and introduced into the church in the darkest ages of popish ignorance a symbol which strongly participates of the true nature and spirit of popery in those severe denunciations of gods wrath which it pours so plentifully forth against all those whose heads are not turned to believe it my father was so enraged that he would not even admit me to his table any longer but bid me be gone my motherinlaw likewise for ever abused me and her nephew the lad insulted me when i came in his way  being thus compelled to withdraw i set sail for england as soon as it was in my power and arrived in cumberland by the force of a storm i proceeded from thence to the mountains of stanemore to look for a gentleman my friend who lived among those hills and as i journeyed over them and missed him i chanced to meet with a fine northern girl and a habitation to my purpose i married her and for almost two years past was the happiest of the human race till the sable curtain fell between us and the angel of death translated her glorious soul to the fields of paradise not able to bear the place of our residence after i had lost my hearts fond idol i left the charming spot and mansion where unmixed felicity had been for some time my portion and i was traveling on toward london to see what is ordained there in reserve for me when by accident i lost my way and the fates conducted me to the groves of basil curiosity led me into the library i found in the plain without this wood from whence in search for some human creatures i proceeded to the fountain where i had the pleasure of seeing you sir and this young lady this is a summary of my past life what is before me heaven only knows my fortune i trust with the preserver of men and the father of spirits one thing i am certain of by observation few as the days of the years of my pilgrimage have been that the emptiness and unsatisfying nature of this worlds enjoyments are enough to prevent my having any fondness to stay in this region of darkness and sorrow i shall never leap over the bars of life let what will happen but the sooner i have leave to depart i shall think it the better for me  the old gentlemans reply to the story    the old gentleman seemed surprised at my story and after some moments silence when i had done he said your measure sir is hard and as it was in part for declaring against a false religion at your years you please me so much that if you will give me leave i will be your friend and as a subaltern providence recompense your loss as to fortune in this world in what manner you shall know tomorrow when we breakfast at eight it is now time to finish our bottle that we may according to our custom betimes retire  the history of chapter henley esquire and his beautiful daughter statia at the time appointed i met the old gentleman in the parlour and just as we had done saluting each other statia entered bright and charming as aurora she was in a rich dress and her bright victorious eyes flashed a celestial fire she made our tea and gave me some of her coffee she asked me a few civil questions and said two or three good things on the beauties of the morning and the charms of the country she left us the moment we had done breakfast and then the old gentleman addressed himself to me in the following words  i do not forget the promise i made you but must first relate the history of my family i do it with the more pleasure as i find you are of our religion and i cannot help having a regard for you on your daring to throw up a fortune for truth for bravely daring to renounce those systems which have an outward orthodox roundness given to them by their eloquent defenders and within are mere corruption and apostasy  the skeleton you saw in the library was once my son charles henley a most extraordinary man he had great abilities and understood every thing a mortal is capable of knowing of things human and divine  when he was in his nineteenth year i took him to france and other countries to see the world and on our return to england married him into a noble family to a very valuable young woman of a large fortune and by her he had the young lady you saw sitting on the chair near the table by me this son i lost three years after his marriage and with him all relish for the world and being naturally inclined to retirement and a speculative life never stirred since from this country house here my son devoted himself entirely to study and amused himself with instructing his beloved statia the young lady you have seen at his death he consigned her to my care and as her understanding is very great and her disposition sweet and charming i have not only taken great pains in educating her but have been delighted with my employment young as she is aug         but in the second month of her one and twentieth year she not only knows more than women of distinction generally do but would be the admiration of learned men if her knowledge in languages mathematics and philosophy were known to them and as her father taught her music and painting perhaps there is not a young woman of finer accomplishments in the kingdom  her father died toward the end of the year      in the   th year of his age when she was not quite sixteen and by his will left her ten thousand pounds and basilhouse and estate but she is not to inherit it or marry till she is two and twenty this was her fathers will as to the skeleton in the library it was my sons express order it should be so and that the figure should not be removed from the place it stands in while the library remained in that room but continue a solemn memorial in his family to perpetuate his memory and be a memento mori to the living  old mr henley offers me his granddaughter in marriage   0 this is the history of basil groves and the late owner of this seat and his daughter statia we live a happy religious life here and enjoy every blessing that can be desired in this lower hemisphere but as i am not very far from a hundred years having passed that ninetytwo which sir william temple says he never knew any one he was acquainted with arrive at i must be on the brink of the grave and expect every day to drop into it what may become of statia then gives me some trouble to think as all her relations except myself are in the other world to spend her life here in this solitude as seems to be her inclination is not proper and to go into the world by herself when i am dead without knowing any mortal in it may involve her in troubles and distresses hear then my son what i propose to you you are a young man but serious you have got some wisdom in the school of affliction and you have no aversion to matrimony as you have just buried you say a glorious woman your wife if you will stay with us here till statia is two and twenty and in that time render yourself agreeable to her i promise you she shall be yours the day she enters the three and twentieth year of her age and you shall have with her fortune all that i am owner of which is no small sum what do you say to this proposal  my reply     sir i replied you do me vast honor much more i am sure than my merits can pretend to i am infinitely obliged to you and must be blind and insensible if i refused such a woman as miss henley were she far from being the fortune she is but i have not vanity enough to imagine i can gain her affections especially in my circumstances and to get her by your authority or power of disposing of her is what i cannot think of i will stay however a few months here since you so generously invite me and let miss henley know i will be her humble servant if she will allow me the honor of bearing that title this made the old gentleman laugh and he took me by the hand saying this is right come let us go and take a walk before dinner  my residence at basil groves for seven months and manner of living     there i passed the winter and part of the spring and lived in a delightful manner the mornings i generally spent in the library reading or writing extracts from some curious mss or scarce books and in the afternoons miss henley and i walked in the lawns and woods or sat down to cards she was a fine creature indeed in body and soul had a beautiful understanding and charmed me to a high degree her conversation was rational and easy without the least affectation from the books she had read and she would enliven it sometimes by singing in which kind of music she was as great a mistress as i have heard as to her heart i found it was to be gained but an accident happened that put a stop to the amor  the death of old mr henley and statias behavior thereupon     in the beginning of march the old gentleman the excellent mr henley statias grandfather and guardian and my great friend died and by his death a great alteration ensued in my affair i thought to have had miss henley immediately as there was no one to plead her fathers will against the marriage and intended to send o finn for friar fleming but when statia saw herself her own mistress without any superior or control and in possession of large fortunes money and an estate that she might do as she pleased this had an effect on her mind and made a change she told me when i addressed myself to her after her grandfather was interred that what she intended to do in obedience to him had he lived she thought required very serious consideration now she was left to herself that exclusive of this her inclination really was for a single life and had it been otherwise yet it was not proper since her guardian was dead that i should live with her till the time limited by her fathers will for her to marry was come but that as she had too good an opinion of me to imagine her fortune was what chiefly urged my application and must own she had a regard for me she would be glad to hear from me sometimes if i could think her worth remembering after i had left the groves of basil this she said with great seriousness and seemed by her manner to forbid my urging the thing any further  my reply to miss henley being an apology for matrimony as it is by the gospel made a memorial of the covenant of grace     i assured her however that time only could wear out her charming image from my mind and that i had reason to fear she would long remain the torment of my heart she had a right to be sure to dismiss me from her service but in respect of her inclination to live a single life i begged leave to observe that it was certainly quite wrong and what she could not answer to the wise and bountiful father of the universe as she was a christian and by being so must believe that baptism was a memorial of the covenant of grace  the catholics and the visionmongers of the protestant side the rev mr wm law and others of his row may magnify the excellence of celibacy as high as they please and work it into christian perfection by sounding words and eloquent pens but most surely revelation was directly against them and required the faithful to produce in a regular way  consider illustrious statia that when the most high gave the abrahamic covenant in these words i will be a god unto thee and to thy seed after thee and in thy seed shall all the families or nations of the earth be blessed which includes an interest in god as a god father and friend for ever and a share in all the blessings wherewith the messiah in the gospel has enriched the world these inestimable blessings and promises of life and favor were designed by the divine munificence for rising generations of mankind and it was most certainly intended not only that they should be received with the highest gratitude and duty but that they should be strongly inculcated upon the thoughts of succeeding generations by an instituted sign or memorial to the end of the world  circumcision was the first appointed token or memorial and at the same time an instruction in that moral rectitude to which the grace of god obliges and when the new testament succeeded the law then was the covenant interest of infants or their right to the covenant of grace to be confirmed by the token or sign called baptism that action being appointed to give the expected rising generation an interest in the love of god the grace of christ and the fellowship of the holy spirit that is in all covenant blessings but what becomes of this great charter of heaven if christian women out of an idle notion of perfection will resolve to lead single lives and thereby hinder rising generations from sharing in the honors and privileges of the church of jesus christ millions of the faithful must thereby be deprived of the token instituted by god to convey to them those covenant blessings which his love and goodness designed for the rising generations of his people have a care then what you do illustrious statia in this particular it must be a great crime to hinder the regular propagation of a species which god has declared to be under his particular inspection and blessing and by circumcision and baptism has made the special object of divine attention and care away then with all thoughts of a virgin life whatever becomes of me as god has appointed matrimony and baptism let it be your pious endeavor to bare sons and daughters that may be related to god their father to jesus their redeemer and first born in the family and to all the excellent who are to enjoy through him the blessings of the glorious world above marry then illustrious statia marry and let the blessing of abraham come upon us gentiles oppose not the gospel covenant that covenant which was made with that patriarch but mind the comfortable promises i will circumcise thy heart and the heart of thy seed i will pour out my spirit upon thy seed and my blessing upon thine offspring the seed of the righteous is blessed they are the seed of the blessed of the lord and their offspring with them such is the magna charta of our existence and future happiness and as infants descending from abraham in the line of election to the end of the world have as good a right and claim as we to the blessings of this covenant and immense promise i will be a god unto thee and to thy seed after thee in their generations it must be a great crime to deprive children of this intailed heavenly inheritance by our resolving to live in a state of virginity in my opinion it is a sin greater than murder what is murder but forcing one from his post against the will of providence and if the virgin hinders a being or beings from coming on the post against the will of providence must she not be culpable and must she not be doubly criminal if the being or beings she hinders from coming on the stage or into this first state were to be a part of the perpetual generations who have a right to the inheritance the blessing and were to be heirs according to the promise made to abraham ponder illustrious statia on the important point consider what it is to die a maid when you may in a regular way pruduce heirs to that inestimable blessing of life and favor which the munificence of the most high was pleased freely to bestow and which the great christian mediator agent and negociator republished confirmed and sealed with his blood marry then in regard to the gospel and let it be the fine employment of your life to open gradually the treasures of revelation to the understandings of the little christians you produce  this i am sure your holy religion requires from you and if from the sacred oracles we turn to the book of nature is it not in this volume written that there must be a malignity in the hearts of those mortals who can remain unconcerned at the destruction and extirpation of the rest of mankind and who want even so much good will as is requisite to propagate a creature in a regular and hallowed way though they received their own being from the mere benevolence of their divine master what do you say illustrious statia shall it be a succession as you are an upright christian and may i hope to have the high honor of sharing in the mutual satisfaction that must attend the discharge of so momentous a duty of celibacy and marriage if succession be the main thing and to prevent the extirpation of the rest of mankind by junction why may it not be carried on as well without marriage as in that confined way i answer that as the author and founder of marriage was the ancient of days god himself and at the creation he appointed the institution as christ who was vested with authority to abrogate any laws or supersede any custom in which were found any flaw or obliquity or had not an intrinsic goodness and rectitude in them confirmed the ordinance by reforming the abuses that had crept into it and restoring it to its original boundary as he gave a sanction to this amicable covenant and statuted that men should maintain the dignity of the conjugal state and by virtue of this primordial and most intimate bond of society convey down the race of mankind and maintain its succession to the final dissolution it is not therefore to be neglected or disregarded we must not dare to follow our fancies and in unhallowed mixtures or an illegal method have any posterity as the great god appointed and blessed this institution only for the continuance of mankind the race is not to be preserved in another way we must marry in the lord to promote his glory as the apostle says   cor vii    the earth is not to be replenished by licentious junction or the promiscuous use of women dreadful hereafter must be the case of all who slight an institution of god  i am sensible the libertine who depreciates and vilifies the dignity of the married state will laugh at this assertion the fop and debauchee will hiss it and still do their best to render wedlock the subject of contempt and ridicule the roman clergy will likewise decry it and injuriously treat it as an impediment to devotion a cramp upon the spiritual serving of god and call it an instrument of pollution and defilement in respect of their heavenly celibacy  but as god thought marriage was suitable to a paradisaical state and the scriptures declare it honorable in all as this is the way appointed by heaven to people the earth and the inslitution is necessary in the reason and nature of things considering the circumstances in which mankind is placed to prevent confusion and promote the general happiness as the bond of society and the foundation of all human government sure i am the rake and the masspriest must be in a dreadful situation at the sessions of righteousness when the one is charged with libertinism and gallantries with madness and folly and with all the evils and mischief they have done by illicit gratification contrary to reason and in direct opposition to the institutes of god  and when the other the miserable masspriests are called to an account for vilifying the honor and dignity of the married state and for striving to seduce mankind into the solitary retirements of celibacy in violation of the laws of god and more especially of the primary law or ordinance of heaven wretched priests your institutions are breaches in revealed religion trespasses upon the common rights of nature and such oppressive yokes as it is not able to bear your celibacy has not a grain of piety in it it is policy and impiety  hear me then ye libertines and masspriests i call upon you of the first row ye rakes of genius to consider what you are doing and in time turn from your iniquities be no longer profligate and licentious blind to your true interest and happiness but become virtuous and honorable lovers and in regard to the advantages of this solemn institution called wedlock as well to the general state of the world as to individuals marry in the lord so will you avoid that dreadful sentence fornicators and adulterers god will judge that is punish and in this life you may make things very agreeable if you please though it is in the heavenly world alone where there shall be all joy and no sorrow let there be true beauty and gracefulness in the mind and manners and these with discretion and other things in your power will furnish a fund of happiness commensurate with your lives it is possible i am sure to make marriage productive of as much happiness as falls to our share in this lower hemisphere as the nature of man can reach to in his present condition for as to joy flowing in with a full constant and equal tide without interruption and without allay there is no such thing human nature does not admit of this the sum of the matter is this to the public the advantages of marriage are certain whether the parties will or no but to the parties engaging not so to them it is a fountain that sends forth both sweet and bitter waters to those who mind their duty and obligations sweet ones to those who neglect them bitter ones  in the next place ye monks i would persuade you if i could to labor no longer in striving to cancel the obligations to marriage by the pretense of religion the voice of heaven and the whispers of sound and uncorrupted reason are against it it is will worship in opposition to revelation it is such a presumption for a creature against the author of our nature as must draw down uncommon wrath upon the head of every masspriest who does not repent their preaching such wicked doctrine indeed i do not know any part of popery that can be called christianity but this in particular is so horrible and diabolical that i can consider the preachers for celibacy in no other light than as so many devils may you ponder in time on this horrible affair     miss henleys answer     all the smiles sat on the face of statia while i was haranguing in this devout manner and her countenance became a constellation of wonders when i had done this beauty said i thank you sir for the information you have given me i am a christian there is no malignity in my heart you have altered my way of thinking and i now declare for a succession  let father flemming be sent for and without waiting for my being two and twenty or minding my fathers will as there is no one to oblige me to it i will give you my hand charming news i dispatched my lad for the friar the priest arrived the next day and at night we were married three days after we set out for orton lodge at my wifes request as she longed to see the place for two years more i resided there it being more agreeable to statia than the improved groves of basil we lived there in as much happiness as it is possible to have in this lower hemisphere and much in the same manner as i did with charlotte my first wife statia had all the good qualities and perfections which rendered charlotte so dear and valuable to me like her she studied to increase the delights of every day and by art good humor and love rendered the married state such a system of joys as might incline one to wish it could last a thousand years but it was too sublime and desirable to have a long existence here statia was taken ill of the smallpox the morning we intended to return to basilgroves she died the  th day and i laid her by charlottes side thus did i become again a mourner i sat with my eyes shut for three days but at last called for my horse to try what air exercise and a variety of objects could do  section iii twas when the faithful herald of the day the villagecock crows loud with trumpet shrill the warbling lark soars high and morning gray lifts her glad forehead over the cloudwrapt hill natures wild music fills the vocal vale the bleating flocks that bite the dewy ground the lowing herds that graze the woodland dale and cavernd echo swell the cheerful sound  april        we leave orton lodge again and set out for harrigate spaw a description of the country we rid over aetat       very early as soon as i could see day the first of april      i left ortonlodge and went to basilgroves to order matters there from thence i set out for harrigate to amuse myself in that agreeable place but i did not go the way i came to mr henleys house to avoid the dangerous morass i had passed at the hazard of my life we went over a wilder and more romantic country than i had before seen we had higher mountains to ascend than i had ever passed before and some valleys so very deep to ride through that they seemed as it were descents to hell the patriarch bermudez in journeying over abyssinia never traveled in more frightful glins relation de lambassade dedica a don sebastien roy de portugal and yet we often came to plains and vales which had all the charms a paradise could have such is the nature of this country  through these scenes an amazing mixture of the terrible and the beautiful we proceeded from five in the morning till one in the afternoon when we arrived at a vast waterfall which descended from a precipice near two hundred yards high into a deep lake that emptied itself into a swallow fifty yards from the catadure or fall and went i suppose to the abyss the land from this headlong river for half a mile in length and breadth till it ended at vast mountains again was a fine piece of ground beautifully flowered with various perennials the acanthus the aconus the adonis or pheasants eye the purple bistorta the blue borago the yellow bupthalmum the white cacalia the blue campanula and the sweet smelling cassia the pretty double daisy the crimson dianthus the white dictamnus the red fruximella and many other wild flowers they make the green valley look charming and as here and there stood two or three evergreen trees the cypress the larix the balm of gilead and the swedish juniper the whole spot has a fine and delightful effect on my arrival here i was at a loss which way to turn  the inhabitants of this fine valley a society of married friars    i could not however be long in suspense how to proceed as i saw near the waterfall a pretty thatched mansion and  inhabitants in it i found they were a religious society of married people ten friars and their ten wives who had agreed to retire to this still retreat and form a holy house on the plan of the famous ivon the disciple of labadie so celebrated on account of his connection with mrs schurman and his many fanatical writings see my  st volume p     where you will find a particular account of labadie and ivon a book called the marriage chretien written by this ivon was their directory and from it they formed a protestant la trappe with this difference from the catholic religious men that the friars of the reformed monastery were to have wives in their convent the better to enable them to obtain christian perfection in the religious life these regulars men and women were a most industrious people never idle but between their hours of prayer always at work the men were employed in a garden of ten acres to provide vegetables and fruit on which they chiefly lived or in cutting down old trees and fitting them for their fire and the women were knitting spinning or twisting what they had spun into thread which they sold for three shillings a pound they were all together in a large handsome room they sat quite silent kept their eyes on their work and seemed more attentive to some inward meditations than to any thing that appeared or passed by them they looked as if they were contented and happy they were all extremely handsome and quite clean their linen fine and white their gowns a black stuff the women dined at one table the men at another but all sat in the same room the whole house was in bed by ten and up by four in the morning winter and summer what they said at their table i could not hear as they spoke low and little and were at a distance from me in a large apartment but the conversation of the men at table was very agreeable rational and improving i observed they had a great many children and kept four womenservants to attend them and do the work of the house the whole pleased me very greatly i thought it a happy institution  some thoughts on the institution of married regulars    as to the marriage of the friars in this cloystral house their founder ivon in my opinion was quite right in this notion chaste junction cannot have the least imperfection in it as it is the appointment of god and the inclination to a coit is so strongly impressed on the machine by the author of it and since it is quite pure and perfect since it was wisely intended as the only best expedient to keep man for ever innocent it must certainly be much better for a regular or retreating priest to have a lawful female companion with him and so the woman who chooses a convent and dislikes the fashions of the world to have her good and lawful monk every night in her arms to love and procreate legally when they have performed all the holy offices of the day and then from love and holy generation return again to prayer and all the heavenly duties of the cloystered life than to live against the institution of nature and providence a burning tortured nun and a burning tortured friar locked up in walls they can never pass and under the government of some old cross impotent superior there is some sense in such a marriage chretien in a convent ivons convent is well enough a cloister may do upon his plan with the dear creature by ones side after the daily labors of the monk are over it had been better if that infallible man the pope had come into this scheme how comfortable has ivon made it to the human race who renounce the dress and pageantry and all the vanities of time their days are spent in piety and usefulness and at night after the completorium they lie down together in the most heavenly charity and according to the first great hail endeavor to increase and multiply this is a divine life i am for a cloister on these terms it pleased me so much to see these monks march off with their smiling partners after the last psalm that i could not help wishing for a charmer there that i might commence the married regular and add to the stock of children in this holy house it is really a fine thing to monk it on this plan it is a divine institution gentle and generous useful and pious  on the contrary how cruel is the roman church to make perfection consist in celibacy and cause so many millions of men and women to live at an eternal distance from each other without the least regard to the given points of contact how unfriendly to society this is abusing christianity and perverting it to the most pernicious purposes under a pretense of raising piety by giving more time and leisure for devotion for it never can be pious either in design or practice to cancel any moral obligation or to make void any command of god and as to prayer it may go along with every other duty and be performed in every state all states have their intermissions and if it should be otherwise sometimes i can then while discharging any duty or performing any office pray as well in my heart o god be merciful to me a sinner and bless me with the blessing of thy grace and providence as if i was prostrate before an altar what martha was reproved for was on account of her being too yolicitous about the things of this life where this is not the case business and the world are far from being a hindrance to piety god is as really glorified in the discharge of relative duties as in the discharge of those which more immediately relate to himself he is in truth more actively glorified by our discharging well the relative duties and we thereby may become more extensively useful in the church and in the world may be more public blessings than it is possible to be in a single pious state in short this one thing celibacy were there nothing else the making the unmarried state a more holy state than marriage shows the prodigious nonsense and impiety of the church of rome and is reason enough to flee that communion if we had no other reasons for protesting against it the tenet is so superstitious and dangerous that it may well be esteemed a doctrine of those devils who are the seducers and destroyers of mankind but it is says wallace dissertation on the numbers of mankind  suitable to the views and designs of a church which has discovered such an enormous ambition and made such havoc of the human race in order to raise establish and preserve an usurped and tyrannical power  a further account of the married regulars i met with among the fells of westmoreland    but as to the married regulars i have mentioned they were very glad to see me and entertained me with great civility and goodness i lived a week with them and was not only well fed with vegetables and puddings on their lean days wednesdays and fridays and with plain meat and good malt drink on the other days but was greatly delighted with their manner and piety their sense and knowledge i will give my pious readers a sample of their prayers as i imagine it may be to edification these friars officiate in their turns changing every day and the morning and evening prayers of one of them were in the words following i took them off in my shorthand  a prayer for morning almighty and everlasting god the creator and preserver of all things our lawgiver savior and judge we adore thee the author of our beings and the father of our spirits we present ourselves our acknowledgments and our homage at the foot of thy throne and yield thee the thanks of the most grateful hearts for all the instances of thy favor which we have experienced we thank thee for ever o lord god almighty for all thy mercies and blessings vouchsafed us for defending us the past night from evil and for that kind provision which thou have made for our comfortable subsistence in this world  but above all most glorious eternal adored be thy goodness for repeating and reinforcing the laws and the religion of thy creation by supernatural revelation and for giving us that reason of mind which unites us to thee and makes us implore thy communications of righteousness to create us again unto good works in christ jesus  we confess o lord that we have done violence to our principles and alienated ourselves from the natural use we were fitted for we have revolted from thee into a state of sin and by the operation of sense and passion have been moved to such practices as are exorbitant and irregular but we are heartily sorry for all our misdoings to thee in christ we now make our address and beseech thee to inform our understandings and refine our spirits that we may reform our lives by repentance redeem our time by righteousness and live as the glorious gospel of thy son requires let the divine spirit assist and enable us to overruled conduct and employ the subordinate and inferior powers in the exercise of virtue and the service of our creator and as far as the imperfections of our present state will admit help us so to live by the measures and laws of heaven that we may have the humility and meekness the mortification and selfdenial of the holy jesus his love of thee his desire of doing thy will and seeking only thy honor let us not come covered before thee under a form of godliness a cloak of creeds observances and institutions of religion but with that inward salvation and vital sanctity which renounces the spirit wisdom and honors of this world dethrones selflove and pride subdues sensuality and covetousness and opens a kingdom of heaven within by the spirit of god o let thy christ be our savior in this world and before we die make us fit to live for ever with thee in the regions of purity and perfection  since it is the peculiar privilege of our nature through thy mercy and goodness that we are made for an eternal entertainment in those glorious mansions where the blessed society of saints and angels shall keep an everlasting sabbath and adore and glorify thee for ever let thy inspiring spirit raise our apprehensions and desires above all things that are here below and alienate our minds from the customs and principles of this mad degenerate and apostate world mind us of the shortness and uncertainty of time of the boundless duration and the vast importance of eternity and so enable us to imitate the example of the holy jesus in this world that we may hereafter ascend with the greatest ardor of divine love to those realms of holiness where our hearts will be filled with raptures of gladness and joy and we shall remain in the highest glory for ever and ever  we live o lord in reconciliation and friendship in love and good will with thy whole creation with every thing that derives from thee holds of thee is owned by thee and under the power of this affection we pray for all mankind that they may be partakers of all the blessings which we enjoy or want and that we may all be happy in the world to come and glorify thee together in eternity to this end bring all the human race to the knowledge of thy glorious gospel and let its influence transform them into the likeness of christ  but especially we pray for all who suffer for truth and righteousness sake and beseech thee to prosper those that love thee defend o lord the just rights and liberties of mankind and rescue thy religion from the corruptions which have been introduced upon it by length of time and by decay of piety infatuate the counsels and frustrate the endeavors of the priests of rome and against all the designs of those who are enemies to the purity of the gospel and substitute human inventions in the place of revealed religion prosper the pious labors of those who teach mankind to worship one eternal and omnipresent being in whose understanding there is the perfection of wisdom in whose will there is the perfection of goodness in whose actions there is the perfection of power a god without cause the great creator benefactor and savior of men  and that the duty of man is to obey in thought word and deed the precepts of godliness and righteousness without regard to pleasure gain or honor to pain loss or disgrace diligently imitating the life of the holy jesus and steadfastly confiding in his mediation  in the last place o lord god almighty we beseech thee to continue us under thy protection guidance and blessing this day as the followers and disciples of thy christ through whom we recommend our souls and our bodies into thy hands and according to the doctrine of his religion say our father etc  in this manner did these pious ivonites begin their every day and when the sun was set and they had finished their supper they worshipped god again in these words  a prayer for night most blessed glorious and holy lord god almighty who art from everlasting to everlasting god over all magnified and adored for ever we thy unworthy creatures humble our souls in thy presence and confess ourselves miserable sinners we acknowledge our miscarriages and faults and condemn ourselves for having done amiss we deprecate thy just offense and displeasure we cry thee mercy we ask thee pardon and as we are quite sensible of our weakness and inability and know thou love the souls of men when they turn and repent we beseech thee to give us true repentance and endue us with the grace of thy sanctifying spirit that we may be delivered from the bondage and slavery of iniquity and have the law of the spirit of life which is in christ jesus upon thee our god we call for that help which is never wanting and beseech thee to give us thy heavenly assistance that we may recover our reasonable nature refine our spirits by goodness and purify ourselves even as the lord jesus is pure o thou father of lights and the god of all comforts inform our understandings with truth and give us one ray of that divine wisdom which sits on the right hand of thy throne o let us be always under thy communication and influence and enable us through the recommendation of thy son our mediator and redeemer to lay aside all passion prejudice and vice to receive thy truth in the love of it and to serve thee with ingenuity of mind and freedom of spirit that we may pass through a religious life to a blessed immortality and come to that eternal rest where we shall behold thy face in righteousness and adore and bless thee to eternity for our salvation through him who has redeemed us by his blood  we praise and magnify thy goodness o lord god almighty for our maintenance and preservation by thy constant providence over us and we beseech thee to take us into thy special care and protection this night defend us from all the powers of darkness and from evil men and evil things and raise us in health and safety do thou most great and good god protect us and bless us this night and when we awake in the morning let our hearts be with thee and thy hand with us and the same mercies we beg for all mankind that thy goodness and power may preserve them and thy direction and influence secure their eternal salvation through jesus christ our lord by whom thou have taught us to call upon thee as our father etc  an observation on the prayers of the ivon recluses    by the way i cannot help observing that these disciples of ivon are much reformed in respect of what his cloystered followers were in his time it appears from ivons books that he was as great a visionary and tritheist as his master labadie or any of our modern mystics now are but these regulars i found among the fells though on ivons plan are as rational christians as ever adorned the religion of our master by a purity of faith you see by their prayers that their devotions are quite reasonable and calm there is no rant nor words without meaning no feeling instead of seeing the truth nor expectation of covenant mercy on the belief of a point repugnant not only to the reason and nature of things but to the plain repeated declarations of god in the christian religion their prayer is a calm address to the great maker governor and benefactor of the universe and honor and obedience to christ as mediator according to the will and appointment of god the father  an answer to a question i asked one of these ivonites    upon my asking one of these gentlemen how they came to differ so much from ivon their founder and cease to be the patrons of vision and an implicit incomprehensible faith he told me they had read all the books on both sides of the question that had been written of late years and could not resist the force of the evidence in favor of reason and the divine unity they saw it go against mechanical impulse and strong persuasion without grounds and therefore they dismissed ivons notions of believing without ideas as they became sensible it was the same thing as seeing without light or objects without dealing any longer in a mist of words or showing themselves orthodox by empty insignificant sounds they resolved that the object of their worship for the time to come should be that one supreme selfexistent being of absolute infinite perfection who is the first cause of all things and whose numerical identity and infinite perfections are demonstrable from certain principles of reason antecedent to any peculiar revelation  and confessed that the blessing with which jesus christ was sent by god to bless the world consists in turning men from their iniquities they now perceived what the creedmakers and ivon their founder could not see to wit that it is against the sacred texts to ascribe to each person of three the nature and all essential attributes and properties of the one only true god and yet make the three the one true god only when considered conjunctly for if each has all possible perfections and attributes then each must be the same true god as if and when conjoined and of consequence there must then be three one true gods or one three true gods three one supreme beings or one three supreme beings since to each of the three must be ascribed as the orthodox say any thing and every thing that is most peculiar and appropriated to the divine nature without any difference in short by conjobbling matters of faith in this manner they saw we had three distinct selfs or intelligent agents equal in power and all possible perfections agreeing in one common essence one sort of species like a supreme magistracy of distinct persons acting by a joint exercise of the same power and so the three are one not by a numerical but specific identity three omnipotents and one almighty in a collective sense this continued this gentleman on searching the scriptures we found was far from being the truth of the case we discovered upon a fair examination and laying aside our old prejudices that there was nothing like this in the new testament it appeared to us to be the confused talk of weak heads in the bible we got a just idea of one eternal cause god the father almighty allwise unchangeable infinite and are there taught how to worship and serve him the greatest care is there taken to guard against the ill effects of imagination and superstition and in the plainest language we are ordered to pray to this blessed and only potentate the king of kings and lord of lords who only or alone has immortality and this in imitation of jesus who in the morning very early went out into a solitary place and there prayed mark i     who dismissing his disciples departed into a mountain to pray mark vi     and he continued all night in prayer to god luke vi     we are ordered to glorify and bless this only wise god for ever romans xvi     blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ   cor i    to god and our father be glory for ever phil iv  0   and to love him truly by keeping the commandments cui jesus sic respondit primum omnium praeceptorum est mark xii     0    audi israelita dominus deus vester dominus unus est itaque dominum deum tuum toto cord toto animo tota mente totisque viribus amato hoc primum est praeceptum hear o israel the lord our god is one lord and thou shall love the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy strength this is the first commandment  et voicy le second vous aimerez vostre prochain comme vous meme and the second is like the first hunc simile est alterum alterum ut teipsum amato his majus aliud praeceptum nullum est thou shall love thy neighbor as thyself there is none other commandment greater than these  to say it  we became fully satisfied that the supreme god and governor of the world who exists by a prior necessity and therefore must be one a perfect moral agent and possessed of all moral perfections is the sole object of religious worship that jesus christ was a temporary minister with a legatarian power to publish and declare the spiritual laws of this great god and that it is incumbent on mankind to yield a perfect obedience to these spiritual laws of this supreme being that is the duty of all to make the object proposed by christ his god and our god his father and our father the sole object of faith and to expect happiness or salvation on the term of being turned from all our inquities this seemed a matter worthy of the son of gods appearing in the world every thing else must be enthusiasm and usurpation  a reflection on true and false religion    here the ivonist had done and i was greatly pleased with his sense and piety what a heavenly christianity should we profess i said if the notions of our modern enthusiasts were as consistent with christs great design and profession we should then set up the kingdom of god among men and be diligent and active in promoting the laws of that kingdom we should then believe like jesus christ and his apostles that there is but one god the father almighty there is no one good so commonly called but one that is god or only the one god mark x     nullus est bonus nisi unus deus castalio and cant ms clem alex adds  my father who is in heaven this is life eternal to acknowledge thee o father to be the only true god john xvii throughout  it is one god who will justify romans iii  0  we know that there is none other gods but one for to us there is one god the father   cor viii     there is one god and father of all who is over all and through all and in you all ephesians iv    and we should confess one mediator  the man christ jesus   timothy ii   we should be consistent and not throw off those principles upon which christianity was founded and alone could be first built we should invite men into our religion by representing to them the perfection of that primary law of god reason or natural religion by declaring the plainness and clearness of it to all attentive and welldisposed minds and then show them how worthy it was of the supreme governor to give such creatures as he has made us the gospel that by the religion of favor he has with glory to himself displayed his paternal regard for us by doing much more than what is strictly necessary for our eternal good god on a principle of love sends his christ to advise us and awaken us to a sense of our danger in passing through this world in case which he saw would be the thing we should not constantly attend to the light we might strike out ourselves with some trouble he calls us in an extraordinary manner to forsake vice and idolatry and practice the whole system of morality we might expect that a good god would once at least interpose by such an extraordinary method as revelation to turn and incline his reasonable creatures to the study and practice of the religion of nature this was acting like the father of the universe considering the negligence and corruption of the bulk of mankind the reason he gave us the law of nature was giving us all that was absolutely necessary the gospel was an addition of what is excellently useful what my beloved might a rational divine say can be more paternal and worthy of the almighty creator than to reveal plainly the motive of a judgment to come in order to secure all obedience to the religion of nature reason may to be sure be sufficient to show men their duty and to encourage their performance of it with the assurance of obtaining a reward if they would duly attend to its dictates and suffer them to have their due effect upon them it may guide mankind to virtue and happiness consequent to it as god must be a rewarder of all those who diligently seek him and was enough to bring them to the knowledge and engage them in the practice of true religion and righteousness if they had not shut their eyes to its light and wilfully rejected the rule written in their hearts but as this was what mankind really did and now do as errors and impieties owing to an undue use or neglect of reason became universal just as the case of christians is by disregarding the new testament and reason through mens faults was rendered ineffectual though still sufficient which justifies both the wisdom and goodness of god in leaving man for so many ages to his natural will and so great a part of the globe to this day with no other light than the law of nature and reason i say was rendered ineffectual though still sufficient to teach men to worship god with pious hearts and sincere affections and to do his will by the practice of moral duties to expect his favor for their good deeds and his condemnation of their evil works then was revelation a more powerful means of promoting true religion and godliness the gospel is a more effectual light it is a clearer and more powerful guide a brighter motive and stronger obligation to universal obedience than reason can with certainty propose and therefore though there was not a necessity for god to give a new rule in vindication of his providence and in order to render men accountable to him for their actions yet the divine goodness was pleased to enforce the principles of reason and morality more powerfully by an express sanction of future rewards and punishments and by the gospel restore religious worship to the original uncorrupted rational service of the deity this displays his paternal regard to his children with glory to himself love was the moving principle of his sending christ into the world to reform the corruptions of reason to restore it to its purity and most effectually to promote the practice of the rules of it the gospelrevelation considered in this manner appears to be the pure effect of the divine goodness it is a conduct accompanied with the greatest propriety and glory  if this representation of christianity was as much the doctrine of the church as it is of the ivonites i have mentioned we might then with hopes of success call upon the rational infidels to come in they could hardly refuse the invitation when we told them our religion was the eternal law of reason and of god restored with a few excellently useful additions that the gospel makes the very religion of nature a main part of what it requires and submits all that it reveals to the test of the law of reason that the splendour of gods original light the light of nature and the revelation of jesus are the same both made to deliver mankind from evils and madness of superstition and make their religion worthy of god and worthy of men to enable them by the voice of reason in conjunction with the words of the gospel to know and worship one god the maker the governor the judge of the world and to practice all that is good and praiseworthy that we may be blessed as we turn from iniquity to virtue and by entering cordially into the spirit of the meritorious example or exemplary merits of christ be determined dead to sin and alive to righteousness in short my brethren in the suffering and death of jesus his patient pious and meek his benevolent and compassionate behavior under the most shocking insult indignity and torture we have what we could not learn from the religion of nature a deportment that well deserves both our admiration and imitation we learn from the perfect example of jesus recommended in his gospel to bear patiently illusage and to desire the welfare of our most unreasonable and malicious enemies this is improving by religion to the best purpose and as we resemble the son of god the man christ jesus in patience piety and benevolence we become the approved children of the most high who is kind and good to the unthankful and to the evil in this view of the gospel all is fine reasonable and heavenly the gentile can have nothing to object we have the religion of nature in its original perfection in the doctrine of the new testament enforced by pains and pleasures everlasting and we learn from the death of the mediator not only an unprecedented patience in bearing our sins in his own body on the tree but the divine compassion and piety with which he bore them we have in this the noblest example to follow whenever called to suffer for welldoing or for righteousnesssake and by the imitation we manifest such a command of temper and spirit as can only be the result of the greatest piety and virtue this added to keeping the commandments must render men the blessed of the father and entitle them to the kingdom prepared for the wife the honest and the excellent  but alas instead of giving such an account of christianity the cry of the doctors is for the most part discard reason and prostrate your understanding before the adorable mysteries instead of a supreme independent first cause of all things to believe in and worship they give three true gods in number three infinite independent beings to be called one as agreeing in one common abstract essence or species as all mankind are one in one common rational nature or abstract idea of humanity amazing account a triune no infidel or gentile of sense will ever worship  instead of fixing salvation or moral rectitude and our preferring the will of god as delineated in the words of the gospel before all other considerations we are told of an innocent meritorious propitiating blood spilt by wicked hands and so made an acceptable sacrifice to a being who is of purer eyes than to behold iniquity this we are assured satisfies all the demands of the law here is infinite satisfaction  and most certainly i add a cool indifference as to personal rectitude when such a faith or credulity becomes the principal pillar of trust and dependence then mere reliance on such satisfaction to divine justice may be a stupifying opiate and make many remiss in the labors of a penitential piety and that exact rectitude of mind and life which even reason requires to render us acceptable to the deity many an appetite and passion are indulged under this subterfuge and with little fervency or zeal for good works men expect to partake of the heavenly joys by trusting to the merits of their savior in their last will and testament deplorable case alas how has christianity suffered by its doctors the infidel laughs at it as thus preached it becomes a byword and a hissing to them that pass by  some remarks on a passage in binius and a few thoughts in relation to the invocation of saints    as to the library of my friends the ivonites it was far from being a grand one but i saw many curious books in it which had not come in my way before from them i made several extracts and to gratify my readers curiosity a little i will here favor him with one of them  the first book i chanced to open in this library was the second volume of severin binis edition of the councils severin bini or binius of councils and the editors of them as he is commonly called was a doctor of divinity at cologne in the circle of the lower rhine in germany and canon of that archiepiscopal cathedral he published in that city in the year   0  an elegant edition of all the councils in four very large volumes folio and by this work made the editions or collections of james merlin peter crabb and lawrence surius of no value but the  d edition published by binius in the year      in nine volumes smaller folio is far preferable to the first and the paris edition of binis councils in      in ten large volumes folio is enlarged more correct and of consequence still better than the  d edition of binius this is not however the best edition to buy if you love to read that theological stuff called councils the louvre edition des conciles en      in    volumes in folio is what you should purchase or that of      paris by the jesuits labbe and cossart in    large volumes in folio this last is what i prefer on account of the additions correctness and beauty of the impression pere hardouin did likewise print a later very fine edition of the councils with explications and free remarks an extraordinary and curious work i have been told but i could not even see it in france as the parliament of paris had ordered the work to be secreted on account of the remarks  n b binius whom i have mentioned was born in the year      and died    0 aet     n b james merlin the first editor of the councils was a doctor of divinity and chanoine of notredame de paris besides the councils two large volumes in folio he published the works of richard de st victor paris       the works of peter de blois paris       and the works of durand de st pourcain paris      his own work are a defense of origin in   to a good thing and six homilies on gabriels being sent to the virgin mary in  vo which homilies are not worth half a farthing  merlin was born in the year      and died      aged     n b peter crabb the  d editor of the councils was a franciscan friar he published two volumes in folio of councils at cologne in      and a third volume in    0  was born    0 died      aet     n b lawrence surius the third editor of the councils a monk of the charireux published his edition of them in four large volumes in folio    0 and a few years after printed his lives of the saints in six tomes he writ likewise a short history of his own time and an apology for the massacre of st barthelemi he was the most outrageous abusive bigot that ever writ against the protestants the great men of his own church despised him and cardinal perron in particular calls him beat and lignorant he was born      died      aet     n b philip labbee the jesuit the  th editor of the councils and the next after binius was born in   0  died      aet  0 he lived only to publish    vols of the councils the   th came out the year he died and the other seven were done by cossart labbe was a man of learning and besides his collection of councils writ several other pieces the best of them are bibliotheca bibliothecarum concordia chronologica bellarmini philologica and the life of galen  gabriel cossart the continuator published the other seven volumes in      and died at paris the   th of december      aet     n b   richard de st victor whose works i said were published by merlin at paris      was a scotchman and prior of the abbey of st victor in paris he died the  0th of march      aet     he was the author of three critical and historical dissertations on the tabernacle two on the temple three on the harmony of the chronology of the kings of judea and israel commentaries on the psalms canticles the epistles of st paul and the revelation some treatises in divinity and several disquisitions relating to spiritual life there have been four editions of these pieces and the best of them is that of rouen in    0 in two volumes by father john de toulouse who writ the life of richard and added it to his edition the three other editions are that of paris      of venice      of cologne      richard de victor has been highly commended by several celebrated writers by henri de grand trithem bellarmine and sixte de sienne there are many curious and fine things in his writings it must be allowed but in general he is too subtle too diffuse and too full of digressions his commentaries for the most part are weak i am sure he did not understand st paul but for the   th century he was an extraordinary man  but who was st victor to whom the abbey of chanoines regulieres in paris and the greater abbaye of chanoines in marseilles are dedicated he was a frenchman who fought under the emperors dioclesian and maximian with great applause in the most honorable post but in the year  0  suffered martyrdom for refusing to sacrifice to the idols he was executed on the spot where the abbey of st victor in marseilles now stands and there they have his relics a la reserve du piee that is except his foot which lies in the abbaye de st victor de paris william grimaud abbot of st victor de marseille on his being made pope urban the  th a d      took the foot of st victor from his abbey when he left it and made a present of it to john duke of berry one of the sons of john the first king of france who was taken prisoner by edward the black prince in the battle of poitiers sept         and this duke of berry gave the inestimable foot to the monks of st victor in paris there it remains to this day and though so small a part of the blessed victor sheds immense benefits on the pious catholics who adore it happy catholics    as to peter de blois he was arch deacon of bath in the reign of henry the second and died in london in the year   00 aet    his works are     letters on various subjects  0 sermons and    tracts of several kinds they were first printed at mayence in   00  then by merlin paris      as before mentioned  afterward john busee the jesuit gave an edition of them in   00 which is far preferable to that of merlin but the most valuable edition is that of peter de goussainville in folio paris      to this edition is prefixed the life of peter de blois and very learned remarks on peters writings and the subjects he writ on are added by goussainville de bloiss works contain many excellent things and his life is a curious piece some of his notions relating to the scriptures are very good and he writes well against vice he is a good author for the age he lived in his letters are well worth reading especially such of them as relate to his own time king henry the second ordered him to make a collection of them for his the kings use    durand de st pourcain was bishop of meux in      and died the   th of september      in the   th year of his age his works are liber de origin jurisdictionum a learned piece and commentaries on the four books of sentences the book called the sentences was written by the famous peter lombard bishop of paris who died in the year      aet    in the sentences one of the propositions argued on is this christus secundum quod est homo non est aliquod some call these sentences excellent which is what i cannot think them but in durands commentary on them there are several excellent things  as to the jesuit jean busee who published the  d edition of peter de blois he died at mayence the  0th of may      aged    and was the author of many books not worth mentioning  the learned goussainville who printed the last edition of de blois with notes and the life died in the year      extremely poor and miserable he likewise published the works of st gregory the first pope of that name with many valuable remarks and notes there are four editions of this popes works that of tussiniani bishop of venice by order of pope sixtus the  th the paris edition    0 goussainvilles edition and the late benedictine edition but goussainvilles is in my opinion the most valuable  n b the sermons in the first and second editions of peter de blois works are not his but peter comestors de blois sermons are only to be found in goussainvilles edition of this archdeacons works note peter comestor was a regular canon of st victors in paris and died in the year      aet     besides the sermons published by mistake as the work of de blois he writ a large scholastic history which comprehends the sacred history from genesis to the end of the acts this is reckoned a good thing and has been abridged by one hunter an englishman  of councils but as to councils we have the following account of the eighteen general ones in the vatican library and are told that the several inscriptions affixed to them were made by pope sixtus the  th the famous felix peretti who was born the   th

reestablished in her exact and regular practice these reader are the eighteen famous general councils and if you will turn to the third volume of a work called notes relating to men and things and books you will find my observations on them my remarks on the popes the princes and the fathers assembled their unchristian immoralities and sad acts against the laws of christ in order to establish for ever that very senseless and very wicked religion called popery that is a composition of sin and error so base and abominable that we might expect such a thing from the devil but it is impossible it could come from heavenlyinspired fathers in that book you will find many thoughts on the religion delivered to the world by those councils and by them established though it is in reality a disgrace to christianity a dishonor to the religion of nature and a faction against the common rights of mankind what ought to be the just object of universal contempt and abhorrence whether we consider it as a system of idolatry impiety and cruelty or as a political scheme to destroy the liberties and engross the properties of mankind of these things particularly and largely in the piece referred to  here i have only further to observe that in the large collections of the councils it is not only the eighteen ecumenical the collectors have gathered but so much of all the councils as they could find their acts letters formularies of faith and canons from the first council at jerusalem a d    to the last council in the   th century which was convoked by the archbishop of ambrun against jean de soanem bishop of senez these amount to above   00 councils note reader the condemnation the banishment of old john de soanem in the  0th year of his age the most learned and excellent prelate in france of his time by firebrand tartuff archbishop of ambrun and his council a d      september    was on account of the bishops admirable pastoral instruction against the execrable constitution unigenitus and the antichristian formulary of pope alexander the seventh and because he recommended the reading of pere quesnels very pious and fine reflections morales  this famous jansenist and father of the oratory psaquier quesnel was the author of many books some of them very good and lived to a great age he was born in      and diet at last in prison if i mistake not a sufferer for religion he was severely persecuted for many years   edit paris    0 and over against a very remarkable passage from cyril p     i found several written leaves bound up in the volume and these leaves referred to by an asterisk the passage i call remarkable is part of a homily pronounced by the alexandrian patriarch before the council of ephesus on st johns day in a church dedicated to his names in rehearsing his discourse to the holy fathers the saint cites heb i   and then addresses himself to the apostle    when he brings in the firstbegotten into the world he says let all the angels of god worship him   etc  o blessed john the evangelist explain this mystery who is this firstbegotten  how came he into the world mysterium hoc aperi effare etiam nunc qui voces habes immortales resera nobis puteum vitae da ut nunc quoque de salutis fontibus hauriamus  this passage of cyril i have heard several learned roman catholic gentlemen call a prayer and affirm it was a proof of the fathers invocation of saints in the beginning of the  th century for st cyril succeeded his uncle theophilus in the sea of alexandria october        but to this it may be answered     that binius though a zealous pleader for the catholic cause as the monks of rome miscall it was of another opinion for he takes no notice of this passage in his notes in calce part   council ephesini tom   p     etc and most certainly he would not have failed to urge it if he had considered it as a prayer and believed it did prove the invocation of saints    nor does bellarmine in his treatise de sanctorum beatitudine henricus vicus de sanctorum invocatione gabriel vasquez de adoratione or gregorius de valentia de oratione make use of this passage of cyril though they do ex professo and data diligently quote all the councils and fathers they can to prove invocation of saints    as rhetorical apostrophes or prosopopaeias are usual in all authors sacred or civil this may be one in cyril and it seems very plain from the passage that it was intended for no more it appears to be a rhetorical figure and not a prayer such a figure as the greek fathers were wont very frequently to use in their orations and poems  cyril intending as appears by the sequel to answer his own question with a passage in st johns gospel makes a long rhetorical apostrophe to the apostle as if he were there present then adds annon dicentem audimus  but do we not hear him saying or as binius has the reading  let us hear what st john says audiamus itaque dicentem as if they had heard john giving his answer and then concludes with the first verse of the first chapter of his gospel  etc in the beginning was the word etc  it is therefore very plain that this passage of cyril is only a part of his homily or sermon and that in a rhetorical manner he quotes a text from a gospel written by john about   0 years before in answer to his own question who the word was for cyril to pray to john to tell them what he had told them long before were senseless and ridiculous but to desire the apostle to do it in a rhetorical apostrophe was allowable it amounts to no more than the figurative expression in our liturgy hear what comfortable words our savior says hear what st paul says  but if cyril did in this passage truly pray to st john that could be no argument for popish invocation of saints for if an hundred fathers in the beginning of the fourth century had preached up and practiced invocation of saints yet that could not make it lawful and right since we are taught by the scriptures to direct our prayers neither to saint no angel but to god only and in the name and mediation of jesus christ only we are not only positively ordered by the apostles to make all our addresses and prayers ot god only and by the mediation and intercession of jesus christ but are told that god is omniscient and so able to hear all our prayers  allsufficient and therefore able to supply all our necessities  and that his mercies in jesus christ are infinite this makes our way sure in this particular  on the contrary the papists have no precept to pray to saints nor any promise that they shall be heard nor any practice of the primitive church for  00 years after christ to encourage them and therefore such popish invocation is a novel groundless and impious error  some remarks on the doctrine of invocation of saints we are told by st peter  acts v    that god had exalted the lord jesus christ to be a prince and savior that is an intercessor  by st paul  heb vii    that christ is able to save to the uttermost all that come to god by him seeing he ever lives to make intercession for them chap ix    that he is gone to haven for this very end to appear in the presence of god for us   timothy ii  that there is not other mediator betwixt god and men but the man christ jesus that is whose prerogative it is to intercede for sinners to the divine majesty being an honor and dignity god has exalted him unto after his sufferings and as a reward thereof  thus are we informed by the divine oracles and yet notwithstanding this to make prayers and supplications to the virgin mary and a thousand other saints for aid or help and to have by their merit and intercession the gists and graces they pray for conferred upon them  this is a doctrine of such dangerous consequence as it is a depriving of christ jesus of that grand dignity and prerogative he is now in heaven exalted to as much as in men lies that i should have admired how it ever came to be embraced by such as profess christianity had not the spirit of god foretold   timothy iv   that some should depart from the faith giving heed to seducing spirits that is seducing men and doctrines of devils that is to say doctrines concerning demons or souls of famous men departed this life which the heathens called demons and to whom they gave the worship of prayer or invocation as intercessors or inferior divinities this prophecy hinders my wondering at the thing but then i must call such modern invocation gentilism christianized a deplorable corruption  ponder then ye catholics in time and think not to excuse yourselves by arguing from the command christians have here on earth to require each others prayers to god for them  for we have no command to supplicate any in heaven but only god  matt vi   we have no reasonable assurance that the saints in heaven do hear our prayers and of consequence have not the same reasons to request their prayers to god for us that we have to request the prayers of saints on earth nor is this all our prayers to each other in this life are only christian requests to recommend our conditions to god offices only of kindness no acts of religious worship  when st paul was on earth had any one on bended knees with hands and eyes lifted up to heaven in time of public prayer and amidst the solemn prayers to god beseeched him for aid and help and for the conference of gifts and graces he would have rent his clothes and said why do ye these things and can we suppose that now in heaven the apostle is less careful to preserve entire gods prerogative  beside there is a great deal of difference betwixt st pauls saying brethren pray for us or our requesting the prayers of the faithful here on earth for us and praying to saints in heaven as practiced in the roman church ours are only wishes and requests theirs solemn prayers on bended knees made in the places and proper seasons of divine worship and joined with the prayers they make to god they use the same postures and expressions of devotions they use to god himself they pray to them for help and aid and make them jointpetitioners with christ relying on their merits as the merits of christ  in sum in the tabernacle of this world we are to request the prayers of every good christian for us but in the tabernacle of heaven we are to call on none but him in whom we believe as in the outward court of the jewish tabernacle every priest was permitted to officiate to receive and present the devotions of the people to the divine majesty but in the holy place within the vail none but the high priest was to do any office or service even so in the tabernacle of this world every christian being a priest to god has this honor conferred upon him but in the holy of holies in heaven none but christ our high priest is to officiate he only is there to appear in the presence of god for us it is his prerogative alone to receive our prayers and present them to the divine majesty as none but the high priest was to offer incense in the holy of holies so none in heaven but christ our high priest is to offer our prayers to god his father he alone is that angel to whom much incense was given that he should offer it with the prayers of all saints upon the golden altar that was before the throne rev viii   which alludes to the altar that was before the mercyseat on which the high priest only was to offer incense  but the catholic may say perhaps that as on earth men do not presently run to kings to present their requests but obtain his favors by the mediation of courtiers and favorites even so it is fitting we have recourse to saints who are favorites in heaven that we may obtain access to god and have our suits accepted of him thus have i heard some learned men of the church of rome argue they should consider however in the first place that if an earthly prince had declared he would have no solicitor but his son and that all favors and royal graces should come to his subjects through his hands and by means of his mediation such subjects could deserve no favor if they make their application to other favorites contrary to their princes command  in the next place if the solicitor the son was out of the question and no such one had been declared by the king yet as we petition earthly princes by such as enjoy their presence because they cannot give audience to all their subjects nor do they know the worthy but god is omnipresent his ears always open and his head bowed down to the prayers of his people is no respecter of persons but gives a like access to the beggar as to the prince and promises to cast out none that make their application to him it follows of consequence that we ought to address ourselves immediately to god and ask from him if an earthly prince should thus invite his subjects to petition him for the supply of their wants i should account the man no better than a fool or a madman who would apply himself to any of the kings favorites  the conclusion is o thou that hear prayer unto thee shall all flesh come  ps lxv   since god who is infinite in mercy omnipresent and omnipotent in wisdom and action admits every man to the throne of grace bids him ask in the name of jesus christ and promises whatever we ask in his sons name he will do it  since the practice of praying to saints is injurious to christ and does manifestly rob him of his royal prerogative which is to be the one and only mediator betwixt god and man for in this office he has no sharers or partners according to the scripture account as god is but one and there is no other so the mediator by the appointment of god is but one and there is there can be no other quid tam proprium christi quam advocatum apud deum patrum adstare populorum ambros in psalm     pro quo nullus interpellat sed ipse pro omnibus hic unus verusque mediator est aug cont parmen l   c      and since exclusive of these unalterable things the roman doctors cannot be certain that saints in heaven hear the requests of suppliants on earth or know whether our prayers are fit to be accepted of god the roman doctors say the saints know the transactions that are done here below by revelation or intuition  to this i answer if it is by revelation that they know our requests and prayers to them then it must be either from god or from angels of which there is not the least assurance or certainty to be any where found but if we could be sure of it then in my opinion we ought to pray to god or angels to make known our prayers to saints which would be strange religion  if it be by intuition as the greatest part of the doctors say and that the saints see the requests in the divine essence as men see things in a corporeal glass then exclusive of answering that the scriptures say no such thing the saints must see all things in the divine essence or only such things as god is pleased to permit them to see if all things they would be omniscient if only the things permitted to be seen how is it possible for us to know whether god is pleased to permit them to see therein our prayers or to know the requests we make to them unless he had told us so let it be revelation or intuition it is sad stuff    let us reject that unlawful practice the invocation of saints and pray for pardon and grace as the gospel directs to god the judge of all through jesus christ the mediator of the new covenant  this do and thou shall live  n b who was the author of these good remarks these friars could not tell me as they were in the book when they bought it if i mistake not they are an abstract from a letter of bishop barlow to mr evelyn with several additions i have not bishop barlows works by me but i think i have seen something to this purpose written by this prelate about one hundred years ago  section iii say why was man so eminently raised amid the vast creation why ordained through life and death to dart his piercing eye with thoughts beyond the limits of his frame but that the omnipotent might send him forth in sight of mortal and immortal powers as on a boundless theater to run the great career of justice to exalt his generous aim to all diviner deeds to shake each partial purpose from his breast and through the mists of passion and of sense and through the tossing tide of chance and pain to hold his course unfault ring while the voice of truth and virtue up the steep ascent of nature calls him to his high reward the applauding smile of heaven else wherefore burns in mortal bosoms this unquenched hope that breathes from day to day sublimer things and mocks possession wherefore darts the mind with such resistless ardor to embrace majestic forms impatient to be free spurning the gross control of wilful might proud of the strong contention of her toils proud to be daring  april        we leave the religious and proceed in the journey    the eighth of april      i bid the ivonites adieu and by their directions walked up a very steep and stony mountain which took me two hours and then arrived at what i had often seen before in this part of the world a great lake the water of which was black as ink to look at as it stood though very bright in a cup and must be owing as i suppose to its descending to the abyss by the side of this water under the shade of oaktrees many hundred years old we rid for an hour on even ground and then came to a descent so very dangerous and dark through a wood on the mountains side that we could hardly creep it down on our feet nor our horses keep their legs as we led them to the bottom this declivity was more than a mile and ended in a narrow lane between a range of precipices that almost met at top this pass was kneedeep in water from a spring in the bottom of the mountain we had come down which ran through it and so very stony that it took us three hours to walk the horses to the end of it though it was not more than two miles but at last we came to a fine plain over which we rid for an hour and a half and arrived at a wood which seemed very large and stood between two very high unpassable hills in this forest was our way and the road so dark and obstructed by the branches of trees that it was dismal and uneasy to go on however we went for a long time and about the middle of it came to a circular opening of about four acres in which four very narrow roads met that we had traveled another before us and one on each hand the way strait on we were cautioned by my friends not to go as it was a terrible ride but whether to turn to the right or left we had forgot i thought to the right but my lad was positive he remembered the directions was to take the lefthand road this caused a stop for some time and as i was a little fatigued i thought it best while we paused to dine finn brought immediately some meat bread and a bottle of cider from his valise and under a great oak i sat down while our horses fed on the green one hour we rested and then went on again to the left as o finn advised for several hours we rid or rather our horses walked till we got out of the wood and then arrived at the bottom of a steep mountain one side of which is in the northern extremity of westmoreland and the other in the north end of stanemorerichmondshire this vast hill we ascended and came down the other side of the fell into a plain which extends southeast for near half a mile to the river teese that divides the north end of stanemore from bishopric or the county of durham yorkshire here ends in an obtuse angle between two mountains and the angle for a quarter of a mile is filled with that beautiful tall evergreen tree the broadleaved alaternus intermixed here and there in a charming manner with the fir tree the norway spruce and the balm of gilead it is as fine a grove as can in any part of the world be seen  a description of a little country seat in the northern extremity of stanemore    just at the entrance of it by the side of a plentiful spring which runs into the teese there stood the prettiest little house i had ever beheld and over it crept the pretty rockrose the cassine the seagreen coromilla and other evergreen shrubs before the house was a large garden seven or eight acres of land under fruit trees and vegetables of every kind very beautifully laid out and watered in a charming manner by the stream that murmured a thousand ways from the spring by the housedoor i have not seen a sweeter thing it appeared so beautiful and useful so still and delightful a place so judiciously cultivated and happily disposed that i could not help wishing to be acquainted with the owner of such a lodge  a description of a sleeping parlour in a grove    as there was no other fence to this fine spot of ground but a ditch like a ha to keep cattle out i leaped into the gardens and roamed about for some time to look at the curious things i then went up to the house in hopes of seeing a human creature either high or low i knocked at the door but no one could i find though the mansion did not look like an uninhabited place i then sauntered into the grove behind and in a winding way of three hundred yards that had been cut through the perennial wood and was made between banks of springing flowers beautiful exotics and various aromatic shrubs crept on till i arrived at a sleeping parlour which stood in the middle of a circular acre of ground and was surrounded and shaded with a beautiful grove the larix the phoenician cedar and the upright savin there was a little falling water near the door that was pleasing to look at and charmed the ear entering this room i found the walls painted by some masterly hand in baskets of flowers and the finest rural scenes two handsome couches were on either side the chamber and between these lits de repos was as curious a table for wood and workmanship as could be seen pretty stools stood near it and one armchair it was a sweet filent place and in every respect far beyond the sleeping parlour in the gardens at stow lord cobhams now earl temples seat in buckinghamshire    miles from london   passed the night in the sleeping parlour in the wood    on one of the couches as it was then evening and i knew not what to do i threw myself down and very soon fell fast asleep i lay the whole night without waking and as soon as i could perceive any day went to see what was become of finn and the horses the beasts i found feeding on very good grass in the green and my lad still snoaring under a great tree but he was soon on his legs and gave me the following account  finns story    about an hour after my departure from him he saw a poor man pass over the plain who had come down the mountain we descended and was going to cross the teese in a small skiff of his own in order to go to his cottage on the other side in bishopric that he lived by fishing and fowling and sold what he got by land and water to the quality and gentlefolk twenty miles round him and on asking who lived in the house before us on the skirts of the grove he said it belonged to a young lady of great fortune miss antonia cranmer whose father had been dead about a year died in the house i saw that she was the greatest beauty in the world and only nineteen and for one so young wise to an astonishing degree that she lived mostly at this seat with her cousin agnes vane who was almost as handsome as she that miss cranmer had no relish for the world being used to still life and seldom stirred from home but to visit an old lady her aunt who lived in cumberland that she was at present there about twenty miles off and would soon return that she kept four young gentlewomen who had no fortunes to attend her and miss vane two old men servants a gardner and a cook and two boys that whenever she went from her house she took her whole family with her and left every place locked up as i faw finns account surprised me it set me a thinking if it was possible to get this charming girl i paused with my finger in my mouth for a few minutes and then bid him saddle the horses  the authors manner of living for several days in the cottage of a poor fisherman in bisheprick    as soon as it was possible i went over the river to the fishermans house determining there to wait till i could see the beautiful antonia and her fair kinswoman another agnes de castro to be sure my curiosity could not pass two such glorious objects without any acquaintance with them  the poor fisherman gave me a bed very readily for money as he had one to spare for a traveller and he provided for me every thing i could desire he brought bread and ale from a village a few miles distant and i had plenty of fish and wildfowl for my table every afternoon i crossed the water went to the sleeping parlour and there waited for the charming antonia  twenty days i went backwards and forwards but the beauties in that time did not return still however i resolved to wait and to amuse myself till they came went a little way off to see an extraordinary man  a description of a charming little country seat where a solitary gentleman lived    while i resided in this cottage christopher informed me that about three miles from his habitation there lived in a wild and beautiful glin a gentleman well worth my knowing not only on account of his pretty lodge and lone manner of spending his time but as he was a very extraordinary man this was enough to excite my curiosity and as soon as it was light the first of may i went to look for this solitary i found him in a vale romantic indeed among vast rocks illshaped and rude and surrounded with trees as venerable as the forest of fontainbleau his little house stood on the margin of a fountain and was encompassed with copses of different trees and greens the pine the oak the ash the chestnut tree cypresses and the acasia diversified the ground and the negligent rural air of the whole spot had charms that could always please variety and agreeableness were every where to be seen here was an harbor of shrubs with odoriferous flowers and there a copse of trees was crowned with the enamel of a meadow there was a collection of the most beautiful vegetables in one part and in another an assembly of evergreens to form a perpetual spring pan had an altar of green turf under the shade of elms and limes and a waternymph stood by the spring of a murmuring stream the whole was a fine imitation of nature simple and rural to a charming degree  the history of dorict watson the hermit    here lived dorick watson an english gentleman who had been bred a catholic in france and there married a sister of the famous abbe le blanc but on returning to his own country being inclined by good sense and curiosity to see what the protestants had to say in defense of their reformation he read the best books he could get on the subject and soon perceived that luther melancthon calvin zuinglius bucer and other ministers of christ had said more against the romish religion than the pretended catholics had been able to give a solid answer to he saw that barbarity policy and sophistry were the main props of popery and that in doctrine and practice it was one of the greatest visible enemies that christ has in the world he found that even bellarmines notes of his church were so far from being a clear and necessary proof that the church of rome is the body of christ or true church that they proved it to be the great babylon or that great enemy of gods church which the apostles describe  the hermits observations on bellarmines notes of the church he saw in the first place that there has not been since the writing of the new testament any empire but that of the church of rome so universal for    0 years together as to have all that dwell upon earth peoples and multitudes and nations and tongues to worship it which is st johns description of the new power that prevailed on the inhabitants of the earth to receive his idolatrous constitutions and yield obedience to his tyrannical authority and all that dwell on the earth shall worship him except those who are enrolled in the registers as heirs of eternal life according to the promises of the mediator of acceptance and blessing  rev xiii   the waters which thou saw where the whore sits are peoples and multitudes and nations and tongues rev xvii    bellarmines universality then is directly against him  the cardinals second note continued dorick is antiquity and his third a perpetual and uninterrupted duration but on examination i could find no ruling power except rome papal so ancient as to have the blood of prophets and saints and of all that were slain upon earth of that kind for that space of time to be found in it  rev xviii    and what rule but papal rome had ever so long a duration upon seven hills so as to answer the whole length of the time of the saracen and turkish empires  the cardinals fourth note is amplitude and it is most certain that never had any other church such a multitude and variety of believers as to have all nations drink of the wine of her fornication and to gain a blasphemous power over all kindreds and tongues and nations  the fifth note is the succession of its bishops and the sixth agreement with the doctrine of the ancient church now it is most true that none but rome was ever so eminently conspicuous for so long a time for the succession of its bishops under one supreme patriarch as to be the living image of all the civil dignities of the empire where it was under one supreme churchhead exercising all the power of the civil head nor did ever any enemy of gods church act for so long a time like the red dragon in its bloody laws against the followers of the lamb and yet so far agree with the primitive church in fundamental doctrines as to answer the character of a false prophet with the horns of the lamb that is christ but speaking like the red dragon to his followers as the church of rome has done an abstract of dr chandlers observations on bellarmines sixth note of the church reader it is well worth your while to turn to the first volume of that admirable work the saltershall sermons against popery and there see how the cardinals notes of his church are considered by that learned and excellent man dr samuel chandler his consideration of the  th note more immediately concerns me here and therefore i give you an abstract of it  the writings of the apostles are allowed even by our adversaries to be the oldest records of christianity and therefore to this ancient and infallible rule we ought to appeal to determine the controversy between us and the papists that is to see how far this antiquity favors their doctrine and practices or is in agreement with ours    the protestants renounce the pope and acknowledge one lawgiver the lord jesus christ for these reasons  that the pope is not mentioned in the new testament that christ says one is your master even christ and st paul says there is but one lord and one faith the whole family in heaven and earth is named of the lord jesus christ    protestants do not pay any worship at all to saints and angels but as st paul directs consider jesus christ as their sole mediator and advocate for there is but one god and one mediator between god and man the man jesus christ they say such veneration and prayer to saints and angels is superstition and will worship and only worship god with all their hearts and souls with the most raised affections and the highst degrees of love and fear faith and confidence for it is written thou shall worship the lord god and him only shall thou serve and the angel in the revelation said to john who fell down at his feet to worship him see thou do it not for i am thy fellow servants    we affirm that in the sacrament of the lords supper after consecration there is nothing existent but bread and wine for st paul says whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup and as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup    we affirm the eucharist is only a memorial of christs death for christ says do this in remembrance of me and st paul assures the corinthians from christ himself   cor xi    that they were to receive the elements with this view only and in his epistle to the hebrews he tells us that by one offering christ has for ever perfected those who are sanctified and that because there is remission of sins under the new covenant there is no more offering for sin which proves the eucharist is not a propitiatory sacrifice    we renounce the doctrine of purgatory and affirm that the future state is no state of probation for at death the dust shall return to the earth as it was and the spirit shall return to god who gave it and st paul declares that at the judgment seat of christ every one shall receive the things done in the body according to that he has done whether it be good or bad    protestants affirm that the worship of god ought to be performed in a language which all men understand and that they have a right to search the scriptures for if i speak with tongues says the apostle in such a language as those i speak to cannot understand what shall i profit you let all things be done to edifying and christ bids us search the scriptures and how could the word of christ dwell richly in us in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another in psalms hymns and spiritual songs if we had not the word of christ and the scriptures of truth to read and consult for ourselves  these are the protestant doctrines and we see they were taught by christ and by his apostles we have the sanction of the most venerable antiquity on our side and this note of the true church of christ belongs to us in the highest perfection  when the papists then scornfully say where was your church before luther and calvin the answer is obvious the doctrine of our church was in the writings of the inspired apostles where the church of rome is never to be found  the same that was taught by christ himself whom they have forsaken and whose faith they have corrupted as to our predecessors and professors they were the persecuted disciples of the crucified jesus those martyrs and confessors whose blood the church of rome has cruelly spilt this is the genuine antiquity the protestants have to boast of their doctrines are the word of christ and their fathers were put to death by papists for the testimony of jesus  but the papists on the contrary exclusive of the example of the devil who was a murderer from the beginning and antiochus epiphanus nero domitian and other monsters of mankind who went before them in the measures of persecution cruelty and blood and excepting the idolatrous nations of the earth and the false prophets and deceivers among the jews by whose authority and example they may vindicate their own idolatries they have no genuine antiquity to plead many of their doctrines were unknown to or abhorred by the primitive church and are mere novelties and innovations that were originally introduced by superstition and then maintained by cruelty and blood     the seventh note of bellarmines holy roman catholic church is the union of the members among themselves and with the head and sure it is that no where else but in rome papal has there been such an union of head and members for that length of time as to apply the one mind of the ten kings for their agreement together to give their power and strength and their whole kingdoms to the beast  the eighth note produced by cardinal bellarmine is sanctity and watson saw it fairly proved by the protestant writers that no church but rome did ever appear so long together with such a medley of sanctity in some doctrines and outward appearances of a strict holiness of life joined with the most abominable doctrines and practices to qualify it for the horns of the lamb and the speech of the dragon for the idolatrous and cruel commands of the image or for having the form of godliness in the latter times and yet denying the power thereof  in short dorick not only found on a careful enquiry that the system of the church of rome was error and turpitude abomination gain and cruelty  and her great design the very reverse of the gospel revelation which came down from heaven to prepare men by the practice of universal holiness and virtue for eternal life but likewise that even her cardinals notes prove this church cannot be in any sense the true church of christ and bellarmine was perfectly infatuated to make choice of such things for the marks of his church as make it the very picture of babylon the great he resolved then to come out of rome he determined to forsake a church which had altered the institutions of christ and is therefore guilty of heresy as well as schism  this change in religion gave dorick the highest satisfaction as he told me and it was doubled by his being able to convert his beloved adelaide from popery to the church of christ but this joy had soon after some mitigation by losing one of the most agreeable women in the world death robbed him of his hearts fond idol and by that stroke he was so wounded that he could not heal himself for a long time he became the real mourner he kept the reasons of his anguish continually before him and was more intent upon spending his spirits than his sorrows he grew fond of solitude and silence that he might indulge his passion and provoke the emotion of that grief that was ready to devour him in short he retreated to the silent place i found him in which was a part of his own estate and turned hermit he built the little villa i saw by the waterside and formed the ground into the natural garden i beheld le blanc mentions it in his letters as an extraordinary thing and very justly prefers it to the labored and expensive gardens at chiswick the work of the late lord burlington here watson laid in every thing he had a mind for and filled his closet with books he amused and kept himself healthy by working in his garden and when he had done abroad went in to read his principal study was the contemplation of the best learning which is the true christian and from that he went to know what the greeks and romans have resolved and taught in some things i found he was a learned agreeable man and wondered greatly at his whim in turning hermit i said a great deal against it as we sat over a bottle of claret told him he might employ his time and talents more usefully in the world by mixing and conversing with his fellow creatures and by a mutual participation and conveyance of the common blessings of nature and providence and as he was not forty yet advised him to go over the teese and make his addresses to miss cranmer or miss vane both of them being most glorious girls as i was told and capable of adding greatly to the delights of philosophy you have not seen two finer creatures soul and body than they are if i have been rightly informed and i think it would be a nobler and more religious act to get one of them with child in the state of holy wedlock than to write the best book that was ever printed for my own part i had rather marry and doublerib one of these dear creatures than die with the character of a father of the deserts but in vain did i remonstrate to this anchoret contemplation was become his venus from the hour he lost his adelaide and he had lived so very happy in his lone state for seven years past that he could not think of hazarding felicity by a change of life he had all he desired if at any time and thing was wanting christopher the fisherman who came to see him once or twice a week very quickly got him whatever he required this was watsons answer to my advice and seeing it was to no purpose to say any more i wished my hermit health and bid him adieu  a few remarks relating to the abbe le blanc and his letters    having in the preceding article mentioned the famous abbe le blanc i think i ought to say something of him in this place by adding a few remarks in relation to this extraordinary man he was in england in the year      and writ two volumes of letters in octavo which were translated into english and printed for brindley in      in this account of england the french monk pretends to describe the natural and political constitution of our country and the temper and manners of the nation but as is evident from his epistles knew nothing at all of any of them  voltaire however that wonderful compound of a man half infidel half papist who seems to have no regard for christianity and yet compliments popery at the expense of his understanding voltaires words are  and notwithstanding all the troubles and infamy which the church of rome has had to encounter she has always preserved a greater decency and gravity in her worship than any of the other churches and has given proofs that when in a state of freedom and under due regulations she was formed to give lessons to all others  is not this facing the world and contradicting truth with a bold front decency and gravity in the church of rome the licentious whore and formed to give lessons lessons voltaire  is not her wisdom in every article of it earthly sensual devilish  and her zeal that bitter fierce and cruel thing which for ever produces confusion and every evil work with a just abhorrence and a manly indignation we must look upon this mystery of iniquity and never let that horror decay which is necessary to guard us against the gross corruptions of the roman church the idolatry of her worship  the absurdity and impiety of her doctrines  the tyranny and cruelty of her principles and practices these are her lessons voltaire and you ought to ask the world pardon for daring to recommend a church whose schemes and pieties bid defiance to reason and are inconsistent with the whole tenor of revelation this is the more incumbent on you as you say you are a philosopher and let us know in more places than one in your writings that by that word you mean a man who believes nothing at all of any revelation    who writes the history of england with a partiality and malevolence almost as great as smollets and pretends to describe the britannic constitution though it is plain from what he says that he has not one true idea of the primary institutions of it but taking this nation to be just such another kingdom of slaves as his own country rails at the revolution and like all the jacobite dunces prates against the placing the prince of orange on the throne and the establishment of the succession in the present protestant heirs though most certain it be that these things were the natural fruit and effect of our incomparable constitution and are de jure  in short that zoilus and plagiary  that carping superficial critic as a good judge calls him who abuses the english nation in his letters and denies shakespeare almost every dramatic excellence though in his mahomet he pilfers from macbeth almost every capital scene  shakespeare who furnishes out more elegant pleasing and interesting entertainment in his plays than all the other dramatic writers ancient and modern have been able to do and without observing any one unity but that of character for ever diverts and instructs by the variety of his incidents the propriety of his sentiments the luxuriancy of his fancy and the purity and strength of his dialogue voltaire i say speaking of this abbe le blanc wishes he had traveled through all the world and wrote on all nations for it becomes only a wise man to travel and write had i always such cordials i would not complain any more of my ills i support life when i suffer i enjoy it when i read you this is voltaires account of the abbe how true and just it is we shall see in a few observations on what this reverend man says of our religion and clergy  some observations on the abbe le blancs fiftyeighth letter to the president bouhier in which he misrepresents and blackens the reformation of england and abuses the english clergy the substance of what this french monk reports vol ii from p    to p    in his letter to the president bouhier of mons bouhier president of the french academy reader  bouhier president of the french academy to whom le blanc inscribes his   th letter died in      he was a scholar labbe de olivet from whom he had the late fine edition of cicero in seven volumes   to speaks of him in the following manner  je me suis prete a ce nouveau travail and dautant plus volontiers que m le president bouhier a bien voulu le partager avec moi  on sera sans doubt charm de voir ciceron enter les mains dun traducteur aussi digne de lui que ciceron luimeme etoit digne davoir traducteur un savant du premier order tusc tome   p     and again  feu m le president bouhier le varron de notre siecle and lhomme le plus capable de bien render les vraies beautez dun original grec ou latin avoit tellement retouche ses deux tusculanes quon aura peine a les reconnoitre dans cette nouvelle edition tusc tome   p    this is olivets account of bouhier and i have heard some gentlemen who knew him say that he was a very fine genius but they added a popish bigot to the last degree and therefore le blanc chose him as the fittest person of his acquaintance to write an epistle to that abused the reformation and the english divines great is the prejudice of education when so bright a mind as bouhiers cannot see the deformity of popery and the beauty of the reformation but on the contrary with pleasure reads the despicable defamation in le blancs letter  n b the two tusculans so finely translated by bouhier are the  d de aegritudine lenienda and the  th virtutem ad beat vivendum seipsa esse contentam de la virtue quelle suffit pour vivre heureux  see likewise m bouhiers curious and useful remarks on the three books de natura deorum the five tusculans scipios dream and on the catilinaires or three orations against catiline these remarks are the third volume   is this    that cranmer and the other doctors who introduced the reformation into england were downright enthusiasts and compassed their designs by being seconded by those who were animated by a spirit of irreligion and by a greedy desire of seizing the possessions of the monks it was the desire of a change established the reformation the new doctors seduced the people and the people having mistaken darkness for light quitted the road of truth to walk in the ways of error    as to morals that this boasted reformation produced no change in that respect for the people are not purer than they were in former times and the ecclesiastics are despised and hated for the badness of their lives the bishops sacrifice every thing to their ambition and the clergy of the second rank have no respect for their office they spend the whole day in public places in smoking and drinking and are remarkable for drunkenness so dishonorable to ecclesiastics their talk is the most dissolute and the vice that degrades these professors sets a bad example to sober people and makes them the jest of libertines    the only remarkable change produced by the reformation was the marriage of priests and exclusive of this being against the decisions of the catholic church it is contrary to sound policy and experience the marriage of priests diminishes the respect we should have for them the misconduct of a woman makes the clergyman fall into contempt the lewdness of the daughter makes the priest her father the object of the most indecent jests and for the most part the daughters of the clergy turn whores after the death of their father who while living spent more of his income in maintaining himself and children in pleasure and luxury than in works of charity he lived profusely and dies poor  beside if the english clergy were the greatest and most excellent men yet a great man in the eyes of the world loses of the respect which is due to him in proportion as he has any thing in common with the rest of mankind a madam newton and a madam fontenelle would injure the illustrious men whose name they bore nor is this all those who by their disposition cannot fix that secret inclination which induces us to love on one person are more humane and charitable than others the unmarried ecclesiastics are more animated with that charitable spirit their function requires as they have no worldly affections to divert it people very rarely as lord bacon says employ themselves in watering plants when they want water themselves  in short the english divines are the worst of men and there is hardly any religion in england  thus does this french abbe revile the english reformation and divines he misrepresents the whole nation and with a falsehood and outrage peculiar to popery and masspriests that is to devils and the most execrable religion screams against the pure religion of the gospel and dishonestly blackens some of the finest characters that ever adorned human nature so very virulent is this reverend french papist against the clergy of england that he is even positive there is not a divine in the nation knows how to behave like a gentleman  in answer to the first article of impeachment i observe that it is so far from being true that cranmer and the other english divines our reformers were enthusiasts and compassed their designs by the assistance of those who were animated by a spirit of irreligion and by a greedy desire of seizing the possession of the monks as this masspriest asserts that it is most certain on the contrary cranmer and the other reformers were wise and upright christians who from a good understanding of religion opposed the false pretensions of the church of rome they saw that popery was contrary to the true genius of christianity its spirit insolent and cruel and its worship not only a jumble of the most ridiculous fopperies and extravagancies borrowed from heathen customs and superstitions but the impurest that ever appeared in the world that the designs of popish rome were contrary to all the principles of humanity its doctrines abominable and sinful and its offices cursed and diabolical it was evident i say to the conception of these great men i mean cranmer and the other english reformers that the romish church was treacherous and inhuman bloodthirsty and antichristian that her devotions were horrible and impious her ministers false prophets and liars covered and decked with the livery of christ but in every thing acting contrary to the salvation wrought by jesus and therefore these wise and excellent reformers renounced popery and bravely declared for that religion which promotes the good of all mankind and inspires men to worship the father only in spirit and in truth they threw off the cloak and garments of antichrist they gloriously separated from him and joined together in purity and simplicity to please the lord jehovah there was no enthusiasm in the case as le blanc the masspriest has the front to say but when the light of the gospel was obscured and darkness had overspread the earth when ignorance and superstition universally prevailed and the immoralities of the church of rome were made to pass for christianity in the world then did these reformers call the people out of rome and preach to them the essential truths of the faith they called them from an idolatrous religion and all its train of direful effects from that sin of the first rank which strikes at the being of a god and ravishes from him the greatest honor that is due to him from his creature man they called them from the horrible service of the mass from their addresses to angels and saints and their worship of images to the inward knowledge of one true god and the worship due to him only to the sanctification and honor which is due to him above all things and above every name to the living hope in god through christ to regeneration and inward renovation by faith hope and charity to a holy conversation and a faithful performance of all the commandments to true repentance perseverance to the end and life eternal to these truths not to be found in the religion of our traveling masspriest did the great the glorious english reformers call mankind they labored to establish them in every thing tending to a pure faith and good life in this there is not there cannot be any enthusiasm  and as to their being assisted by those who were animated by a spirit of irreligion and by a greedy desire of seizing the possessions of the monks it does not appear to be the truth of the case supposing there were such irreligious men the assistance the reformers had from any great men in henry the eighths time when the abbeys were destroyed was so very little that malice only could mention it as an objection to the reformation popery in that monarchs reign was still the established religion of england and both sides blame this kings persecutions if papists were put to death for denying the supremacy of harry protestants were no less sufferers for opposing the adoration of the host and other religious impieties and after the short reign of his son edward the sixth what assistance had the reformers under bloody mary did she not do all that infernal popery could suggest to destroy cranmer his brethren and their reformation and did not they without any other assistance than what they received from the spirit of god continue to vindicate the truth as it is in jesus and teach the pure doctrines of the gospel in opposition to the frauds and vile inventions of papal rome without minding the indignities the torments and the cruel death prepared for them the brave honest men went on with their heavenly work and till the flames made them silent endeavored to destroy the romish artifices and immoralities and to spread the pure religion and undefiled before god and the father they were zealous with the truth of religion on their side and labored to convert out of a pure and friendly regard to the eternal welfare of mankind they did the work by the blessing of god and therefore the malicious le blanc the masspriest reviles and blackens them  what he says of usurpation in respect of church lands does not deserve any notice the reforming clergy were not the actors in that scene it was the king and his council and as the pope had showed them the way by granting bulls for the dissolution of the lesser monasteries they thought since the popes power was taken away by a general consent of the nation the king the church and the people concurring they might with as little sacrilege dissolve the rest the king and parliament says bishop burnet could not discern the difference between greater and lesser as to the point of sacrilege and although some uses might cease by the doctrines of the reformation as masses for souls departed and monks to pray the dead out of purgatory yet there were others to employ the church lands about as some of them were in founding new bishoprics and if in this case the reformers had been guilty of some wilful errors that could be no crime of the reformation the culpable must answer it for the satisfaction of conscience about the reformation there can be but three questions fairly proposed was there sufficient cause for it was there sufficient authority and whether the proceedings of our reformation were justifiable by the rule of scripture and the ancient church upon these points we ought to join issue and i am sure the conclusion must be in the affirmative  as to le blancs second observation in relation to the marriage of priests which our reformation he says produced it may be answered that the doctrine of a priests marriage being unlawful was borrowed by the church of rome from the ancient heretics especially from the manichees who allowed marriage to their hearers as the church of rome does to laymen but forbad it to their elect as that church does to her priests st augustine charges the manichees with this error hic non dubito vos esse clamaturos invidiamque factures castitatem perfectam vos vehementer commendare atque laudare non tamen nuptias prohibere quandoquidem auditores vestri quorum apud vos secundus est gradus ducere atque habere non prohibentur uxores de moribus manichaeorum lib   c     the first pope we read of that condemned the marriage of priests was syricius the roman a d          and upon this account i wonder baronius had not a regard to his memory but it has been the misfortune of his holiness since his death to fall under the displeasure of the cardinal to that degree that he has struck him out of his catalogue of his romish saints he does not tell us for what reason perhaps it was because this pope rather dissuaded priests from marriage than peremptorily forbad it as appears by his letters sir epist   and   apud binium  the next pope who distinguished himself against the marriage of priests was the son of baldhead count of burgundy whose granddaughter was consort to lewis the  th king of france i mean the celebrated guy archbishop of vienne who succeeded gelasius a d      and had for successor in the year      lambert of bononia commonly called honorius the second calixtus the second pope and prince of burgundy was the first who absolutely forbad priests marriage and in case they were married commanded them to be separated great did    c   this was in the beginning of the twelfth century and toward the end of it a d      the renowned son of count trasimund i mean innocent the third the ever memorable cardinal lotharius pronounced all the marriages of priests null and afterward came on the council of trent a d            which anathematizes those who say such marriages are valid sess    can    but one would think that god sufficiently declared his approbation of such marriages in that the whole world has by his appointment been twice peopled by two married priests first by adam secondly by noah and we are sure the holy scripture tells us that marriage is honorable in all heb xiii   and places it among the qualifications of a bishop that he be the husband of one wife having faithful children tit i   this says st chrysostom the apostle prescribed to this end that he might stop the mouths of heretics who reproached marriage declaring thereby that marriage is no unclean thing but so honorable that a married man may be exalted to the sacred throne of a bishop chrysostom hom   in c   ad tit what do you say to this le blanc i fancy you never read this homily of chrysostom  and well might this saint think it not unbecoming a bishop to marry when our lord thought it not unbecoming an apostle no not the prince of the apostles as the romanists will have him for it is without doubt that st peter was married in that the scripture makes mention of his wifes mother  matt viii    and clemens of alexandria tells us that it was certainly reported that when he saw his wise led to death he rejoiced and having exhorted her and comforted her he called her by her name and bid her remember the lord  clemens alex stromat l   p     lut      and that he was not only married but begat children the same clemens in another place affirms  stromat l   p     yea that st philip and st jude were also married and had children eusebius is witness  eusebius eccles hist l   c  0     and in like manner we find that many of the primitive bishops were married charemon bishop of nilus st spiridion st gregory nazianzen st gregory nyssen st hilary and many more were married men  nor can it be said that they took wives while they were laymen and after they took upon them the sacred ministry were separated from them since the canons commonly called the apostles did prohibit either bishop priest or deacon to put away his wife upon pretense of religion see canon   and if any such shall abstain from marriage as in itself abominable command that he be corrected or deposed and cast out of the church canon  0  now supposing these canons notwithstanding all that whiston has said were not made by them whose name they bear yet they are allowed by all to be of much greater antiquity than the first nicene council and when in that council it was moved that bishops and priests deacons and subdeacons might not cohabit with their wives which they had taken before ordination the motion was presently dashed by the famous paphnutius who was himself a single person  socrat eccles hist l   c    yea a long time after this council we meet with many popes who were sons of bishops and priests  pope theodorus silverius and gelasius i were the sons of bishops pope boniface i felix ii and agapetus ii were the sons of priests  gratian did    c   and that we may not think this strange gratian himself informs us that the marriage of priests was in those days lawful in the latin church did    c     nor is this doctrine to be rejected only as contrary to scripture and to primitive and apostolical practice but because of the abominable fruits produced in the church of rome by it for when the clergy might not have wives which god allowed instead of them they took whores and that wickedness so far prevailed in the church that the cardinal of cambray informs us de reform eccles many clergymen were not ashamed publicly in the face of the world to keep concubines and the gloss upon gratian says a priest may not be deposed for simple fornication because there are few priests to be found without that fault this made pius the second say that though priests were by the western church forbid to marry for good reason yet there was stronger reason to restore marriage to them again hist council trent l   p   0 and many in that council were so sensible of this that they alleged the great scandal given by incontinent priests and that there was want of continent persons fit to exercise the ministry  paoli p     etc the emperor and the duke of bavaria did therefore require that the marriage of priests might be granted  paoli p   0 etc and many bishops desired that married persons might be promoted to holy orders but this request was not granted because as the fathers observed if the clergy once come to be married they will no longer depend on the pope but on their prince  to conclude this article and i shall do it in the words of a great man a prelate of the church of england now living to make war against the very being of their species they the romish priests devote themselves to a single life in blasphemous opposition to that first great command and blessing increase and multiply  as to le blancs third observation relating to the immoralities and bad behavior of the english clergy i answer if there are several bad men among so large a body as the protestant divines are which is not strange as it is the common case of all societies yet the majority of them orthodox and other dox are as worthy men as can be found among the human race i am very sure my acquaintance among them has been much larger than le blancs could possibly be and i can affirm from my own knowledge that there are very many of this order of men not only as fine gentlemen as i have ever conversed with but a clergy holy in heart superior to pride to anger to foolish desires who walk as christ also walked and by their example and doctrine labor to make the people what the gospel requires they should be that is pious and useful pure and honest meek and charitable to walk by faith and not by sight and so pass through things temporal that they may be sure of obtaining the things eternal this i can say of many english divines of my acquaintance and i may add that this testimony from me who am not overfond of the clergy as the main of the christianity of too many of them lies in their opinion decked with a few outward observances says mr wesley very truly in his letter to bishop warburton and only upon occasion endeavor now to do them justice is certainly of more weight in their favor than the calumny and abuse of a furious bigot and masspriest can be to make the world have as bad an opinion of them as popery and its wretched emissaries would have the public entertain consider this then when you read le blancs letters  on the other hand i have had a very large and intimate acquaintance with masspriests in my time in many parts of the world and a few excellent ones excepted i can affirm that more wicked and more worthless men than these romish monks i have never seen if adultery fornication drunkenness and swearing are crimes then the greatest criminals i could name in these respects are romancatholic priests let this assertion of mine be set over against the character the ahbe le blanc gives the english protestant ministers consider all i have said when you read this masspriests fiftyeighth letter and then judge of our reformation and clergy a word or two relating to transubstantiation note reader in the fourth volume of a work called notes relating to men and things and books you will find some more of my remarks on the abbe le blancs epistles you will see among other observations on this monk a vindication of archbishop tillotson the abbe rails at one of this prelates fine sermons with great malice and impudence and has the vanity to think his miserable declamation an answer this wretched and despicable romish apsstate has the impudence and impiety to defend the worship of his god of dough and would if it were in his power persuade the readers of his letters to adore the tiny cake he prostrates himself before for this the reader will find the masspriest well chastised in the work i have referred to and see the doctrine of the lords supper set in a true light you will find there a curious history of the mass from the time the popish doctors first drew it out of the bottomless pit and see it made quite evident that in this abominable article of their faith as well as in every other part of their execrable religion they make void the law of god and sink the human race into the vilest slavery and idolatry beware then christians of popery still bravely dare to protest against her infernal schemes and inventions and draw your religion from the book of god that holy volume of inestimable treasure it is our light in darkness  our comfort under affliction  our direction to heaven  and let us die in defense of it if ever there should be occasion rather than suffer the bloodthirsty papists the redhanded idolaters to snatch it out of our hands they will give us for it the despicable legends of fictitious saints and false miracles  a history of diseases cured instantly by relics  accounts of speaking images  stories of traveling chapels  wonders done by a madona  and the devil knows what he has crowded into their wretched heads down with popery then the religion of hell and may that happy state be erected when truth and love shall embrace and reign come lord jesus come quickly    but it is time to return to the cottage of christopher the fisherman and see what happened to antonia and agness  the beginning of my acquaintance with miss cranmer and how it ended in a marriage   0 when i came back to the poor mans cottage he told me the ladies were come home and as he had given miss cranmer some account of me as a traveller who had journeyed into that remote corner of the world in search of antiquities and curiosities he did not think this lady would be averse to seeing me and hearing me too if i contrived any plausible pretense to throw myself in her way  immediately then i crossed the water went up to the house and as i saw her and the fair agness her cousin walking in the garden near the ha leaped it over immediately broad as it was and with my hat in my hand made her a low bow began an apology for presuming to introduce myself to her presence in such a manner and concluded with my being in love with her charming character before i had the honor and happiness of seeing her what a condition then must i be in when a heavenborn maid like her appeared strange pleasures filled my soul unloosed my tongue and my first talk could not be any thing but love a deal i said on the subject not worth repeating to the reader and the issue of the matter was that i became so well acquainted with this innocent beauty that on taking my leave i had an invitation to breakfast with her the next morning i was there by eight and really and truly quite charmed with her she was pretty as it was possible for flesh and blood to be had a beautiful understanding and as she had very little notion of men having seen very few except the two old servants who lived with her she had not a notion of any danger that could come from conversing freely with a man she knew nothing of and who might be an enemy in disguise  after breakfast i offered to go but she asked me to stay and dine and to sum up the matter i did dine sup and breakfast with her every day for a month till my good priest friar fleming arrived on a letter i had sent him and we were married before the end of six weeks we loved to excess and did enhance human happiness to a high degree she was good as an angel and for two years we lived in unspeakable felicity for the greatest part of that time we were at ortonlodge as she liked the wild place there she likewise died of the smallpox in the first month of the third year and left me the most disconsolate of men four days i sat with my eyes shut on account of this loss and then left the lodge once more to live if i could since my religion ordered me so to do and see what i was next to meet with in the world as grief sat powerfully on my spirits and if not dislodged would have drank them all up very soon i resolved to hasten to harrogate and in the festivities of that place forget my departed partner as soon as i could i laid my antonia by my charlotte and my statia and then rode off what happened at the wells and all the observations i made there and thereabout the reader will find in my fifth section  n b as i mention nothing of any children by so many wives some readers may perhaps wonder at this and therefore to give a general answer once for all i think it sufficient to observe that i had a great many to carry on the succession but as they never were concerned in any extraordinary affairs nor ever did any remarkable things that i heard of  only rise and breakfast read and saunter drink and eat it would not be fair in my opinion to make any one pay for their history  section v as once it was in astraeas reign the vernal powers renewed their train it happened that immortal love was ranging through the spheres above and downward hither cast his eye the years returning pomp to spy he saw the radiant god of day lead round the globe the rosy may the fragrant airs and genial hours were shedding round him dews and flowers before his wheels aurora past and hespers golden lamp was last but fairest of the blooming throng when health majestic moved along all gay with smiles to see below the joys which from her presence flow while earth inlivend hears her voice and fields and flocks and swains rejoice then mighty love her charms confessed and soon his vows inclined her breast and known from that auspicious morn the pleasing cheerfulness was born thou cheerfulness by heaven designed to rule the pulse that moves the mind whatever fretful passion springs whatever chance or nature brings to strain the tuneful poize within and disarrange the sweet machine thou goddess with a masterhand do each attemperd key command refine the soft and swell the strong till all is concord all is song  the author goes to harrogate    in the year      i arrived at harrogate in the west riding of yorkshire in order to amuse my mind with the diversions and company of the place an account of the place the wells and company it is a small straggling village on a heath two miles from knaresborough which is thirteen miles from york and     from london the sulphur wells are three on the north side of the town about  00 yards east of the bog they rise out of a little dry hill the second is a yard from the first and the third is five yards and a half from the second the water rises into stonebasons which are each enclosed in a small neat building of stone and lime a yard square on the insides and two yards high covered over with thick flagstones laid shelving  the soil out of which these springs rise is first cornmould then a marle limestone and a stratum of plaster the limestone is so abraded by the salt in the water that when dried it swims and where the water stagnates between the basins and the brook the earth is ink black and has a dry white scum which smells like sulphur and burns with a blue flame the water does likewise throw up much candied sea salts that is salts to which sulphur adheres and the pigeons resort from all parts to pick them up in moist or rainy weather these waters send forth a strong smell at a distance and before rain they bubble up with an impetuous force yet neither rain nor drought increases or decreases the springs  from the large quantities of fine flower of brimstone which these waters throw off it is plain that sulphur is the principal thing in them but experiment likewise proves that besides sulphur the stinking well has vitriol nitre copper and salt these lie in solutis principiis in earth from which the water comes and may be separated by operation some i know deny there is any copper in these waters but they do not consider that the glittering glebes of a gold color found here can be nothing else than glebes gilt with copper  as to the diseases wherein this strong sulphurwater is proper it is good for every thing except a consumption for this i recommend the scarborough purgingchalybeate above all waters but if reader you have obstructions in your liver and other viscera and are tormented with vicious humors in your intestines if your bowels are full of worms the ascarides or the broad round worm or the worms called the dog and the wolf from their likeness to these animals or if from a venereal cause the malady of many a priest and layman you have an ulcer in the anus or in the neck of your bladder go to harrogate drink the stinkingwater live temperate and you will be cured for the scurvy that universal disease it is better than all other medicines it is excellent in the jaundice though of many years standing it cures the asthma the scotomia and palsy and in many other deplorable cases gives wonderful relief whatever ails you the consumption excepted fly to harrogate and the water will do you good if your hour be not come and if you are well the waters will promote long life and make you the more able to dance with the ladies  four pints of water are enough for a patient to be taken from half an hour to two hours after sun rising upon an empty stomach you should take some preparatory medicine and walk drinking the waters to warm the body a little and make the passage the easier some people i have known drink their dose in bed and it does well enough but exercise and the thin open air do better and contribute not a little to the patients recovery and there is no finer fresher air in england than at this place  in short these wells are the strongest sulphurwater in great britain and from the superior strength of the impregnating sulphur it does not lose but retain the sulphurous smell even when exposed to a scalding and almost a violent heat and in distilling it when three pints had been taken off from a gallon of it the last was as strong as the first and stunk intolerably  make haste then to harrogate if you are sick and have money and in all probability you will find the waters efficacious unless thy distemper be a consumption or in its nature incurable which is the case of many as death is the common fate of mankind  some advice to the drinkers of harrogate waters    but when you are there let me advise you to exercise as much as you can bear without fatiguing yourself  and in the next place to be regular in meats and drinks and as temperate as possible without these things you will lose the benefit of the waters no good can be expected if men will indulge during a course of drinking the spaw and be not only excessive in quantity but indiscreet as to the quality of meats and liquors  some observations on spawwaters and advice to the drinkers in a mineral course i have known some wornout hard drinkers come to the wells for relief and at the same time increase by intemperance what they had contracted by the same measure i have likewise seen some in a diabetes drink white wine in a cachexy ale in the stone and gravel claret i have known a man in a dropsy eat nothing but cooling insipid mucilaginous foods and drink maltdrink plentifully  a man in a jaundice eat nothing but flesh meat and claret  in a scurvy prefer the pungent saline diet  in obstinate obstructions and a chronic hyppo feed on thickning hardening and drying meats  and in a hectic vomiting and spitting of blood choose only such things as increase the bloods momentum and velocity i have known some gentlemen who sat up late never exercised could not eat a dinner and therefore would indulge in a flesh supper  all these and many other irregularities have i known expect surprising effects from the waters and when they received no benefit say there were no sanative principles in them unreasonable unhappy men be temperate regular exercise keep the passions within bounds and you may expect very astonishing cures provided your bodies are not become irreparable and no longer tenantable that your juices are not to the last degree glutinous and acrimonious that the corrosiveness of your blood is not bringing on mortifications  nor inflammations filling dilating and breaking your vessels into suppuration and putrefactions then live how you will the waters can be of no use you must pay the debt of nature by an incurable disease neither mineral waters nor physic can create and enliven new bodies or make and adapt particular members to the old but if you are only hurt a little and the disease is curable the waters will certainly be efficacious and recover you if you use moderate exercise riding especially and diversion a strict regularity and great temperance  conclusion of the authors advice o temperance divine temperance thou art the support of the other virtues the preserver and restorer of health and the protracter of life thou art the maintainer of the dignity and liberty of rational beings from the wretched inhuman slavery of sensuality taste custom and examples and the brightner of the understanding and memory thou art the sweetner of life and all its comforts the companion of reason and guard of the passions thou art the bountiful rewarder of thy admirers and followers thine enemies praise thee and thy friends with rapturous pleasure raise up a panegyric in thy praise  o hunger hunger immortal hunger thou art the blessing of the poor the regale of the temperate rich and the delicious gust of the plainest morsel cursed is the man that has turned thee out of doors and at whose table thou art a stranger yea thrice cursed is he who always thirsts and hungers no more  the company and manner of living at harrogate    as to the company at these wells i found it very good and was pleased with the manner of living there in the daytime we drank the waters walked or rid about and lived in separate parties lodging in one or other of the three inns that are on the edge of the common but at night the company meet at one of the publichouses the inns having the benefit of the meeting in their turn and sup together between eight and nine oclock on the best substantial things such as hot shoulders of mutton rumpstakes hot pigeon pies vealcutlets and the like for this supper ladies and gentlemen pay eightpence each and after sitting an hour and drinking what wine punch and ale every one chooses all who please get up to countrydances which generally last till one in the morning those that dance and those who do not drinking as they will the ladies pay nothing for what liquor is brought in either at supper or after and it costs the gentlemen five or six shillings a man at one the ladies withdraw some to their houses in the neighborhood and some to their beds in the inns the men who are temperate do then likewise go to rest  in short of all the wells i know harrogate is in my opinion the most charming the waters are incomparable no air can be better and with the greatest civility cheerfulness and good humor there is a certain rural plainness and freedom mixed which are vastly pleasing the lady of pleasure the welldrest tailor and the gamester are not to be found there gentlemen of the country and women of birth and fortune their wives sisters and daughters are for the most part the company there were at least fourscore ladies in the countrydances every night while i was there and among them many fine women  the author meets at harrogate six gentlemen of his acquaintance from dublin    among the company i found at this agreeable place were six irish gentlemen who had been my contemporaries in trinitycollege dublin and were right glad to see me as we had been sociorums a word of swifts at the connivinghouse at ringsend for many a summers evening and their regard for me was great they thought i had been long numbered with the dead as they could not get any account of me for so many years and when they saw me at their entering the public room sitting by a beauty in deep discourse godzounds says one of them there he is making love to the finest woman in the world these gentlemen were mr gollogher mr gallaspy mr dunkley mr makins mr monaghan and mr okeefe descended from the irish kings and first cousin to the great okeefe who was buried not long ago in westminster abbey they were all men of large fortunes and mr makins excepted were as handsome fine fellows as could be picked out in all the world makins was a very low thin man not four feet high and had but one eye with which he squinted most shockingly he wore his own hair which was short and bad and only dressed by his combing it himself in the morning without oil or powder but as he was matchless on the fiddle sung well and chated agreeably he was a favorite with the ladies they preferred ugly makins as he was called to many very handsome men i will here give the public the character of these irish gentlemen for the honor of ireland and as they were curiosities of the human kind  the characters of six irish gentlemen okeefes character    okeefe was as distinguished a character as i have ever known he had read and thought traveled and conversed was a man of sense and a scholar he had a greatness of soul which showed a preeminence of dignity and by conduct and behavior the faithful interpreters of the heart always attested the noblest and most generous sentiments he had an extreme abhorrence of meanness of all kinds treachery revenge envy littleness of mind and showed in all his actions the qualities that adorn a man  his learning was of the genteel and useful kind a sort of agreeable knowledge which he acquired rather from a sound taste and good judgment than from the books he had read he had a right estimation of things and had gathered up almost every thing that is amusing or instructive this rendered him a master in the art of pleasing and as he had added to these improvements the fashionable ornaments of life languages and bodily exercises he was the delight of all that knew him  character of mr makins makins was possessed of all the excellent qualities and perfections that are within the reach of human abilities he had received from nature the happiest talents and he made singular improvements of them by a successful application to the most useful and most ornamental studies music as before observed he excelled in his intellectual faculties were fine and to his honor i can affirm that he mostly employed them as he did his great estate to the good of mankind the advancement of morality and the spread of pure theism the worship of god our savior who raised and sent christ to be a redeemer this gentleman was a zealous unitarian and though but five and twenty when we met at harrogate a religious man but his religion was without any melancholy nor had it any thing of that severity of temper which diffuses too often into the hearts of the religious a morose contempt of the world and an antipathy to the pleasures of it he avoided the assemblies of fools knaves and blockheads but was fond of good company and condemned that doctrine which taught men to retire from human society to seek god in the horrors of solitude he thought the almighty may be best found among men where his goodness is most active and his providence most employed  character of mr gallaspy gallaspy was the tallest and strongest man i have ever seen well made and very handsome he had wit and abilities sung well and talked with great sweetness and fluency but was so extremely wicked that it were better for him if he had been a natural fool by his vast strength and activity his riches and eloquence few things could withstand him he was the most profane swearer i have known fought every thing whored every thing and drank seven in a hand that is seven glasses so placed between the fingers of his right hand that in drinking the liquor fell into the next glasses and thereby he drank out of the first glass seven glasses at once this was a common thing i find from a book in my possession in the reign of charles the second in the madness that followed the restoration of that profligate and worthless prince but this gentleman was the only man i ever saw who could or would attempt to do it and he made but one gulp of whatever he drank he did not swallow a fluid like other people but if it was a quart poured it in as from pitcher to pitcher when he smoaked tobacco he always blew two pipes at once one at each corner of his mouth and threw the smoke of both out of his nostrils he had killed two men in duels before i left ireland and would have been hanged but that it was his good fortune to be tried before a judge who never let any man suffer for killing another in this manner this was the late sir john st ledger he debauched all the women he could and many whom he could not corrupt he ravished i went with him once in the stagecoach to kilkenny and seeing two pretty ladies pass by in their own chariot he swore in his horrible way having drank very hard after dinner that he would immediately stop them and ravish them nor was it without great difficulty that i hindered him from attempting the thing by assuring him i would be their protector and he must pass through my heart before he could proceed to offer them the least rudeness in sum i never saw his equal in impiety especially when inflamed with liquor as he was every day of his life though it was not in the power of wine to make him drunk weak or senseless he set no bounds or restrictions to mirth and revels he only slept every third night and that often in his clothes in a chair where he would sweat so prodigiously as to be wet quite through as wet as if come from a pond or a pail of water had been thrown on him while all the world was at rest he was either drinking or dancing scouring the bawdyhouses or riding as hard as he could drive his horse on some iniquitous project and yet he never was sick nor did he ever receive any hurt or mischief in health joy and plenty he passed life away and died about a year ago at his house in the county of galway without a pang or any kind of pain this was jack gallaspy there are however some things to be said in his favor and as he had more regard for me than any of his acquaintance i should be ungrateful if i did not do him all the justice in my power  he was in the first place far from being quarrelsome and if he fought a gentleman at the smallsword or boxed with a porter or coachman it was because he had in some degree been ill used or fancied that the laws of honor required him to call an equal to an account for a transaction his temper was naturally sweet  in the next place he was the most generous of mankind his purse of gold was ever at his friends service he was kind and good to his tenants to the poor a very great benefactor he would give more money away to the sick and distressed in one year than i believe many rich pious people do in seven he had the blessings of thousands for his charities and perhaps this procured him the protection of heaven  as to swearing he thought it was only criminal when it was false or men lied in their affirmations and for whoring he hoped there would be mercy since men will be men while there are women ravishing he did not pretend to justify as the laws of his country were against it but he could not think the woman was a sufferer by it as she enjoyed without sinning the highest felicity he intended her happiness and her saying no kept her an innocent  how far all this can excuse mr gallaspy i pretend not to determine but as i thought it proper to give the world the picture of so extraordinary a man it was incumbent on me as his friend to say all i could with truth in his vindication  character of mr dunkley dunkley had an extensive capacity an exquisite taste and a fine genius besides an erudition which denominates what we call a man of learning he happily possessed a social knowledge which rendered him agreeable to every body he was one of the men that are capable of touching every note to all the variety of topics for conversation the diversity of occurrences and incidents the several distinctions of persons he could adapt himself he would laugh like democritus weep like heraclitus he had the short pert trip of the affected the haughty tragic stalk of the solemn and the free genteel gait of the fine gentleman he was qualified to please all tastes and capable of acting every part he was grave gay a philosopher and a trifler he had a time for all things relative to society and his own true happiness but none for any thing repugnant to honor and conscience he was a surprising and admirable man  character of mr monaghan monaghan had genius and knowledge had read many books but knew more of mankind he laughed at the men who lost among their books the elegancy of mind so necessary in civil society he had no relish but for nice studies and fine literature and despised too serious and abstruse sciences this was reckoned a fault in him by several judges but with me it is a quere if he was much to blame politeness is certainly preferable to dry knowledge and thorny enquiries this gentlemans was such as rendered him for ever agreeable and engaging he was continually an improving friend and a gay companion in the qualities of his soul he was generous without prodigality humane without weakness just without severity and fond without folly he was an honest and charming fellow this gentleman and mr dunkley married ladies they fell in love with at harrogate wells dunkley had the fair alcmena miss cox of northumberland and monaghan antiope with haughty charms miss pearson of cumberland they lived very happy many years and their children i hear are settled in ireland  character of mr gollogher gollogher was a man of learning and extraordinary abilities he had read very hard for several years and during that time had collected and extracted from the best books more than any man i ever was acquainted with he had four vast volumes of commonplace royal paper bound in rough calf and had filled them with what is most curious and beautiful in works of literature most refined in eloquent discourses most poignant in books of criticism most instructive in history most touching and affecting in news catastrophes and stories and with aphorisms sayings and epigrams a prodigious memory made all this his own and a great judgment enabled him to reduce every thing to the most exact point of truth and accuracy a rare man till he was five and twenty he continued this studious life and but seldom went into the mixed and fashionable circles of the world then all at once he sold every book he had and determined to read no more he spent his every day in the best company of every kind and as he had the happy talent of manner and possessed that great power which strikes and awakens fancy by giving every subject the new dress and decoration it requires  could make the most common thing no longer trivial when in his hand and render a good thing most exquisitely pleasing  as he told a story beyond most men and had in short a universal means toward a universal success it was but natural that he should be every where liked and wished for he charmed wherever he came the specific i have mentioned made every one fond of him with the ladies especially he was a great favorite and more fortunate in his amors than any man i knew had he wanted the fine talents he was blessed with yet his being an extremely handsome man and a master on the fiddle could not but recommend him to the sex he might if he had pleased have married any one of the most illustrious and richest women in the kingdom but he had an aversion to matrimony and could not bear the thought of a wife love and a bottle were his taste he was however the most honorable of men in his amors and never abandoned any woman to distress as too many men of fortune do when they have gratified desire all the distressed were ever sharers in mr golloghers fine estate and especially the girls he had taken to his breast he provided happily for them all and left nineteen daughters he had by several women a thousand pounds each this was acting with a temper worthy of a man and to the memory of the benevolent tom gollogher i devote this memorandum  having said above that too many men of fortune abandon the girls they have ruined i will here relate a very remarkable story in hopes it may make an impression on some rake of fortune if such a man should ever take this book in his hand  the history of the unfortunate miss hunt    as i traveled once in the county of kildare in ireland in the summertime i came into a land of flowers and blossoms hills woods and shades i saw upon an eminence a house surrounded with the most agreeable images of rural beauties and which appeared to be on purpose placed in that decorated spot for retirement and contemplation it is in such silent recesses of life that we can best enjoy the noble and felicitous ideas which more immediately concern the attention of man and in the cool hours of reflection secreted from the fancies and follies the business the faction and the pleasures of an engaged world thoroughly consider the wisdom and harmony of the works of nature the important purposes of providence and the various reasons we have to adore that ever glorious being who formed us for rational happiness here and after we have passed a few years on this sphere in a life of virtue and charity to translate us to the realms of endless bliss happy they who have a taste for these silent retreats and when they please can withdraw for a time from the world  the picture of miss hunt the owner of this sweet place was mr charles hunt a gentleman of a small estate and good sense whom i knew many years before fortune led me to his house his wife was then dead and he had but one child left his daughter elizabeth the beauties of this young lady were very extraordinary she had the finest eyes in the world and she looked she smiled she talked with such diffusive charms as were sufficient to fire the heart of the morosest womanhater that ever lived and give his soul a softness it never felt before her father took all possible pains to educate her mind and had the success to render her understanding a wonder when she was but twenty years old she sung likewise beyond most women danced to perfection and had every accomplishment of soul and body that a man of the best taste could wish for in a wife or a mistress she was all beauty life and softness  mr hunt thought to have had great happiness in this daughter though it was not in his power to give her more than five hundred pounds for a fortune and she would have been married to a countrygentleman in his neighborhood of a good estate had not death carried off both her father and lover in a few days just as the match was agreed on this was a sad misfortune and opened a door to a long train of sorrows for two years however after the decease of her father she lived very happily with an old lady her near relation and was universally admired and respected i saw her many times during that term at the old ladys villa within a few miles of dublin and took great delight in her company if i had not been then engaged to another i would most certainly have married her  in this way i left eliza in ireland and for several years could not hear what was become of her no one could give me any information but about a twelvemonth ago as i was walking in fleet street i saw a woman who cleaned shoes and seemed to be an object of great distress she was in rags and dirt beyond all i had ever seen of the profession and was truly skin and bone her face was almost a scull and the only remaining expression to be seen was despair and anguish the object engaged my attention not only on account of the uncommon misery that was visible but as her eyes though sunk were still extraordinary and there were some remains of beauty to be traced i thought i had somewhere seen that face in better condition this kept me looking at her unnoticed for near a quarter of an hour and as i found she turned her head from me when she saw me with a kind of consciousness as if she knew me i then asked her name and if she had any where seen me before  the tears immediately ran plentifully from her eyes and when she could speak she said i am elizabeth hunt  what mr hunts daughter of rafarlin i replied with amazement and a concern that brought the tears into my eyes i called a coach immediately and took her to the house of a good woman who lodges and attends sick people ordered her clean clothes and gave the woman a charge to take the greatest care of her and let her want for nothing proper till i called next day  when i saw her again she was clean and whole and seemed to have recovered a little though very little of what she once was but a more miserable spectacle my eyes have not often seen she told me that soon after i went to england mr r a gentleman of my acquaintance of great fortune got acquainted with her courted her and swore in the most solemn manner by the supreme power and the everlasting gospel that he would be her husband and marry her as soon as a rich dying uncle had breathed his last if she would consent in the mean while to their living in secret as man and wife for his uncle hated matrimony and would not leave him his vast fortune if he heard he had a wife and he was sure if he was married by any of the church some whisperer would find it out and bring it to his ear but notwithstanding this plausible story and that he acted the part of the fondest and tenderest man that ever lived yet for several months she would not comply with his proposal she refused to see him any more and for several weeks he did not come in her sight  the fatal night however at last arrived and from the lord mayors ball he prevailed on her by repeated vows of sincerity and truth to come with him to his lodgings she was undone with child and at the end of two months she never saw him more when her relations saw her big belly they turned her out of doors her friends and acquaintance would not look at her and she was so despised and ashamed to be seen that she went to england with her little one it fortunately died on the road to london and as her five hundred pounds were going fast by the time she had been a year in the capital she accepted an offer made her by a great man to go into keeping three years she lived with him in splendour and when he died she was with several in high life till she got a cancer in her breast and after it was cut off an incurable abscess appeared this struck her out of society and as she grew worse and worse every day what money she had and clothes were all gone in four years time in the relief she wanted and in support she came the fifth year to a garret and rags and at last to clean shoes or perish for want she then uncovered the upper part of her body which was half eaten away so as to see into the trunk and rendered her in the emaciated condition she was in an object shocking to behold she lived in torment and had no kind of ease or peace but in reflecting that her misery and distress might procure her the mercy of heaven hereafter and in conjunction with her true repentance bring her to rest when she had passed through the grave and gate of death  such was the case of that venus of her sex miss hunt  when first i saw her it was rapture to be in her company her person matchless and her conversation as charming as her person both easy unconstrained and beautiful to perfection  when last i saw her she was grim as the skeleton horrid loathsome and sinking fast into the grave by the laws of corruption what a change was there she lived but three months from the time i put her into a lodging and died as happy a penitent as she had lived an unhappy woman i gave her a decent private funeral a hearse and one mourningcoach in which i alone attended her remains to the earth the great charnelhouse where all the human race must be deposited here ends the story of miss hunt  a word or two to mr r who debauched miss hunt and now a word or two to the man who ruined her bob r is still living the master of thousands and has thought no more of the wretched eliza than if her ruin and misery were a trifle he fancies his riches and and power will screen him from the hand of justice and afford him lasting satisfaction but cruel man after this short day the present life the night of death comes and your unrelenting soul must then appear before a judge infinitely knowing and righteous who is not to be imposed upon and cannot be biassed the sighs and groans of eliza will then be remembered and confound and abash you for your falsehood and inhumanity to this unhappy woman in your last agony her ghost will haunt you and at the sessions of righteousness appear against you execrable r r  the author falls in love with miss spence    but to return to harrogate while i was there it was my fortune to dance with a lady who had the head of aristotle the heart of a primitive christian and the form of venus de medicis this was miss spence of westmoreland i was not many hours in her company before i became most passionately in love with her i did all i could to win her heart and at last asked her the question but before i inform my readers what the consequence of this was i must take some notice of what i expect from the critical reviewers these gentlemen will attempt to raise the laugh our moralist they will say has buried three wives running and they are hardly cold in their graves before he is dancing like a buck at the wells and plighting vows to a fourth girl the beauty miss spence an honest fellow this suarez as pascal says of that jesuit in his provincial letters  an apology for the authors marrying so often to this i reply that i think it unreasonable and impious to grieve immoderately for the dead a decent and proper tribute of tears and sorrow humanity requires but when that duty has been paid we must remember that to lament a dead woman is not to lament a wife a wife must be a living woman the wife we lose by death is no more than a sad and empty object formed by the imagination and to be still devoted to her is to be in love with an idea it is a mere chimerical passion as the deceased has no more to do with this world than if she had existed before the flood as we cannot restore what nature has destroyed it is foolish to be faithful to affliction  nor is this all if the woman we marry has the seven qualifications which every man would wish to find in a wife beauty discretion sweetness of temper a sprightly wit fertility wealth and noble extraction yet deaths snatching so amiable a wife from our arms can be no reason for accusing fate of cruelty that is providence of injustice nor can it authorize us to sink into insensibility and neglect the duty and business of life this wife was born to die and we receive her under the condition of mortality she is lent but for a term the limits of which we are not made acquainted with and when this term is expired there can be no injustice in taking her back nor are we to indulge the transports of grief to distraction but should look out for another with the seven qualifications as it is not good for man to be alone and as he is by the abrahamic covenant bound to carry on the succession in a regular way if it be in his power  nor is this all if the woman adorned with every natural and acquired excellence is translated from this gloomy planet to some better world to be a sharer of the divine favor in that peaceful and happy state which god has prepared for the virtuous and faithful must it not be senseless for me to indulge melancholy and continue a mourner on her account while she is breathing the balmy air of paradise enjoying pure and radiant vision and beyond description happy  in the next place as i had forfeited my fathers favor and estate for the sake of christiandeism and had nothing but my own honest industry to secure me daily bread it was necessary for me to lay hold of every opportunity to improve my fortune and of consequence do my best to gain the heart of the first rich young woman who came in my way after i had buried a wife it was not fit for me to sit snivelling for months because my wife died before me which was at least as probable as that she should be the survivor but instead of solemn affliction and the inconsolable part for an event i foresaw it was incumbent on me after a little decent mourning to consecrate myself to virtue and good fortune united in the form of a woman whenever she appeared it was my business to get her if i could this made me sometimes a dancer at the wells in the days of my youth  miss spences reply to my addresses    as to miss spence she was not cruel but told me at last after i had tired her with my addresses and petitions that she would consider my case and give me an answer when i called at her house in westmoreland to which she was then going at present however to tell me the truth she had very little inclination to change her condition she was as happy as she could wish to be and she had observed that many ladies of her acquaintance had been made unhappy by becoming wives the husband generally proves a very different man from the courtier and it is luck indeed if a young woman by marrying is not undone  during the mollia tempora fandi as the poet calls it the man may charm when like the god of eloquence he pleads and every word is soft as flakes of falling snow but when the man is pleased to take off the mask and play the domestic hero gods what miseries have i seen in families ensue if this were my case i should run stark mad  miss spences mentioning the memorable line from virgil surprised me not a little as she never gave the least hint before though we had conversed then a fortnight of her having any notion of the latin tongue and i looked at her with a raised admiration before i replied in the following manner  what you say miss spence is true but this is far from being the case of all gentlemen if there be something stronger than virtue in too many of them something that masters and subdues it a passion or passions rebellious and lawless which makes them neglect some high relations and take the throne from god and reason gaming drinking keeping yet there are very many exceptions i am sure i know several who have an equal affection to goodness and were my acquaintance in the world larger than it is i believe i could name a large number who would not prefer indulgence to virtue or resign her for any consideration there are men madam and young men who allow a partial regard to rectitude is inconsistent and absurd and are sensible it is not certain that there is absolutely nothing at all in the evidences of religion that if there was but even a chance for obtaining blessings of inestimable worth yet a chance for eternal bliss is worth securing by acting as the spotless holiness of the deity requires from us and the reason and fitness of things makes necessary in respect of every kind of relation and neighbor this is the case of many men they are not so generally bad as you seem to think  on the other hand i would ask if there are no unhappy marriages by the faults of women are all the married ladies consistently and thoroughly good that is effectually so do they all yield themselves entirely and universally to the government of conscience subdue every thing to it and conquer every adverse passion and inclination has reason always ways the sovereignty and nothing wrong to be seen are truth piety and goodness the settled prevailing regard in the hearts and lives of all the married ladies you know have you heard of no unhappy marriages by the passions and vices of women as well as by the faults of men i am afraid there are too many wives as subject to ill habits as the men can be it is possible to name not a few ladies who find their virtuous exercises the duties of piety and the various offices of love and goodness as distasteful and irksome to them as they can be to a libertine or a cruel man i could tell some sad stories to this purpose but all i shall say more is that there are faults on both sides and that it is not only the ladies run a hazard of being ruined by marrying i am sure there are as many men of fortune miserable by the manners and conduct of their wives as you can name ladies who are sufferers by the temper and practice of their husbands this is the truth of the case and the business is in order to avoid the miseries we both have seen among married people to resolve to act well and wisely this is the thing to be sure miss spence replied this will prevent faults on either side such a course as virtue and piety require must have a continued tendency to render life a scene of the greatest happiness and it may gain infinitely hereafter  call upon me then at cleator as soon as you can miss spence concluded with her face in smiles and we will talk over this affair again thus we chatted as we dined together in private and early the next morning miss spence left the wells  may    a remove to oldfieldspaw for a week on account of an indisposition    miss spence being gone from harrogate and finding myfelf very ill from having drank too hard the preceding night i mounted my horse and rid to oldfieldspaw a few miles off as i had heard an extraordinary account of its usefulness after a debauch there is not so much as a little alehouse there to rest at and for six days i lodged at the cottage of a poor laboring man to which my informer directed me i lived on such plain fare as he had for himself bread and roots and milk and water were my chief support and for the time i was as happy as i could wish  a reflection at solitary oldfieldspaw after a nights hard drinking o nature nature would man be satisfied with thee and follow thy wife dictates he would constantly enjoy that true pleasure which advances his real happiness and very rarely be tormented with those evils which obstruct and destroy it but alas instead of listening to the voice of reason keeping the mind free of passions and living as temperance and discretion direct the man of pleasure will have all the gratifications of sense to as high a pitch as an imagination and fortune devoted to them can raise them and diseases and calamities are the consequence fears and anxieties and disappointments are often the attendants and too frequently the ruin of health and estate of reputation and honor and the lasting wound of remorse in reflection follow this is generally the case of the voluptuary dreadful case he runs the course of pleasure first and then the course of produced evils succeed he passes from pleasure to a state of pain and the pleasure past gives a double sense of that pain we ought then surely as reasonable beings to confine our pleasure within the bounds of just and right  a description of oldfieldspaw   0 as to the place called oldfieldspaw it is seven miles from harrogate and four from rippon lies on a rising ground between two high hills near an old abbey about five yards from a running stream and in a most romantic delightful situation which resembles matlock in derbyshire ten miles beyond derby in the peak so very much that one might almost take it for the same place if conveyed there in a long deep sleep the same kind of charms and various beauties are every where to be seen rocks and mountains groves and valleys tender shrubs and purling currents at once surprise and please the wandering eye  an account of oldfieldspawwater as to the mineral water at oldfieldspaw it is an impetuous spring that throws out a vast quantity of water and is always of the same height neither affected by rain or drought it is bright and sparkling and when poured into a glass rises up in rows like strings of little beads it has an uncommon taste quite different from all other mineral waters that ever came in my way but it is not disagreeable what impregnates it i know not dr rutty i suppose never heard of this water for it is not in his valuable quarto lately published and dr short in his excellent history of mineral waters   volumes   to london      says little more than that there is a medicinal spring there what i found upon trial is that two quarts of it swallowed as fast as i could drink it in a morning vomits to great advantage and that four quarts of it drank by degrees at intervals works off by siege or stool and urine in a very beneficial manner i was apprehensive of a high fever from my nights hard drinking at harrogate which i could not avoid and the oldfieldwater operating as related carried off the bad symptoms and restored me to sanity in two days time this is all i can say of this fine water it is very little in respect of what it deserves to have said of it  an observation on our people of fortune going to other countries to drink mineral waters     by the way it is to me a matter of great admiration that so many of our rich and noble not only endure the fatigues and hazards of sailing and traveling to remote countries but waste their money to drink spawwaters abroad when they can have as good of every kind in england by fiding a few miles to the most delightful places in the world in summer time our own country has healing waters equal to the best in france italy and westphalia harrogatewater in particular has all the virtues of the famous baths of aponus within a mile of padua in italy and is in every respect exactly alike see the analysis of aponuswater by fallopius and baccius and the analysis of the english sulphurspaw by dr rutty it is injustice then to our country to visit foreign nations upon this account  moffatwaters likewise are as good as any in all the world  of moffatwells n b moffat is a village in annandale    miles sw of edinburgh the mineral waters called moffatwaters lie at the distance of a long mile northward from the village and are    miles from edinburgh the springs are situated on the declivity of a hill and on the brow of a precipice with high mountains at a distance and almost on every side of them the hill is the second from hartfield adjoining the highest hill in scotland  a vein of spar runs for several miles on this range of hills and forms the bottom and lower sides of the wells it is a greyish spar having polished and shining surfaces of regular figures interspersed with glittering particles of a golden color which are very copious and large  there are two medicinal springs or wells which are separated from one another by a small rock the higher well lies with its mouth south east it is of an irregular square figure and is about a foot and a half deep the lower well is surrounded with naked rocks it forms a small arch of a circle its depth is four foot and a half and by a moderate computation the two springs yield  0 loads of water in    hours each load containing    or    scotch pints a scotch pint is two english quarts  the higher shallow well is used for bathing as it is not capable of being kept so clean as the lower well on account of the shallowness and the looseness of its parts  these waters are strongly sulphurous and resemble the scourings of a foul gun or rotten eggs or a weak solution of sal polychrestum or hepar sulphuris the color of the water somewhat milky or bluish  n b the soil on every side of the wells is thin and the hills rocky only just below the wells there is a small moss caused by the falling of water from the hill above it  virtues of these waters great is the medicinal virtue of these waters in relieving inwardly cholics pains in the stomach griping of the guts bilious and nephritic colics nervous and hysteric colics the gravel by carrying off the quantities of sand but does not dissolve the slimy gravel clearing the urinary passages in a wonderful manner in curing ischuries and ulcerated kidneys the gout the palsy obstructions of the menses old gleets and barrenness it is a sovereign remedy in rheumatic and scorbutic pains even when the limbs are monstrously swelled useless and covered with scales  outwardly ulcers tumors itch st anthonys fire and kings evil  the waters are used by bathing and drinking to drink in the morning three chopins six pints or a scotch quart four english quarts at most between the hours of six and eleven after dinner to drink gradually  medicines commonly used during the drinking of the waters are an emetic or two at first and a few cathartic doses the doses sal glauberi and polychrestum syrup of buckthorn and sulphur is used along with the water  but the cathartic prescription most in use which was given by an eminent physician for a general recipe to be taken by all who should at any time use the water is pills that are a composition of gambozia resin of jalop aloes and scammony these to all intents are a strong hydragogue  the large vein of spar three feet thick runs in one direction for six miles to the wells and crosses obliquely the rivulet at the bottom of the precipice and ascends the hill on the opposite side small veins of the same spar which appears on the precipices are on the side of the rivulet and six small gushes of water of the mineral kind proceed from them the rocks and stones about the tops of the wells and in other parts of the hill and precipices differ not from common stones no more than the water of the small springs in the neighborhood with the common water  the virtue of this water was discovered by miss whiteford daughter of bishop whiteford in      she was married in      she had been abroad and all over england drinking mineral waters for the recovery of her health but found little benefit till by accident she tasted these waters in her neighborhood and finding they resembled those she had used elsewhere made a trial of them and was cured of all her disorders  upon this she recommended the use of them to others and employed workmen to clear the ground about the springs their overflowing having made a small morass that the poor and the rich might come and make use of a medicine which nature had so bounteously offered to them  the author leaves oldfieldspaw and sets out for knaresborough but arrives at another place may             the   th of may at that hour when a fine daybreak offers the most magnificent sight to the eyes of men though few who have eyes will deign to view it i mounted my horse again and intended to breakfast at knareshorough in order to my being at harrogate by dinner time with my friends again but the land i went over was so inchantingly romantic and the morning so extremely beautiful that i had a mind to see more of the country and let my horse trot on where he pleased for a couple of hours he went slowly over the hills as his inclination directed him and i was delightfully entertained with the various fine scenes till i arrived at a sweet pretty country seat  a morning thought on the rising sun the rising sun which i had directly before me struck me very strongly in the fine situation i was in for observing it with the power and wisdom of the author of nature and gave me such a charming degree of evidence for the deity that i could not but offer up in silence on the altar of my heart praise and adoration to that sovereign and universal mind who produced this glorious creature as the bright image of his benignity and makes it travel unweariedly round not only to illustrate successively the opposite sides of this globe and thereby enliven the animal world support the vegetable and ripen and prepare matter for all the purposes of life and vegetation but to enlighten and cheer surrounding worlds by a perpetual diffusion of bounties to dispel darkness and sorrow and like the presence of the deity infuse secret ravishment into the heart this cannot be the production of chance it must be the work of an infinitely wise and good being the nature situation and motion of this sun bring the deity even within the reach of the methods of sense assisted by reason and shows such constant operations of his power and goodness that it is impossible to consider the present disposition of the system without being full of a sense of love and gratitude to the almighty creator  the parent of being and of beauty by this returning minister of his beneficence all things are recalled into life from corruption and decay and by its and all the other heavenly motions the whole frame of nature is still kept in repair his name then alone is excellent and his glory above the earth and heaven it becomes the whole system of rationals to say hallelujah  section vi come cheerfulness triumphant fair shine

may         a description of a beautiful spot of ground and a sweet pretty country seat in the west riding of yorkshire    while i was thinking in this manner of the sun and the author of it i came into a silent unfrequented glade that was finely adorned with streams and trees nature there seemed to be lulled into a kind of pleasing repose and conspired as it were to soften a speculative genius into solid and awful contemplations the woods the meadows and the water formed the most delightful scenes and the charms of distant prospects multiplied as i traveled on but at last i came to a seat which had all the beauties that proportion regularity and convenience can give a thing the pretty mansion was situated in the midst of meadows and surrounded with gardens trees and various shades a fountain played to a great height before the door and fell into a circular reservoir of water that had foreign wildfowl swimming on its surface the whole was very fine  here i walked for some time and after roaming about went up to the house to admire the beauties of the thing i found the windows open and could see several ladies in one of the apartments how to gain admittance was the question and i began to contrive many ways but while i was busied in this kind of speculation a genteel footman came up to me and let me know his lady sent him to inform me i might walk in and look at the house if i pleased so in i went and passed through several grand rooms all finely furnished and filled with paintings of great price in one of those chambers the servant left me and told me he would wait upon me again in a little time this surprised me and my astonishment was doubled when i had remained alone for almost an hour an account of two wonderful figures which played on the german flute no footman returned nor culd i hear the sound of any feet but i was charmingly entertained all the while in the apartment i was left in were two figures dressed like a shepherd and shepherdess which amazed me very much they sat on a rich couch in a gay alcove and both played on the german flute they moved their heads their arms their eyes their fingers and seemed to look with a consciousness at each other while they breathed at my entering the room that fine piece of music the masquerade minuet and afterward several excellent pieces i thought at first they were living creatures but on examination finding they were only wood my admiration increased and became exceeding great when i saw by shutting their mouths and stopping their fingers that the music did not proceed from an organ within the figures it was an extraordinary piece of clockwork invented and made by one john nixon a poor man  the history of miss wolf    at length however a door was opened and a lady entered who was vastly pretty and richly dressed beyond what i had ever seen she had diamonds enough for a queen i was amazed at the sight of her and wondered still more when after being honored with a low courtesy on my bowing to her she asked me in irish how i did and how long i had been in england my surprise was so great i could not speak and upon this she said in the same language i see sir you have no remembrance of me you cannot recollect the least idea of me you have quite forgot young imoinda of the county of gallway in ireland who was your partner in country dances when you passed the christmas of the year      at her fathers house what i said miss wolf of balineskay o my imoinda and snatching her to my arms i almost stifled her with kisses i was so glad to see her again and in the situation she appeared in that i could not help expressing my joys in that tumultuous manner and hoped she would excuse her valentine as i then remembered i had had that honor when we were both very young  this lady who was good humor itself in flesh and blood was so far from being angry at this strange flight of mine that she only laughed excessively at the oddness of the thing but some ladies who came into the apartment with her seemed frightened and at a loss what to think till she cleared up the affair to them by letting them know who i was and how near her father and mine lived to each other in the country of ireland she was indeed extremely glad to see me and from her heart bid me welcome to clankford our meeting was a vast surprise to both of us she thought i had been in the elysian fields as she had heard nothing of me for several years and i little imagined i should ever find her in england in the rich condition she was in she asked me by what destiny i was brought to yorkshire and in return for my short story gave me an account of herself at large till the bell rung for dinner we sat talking together and then went down to as elegant a one as i had ever seen there were twelve at table six young ladies all very handsome and six gentlemen good humor presided and in a rational delightful cheerfulness we passed some hours away after coffee we went to cards and from them to country dances as two of the footmen played well on the fiddle the charming imoinda was my partner and as they all did the dances extremely well we were as happy a little set as ever footed it to country measure two weeks i passed in this fine felicity then we all separated and went different ways what became of miss wolf after this  the extraordinary events of her life  and the stories of the five ladies with her  i shall relate in the second volume of my memoirs of several ladies of great britain four of them were mrs cheslin mrs fanshaw mrs chadley and mrs bissel the fifth was miss farmor all mentioned in the preface to the first volume of my memoirs aforesaid may         an account of oliver wincup esquire      a fortnight as said i stayed with miss wolf that was but at the time i am speaking of the relict of sir loghlin fitzgibbons an old irish knight who was immensely rich and married her when he was creeping upon allfours with snow on his head and frost in his bones that he might lie by a naked beauty and gaze at that awful spot he had no power to enjoy i did intend on leaving this lady to be at knaresborough at night but the fates for a while took me another way at the inn where i dined i became acquainted with a gentleman much of my own age who was an ingenious agreeable man this was oliver wincup esquire who had lately married miss horner of northumberland a fine young creature and a great fortune this gentleman by his good humor and several good songs pleased me so much that i drank more than i intended and was easily prevailed on to go with him in the evening to woodcester the name of his seat which was but ten miles from the house we had dined at we came in just as they were going to tea there was a great deal of company at least a dozen ladies besides half a score gentlemen and all of them as gay and engaging as the bestbred young mortals could be  a description of woodcester house    the vill here was very odd but a charming pretty thing the house consisted of several ground rooms ten i think detached from one another and separated by trees and banks of flowers they were entirely of wood but finely put together and all disposed with the greatest symmetry and beauty they were very handsome without side and the inside furnished and adorned with the finest things the owner could get for money easy hills little valleys and pretty groves surrounded the sweet retreat and the valleys were watered with clear streams the whole had a fine appearance the varied scenes for ever pleased  the manner of living at woodcester    at this delightful place i stayed ten days and was very happy indeed we drank we laughed we danced we sung and chatted and when that was done twas night but country dances were the chief diversion and i had a partner who was not only a wonder in face and person divinely pretty but did wonders in every motion this was miss veyssiere of cumberland the dear creature reader when i was a young fellow there were few could equal me in dancing the famous paddy murphy an irish member of the house of commons commonly called the little beau well known at lucass coffeehouse dublin he danced one night in      that i was at the castle before the late duke of dorset and his duchess at their graces request this gentleman and langham the miller who danced every night at the renowned stretchs puppetshew before the curtain was drawn up were both deservedly admired for their performance in the hornpipe yet were nothing to me in this particular but miss veyssiere outdid me far her steps were infinite and she did them with that amazing agility that she seemed like a dancing angel in the air eight nights we footed it together and all the company said we were born for each other she did charm me and i should have asked her the question to try her temper if wincup had not told me her father intended to sacrifice her to a man old enough to be her grandfather for the sake of a great jointure and in a week or two she was to dance the reel of bogee with an old monk  poor miss veyssiere i said what connection can there be between the hoary churl and you  while side by side the blushing maid shrinks from his visage half afraid i do not wish you may feather him but may you bury him very quickly and be happy  an account of a company of stroling players at woodcester    another of our diversions at woodcester was a little company of singers and dancers mr wincup had hired to perform in a sylvan theater he had in his gardens these people did the mime the dance the song extremely well there was among them one miss hinxworth a charming young creature who excelled in every thing but in singing especially had no equal i believe in the world she was a gentlemans daughter and had been carried off by one o regan an irishman and dancing master the head of this company he was the most active fellow upon earth and the best harlequin i have ever seen every evening we had something or other extraordinary from these performers he gave us two pieces which so nearly resembled the two favorite entertainments called harlequin sorcerer and the genii though in several particulars better that i cannot help thinking mr rich owed his harlequin sorcerer to o regan and that the genii of drury lane was the invention of this irishman  you know reader that in the first scene of harlequin sorcerer there is a group of witches at their orgies in a wilderness by moonlight and that harlequin comes riding in the air between two witches upon a long pole here o regan did what was never attempted at covent garden house and what no other man in the world i believe did ever do as the witches danced round and round hand in hand as swift as they could move o regan leaped upon the shoulder of one of them and for near a quarter of an hour jumped the contrary way as fast as they went round all their shoulders this was a fine piece of activity i think it much more wonderful than to keep at the top of the outwheel of a watermill by jumping there as it goes with the greatest rapidity round this mun hawley an account of mr hawley of lochgur of lochgur in the county of tipperary could do he was a charming fellow in body and mind and fell unfortunately in the   d year of his age in a plain field by a trip of his horse he came down and fractured his skull he did not think he was hurt but at night as soon as he began to eat it came up a surgeon was sent for to look at his head it was cracked in several places and he died the next day he and i were near friends  june        the author leaves woodcester and rides to a lone silent place called lasco    the first of june      at five in the morning i took my leave of honest wincup as cheerful and worthy a fellow as ever lived and set out for knaresborough but lost my way went quite wrong and in three hours time came to a little blind alehouse the sign of the cat and bagpipe in a lone silent place the master of this small inn was one tom clancy brother to the wellknown martin clancy in dublin he came to england to try his fortune as he told me and married an old woman who kept this publichouse the sign of the cat to which tom added the bagpipe as he had been a waiter at his brothers house he remembered to have seen me often there and was rejoiced at my arrival at the cat and bagpipe he got me a good supper of trouts fine ale and a squib of punch and after he had done talking of all the gallant fellows that used to resort to his brother martins such as the heroes of trinitycollege dublin captain maccan of the county of kerry and many more he let me go to sleep  the history of the two beauties in the wood    the next morning betimes i was up and walked into a wood adjoining to clancys house i sauntered on for about an hour easily enough but at last came to a part of the forest that was almost impenetrable curiosity incited me to struggle onwards if possible that i might see what country was before me or if any house was to be found in this gloomy place this cost me a couple of hours much toil and many scratches but at length i arrived at the edge of a barren moor and beyond it about a quarter of a mile off saw another wood proud to be daring on i went and soon came to the wood in view which i found cut into walks and arrived at a circular space surrounded with a forest that was above a hundred yards every way in the center of this was a house enclosed within a very broad deep mote full of water and the banks on the inside all round were so thick planted with trees that there was no seeing any thing of the mansion but the roof and the chimnies over the water was one narrow drawbridge lifted up and a strong door on the garden side of the mote round i walked several times but no soul could i see not the least noise could i hear nor was there a cottage any where in view i wondered much at the whole and if i had had my lad o finn with me and my pole i would most certainly have attempted to leap the fosse broad as it was and if it was possible have known who were the occupants of this strange place but as nothing could be done nor any information be had i returned again to the cat and bagpipe  character of mr jeremiah cock an old lawyer it was ten by the time i got back and at breakfast i told clancy my landlord where i had been and asked him if he knew who lived in that wonderful place his name he replied is cock an old lawyer and limb of the devil and the most hideous man to behold that is upon the face of the earth every thing that is bad and shocking is in his compound he is to outward appearance a monster and within the miser the oppressor the villain he is despised and abhorred but so immensely rich that he can do any thing and no one is able to contend with him i could relate says tom a thousand instances of his injustice and cruelty but one alone is sufficient to render his memory for ever cursed two gentlemen of fortune who had employed him several years in their affairs and had a good opinion of him on account of a canted uprightness and seeming piety left him sole guardian of a daughter each of them had and the management of fifty thousand pounds apiece the fortune of these girls with power to do as he pleased without being subject to any control till they are of age these ladies as fine creatures as ever the eye of man beheld he has had now a year in confinement in that prison you saw in the wood and while he lives will keep them there to be sure on account of the hundred thousand pounds or till he dispose of them to his own advantage some way or other he intends them it is said for two ugly nephews he has who are now at school about fourteen years old and for this purpose or some other as bad never suffers them to stir out of the garden surrounded by the mote nor lets any human creature visit them they are greatly to be pitied but bear the severe usage wonderfully well one of them miss martha tilston is in her twentieth year and the other miss alithea llansoy in her nineteenth they are girls of great sense and would if any kind of opportunity offered make a brave attempt to escape but that seems impossible they are not only so strictly confined and he for ever at home with them except he rides a few miles but are attended continually in the garden when they walk by a servant who is well paid and devoted to the old man her master this makes them think their state is fixed for life and to get rid of melancholy they read and practice music they both play on the fiddle and do it extremely fine  here clancy had done and i was much more surprised at his relation than at the place of their residence which i had seen i became very thoughtful and continued for some time with my eyes fixed on the table while i revolved the case of these unfortunate young ladies but is all this true at last i said or only report how did you get such particular information  i will tell you tom answered old cock is my landlord and business often brings me to his house in the wood to pay my rent or ask for something i want besides i sometimes bring a fat pig there and other things to fell my daughter likewise has sometimes a piece of work in hand for the ladies and she and i take a walk with it there by a better and shorter way than you went you cannot think how glad they are to see us and they let me into all their perplexities and distress  on hearing this a sudden thought of being serviceable to these ladies came into my head and i was going to ask a question in relation to it when two horsemen rode up to the door and one of them called house this says my landlord is old cock and his man and immediately went out to him to know his will he told him he came for the ridesake himself to see if any letters were left for him by that days post at his house and would dine with him if he had any thing to eat that i have the man replied as fine a fowl bacon and greens as ever was served up to any table and only one gentleman a stranger and traveller to sit down to it cock upon this came into the room i was sitting in and after looking very earnestly at me said your servant sir i told him i was his most humble and right glad to meet with a gentleman for society in that lone place i immediately began a story of a cock and a bull and made the old fellow grin now and then i informed him among other things that i was traveling to westmoreland to look after some estates i had there but must hurry back to london very soon for my wife was within a few weeks of her time you are a married man then sir he replied yes indeed and so supremely blessed with the charms and perfections the fondness and obedience of a wife that i would not be unmarried for all the world few men living so happy as i am in the nuptial state  here dinner was brought in and to save the old gentleman trouble i would cut up the fowl i helped him plentifully to a slice of the breast and the tips of the wings and picked out for him the tenderest greens i was as complaisant as it was possible and drank his health many times the bottle after dinner i put about pretty quick and told my old gentleman if affairs ever brought him up to london i should be glad to see him at my house in goldensquare the very next door to sir john heirs or if i could be of any service to him there he would oblige me very much by letting me know in what way in short i so buttered him with words and filled him with fowl and wine that he seemed well pleased especially when he found there was nothing to pay as i informed him it was my own dinner i had bespoke and dined with double pleasure in having the satisfaction of his most agreeable company he was a fine politician i said and talked extremely well of the government and the times that i had received more true knowledge from his just notions than from all i had read of men and things or from conversing with any one the glass during this time was not long still but in such toasts as i found were grateful to his jacobite heart drank brimmers as fast as opportunity served and he pledged me and cottoned in a very diverting way he grew very fond of me at last and hoped i would spare so much time as to come and dine with him the next day this honor i assured him i would do myself and punctually be with him at his hour he then rid off brim full and i walked out to consider of this affair but before i proceed any farther in my story i must give a description of this man  a description of old cock the lawyer cock the old lawyer and guardian was a low man about four feet eight inches very broad and near seventy years old he was humped behind to an enormous degree and his belly as a vast flasket of garbage projected monstrously before he had the most hanging look i have ever seen his brows were prodigious and frowning in a shocking manner his eyes very little and above an inch within his head his nose hooked like a buzzard wide nostrils like a horse and his mouth sparrow in this case was a mind quite cunning in the worst sense of the word acute artful designing and base there was not a spark of honor or generosity in his soul  how to circumvent this able one and deliver the two beauties from his oppressive power was the question it seemed almost impossible but i resolved to do my best this i told clancy and requested as i was to dine with cock the next day that he would be there in the morning on some pretense or other and let the ladies know i offered them my service without any other view than to do them good and if they accepted it to inform me by a note slipped into my hand when they saw me that if they could direct me what to do i would execute it at any hazard or let them hint the least particular that might have any tendency to their freedom in some time to come though it were three months off and i would wait for the moment and study to improve the scheme this my landlord very carefully acquainted them with at the time i mentioned and by two oclock i was at cocks house to see these beauties and know what they thought of the service offered them the old man received me much civiler than i thought he would do when he was sober and had what my landlord told me was a very rare thing in his house to wit a good dinner that day just as it was brought in the ladies entered two charming creatures indeed and made me very low courtesies while their eyes declared the sense they had of the good i intended them cock said these are my nieces sir and as soon as i had saluted them we sat down to table the eldest carved and helped me to the best the board afforded and young as they were they both showed by their manner and the little they said that they were women of sense and breeding they retired a few minutes after dinner and the youngest contrived in going off to give me a billet in an invisible manner i then turned to cock entirely heard him abuse the government in nonsense and falsehoods as all jacobites do and after we had drank and talked for better than an hour took my leave of him very willingly to read the following note  sir as you can have nothing in view but our happiness in your most generous offer of assistance we have not words to express our grateful sense of the intended favor what is to be done upon the occasion as yet we cannot imagine as we are so confined and watched and the doors of the house locked and barred in such a manner every night that a cat could not get out at any part of it you shall hear from us however soon if possible to some purpose and in the mean time we are  sir your ever obliged servants mt al    what to do then i could not tell but as i rid back i consulted with my lad o fin who was a very extraordinary young man and asked him what observations he had made on the servants and place he said he had tried the depth of the water in the mote all round and found it fordable at one angle waist high and about two feet broad the rock he trod on he had stripped and walked it over to be sure of the thing as to the people he fancied there was one young man a labourer by the year under the gardener who would for a reasonable reward for losing his place be aiding in the escape of the ladies for he talked with pity of them and with great severity of his master that if i pleased he would sound this man and let me know more in relation to him that if he would be concerned he could very easily carry the ladies on his back across the water as he was a tall man and then we might take them behind us to what place we pleased or if it was not safe trusting this man for fear of his telling his master in hopes of more money on that side then he would himself engage to bring the ladies and their clothes over on his own back with wetting only their legs if they could be at the waterside some hour in the night this was not bad to be sure but i was afraid to trust the man for if he should inform old cock of the thing they would be confined to their chambers and made close prisoners for the time to come it was better therefore to rely entirely upon o fin if they could get into the garden in the night  in answer then to another letter i had from the ladies by my landlords daughter the next morning in which they lamented the appearing impossibility of an escape i let them know immediately the state of the water and desired to be informed what they thought of the gardeners man or if he would not do could they at any particular hour get to that angle of the mote i named to be brought over on my mans back and then immediately ride off behind us on pillions which should be preparedmdashtheir answer was that they dared not trust any of mr cocks men but thought my own servant would do and the scheme reasonable and seemingly safe if they could get out they gave me a million of thanks for my amazing care of them and called the immortal powers to witness the high sense they had of their unutterable obligation to me  waiting then for them i staid at the little inn three days longer and at last received a billet to let me know that at twelve oclock that night which was the sixth of june they could by an accident that had happened be at the appointed place and ready to go wherever i pleased to a minute my man and i were there and in a few moments o fin brought them and their clothes over safe in an instant after they were behind us and we rid away as fast as we could six hours we traveled without stopping and in that time had gone about thirty miles we breakfasted very gaily at our inn and when the horses had rested a couple of hours we set out again and rid till three in the afternoon when we baited at a lone house in a valley called straveret vale which had every rural charm that can be found in the finest part of juan fernandes a young couple vastly civil kept here a small clean public house the sign of the pilgrim on the very margin of a pretty river and the plain things they had were as good as we could desire their bread their drink their fowl their eggs their butter cheese vegetables and bacon were excellent and as they had good beds i thought we could not do better than lie by for two or three days in this sweet place till it was determined where the ladies should fix we were at least fixty miles from old cocks house and in an obscurity that would conceal us from any pursuers for we had kept the cross roads and byways and were on the confines of westmoreland here then we agreed to rest for a little time in reality it was just as i pleased the ladies were all acknowledgment for what i did to deliver them and all submission to my direction they had each of them thirty guineas in their purses as they showed me but what to do after that was gone or where to go while it lasted to be in safety they could not tell  the affair perplexed me very much and i turned it a thousand ways without being able to settle it as i would i had two young heiresses on my hands who wanted more than a year of being at age and i must support them and place them in some spot of decency security and peace since i had gone thus far or i had injured them greatly instead of serving them in bringing them from their guardians house this took up all my thoughts for three days i concealed however my uneasiness from them and endeavored to make the house and place quite pleasing to them i kept up a cheerfulness and gaiety and we sat down with joy and pleasure to breakfast dinner and supper within doors we played at cards we sung and i entertained them with my germanflute abroad we walked fished and sometimes i rowed them up the river in a boat the man of the house had the whole scheme was really delightful and as the girls had great quickness and vivacity and were far from being ignorant considering their few years i could have wished it was possible to stay there much longer but it was no place for them and i was obliged to call at claytor in a little time i could not forget my promise to the lovely miss spence my honor was engaged and there was no time to lose it is true if i had not been engaged i might immediately have married either the beautiful miss tilston or the more beautiful miss llandsoy then become my wards but as they were minors if such a wife died under age i could be no gainer and might have children to maintain without any fortune all these things sat powerfully on my spirits and i was obliged at last to make the following declaration to the ladies which i did the third day after dinner  miss tilston miss llandsoy i am sensible you have too high an opinion of what i have done to serve you and think there is more merit in it than there really is for a man of any generosity and ability would i imagine do all that was possible to deliver two young ladies of your charms and perfections from the slavery and misery your guardian kept you in i am likewise sure you believe i would do every thing in my power to secure your happiness and give you the possession of every blessing of time i honor i admire i regard you both to a high degree and if i were some powerful genie i would crown your lives with stable felicity and glory but nature ladies has irrevocably fixed limits beyond which we cannot pass and my sphere of action is far from being large my fortune is not very great and thereby prevents my being so useful a friend to you as i would willingly be however though it is not in my power to do according to my inclination in regard to your case and with security place you in some station fit for your rank and worth yet i can bring you to a spot of tranquillity and in still life enable you to live without perplexity or care of any kind you shall have peace and little and may perhaps hereafter say you have enjoyed more real happiness for the time you had occasion to reside there than you could find in the tumult pomp and grandeur of the world  here i gave the ladies an account of ortonlodge in the northern extremity of westmoreland where i had lived a considerable time told them the condition it was in the goods the books the liquors and other necessaries and conveniences that were there and if in that charming romantic spot where no mortal could come to hurt them they could bear to live for a while i would settle them there and get a man servant to work in the garden and a couple of maids i would likewise procure for them two cows a few lambs some poultry and corn and seeds for the ground in short that they should have every thing requisite in such a place i would return to them as soon as possible i would write to them often directing my letters to the nearest town to be called for by their man what do you say ladies to this proposal in london it is not possible for you to be at a farmhouse you might have no satisfaction and any where that was known and frequented you may be liable to discovery as cock your guardian will enquire every where and if he hears of you you will be carried home most certainly to his dismal habitation and be used ten times worse than before what do you think then of this scheme  sir they both replied you are to us a subaltern power by heaven sent to deliver us from misery and secure our happiness in this world we have not words to express the gratitude of our souls for this further instance of your goodness in the offer you make us nor can it ever be in our power to make you the return it deserves you will be pleased to accept our grateful thanks and all we have to add at present our prayers for your preservation and health conduct us we beseech you immediately to that sweet spot of peace you have described  this being agreed on the next thing to be done was to get two horses for the ladies for mine were not able to carry double any further if there had been a turnpike road before us then up the mountains we were to go where no double horse could travel and when they were at the lodge they would want horses to ride sometimes or to remove if the necessity of their case should happen to require it to my landlord therefore i applied upon the occasion and he very quickly got for me not only two pretty beasts but a young laboring man and two country girls to wait upon the ladies i then sent to the next town for a couple of sidesaddles gave the servants directions to go to the rev mr flemings house to wait there till they heard from me and then we set out for ortonladge two days we spent in traveling there feeding on cold provisions we had with us and lying a night on the fern of the mountains the second evening we arrived at the lodge there i found every thing safe and the place as i had left it i opened my various storehouses to the surprise of the young ladies and brought them many good things biscuits potted char potted blackcocks sweetmeats and liquors of various kinds o fin likewise got us a dish of trouts for supper and the two beauties and i sat down with cheerfulness to our table  vastly amazed they were at all they saw every thing was so good and the wild charms of the place so pleasing that they could not but express the transports they were in at their present situation the whole they said was charming as enchantment and in language there was not a force sufficient to express their grateful sentiments upon the occasion this gave me much pleasure and till the end of june i lived a very happy life with these fine young creatures they did all that was possible to show their esteem and gratitude exclusive of their amazing fine faces and persons they were ingenious gay and engaging and made every minute of time delightful if i had not been engaged to miss spence i should certainly have sat down in peace with these two young ladies and with them connected have looked upon ortonlodge as the garden of eden they were both most charming women miss llandsoy was a mere divinity  section vii come all o come ye family of joy ye children of the cheerful hour begot by wisdom on the virtuous mind

benign immensely good rejoicing in his creatures they wake new raptures in the heart of man and fill his soul with gratitude immense  july        my departure from ortonlodge a second time missed my road the country described    the first of july just as the day was breaking i mounted my horse and went again from ortonlodge the morning being extremely fine and every thing appearing as in the above lines i rid softly on for three or four hours and was so delighted with the beauties and an infinite variety of lovely objects my eyes were feasted with that i did not mind the way and instead of coming to the turning that was my road i got into a bending valley which ended at a range of rocky mountains for half an hour i traveled by the bottom of these frightful hills and came at length to a pass through them but so narrow that the beasts had not above an inch or two to spare on each side it was dark as the blackest night in this opening and a stream came from it by the waters falling in several places from the top of the high enclosing precipices it was as shocking a footway as i had ever seen  finn i said to my young man as the bottom is hard and you can only be wet a little will you try where this pass ends and let me know what kind of country and inhabitants are beyond it that i will said o finn and immediately entered the cleft or crevice between the mountains a couple of hours i allowed my adventurer to explore this dark way but if in that time he could make nothing of it then his orders were to return but there was no sign of him at the end of six hours and i began to fear he had got into some pound after him then i went about one oclock and for near half a mile the narrow way was directly forward a rough bottom and ancle deep in water but it ended in a fine flowery green of about twenty acres surrounded with steep rocky hills it was impossible to ascend walking up to the precipice before me i found many caverns in it which extended on either hand and onwards into a vast variety of caves some of them having high arched openings for entrance and others only holes to creep in at but all of them spacious within and high enough for the tallest man to walk in  in these dismal chambers i apprehended my fellow had lost himself and therefore went into them as far as i could venture that is without losing sight of the day and cried out finn finn but could hear no sound in return this was a great trouble to me and i knew not what to do back however i must go to my horses and after i had spent two hours in searching shouting and expecting my lads return by some means or other i was just going to walk toward the crevice or dark narrow pass i had come through to this place when casting my eyes once more toward the caverns in the mountains i saw my boy come out leaping and singing for joy he told me he never expected to see the daylight more for after he had foolishly gone too far into the caves till he was quite in the dark in hopes of finding a passage through the mountain to some open country he was obliged to wander from chamber to chamber he knew not where for many hours without one ray of light and with very little expectation of deliverance that he did nothing but cry and roar and was hardly able to stand on his legs any longer when by a chance turn into a cave he saw some light again and then soon found his way out poor fellow he was in a sad condition and very wonderful was his escape  after this we made what haste we could to our horses which we had left feeding in the vale and finn brought me some cold provisions from his wallet for my dinner i dined with great pleasure on account of the recovery of my lad and when we had both recruited and rested sufficiently on we went again we found the valley winded about the mountains for three miles and then ended at the highest hill i had ever seen but which it was possible to ascend with great difficulty we and our horses got to the top of it and down on the other side six mountains of the same height whose tops were above the clouds we had to cross and then arrived at a bottom which formed a most delightful scene  mrs thurloes seat in westmoreland    the vale of keswick and lake of derwentwater in cumberland are thought by those who have been there to be the finest point of view in england and extremely beautiful they are far more so than the rev dr dalton has been able to make them appear in his descriptive poem addressed to two ladies at their return from viewing the coalmines near whitehaven that is the late excellent lord lonsdales charming daughters or than the doctors brother mr dalton has painted them in his fine drawings and yet they are inferior in charms to the vale the lake the brooks the shaded sides of the surrounding mountains and the tuneful falls of water to which we came in westmoreland in all the world i believe there is not a more glorious rural scene to be seen in the fine time of the year  in this fine vale i found one pretty little house which had gardens very beautifully laid out and usefully filled with the finest dwarf fruit trees and evergreens vegetables herbs and shrubs the mansion and the improved spot of ground were at the end of the beautiful lake so as to have the whole charming piece of water before the door the projecting shaded fells seemed to nod or hang over the habitation and on either hand a few yards from the front of the house cascades much higher than that of dread lodore in cumberland fell into the lake there is not any thing so beautiful and striking as the whole in any part of the globe that i have seen and i have been in higher latitudes north and south than most men living i have conversed with nations who live many degrees beyond the poor frozen laplander i have traveled among the barbarians who scorch beneath the burning zone  an acccount of the  miss thurlies    who lived in this delightful valley was in the next place my enquiry after i had admired for an hour the amazing beauties of the place i walked up to the house and in one of the parlour windows that had a view up the loch i saw a young beauty sitting with a musicbook in her hand and heard her sing in a masterly manner she could not see me but i had a full view of her fine face and as i remembered to have seen her somewhere i stood gazing at her with wonder and delight and was striving to recollect where i had been in her company when another young one came into the room whom i had reason to remember very well on account of an accident and then i knew they were the two young ladies i had seen at mr harcourts see p     of memoirs of several ladies of great britain and admired very greatly for the charms of their persons and the beauties of their minds upon this i walked up to the window and after a little astonishment at seeing me they behaved with the greatest civility and seemed to be highly pleased with the accidental meeting while we were talking their mamma came into the apartment and on their letting her know who i was and where they had been acquainted with me the old lady was pleased to ask me to stay at her house that night and to assure me she was glad to see me as she had often heard her daughters speak of me three days i passed with great pleasure in this sweet place and then with regret took my leave these two fine young creatures were the miss thurloes and are mrs lowman and mrs munkley in the memoirs of several ladies of great britain in the  d volume of that work the reader will find their lives  account of a carthusian monastery in richmondshire    the  th of july i left mrs thurloes and by the assistance of a guide had a fine ride to the house of friar fleming in richmondshire where i arrived by noon i dined with this good franciscan and should have lain there that night but that i could not help being melancholy on missing my dear friend tom the monks brother who died of a fever as before related from him then i parted in the evening and rid to a carthusian monastry which consisted of seven monks men of some estate who had agreed to live together in this remote place and pass their lives in piety study and gardening i had a letter from fleming to one of these gentlemen the superior letting him know i was his near friend and desiring he would receive me as himself that although a protestant i was of no party but in charity with all mankind this letter procured me all the kindness and honors these gentlemen could show me they behaved with great civility and tenderness and gave me the best they had good fish good bread good wine excellent fruit and fine vegetables for as to flesh they never eat any by their rule  they were all learned and devout men very grave and silent for the most part except when visited but without any thing stiff or morose in their manner they had a large collection of books and seemed to understand them well what time they had to spare from the hours of divine service and working in their gardens according to the rule of st benet which they follow they give to study and had many volumes of their own writing being mostly old mss they had transcribed greek latin and french making such copies was their principal work in the closet  reasons for reading the works of the rabbis fictitious and extravagant as they are    i stayed two days with these gentlemen and had a good deal of useful conversation with them on various subjects on looking into the writings of the rabbis which i saw in their library i told one of these chartreux that it was a wonder to me that any one read such extravagant fabulous relations and despicable fictions as these books contained and should be glad to know what good could be extracted from them  the friar replied that notwithstanding their being fictitious and extravagant to a high degree yet great use may be made of the works of the rabbis and especially of the talmud of babylon an account of the talmuds reader that you may the better understand the conversation i had with this learned carthusian i must inform you what the talmud and other writings of the rabbis are   the talmud is a celebrated piece of jewish literature that is full of rabinical domination and enthusiasm the rabbis pretend this book contains the oral laws and other secrets which god communicated to moses it consists of two parts each of which is divided into several books in the first part which they call mishna is the text in the other is a sort of comment on the text and this is styled the gemara  this oral law or tradition of the jews was collected after the destruction of the temple a d   0 by rabbi judah and is by them preferred before the scripture they suppose it was orally delivered by moses to israel and unlawful to be written but when jerusalem was destroyed they were constrained to write it least it should be lost but yet it was so written as that none but themselves might understand it  this mishna and gemara complete the two talmuds  that of jerusalem a d   0  and that of babylon  00 years after christ many parts of these talmuds are translated by several learned men who have endeavored to render them intelligible but in order to understand them fully you must read the jad chaska or mishna torah of moses maimonides who was physician to the king of egypt about  00 years ago this rabbi has comprised the substance of the mishna and gemara of the talmud in his books and enabled us to understand all the mishna with ease and pleasure see likewise the clavis talmudica cocks excerpta and the works of the excellent ludivicus de campeigne du veil who had been a jew but became a roman catholic from rome went over to the church of england where he was for several years in the character of a great divine but at last turned baptist and died a member of that christian church which lost him all his friends and interest he died the beginning of this century with the reputation of an upright christian and a most learned man there is no tolerable account given of him in any of the biographical dictionaries what they say is short and next to nothing and the popish accounts are not only short but false and mere calumny  i took a great deal of pains some years ago to collect among the baptists and from others who knew this great man every thing i could get relating to him and his works and formed what i had got into a life of him which i did intend to insert in this place but by some accident or other it is gone i cannot find it any where   we obtain from thence a knowledge of the customs and opinions of the jews which afford some benefit in the next place they serve to the confirmation of the history of jesus christ for it appears by the babylonish talmud that there was one jesus who had disciples lived in such and such a place and did and said diverse things and in the bible many texts relating to the messiah are confirmed and explained by these books of the rabbis though not by them intended this i have since found to be the truth of the case i have read the works of the rabbis since and find it to be as the carthusian said for example  it is said in genesis iii    i will put enmity between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head and thou shall bruise his heel now the targum of onkelos gives the sense thus the man shall be mindful of or remember what thou satan have done to him in times past and thou shall observe watch or haunt him till the end of days that is the serpent or devil should pursue and have dominion over the world till the last days and then the prince of this world should be cast out and the works of the devil destroyed beacharith heyamim the end of days or last days is by a general rule given by the most learned rabbis meant of the messiah so kimchi on isa ii    and abarbriel and r moses nachm on genesis xlix   inform us  it is likewise very remarkable that the targum of jerusalem and that of jonathan ben uziel apply this place to the coming of the messiah they give the words the following sense  i will put enmity between thy seed and her seed when the sons of the woman keeping my law they shall bruise thy head and when they break my law thou shall bruise their heel but the wound given to the seed of the woman shall be healed but thine shall be incurable they shall be healed in the last days in the days of the messiah  such is the opinion of the most learned jews  and from thence it follows that the christians have not put their sense upon the text i have cited to serve their own turn the rabbis we see give the very same meaning to the place  again in numb xxiv    we have the famous prophecy of balaam there shall come a star out of jacob and a scepter shall rise out of israel  in isaiah xi   it is written and there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of jesse and a branch shall grow out of his roots and the spirit of the lord shall rest upon him and in jeremiah xxiii    behold the days shall come says the lord that i will raise unto david a righteous branch  and this is his name whereby he shall be called the lord our righteousness that the christians apply these texts to the messiah i need not inform the reader but it must be grateful to observe that the paraphrases of onkelos jonathan and jerusalem all of them expressly attribute the prophecy of balaam to the messiah and rabbi moses hadarsan and maimon say he is here called a star which signifies what malachi expresses by the sun of righteousness mal iv   and zechariah by the east i will bring forth my servant the east zach iii   as it is translated in the vulgar septuagint arabic and syriac is here say these rabbis called a star because he should come and destroy idolatry among the heathen nations by becoming a light to the gentiles and the glory of israel  as to the other two texts the jews do likewise attribute them to the messiah rabbi joseph albo speaking of the words the lord our righteousness in particular says expressly that this is one name given to the messiah albo sep ikker lib   c    thus do the jews concur with us in the application of texts to the messiah but what is become of this messiah they cannot tell they are amazed perplexed and confounded about him they dispute on the article and have the wildest fancies in relation to it whereas the christians give a clear and consistent account of the messiah and by every argument that can be desired by a rational prove the truth of christianity  again in isa ix   we have these words unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulders and his name shall be called wonderful counselor the mighty god the everlasting father the prince of peace or as the alexandrian ms has it he shall call his name the angel wonderful counselor mighty the governor the prince of peace the father of the age to come this is thought by all christians to be a plain declaration of the messiah for to apply it to any mere mortal as to hezekiah or isaiahs son cannot be done without the greatest absurdity and therefore ben maimon epist ad afric fairly yields that these words belong to the messiah and so does jonathan ben uziel in his chaldee paraphrase the talmud itself allows it tract sanhedrim that it relates to a person not come in the time of the prophets but to the man whose name is the branch which was to come forth out of the stem of jesse and to grow out of his roots my servant the branch behold the man whose name is the branch zech iii   and chapter xii and isa iv   even the person that shall be sent shilo that remarkable person god had promised to his people so says the talmud  but further as to the birth of the messiah in respect of the manner and the place it is thus set down by the prophet micah v   and thou bethlehem ephrata though thou be little among the thousands of judah yet out of thee shall come forth unto me that is to be ruler in israel whose goings forth have been of old even from everlasting  and in isa vii    are these words behold a virgin shall conceive and bring forth a son and call his name immanuel in these two texts the christians say the place of the birth of the messiah and the manner of it are as plainly described as words can do and if they cannot without absurdity be explained as relating to any other person then it must be perverting the meaning of the records to oppose this explication but this the jews are far from doing the place is acknowledged in the talmud in the chaldee paraphrase of jonathan and all their most famous masters declare with one voice that bethlehem indisputably belongs to the messiah exte bethlehem coram me prodibit messiah ut sit dominium exercens in israel cujus nomen dictum est ab aeternitate a diebus seculi talmud lib sanhedrim et midrasch the hillinic rabbi selemoh paraph jonath in loc rabbi david kimchi  and as to the manner though it be true that some jews say the hebrew word gnalma signifies a young woman as well as a virgin yet kimell jarchi and selemoh three of their greatest rabbis confess that here is something wonderful presaged in the birth and generation of this person and that he was not to be born as other men and women are born what can we desire more in the case from an enemy and in truth the behold or wonder with which the text begins would be nothing if it was only that a young woman should have a child  and as to the hebrew word gnalmah if it ever does signify a young women which i very much doubt yet in the translation of the seventy who well understood the original surely they render the word by parthenos in graec which always signifies a virgin in the strict propriety of the phrase and in the punic language which is much the same as the hebrew the word alma signifies a virgin virgo intacta and never means a young woman  such are the advantages we may gain by reading the books of the rabbis and to me it is pleasing to see these great hebrew masters granting so much to us for our messiah while they hate our holy religion beyond every thing even the gay among the jews if i have been truly informed by one who danced a night with them have in contempt and abhorrence of our faith a countrydance called the little jesus  an account of knareshorough and its waters    the eighth of july i left the little chartreuse and went from thence to knaresborough where i arrived that night and resided three days it is a fine old town and borough by prescription in the west riding of yorkshire and wapentake of claro the vast hills of craven look beautifully wild in its neighborhood and the rapid river nid which issues from the bottom of those mountains almost encompasses the town it is     measured miles from london and the best way to it is from ferrybridge to wetherby the left hand road where there is an excellent inn and from that to knaresborough  when this very ancient town passed from the posterity of surlo de burgh the founder of it we know not but we find that henry iii reg    granted the honor castle and manor to the earl of kent margaret his wife and their issue and heirs and that on failure of issue and right heirs it returned again to the crown for edward the second among other lands gave this lordship of knaresborough to his favorite pierse de gaveston earl of cornwall and his heirs gaveston was taken not long after by the barons in scarborough castle after a short siege and on gaverslyheath near warwick was beheaded by order of the earl of warwick june  0       by the fall of the insolent gaveston who had been banished by the great edward the first but recalled and received into favor by edward the second before his fathers funeral was performed by the death of this favorite who had involved his masters interest with his own and rendered any displeasure against himself the want of duty to the prince just as lord b    and the now outs did the other day which ruined the miserable king knaresborough came again to the crown and so continued till the   th of edward the third when this king made a grant of the honor castle and manor of this town and the cell of st roberts to john of gaunt the kings fourth son who was earl of richmond and created duke of lancaster on his having married one of the coheiresses of henry duke of lancaster other great estates were likewise given at the same time to this fourth son of edward that he might maintain his grandeur and ever since this town has belonged to the duchy of lancaster it is an appendage to the crown  not far from this town are two wells as strong of sulphur as harrogatewater and as valuable though no one takes any notice of them one lies in the way to harrogate in a low ground by a brookside the other is bittonspaw in a park by mr staughtons house  description of a dropping well as to the famous droppingwell or petrifying water it lies on the west side of the town and river about    yards from the bank of the nid it rises    yards below the top of a mountain of marle stone and in four falls of about two yards each fall comes to an easy ascent where it spreads upon the top of an isthmus of a petrified rock generated out of the water which falls down round it this isthmus or rock is ten yards high and hangs over its base or bottom about   yards it is near    yards long and    broad and as it started from the bank about fifty years ago leaves a chasm between them that is about three yards wide in this chasm you will find petrified twigs of trees shrubs and grassroots hanging in most beautiful pillars all interwoven and forming many charming figures and on the common side are whole banks like stalactilites hard and inseparable from the rock where the water trickles down these petrefactions the falling water and the little isthmus or island being beautifully clothed with ash osier elm sambucus servicana major geraniums woodmercury hartstongue sage ladies mantle cowslips wild angelica etc form all together a delightful scene  the first spring of this water is out of a small hole on the little mountain in the middle of a thickset of shrubs it sends out  0 gallons in a minute of the sweetest water in the world and it is    grains in a pint heavier than common water  observations on petrifying waters most people are of opinion that petrifying water is dangerous drink and may produce abundance of mischief in causing the stone and gravel in the body the original particles or principles of the stony substance called spar which are in abundance suspended in this kind of water must get into the floodgates of the kidneys and ureters as they opine and create great misery in a little time  but this fear of petrefactions in living animal bodies is grounded upon neither reason nor experience for the spar in these waters forms no petrefactions whilst in a brisk motion or in a temperate season or on vegetables while they preserve their vegetating life while there is warmth and circulation of juices there can be no incrustation or petrefaction from the suspended stony particles besides if the minims of spar are not within the spheres of sensible attraction whilst in motion much less are they so when mingled with the fluids of the human body you may therefore very safely drink these limpid petrifying waters at all times as a common fluid if they come in your way as the best and most grateful or pleasant water in the world on account of the infinitesimals or original leasts of spar that are in them in vast quantities but infinitely small particles and if you are sick in many cases sure i am they are the best of medicines human invention has nothing equal to them for fluxes of any part of the body or colliquations from an acid salt so far are they from being in the least dangerous that in all unnatural discharges by spitting stool or urine by excessive menstrual or haemorrhoidal fluxes in the fluor albus diabetes profuse sweatings in the diarrhoea dyfentry or lienteria where the springs are not quite worn out in ulcers of the viscera hectic fevers atrophy and colliquations or night sweats there is not any thing in physic more profitable or pleasant to recover a patient let your dose in such cases be three halfpints of knaresborough droppingwell in the forenoon and before you begin to drink this water remember to take two doses of rhubarb to cleanse off the excrements of the first viscera you must not drink ale drams or punch during a course of these waters and take but very little red port you must likewise have a strict regard to diet let it be milk eggs jellies barleybroth chickens kid lamb and the like you must avoid all salt sharp stimulating things daysleep and nightair but agreeable conversation and diversions that require very little exercise conduce to the success of this kind of water in the distempers i have mentioned if such diseases are curable you may expect a restoration of health  but in the dropsy jaundice diminished or irregular menses in hyppo melancholy stuffings of the lungs obstructions of the viscera stoppages of the lacteals and misentery glandular swellings kings evil or any case where thinning relaxing opening deterging attenuation or stimulation are wanting such water is death  note reader there is another excellent petrifyingwater at newtondale in yorkshire n r thirteen miles from scarborough  another near castlehoward the fine seat of the earl of carlisle ten miles from york  another near skipton in that rough romantic wild and silent country called craven in the west riding of yorkshire  and one called bandwell at stonefield in lincolnshire west of horncastle which is     miles from london these springs and many that are not to be come at among the vast fells of westmoreland and the high mountains of stanemore have all the virtues of knaresborough droppingwell though knaresboroughwater is the only one resorted to by company and as to this spring i can affirm from my own knowledge that it is as excellent and truly medicinal as the famous petrifyingwater at clermont there is no manner of need for britons going to the mountain gregoire in basseauvergne  a postilla a postilla reader is a barbarous word made up of the words post illa and was brought into use in the twelfth century when the marginal explicators of the bible left the margins and under their text writ short and literal notes before which they put the word postilla instead of the words post illa meaning the particular words in the text from whence by a letter they referred to the little note below but in the   th century the barbarous word took so much that all the commentators following appropriated the name to their most copious commentaries contrary to the first practice in the use of the word and for three centuries after the biblial learning was all postilla till at length the word disappeared according to the wonted inconstancy and agitation of all human things and gave place to a new and fifth invention called tractatus or homily this is the history of a postilla   containing an account of wardrew sulphurwater  the life of claudius hobart  and a dissertation on reason and revelation in my account of sulphurwaters i forgot to mention one very extraordinary spring of this kind and therefore make a postilla of it here that the reader may find in one section all i have to say on mineral waters  and as i found by the side of this water a man as extraordinary as the spring i shall add his life to my account of the water and a couple of little pieces written by him  of wardrew sulphurwater in northumberland on the borders of cumberland there is a place called wardrew to the northwest of thirlwallcastle which stands on that part of the pictswall where it crosses the tippel and is known by the name of murus perforatus in saxon thirlwall on account of the gaps made in the wall at this place for the scots passage here as i wandered about this wild untravelled country in search of roman antiquities i arrived at a sulphurspring which i found to be the strongest and most excellent of the kind in all the world it rises out of a vast cliff called ardenrock over the bank of the river arde or irthing six feet above the surface of the water and comes out of a chink in the cliff by a small spout the discharge is fifty gallons in a minute from a mixture of limestone and ironstone and the water is so very foetid that it is difficult to swallow it the way to it is not easy for there is no other passage than along a very narrow ledge about nine inches broad which has been cut off the rock over the deep river and if you slip as you may easily do having nothing to hold by down you go into a water that looks very black and shocking by the shade of the hanging precipice and some aged trees which project from the vast cliff  this dangerous situation and its remoteness will prevent its being ever much visited admirable as the spaw is yet the country people thereabout make nothing of the ledge and drink plentifully of the water to their sure relief in many dangerous distempers  it is to them a blessed spring  a description of wardrew in northumberland the land all round here was one of the finest rural scenes i have seen and made a pensive traveller wish for some small publichouse there to pass a few delightful days its lawns and groves its waters vales and hills are charming and form the sweetest softest region of silence and ease whichever way i turned the various beauties of nature appeared and nightingales from the thicket inchantingly warbled their loves the fountains were bordered with violets and moss and near them were clumps of pine and beech bound with sweetbriar and the tendrils of woodbine it is a delightful spot a paradise of blooming joys in the fine season of the year  the history of claudius hobart    one inhabitant only i found in this fine solitude who lived on the margin of the river in a small neat cottage that was almost hid with trees this was claudius hobart a man of letters and a gentleman who had been unfortunate in the world and retired to these elysian fields to devote the remainder of his time to religion and enjoy the calm felicities of contemplative life he was obliged by law to resign his estate to a claimant and death had robbed him of a matchless mistress of great fortune to whom he was to have been married the men who had called themselves his friends and as timon says in lucian honored him worshipped him and seemed to depend on his nod  no longer knew him jam ne agnoscor quidem ab illis nec aspici ne dignantur me perinde ut eversum hominis jam olim defuncti cippum ac temporis longitudine collapsum pretereunt quasi ne norint quidem  so true continued mr hobart are the beautiful lines of petronius nomen amicitiae si quatenus expedit haeret calculus in tabula mobile ducit opus quum fortuna manet vultum servatis amici cum cecidit turpi vertitis ora fuga and so sweet ovid says was his case eandem cum timone nostro sortem expertus naso qui sic de seipso en ego non paucis quondam munitus amicis dum flavit velis aura secunda meis ut fera terribili tumuerunt aequora vento in mediis lacera puppe relinquor aquis   so hobart found it and as his health was declining from various causes and he had nothing in view before him while he appeared but misery therefore he retired to wardrew while he had some money built the little house i saw on a piece of ground he purchased and provided such necessaries and comforts as he imagined might be wanting he had a few good books the bible some history and mathematics to make him wiser and better and abroad he diverted himself mostly in his garden and with fishing for fifteen years past he had not been in any town nor in any ones house but conversed often with several of the country people who came to drink the mineralwater what he had fresh occasion for one or other of them brought him according to his written directions and the money he gave them and once or twice a week he was sure of seeing somebody as the people knew he was not rich and lived a harmless life they were far from being his enemies and would do any thing in their power to serve the hermit as they called him but he seldom gave them any trouble his food was biscuit honey roots fish and oil and his drink water with a little rum sometimes he was never sick nor melancholy but by a life of temperance and action and a religion of trust and resignation enjoyed perpetual health and peace and run his latent course in the pleasing expectation of a remove when his days were past to the bright mansions of the blessed  such was the account mr hobart gave me of himself which made me admire him much as he was but fifty then and to convince me his temper had nothing timonean or unsocial in it from his solitary life he requested i would dine with him he entertained me with an excellent pickled trout and biscuit fine fruit and a pot of extraordinary honey with as much creme of tartar as lay on a sixpence fused in warm water he made half a pint of rum into good punch and he talked over it like a man of sense breeding and good humor we parted when the bowl was out and at my going away he made me a present of the following ms and told me i might print it if i could think it would be of any use to mankind it was called the rule of reason with a few thoughts on revelation  a tract    the throne of god rests upon reason and his prerogative is supported by it it is the sole rule of the deity the mind which presides in the universe and therefore is venerable sacred and divine every ray of reason participates of the majesty of that being to whom it belongs and whose attribute it is and being thereby awful and invested with a supreme and absolute authority it is rebellion to refuse subjection to right reason and a violation of the great and fundamental law of heaven and earth  to this best and fittest and noblest rule the rule of truth we ought to submit and in obedience to the sacred voice of reason resist the importunities of sense and the usurpations of appetite since the will of that being who is infinitely pure and perfect rational and righteous is obliged and governed by his unerring understanding our wills should be guided and directed by our reason in imitation of the wisest and best of beings we must perpetually adhere to truth and ever act righteously for righteousness sake by acting in conformity to moral truths which are really and strictly divine we act in conformity to ourselves and it is not possible to conceive any thing so glorious or godlike we are thereby taught the duties of piety our duties toward our fellows and that selfculture which is subservient to piety and humanity  discourse on the rule of reason reason informs us there is a superior mind endued with knowledge and great power presiding over human affairs some original independent being complete in all possible perfection of boundless power wisdom and goodness the contriver creator and governor of this world and the inexhaustible source of all good a vast collection of evidence demonstrates this design intention art and power as great as our imagination can conceive every where occur as far as we can make observations original intelligence and power appear to reside in a spirit distinct from all divisible changeable or moveable substance and if we can reason at all it must be clear that an original omnipotent mind is a good deity and espouses the cause of virtue and of the universal happiness will gloriously compensate the worthy in a future state and then make the vicious and oppressive have cause to repent of their contradicting his will it follows then most certainly that with this great source of our being and of all perfection every rational mind ought to correspond and with internal and external worship adore the divine power and goodness his divine perfections creation and providence must excite all possible esteem love and admiration if we think at all must beget trust and resignation and raise the highest resentments of gratitude all our happiness and excellency is from his bounty and therefore not unto us not unto us but to his name be the praise and can there be a joy on earth so stable and transporting as that which rises from living with an habitual sense of the divine presence a just persuasion of being approved beloved and protected by him who is infinitely perfect and omnipotent  by reason we likewise find that the excesses of the passions produce misery and iniquity makes a man completely wretched and despicable but integrity and moral worth secure us peace and merit and lead to true happiness and glory unless reason and inquiry are banished vice and oppression must have terrible struggles against the principles of humanity and conscience reflection must raise the most torturing suspicions and all stable satisfaction must be lost but by cultivating the high powers of our reason and acquiring moral excellence so far as human nature is able by justice and the benevolent affections virtue and charity we are connected with and affixed to the deity and with the inward applauses of a good heart we have the outward enjoyment of all the felicities suitable to our transitory condition happy state surely there are no horrors here to haunt us there is no dreadful thing to poison all parts of life and all enjoyments  let us hearken then to the original law of reason and follow god and nature as the sure guide to happiness let the offices of piety and beneficence be the principal employment of our time and the chief work of our every day to secure an happy immortality by equity benignity and devotion by continual attention and internal discipline reason can do great things and enable us so to improve the supreme and most godlike powers of our constitution and so discharge the duties imposed upon us by our creator that when we return into that silence we were in before we existed and our places shall know us no more we may pass from the unstable condition of terrestrial affairs to that eternal state in the heavens where everlasting pleasures and enjoyments are prepared for those who have lived in the delightful exercise of the powers of reason and performed all social and kind offices to others out of a sense of duty to god thus does truth oblige us it is the basis of morality as morality is the basis of religion  this i think is a just account of moral truth and rectitude and shows that it is essentially glorious in itself and the sacred rule to which all things must bend and all agents submit but then a question may be asked what need have we of revelation since reason can so fully instruct us and its bonds alone are sufficient to hold us  and in particular what becomes of the principal part of revelation called redemption  account of revelation the system of moral truth and revelation it may be answered are united and at perfect amity with each other morality and the gospel stand on the same foundation and differ only in this that revealed religion in respect of the corrupt and degenerate state of mankind has brought fresh light and additional assistance to direct support and fix men in their duty we have histories which relate an early deviation from moral truth and inform us that this disease of our rational nature spread like a contagion the case became worse and more deplorable in succeeding ages and as evil examples and prejudices added new force to the prevailing passions and reason and liberty of will for want of due exercise grew weaker and less able to regain their lost dominion corruption was rendered universal then did the true god the father of the universe and the most provident and beneficent of beings interpose by a revelation of his will and by advice and authority do all that was possible to prevent the selfdestructive effects of the culpable ignorance and folly of his offspring he gave the world a transcript of the law of nature by an extraordinary messenger the man christ jesus who had power given him to work miracles to rouse mankind from their fatal stupidity to set their thoughts on work and to conciliate their attention to the heavenly declaration in this republication of the original law he gave them doctrines and commandments perfectly consonant to the purest reason and to them annexed sanctions that do really bind and oblige men as they not only guard and strengthen religion but affect our natural sensibility and selfishness religion appears to great disadvantage when divines preach it into a bond of indemnity and a mere contract of interest but exclusive of this it must be allowed that the sanctions of the gospel have a weight awfulness and solemnity that prove to a great degree effectual safety and advantage are reasons for welldoing  in short the evidence of the obligation of the duties of natural religion is as plain and strong from reason as any revelation can make it but yet the means of rendering these duties effectual in practice are not so clear and powerful from mere reason as from revelation the proof of obligation is equally strong in reason and inspiration but the obligation itself is rendered stronger by the gospel by superadded means or motives the primary obligation of natural religion arises from the nature and reason of things as being objects of our rational moral faculties agreeably to which we cannot but be obliged to act and this obligation is strengthened by the tendency of natural religion to the final happiness of every rational agent but the clear knowledge and express promises which we have in the gospel of the nature and greatness of this final happiness being added to the obligation from and the tendency of reason or natural religion to the final happiness of human nature the obligation of it is thereby still more strengthened in this lies the benefit of christianity it is the old incorrupt religion of nature and reason entirely free from superstition and immorality delivered and taught in the most rational and easy way and enforced by the most gracious and powerful motives  of the mysteries trinity and sacrifice of the cross but if this be the case it may be asked where are our holy mysteries  and what do you think of our redemption if natural reason and conscience can do so much and to the gospel we are obliged only for a little more light and influence then trinity in unity and the sacrifice of the cross are nothing what are your sentiments on these subjects  as to the trinity it is a word invented by the doctors and so far as i can find was never once thought of by jesus christ and his apostles unless it was to guard against the spread of tritheism by taking the greatest care to inculcate the supreme divinity of god the father but let it be a trinity since the church will have it so and by it i understand one uncreated and one created and a certain divine virtue of quality these i find in the bible god jesus the word and a divine assistance or holy wind not holy ghost as we have translated it called a wind because god from whom every good and perfect gift comes gave the most extraordinary instance of it under the emblem of a wind and holy because it was supernatural this is the scripture doctrine in relation to the deity the messiah and the energy of god of which the wind was promised as a pledge and was given as an emblem when the day of pentecost was come and if these three they will call a trinity i shall not dispute about the word but to say jesus christ is god though the apostles tell us that god raised from the dead the man jesus christ whom they killed that he had exalted him at his right hand and had made him both lord and christ and to affirm that this ghost as they render the word wind is a person distinct and different from the person of god the father and equally supreme  this i cannot agree to if the scripture is true all this appears to me to be false it is a mere invention of the monks  as to redemption it may be in perfect consistence and agreement with truth and rectitude if the accomplishment of it be considered as premial and as resulting from a personal reward but to regard the accomplishment as penal and as resulting from a vicarious punishment is a notion that cannot be reconciled to the principle of rectitude vicarious punishment or suffering appears an impossibility but as jesus by adding the most extensive benevolence to perfect innocence and by becoming obedient to death even the death of the cross was most meritorious and was entitled to the highest honor and most distinguished reward his reward might be our deliverance from the bonds of sin and death and the restoration of immortality this reward was worthy of the giver and tended to the advancement and spread of virtue it was likewise most acceptable to the receiver it no way interfered with right and truth it was in all respects most proper and suitable these are my sentiments of redemption this appears to me to be the truth on the most attentive and impartial examination i have been capable of making  to this perhaps some people may reply that though these notions are for the most part just and in the case of redemption in particular as innocence and punishment are inconsistent and incompatible ideas that it was not possible christs oblation of himself could be more than a figurative sacrifice in respect of translation of guilt commutation of persons and vicarious infliction though a real sacrifice in the sense of intending by the oblation to procure the favor of god and the indemnity of sinners yet as the author appears to be a socinian his account is liable to objections for though the socinians acknowledge the truth and necessity of the revelation of the gospel yet in the opinion of some great divines they interpret it in such a manner as no unprejudiced person who has read the scriptures with any attention nor any sensible heathen who should read them can possibly believe they make our redeemer a man and by this doctrine reflect the greatest dishonor on christianity and its divine author  this is a hard charge the socinians are by these divines described as people who read the scriptures with prejudice and without attention men more senseless than the heathens and as wicked too for in the highest degree they dishonor christ jesus and his religion astonishing assertion it puts me in mind of an imputation of the celebrated waterland in his second charge  what atheism chiefly aims at is to sit loose from present restraints and future reckonings and these two purposes may be competently served by deism which is a more refined kind of atheism  groundless and ridiculous calumny true and proper deism is a sincere belief of the existence of a god and of an impartial distribution of rewards and punishments in another world and a practice that naturally results from and is consonant to such belief and if atheism aims to sit loose from restraints and reckonings then of consequence deism is the grand barrier to the purposes of atheism the true deist is so far from breaking through restraints that he makes it the great business of his life to discharge the obligations he is under because he believes in god and perceives the equity and reasonableness of duties restraints and future reckonings the assertion therefore demonstrates the prejudice of dr waterland in relation to the deists  and the case is the same in respect of the charge against the socinians it is the divines that are prejudiced against them and not the socinians in studying the new testament it is the grand purpose of our lives to worship god and form our religious notions according to the instructions of divine wisdom we examine the sacred writings with the utmost desire and most ardent prayer that we may be rightly informed in the truest sense of the holy authors of those divine books and it appears to our plain understandings after the most honest labor and wishes to heaven for a clear conception of holy things that the father is the supreme god that is the first and chief being and agent the first and chief governor the fountain of being agency and authority that the christian messiah the man christ jesus was sent into the world to bear witness to the truth and preach the gospel of the kingdom of god that kingdom of god which is within you says the lord luke xvii    not a kingdom of monks a sacerdotal empire of power propositions and ceremonies he came to call sinners to repentance and amendment of life to teach them the law of love and assure mankind of grace and mercy and everlasting glory if they kept the commandments and were obedient to the laws of heaven laws of righteousness peace giving no offense and unanimity in the worship of the god and father of our lord jesus christ but that if they did not repent and cease to be hurtful and injurious if they did not open their eyes and turn from darkness to light from the power of satan unto god and put on such an agreeable and useful temper and behavior as would render them a blessing in the creation they would be numbered among the cursed and perish everlastingly for want of real goodness and a general sincerity of heart this the socinians think is what christ proposed and recommended as the only and the sure way to gods favor through the worthiness of the lamb that was slain we say this is pure religion it is true original christianity and if the glorious design of our lord is answered by his miracles and preaching by his death his resurrection his ascension and by the grace of the holy blessed and sanctifying spirit it could reflect no dishonor on christianity and its divine author if our redeemer was a mere man if by the assistance of god almighty a mere man performed the whole work of our redemption all we had to do was to be thankful for the mighty blessing the love of god in this way had been equally inestimable the worth of jesus would be still invaluable  but it is not the opinion of the socinians that christ was a mere man it is plain from this assertion that the rev dr heathcote in his remarks on free and candid disquisitions knows nothing of them the account they give of jesus christ is very different they say he was a most glorious agent united to a human body and so far from being a mere man that he was superior to angels he was the next in character to the necessarily existing being he is the brightness of the fathers glory and the express image of his person he has an excellency transcendent and to the life represents what is infinitely great and perfect  if they do not allow that he made the worlds or had an eternal generation if they say he had no existence till he was formed by the power of god in the womb and assert this eminency is proper to the man christ jesus yet they are far from affirming he was therefore a mere man no they believe he was decreed to be as great and glorious as possible and that god made the world for him that he was made the image of the invisible person of the father an image the most express and exact as great as god himself could make it and of consequence so transcendent in all perfections that what he says and does is the same thing as if god had spoken and acted this is not making him a mere man no they say he is the first of all and the head of all creatures whom the infinite love of god produced to promote greatness glory and happiness among the creatures by the superlative greatness and glory of jesus and that angels and the spirits of the just made perfect might have the pleasure of beholding and enjoying the presence of this most glorious image that is of seeing their invisible creator in his image jesus christ he is not a mere man but the brightness of the glory of god the express image of his person and raised so much higher than the angels as he has inherited from god a more excellent name than they to wit the name of son and is the appointed heir of all things  so that this socinianism reflects no dishonor on christianity and its divine author it conduces as much to the glory of god and the benefit of man as any christianity can do there is something vastly beautiful and satisfactory in the notion of christs being the most glorious image of the invisible father whenever his existence began the many transcendent excellencies of the messiah in whom all fullness dwells are exercised upon men to their happiness and to his glory and we learn from thence that greatness and glory are the result of the exercise of virtue to the relief and happiness of others the redeemer of the world is in this account the next in dignity and power to the great god and the perfections of the father do most eminently shine forth in him we are hereby made meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light and delivered from the power of darkness we give thanks unto the father who has translated us into the kingdom of the son of his love  it is certain then that the divines have misrepresented the people who are injuriously called socinians as the religion they profess is scripturechristianity i say injuriously because in the first place the word socinian is intended as a term of great reproach to christians who deserve better usage for the goodness of their manners and the purity of their faith and in the next place that socinus was so far from being the author of our religion that he was not even the first restorer of it he did not go to poland to teach the people there his religious notions but because there was a unitarian congregation there with whom he might join in the worship of the father through jesus the mediator as his conscience would not suffer him to assemble with those who worship a being compounded of three divine persons  but it is time to have done and i shall conclude in the words of a good author in old french or rather in bad french as the writer was no frenchman the extract must be a curious thing to the reader as the valuable book i take it from is not to be bought  nostre confession de foy ate depuis la premiere predication de levangile puisque nous luy donnons la saint ecriture pour fondement mais il arrive de nous ce quil arrive des tous ceux qui se sont detaches de leglise roman aux quels le papists donnent malgre eux pour autheurs de leur religion luther calvin and autres docteurs qui nont ete que les restorateurs des dogmes and de verites qui setoyent presque perdues sous le gouvernement tyrannique de leglise roman pendant lequel lecriture saint etoit devenue un livre inconnu a la pluspart de chretiens la lecture en ayant ete defendue communement mais par un decret de la providence de dieu le periode de la revolution etant venu chacun a commence a deterrer la verite la mieux quil a pu and comme dans chaque revolution il y a des chefs and des gens illustres ainsi dans le retablissement des dogmes etouffes si longtems par le papisme luther calvin arminius and socin ont ete des hommes illustres and dont on a done le nom aux religions vous scaurez donc sil vous plaist que socin bien loin davoir ete autheur de nostre religion nen a pas ete meme la premier restaurateur car il netoit venu en pologne que parce quil avoit appris quil sy etoit deja formee une assemblee de gens qui avoyent des opinions semblables aux siennes je vous diray de plus que la seule chose que le fait un heroes dans nostre religion cest quil en a ecrit des livres mais il ny a presque person qui les life car comme socin etoit un bon jurisconsulte il est extremement long and ennuyeux and outre que nous ne voulous point avoir dautre livre de religion que le nouveau testament and point dautres docteurs que les apostres cest pourquoy cest bien malgre nous quon nous appelle sociniens ou arriens ce sont des noms dont la malignite de nos ennemys nous couvre pour nous render odieux nous appellons enter nous du simple nom de chretiens mais puisque dans cette desunion de la chretiente on nous dit quil ne suffit pas de porter ce nom universel mais quil encore necessairement se distinguer par quelque appellation particuliere nous consentons donc de porter le nom de chretiens unitaires pour nous distinguer de chretiens trinitaires ce nom de chretiens unitaires nous convient fort bien comme a ceux qui ne voulant en aucune facon encherye sur la doctrine de jesus christ ny y subtiliser plus quil ne faut attachent leur croyance and leur confession positivement a cette instruction de jesus christ qui se trouve dans le    chap de levangile de st jean quand il dit  mon pere lheure est venue glorifiez vostre fills afin que vostre fills vous glorify comme vous luy avez done puissance sur tous les hommes a fin quil done la vie eternelle a tous ceux que vous luy avez done or la vie eternelle consiste a vous connoistre vous qui estes le seul dieu veritable and jesus christ que vous avez envoye la meme lecon nous done lapostre st paul dans le   chap aux cor disant  quil ny a pour nous quun seul dieu qui est la pere duquel sont toutes chooses and nous pour luy and il ny a quun seul seigneur qul est jesus christ par lequel sont toutes chooses and nous par luy cest donc a cause de cette confession que nous nous appellons chretiens unitaires par ce que nous croyons quil ny a quun seul dieu pere and dieu de nostre seigneur jesus christ celuy que jesus christ nous a appris dadorer and lequel il a aussy adore luy meme lappellent non seulment nostre dieu mais son dieu aussy selon quil a dit je men vay a mon pere and vostre pere a mon dieu and a vostre dieu  ainsy vous voyez que nous nous tenons aux verites divines nous avons la religieuse veneration pour la saint ecriture avec tout cela nous sommes serviteurs tres humble des messieurs les trinitaires  penes quos mundanae fabulae actio est and il ne tient pas a nous que nous ne courrious de tout nostre coeur a leurs autels sils vouloyent nous fair la grace de souffrir nostre simplicite en jesus christ and de ne pas vouloir nous obliger a la confession de supplements a la saint ecriture la verite and la religion en visit alamagne        an account of socinus    the great and excellent faustus socinus was born at sienna in the year      and died at luclavie the third of march   0  aged    his book in defense of the authority of the sacred scriptures is a matchless performance and if he had never written any thing else is alone sufficient to render his memory glorious and precious to all true christians get this book if you can it is the finest defense of your bible that was ever published steinfurti a      edit vorst and yet such is the malignity of orthodoxy that a late great prelate dr smalbroke bp of litchfield and coventry who died a d      could not help blackening the author when he mentioned the work his words are these  and if grotius was more especially assisted by the valuable performance of a writer otherwise justly of ill fame i mean faustus socinuss little book de auctoritate s scripturae this assistance etc  d charge to the clergy of st davids p     here the admirable faustus a man of as much piety and as good morals as has lived since the apostles time who truly and godly served the almighty and everlasting god through our lord and savior jesus christ is painted by this eminent hand a man of ill fame and for no other reason but because his heavenly religion made him oppose the orthodox heresy of three gods as taught in the creed of athanasius and piously labor by the purity of his doctrine and example to keep the world from corruption  let us then be careful to confess the holy unitarian faith let us take the advice of socinus and be original christians let there not be in our religion a god compounded of three supreme spirits equal in power and all possible perfections let us worship the invisible father the first and chief almighty being who is one supreme universal spirit of peerless majesty and as the inspired apostles direct let us worship him through his most glorious image the man christ jesus our redeemer and mediator our king and our judge  n b though the reverend dr heathcote has been very unfriendly in his account of the christians he calls socinians in his observations before mentioned yet you are not from thence to conclude that he belongs to the orthodox party he is far from it and therefore i recommend to your perusal not only his cursory animadversions upon free and candid disquisitions and his finer boylelecture sermons on the being of god but also his cursory animadversions upon the controversy concerning the miraculous powers and his remarks on chapmans credibility of the fathers miracles they are three excellent pamphlets the first is against the scholastic trinity and the others on the side of doctor middleton against the miracles of the fathers  note reader dr heathcotes two pamphlets on the side of dr middleton and the rev mr tolls admirable pieces in vindication of the doctor against the miracles of the fathers will give you a just and full idea of the late controversy mr tolls pieces are called  a defense of dr middletons free enquiry  remarks upon mr churchs vindication  and his sermon and appendix against dr churchs appeal  and if you would see all that can be said in relation to this matter get likewise dr sykes two previous questions and the two previous questions impartially considered by the same author  remarks on two pamphlets against dr middletons introductory discourse  two letters to the rev mr jackson in answer to his remarks on middletons free inquiry  and a view of the controversy concerning the miraculous powers supposed to have subsisted in the christian church through several successive centuries  these pamphlets will bind into two large octavo volumes and make a valuable collection of critical religious learning  note reader of that admirable work called bibliotheca fratrum polonorum by socinus crellius sclichtingius and wolzgoenius   tomes fol irenopoli      the first and second volumes are the writings of socinus the third and fourth by crellius the fifth by sclichtingius and the sixth by wolzogenius they are all well worth your reading as they contain the most valuable and excellent learning and especially socinus and crellius in another place where you will find me alone in a solitude i shall give some curious extracts from the works of these great injured men and a summary of their lives  section viii when loves well timed it is not a fault to love the strong the brave the virtuous and the wise sink in the soft captivity together  the author returns to harrogate and from thence goes to cleator in westmoreland to wait upon miss spence from knaresborough i went to harrogate again and there found the following letter of an old date left for me  sir as you told me you intended to go to london soon and business obliges me to ride up to the capital a few weeks hence i should take it as a great favor if you would make westmoreland your way and through lancashire to the chester road that i may have your protection and guidance in this long journey  i am sir your humble servant maria spence cleator six miles to the southwest of whartonhall  this letter surprised me yes dear creature i said i will make westmoreland my way to london at four in the morning i mounted my horse and rid to cleator i arrived there at six in the evening and had traveled that day    miles to wit from harrogate to boroughbridge   from thence to catarric    to gretabridge    to bows   to brugh in westmoreland    to kirkbysteven near whartonhall   to cleator       miles i dined at catarric on a hot pigeonpye just drawn and ale of one ear that is admirable as rabelais means by the phrase we had wine of one ear alluding to the one shake of the head to the right shoulder when a thing is excellent and i gave the horses another feed of corn at bows the george kept by railton the quaker an excellent inn and the master of it an instructive and entertaining orator i mention these things for your benefit reader that you may know where to stop to advantage if you should ever ride over the same ground i went that day while i waited at the inn till the horses had eaten their corn the landlord brought me a paper dropped by a lady he knew not some days before at his house he added it was a curiosity and worth my serious consideration  a morning and evening prayer almighty and everliving god have mercy on me forgive me all my sin and make my heart one to fear thy glorious fearful name jehovah guide me with thy counsel i beseech thee and be the strength of my life and my portion for ever  o lord jehovah defend me from the power and malice the assaults and attempts of all my adversaries and keep me in health and safety in peace and innocence these things i ask in the name of jesus christ thy son our lord and in his words i call upon thee as our father who art in heaven etc  observations relative to miss dudgeon s prayer this prayer pleased me very much in the most beautiful manner as well as in a few words it expresses all we need ask from heaven and if miss dudgeon of richmondshire was the composer of it as i have been assured since upon enquiry i here place it to her honor as a monument of her piety and sense and in hopes the illustrious of her sex will use so short and excellent a form of devotion in their closets morning and night  there is an expression in this prayer which for some time i could not well comprehend the meaning of that is make my heart one but on considering it i found it supported by the greatest authorities  among the sayings of pythagoras one is be simply thyself reduce thy conduct to one single aim by bringing every passion into subjection and acquiring that general habit of selfdenial which comprehends temperance moderation patience government and is the main principle of wisdom be simply thyself and so curb desire and restrain the inclinations and control the affections that you may be always able to move the passions as reason shall direct let not every foremost fancy or every forward appearance have the least mastery over you but view them on every side by the clear light of reason and be no further influenced by the imaginations of pleasure and apprehensions of evil than as the obvious relations and nature of things allow let the result of a perception which every rational mind may have of the essential difference between good and evil the be cause or ground of obligation this will add greatly to quiet and be productive of much real felicity it will render every present condition supportable brighten every prospect and always incline us more to hope than to fear this is the doctrine of pythagoras  i likewise find that david expresses the same thought in the   th psalm ver    which is rendered in the bible translation unite my heart to fear thy name  in the common prayer book o knit my heart unto thee that i may fear thy name but the hebrew is  make my heart one to fear thy name meaning let the fear of thee be the one ruling disposition of my soul in opposition to the doubleminded man which the hebrew elegantly expresses by a heart and a heart one that draws to the riches pleasures and honors of this world and another to the practice of all virtue  as to the other part of the prayer which has the words  glorious  fearful  jehovah  whereas in the   th psalm it is only said  to fear thy name the author certainly took them from the   th chapter of deuteronomy ver    the design of the dreadful threatenings in this chapter set before the people is there thus expressed  that thou may fear this glorious and fearful name jehovah thy god in our translation the lord thy god and therefore i think these words are very finely used in this prayer  it is amazing to me says the rector of st mabyn that throughout the bible the translators have every where changed the word jehovah for the word lord when god himself gave the word jehovah as his name to be uttered and as in this word the whole mystery of the jewish and christian dispensations seem to have been wrapped up  say to the people ami jehovah i am jehovah ye shall know that i jehovah am your god which brings you out from under the burdens of the egygtians exodus vi     and deuteronomy vi   hear o israel jehovah our god is one jehovah  then as to this words comprehending the two dispensations a good writer observes that though god was known to his true worshippers by many other names as god almighty the high god the everlasting god etc yet jehovah was his one peculiar name a name which he had appointed to himself in preference to all others and by which he declared by moses he would be distinguished for the time to come  and as of all the names of god this seems to be the most expressive of his essence as it can only be derived from the root which signifies to be and denotes the one eternal selfexistent being from whom all other things derive their being and on whom they must depend  as the word does likewise signify makes to be what was promised or foretold and by such meaning declares as often as the word is repeated that jehovah our god is not only selfexistent and the creator of the world but him in whom all divine prophecies and predictions center it follows in my opinion that we should utter this awful name in our addresses to god and not like the jews through a superstition omit it and use another instead of it  n b the rector of st mabyn is the rev mr peters and the passage is to be found in an excellent preface to the octavo edition of his admirable dissertation on the book of job in reply to that part of the divine legation of moses demonstrated in which the author my lord of gloucesier sets himself to prove that this book is a work of imagination or dramatic composition no older than ezra the priest whom he suppofes to be the writer of it in the year before christ     or the year     in the  0th year of the reign of artaxerxes king of persia when daniels seventy weeks begins that is the period of   0 years that were to be fulfilled before the passion of our savior and further according to the author of the legation that this allegorical drama or poem was written to squiet the minds of the jewish people under the difficulties of their captivity and to assure them as represented by the person of job of those great temporal blessings which three prophets had predicted  now in the preface to the book aforementioned in answer to all this and fully and beautifully answered it is you will find i say the passage relating to the word jehovah and more than i have quoted from it  as to pythagoras the samean mentioned in this note on account of his saying  be simply thyself  he was famous in the  0th olympiad as jamblicus informs us that is his elikia or reign offame began in the first year of this olympiad which was the year before christ   0 for  0 x   gives   0      leaves        the plus years of the olympiad i e          0  and he died in the  th year of the  0th olympiad that is the year before christ     for  0 x      0      remains     there are no plus years to be added here as it happened in the  th or last year of the olympiad this philosopher was contemporary with and a near friend to the renowned phalaris who was murdered in the year before christ     when the belshazzar of daniel ascended the throne of babylon and as pythagoras lived to the age of  0 according to diogenes he must have been born in the beginning of the reign of nebuchadnezzar the year this conqueror took jerusalem and its king zedekiah which was olymp     and of consequence before christ   0 for    x             remains   0     0 this was    years before thespis invented tragedy olymp     seldens comment on the arundel marble and    years before the birth of aeschylus the reformer of tragedy cyrus was then in the  0th year of his age  it is likewise evident from hence that pythagoras must have lived through the reigns of cyrus cambyses and the greatest part of the reign of darius histaspes who slew smerdis the magi and is called in scripture abasuerus the king of persia who married esther and ordered haman the amalekite to be hanged on the gallaws he had erected for mordecai the jew in the year before christ   0  note david was before pythagoras     years  reader as to the word elikia which i have used to express the reign or time of flourishing of pythagoras i have an observation or two to make in relation to it which i think worth your attending to  clemens alexandrinus says  stromata p  0  that is the years from moses to solomons elikia are   0 to wit mosess life    0 from his death to davids accession    0 davids reign   0   0  from this passage it is plain that the elikia of solomon is not meant of his nativity but of the beginning of his reign when he was    years of age  it is then very surprising that dodwell should insist upon it that elikia always signifies nativity it is the more wonderful as dodwell quotes this passage from clement and as it is impossible to make out   0 without coming to the   d of solomon as i have reckoned it  nay in another place of the stromata clement says isaiah hosea and micah lived after the elikia of lycurgus where he can only mean the time when that lawgiver flourished for from the destruction of troy to the akme of lycurgus was   0 years and from solomon in whose time troy was taken to the time of the prophets was   0 years  thus does learning accommodate things dodwell wanted to fit a passage in antilochus to his own calculation and so     years from the elikia of pythagoras that is says dodwell from the nativity of the philosopher he meant taking the word in that sense to the death of epicurus brings us exactly to the time who can forbear smiling a favorite notion is to many learned men a sacred thing dodwell settles his passage in antilochus to his mind by perverting the word elikia  this to be sure in profane things can do no great harm but when the practice is brought into things sacred it is a detriment to mankind some divines for example to support a notion as unreasonable as it is dear to them tell us that the word isos signifies strict equality not like and that when st paul says  we must construe it jesus christ was strictly equal to the most high god this is sad construction when homer euripides aeschylus make the word isos to import no more than like isanemos swift as the wind isatheos phos like a god isanerios like a dream  and when a divine is positive that os and kathos as and even as words occurring in the new testament signify a strict equality and not some sort of likeness this is miserable perversion and hurts the christian religion very greatly as they endeavor by such a given sense to prove that the man christ jesus is to be honored with the same divine honors we offer to god the father almighty by the command and example of jesus who was sent from god and was a worshipper of god who lived obedient to the laws of god preached those laws and died for them in the cause of god who was raised from the dead by god and now fits on gods right hand intercedes with god and in his gospel owns his father to be his and our only true god this is sad accommodation though the words never signify more than a degree of likeness in the greek classics yet our headstrong orthodox monks will have them to mean strict equality and alexander the great and alexander the coppersmith are the same being amazing gentlemen here is but one ball and out of itself you shall see this one ball send forth two other balls big as it and yet not lose one atom of its weight and grandeur hocus pocus reverendissimi spectatores the one is three  and now gentlemen be pleased to observe the miracle reversed pilluli pilluli congregate presto presio unite observate signori dottissimi the three are one  such is the becus pocus the monks have made of their trinity       when i came to miss spences door i sent in my name by a servant and immediately maria came out herself to welcome me to cleator she told me she was glad to see me and extremely obliged to me for riding so many miles out of my way to travel up with her to london but as she had never been further from home than harrogate and was afraid of going such a journey by herself she writ to me in hopes curiosity and my great complaisance to the ladies might induce me to take cleator in my way to town though so much about but as so many weeks had passed since she came away from the wells and she heard nothing of me she had laid aside all expectation of my coming this made the visit the more pleasing  in answer to this i replied that if i had got her letter sooner i would have been with her long before but that was not possible as i had been at a little lodge and farm of mine in the northern extremity of westmoreland to settle things there and returned to harrogate but yesterday when i had the honor of receiving your letter and upon reading it set out at daybreak this morning to kiss your hand and execute any commands  the manner of passing the evening at cleator the first night i was there    here an excellent hot supper was brought in and after it miss spence said she was surprised to hear i was an inhabitant of westmoreland as she had never heard of me in the north nor seen me at harrogate before the other day  i told her i was a stranger in the county and by a wonderful accident as i traveled a few years ago out of curiosity and in search of a friend up stanemorehills i became possessed of a lodge i had on the northern edge of westmoreland where i lived a considerable time and once imagined i should never leave it as it is the most romantic and the most beautiful solitude in the world  while i was giving this short relation miss spence seemed greatly amazed and her uncle an old clergyman who had looked with great attention at me hoped it would be no offense to ask me how old i was  none at all sir i replied i want some months of twentysix and though i dance and rattle at the wells and am now going up to london where all is tumult and noise yet my passion for still life is so great that i prefer the most silent retreat to the pleasures and splendors of the greatest town if it was in my power to live as i please i would pass my days unheard of and unknown at ortonlodge so my little silent farm is called near the southern confines of cumberland with some bright partner of my soul i am sure i should think it a complete paradise to live in that distant solitude with a woman of miss spences form and mind  but tell me i request maria said how did you get to the confines of westmoreland over stanemore hills and what was that accident that put you in possession of ortonlodge it must be a curious account i am sure  this i replied you shall hear tomorrow morning after breakfast there is not time for it now all i can say at present is that it was love kept me among the mountains for some years and if the heavenborn maid vastly like you miss spence she was had not by the order of heaven been removed to the regions of immortality and day i should not have left the solitude nor would you ever have left the solitude nor would you ever have seen me at harrogate but destiny is the dirigent mutable is the condition of mortals and we are blind to futurity and the approaches of fate this led me over the vast mountains of stanemore enabled me to cross the amazing fells of westmoreland and brought me to that spot where i had the honor and happiness of becoming acquainted with miss spence thus did we chat till eleven and retired to our chambers  but the old gentleman the doctor when he came with me into my apartment told me we must have one bottle more for it was his nightcap without which he could not sleep he then bid the servant make haste with it and when that was out we had another he was a sensible agreeable man and pleased me very much as he appeared a zealous friend to the illustrious house of hanover whereas almost all the clergymen i had been in company with since i came to england were jacobites and very violent ones  a conversation relating to the revolution and exclusion of james ii    i remember among other things i asked this divine over our wine  if popery is ever so corrupt could men be debarred of their rights for an attachment to it  are not crowns hereditary  and is not treason in our country stamped with so peculiar an infamy as involving the delinquents innocent children in the forfeitures or penal consequences that await it on purpose to check the rebellion of britons by such an accumulated punishment of evil doers  to this the doctor replied that the exclusion of a popish prince must be lawful if we ought to secure our property and religion and as in duty bound oppose his trampling upon the laws and his own solemn declarations if the people have privileges and interests they may defend them and as justifiably oppose notorious domestic oppressions as foreign invasions the head of the community has no more a license to destroy the most momentous interests of it than any of the inferior members or than any foreign invader if a king has no passion to indulge incompatible with the welfare of his people then as protection and obedience are reciprocal and cannot subsist the one without the other it must be a crime in the people not to honor and obey and assist the royal authority it is not only the interest but the duty of the subject to obey the prince who is true to the important trust reposed in him and has the welfare of the people at heart but such a king cannot be a papist the romish prince will not only stretch a limited prerogative into lawless power and grasp at absolute monarchy but will break through the most sacred ties and subvert the rights he was sworn to guard to reestablish popery in this kingdom could james the second have kept the seat of government and baffled all opposition we may conclude from what he did from his trampling upon the laws and his own solemn declarations from his new court of inquisition the high commission court to subvert the constitution of the church of england and to lay waste all its fences against popery from that furious act of his power which fell on magdalencollege and his two cruel acts of parliament in ireland  repeal of the act of settlement by which the protestant gentlemen were deprived of their estates and the act of attainder by which they were to be hanged for going to beg their bread in another country after they had been robbed of all in their own by their king who had sworn to protect them from hence i say it is plain that if james could have sat firm upon the throne his misguided conscience would have induced him to the most inhuman acts of violence he would have proceeded to the barbarities and rekindled the flames of mary had he continued to reign over these kingdoms it is most certain that instruction and persuasion only would not have been the thing but where instruction and persuasion failed imprisonments tortures death would have been used to compel us to believe all the gross absurdities of rome their impieties go god and contradictions to common sense we must throw away our reason and our bibles the noblest gifts of heaven and neither think nor speak but as we are bid by men no wiser than ourselves or we must expire under torments as great as the devil and the monks could devise it was therefore necessary for the preservation of our church and state to exclude james and his popish heirs the common welfare required this salutary precaution the collected interest of the community is the primary end of every law  all this i said seems quite right to be sure during that short twilight of power which dawned upon popery in england in the years      and  0 its rage was imprudent it did discover its fury and resentment in one of the irish acts you have mentioned more than  000 people were attainted and some of them the most noble and venerable characters in ireland yet had success attended the arms of james this would have been but the beginning of sorrows and probably a son of christian rome would have proscribed more in these two islands than in heathen rome out of the whole vast roman empire were given up to destruction for their virtue by the cruel triumvirate augustus antony and lepidus and of consequence since dear experience convinced it was equally absurd and vain to imagine that a popish head would govern a protestant church by any councils but those of popish priests as it was to imagine that a popish king would govern a protestant state by any councils but those of popish counselors it must therefore be owned that the lords and others assembled at nottingham were just in declaring that king jamess administrations were usurpations on the constitution and that they owned it rebellion to resist a king that governed by law but to resist a tyrant who made his will his law was nothing but a necessary defense this to be sure is just but still if crowns are hereditary and one severe punishment of treason was intended to check all rebellion were we not a little too hasty in the affair of the revolution and might we not have expected something better from the good sense and good nature of james if we had waited a while till he could see the folly of his proceedings  to this the doctor replied that as to jamess good sense it never appeared he had any and in respect of his many real good qualities they were extinguished by his bigotry and could never be of service to a protestant spirit the spirit of freemen it was therefore incumbent on them who knew and loved the invaluable blessings they enjoyed to act as they did that is as the wisdom of our constitution requires in such cases  as to the crowns being hereditary  and the severe punishment of treasons  in respect of the first particular there is no natural or divine law declares crowns hereditary if a certain rule of succession has been established in most kingdoms the single point of view in it was public good or a prevention of those intestine commotions which might attend an election but as every rule is dispensible and must give way when it defeats the end for which it was appointed should the customary succession in a kingdom prove at any time productive of much greater evils than those it was intended to obviate it may questionless be superseded occasionally this point is evident from reason though the crown in our own country is generally hereditary yet that right is to be set aside if the security of our civil and religious liberty requires it if the pretense of james was a right to dominion in opposition not only to the sense of the legislature but to that of the nation then the popish prince was justly excluded for denying the public good to be the supreme law had the right he claimed been established then our religion our liberties and the safety of our fortunes had been no longer our own in case of such establishment the glory of our constitution was no more the sum of the matter is the royal family of the steuarts being roman catholics makes their case similar to an extinction of it  and as to the accumulated punishment of treason in great britain that can only be designed as a powerful check to rebellion against a king whose darling view is the welfare of the people no infamy forfeitures or death can be too severe for the man who rebels against a prince that governs for the good of the people and endeavors to transmit our state safe to posterity to plot against such a sovereign is a great crime indeed to conspire against a prince whose life is of the utmost consequence to the community is an enormity that ought to be stamped with a peculiar infamy and punished in the severest manner but it can be no treason to act against a papist who violates every maxim of our constitution and by every maxim of popery labors to destroy our religion and liberties every man may repel unlawful attempts upon his person and property and is armed by god with authority for selfdefence  to this it was replied that i thought the doctor quite right and for my own part was determined to oppose a popish prince whenever he comes on with his unalienable and indefeasible claim to introduce his absurd and cruel religion to deprive us of our rational christianity and make us slaves instead of freeborn subjects no popish james to write our themes but filling a bumper may this nation be ever happy in a king whose right is founded upon law and who has made it the rule of his government may britons ever remember the merciless rage of popery and the envious malice of france each ready to lay waste the whole fabric of our excellent constitution and cry aloud with all the embittered sons of edom down with it down with it even to the ground  here the clock struck one and we parted  a description of cleator    early the next morning i was up according to my wont and walked out to look at the place cleator is one of the finest spots that can be seen in a wild romantic country the natural views are wonderful and afford the eye vast pleasure the charming prospects of different kinds from the edges of the mountains are very fine  the winding hills pretty plains vast precipices hanging woods deep vales the easy falls of water in some places and in others cataracts tumbling over rocks  form all together the most beautiful and delightful scenes all the decorations of art are but foils and shadows to such natural charms  in the midst of these scenes and in a theatrical space of about two hundred acres which the hand of nature cut or hollowed out on the side of a mountain stands cleatorlodge a neat and pretty mansion near it were groves of various trees and the water of a strong spring murmured from the front down to a lake at the bottom of the hill  character of maria spence    this was miss spences country house here the wise and excellent maria passed the best part of her time and never went to any public place but harrogate once a year in reading riding fishing and some visits to and from three or four neighbors now and then her hours were happily and usefully employed history and mathematics she took great delight in and had a very surprising knowledge in the last she was another of those ladies i met with in my travels who understood that method of calculation beyond which nothing further is to be hoped or expected i mean the arithmetic of fluxions  very few men among the learned can consider magnitudes as generated by motion or determine their proportions one to another from the celerities of the motion by which they are generated i question if the critical reviewers can do it i am sure they cannot though they have made so licentiously free with me they may however pretend to know something of the matter and so did berkley late bishop of cloyne in ireland yet that prelate in reality understood no more of the method than a porter does though he presumed to write against it and the divine newton the inventor of it i say it but maria spence in the   th year of her age at this time was a master in the fluxionary way she had not only a clear and adequate notion of fluxions but was able to penetrate into the depths of this science and had made sublime discoveries in this incomparable method of reasoning she astonished me i thought mrs burcott and mrs fletcher mentioned in my first volume p     were very extraordinary women on account of their knowledge in algebra and the sine answers they gave to the most difficult problems in universal arithmetic but this sort of reasoning is far inferior to the fluxionary method of calculation as the latter opens and discovers to us the secrets and recesses of nature which have always before been locked up in obscurity and darkness by fluxions such difficulties are resolved as raise the wonder and surprise of all mankind and which would in vain be attempted by any other method whatsoever what then must we think of a young woman well skilled in such work  not only able to find the fluxions of flowing or determinate quantities that is the velocities with which they arise or begin to be generated in the first moments of formation called the velocities of the incremental parts and the velocities in the last ratios as vanishing or ceasing to be but from given fluxions to find the fluents  and be ready in drawing tangents to curves in the solution of problems de maximis and minimis that is the greatest or least possible quantity attainable in any case in the invention of points of inflection and retrogression in finding the evoluta of a given curve in finding the caustic curves by reflection and refraction etc etc  this was amazing beyond any thing i had seen or did ever see since except mrs benlow of richmondshire with whom i became acquainted in      see memoirs of several ladies of great britain vol i with astonishment i beheld her i was but a young beginner or learner in respect of her though i had applied so close to fluxions after i had learned algebra that my head was often ready to split with pain nor had i the capacity at that time to comprehend thoroughly the process of several operations she performed with beauty simplicity and charming elegance admirable maria no one have i ever seen that was her superior in this science one equal only have i known the lady a little before mentioned and does not this demonstrate that the faculties and imagination of womens minds properly cultivated may equal those of the greatest men a reflection on the education of the women and since women have the same improvable minds as the male part of the species why should they not be cultivated by the same method why should reason be left to itself in one of the sexes and be disciplined with so much care in the other learning and knowledge are perfections in us not as we are men but as we are rational creatures in which order of beings the female world is upon the same level with the male we ought to consider in this particular not what is the sex but what is the species they belong to and if women of fortune were so considered and educated accordingly i am sure the world would soon be the better for it it would be so far from making them those ridiculous mortals moliere has described under the character of learned ladies that it would render them more agreeable and useful and enable them by the acquisition of true sense and knowledge to be superior to gayety and spectacle dress and dissipation they would see that the sovereign good can be placed in nothing else but in rectitude of conduct as that is agreeable to our nature conducive to wellbeing accommodate to all places and times durable selfderived indeprivable and of consequence that on rational and masculine religion only they can rest the soal of the foot and the sooner they turn to it the happier here and hereafter they shall be long before the power of sense like the setting sun is gradually forsaking them that power on which the pleasures of the world depend they would by their acquired understanding and knowledge see the folly of pleasure and that they were born not only to virtue friendship honesty and faith but to religion piety adoration and a generous surrender of their minds to the supreme cause they would be glorious creatures then every family would be happy  but as to miss spence this knowledge with a faultless person and a modesty mor graceful than her exquisite beauty were not the things that principally charmed me nor was it her conversation than which nothing could be more lively and delightful nor her fine fortune it was her manners she was a christian deist and considered benevolence and integrity as the essentials of her religion she imitated the piety and devotion of jesus christ and worshipped his god and our god his father and our father as st john expressly styles the god of christians xx    she was extremely charitable to others and considered conscious virtue as the greatest ornament and most valuable treasure of human nature excellent maria  the authors departure    with this young lady and her two servants her footman and her woman i went up to london from cleator for london july         we set out from cleator the   st day of july and without meeting with any mischief in all that long way came fafe to london we were nine days on the road and as the weather was fine and our horses excellent we had a charming journey my companion was so agreeable that had it been two thousand miles from cleator to london instead of     i should still have thought it too short her conversation was so various and fine that no way could seem tiresome and tedious to him that traveled with her her notions and remarks were ever lively and instructive it was vast pleasure to hear her even on the driest and most abstruse subjects on account of the admiration her discourse raised and the fine knowledge it communicated to one who understood her i will give an instance     in riding over the mountains the first day we missed the road in the evening and instead of getting to a very good inn where we intended to rest we were forced to stop at a poor little public house and right glad to get in there as the evening was tempestuous and wet dark and cold here we got some bacon and fresh eggs for supper and the ale was good which amused us well enough till nine oclock we then proposed to play at cribbage for an hour and called for a pack of cards but they had none in the house and we were obliged to divert ourselves with conversation till it was time to retire miss spence began in the following manner  a discourse on fluxions was newton sir or leibnitz the author of that method of calculation which lends its aid and assistance to all the other mathematical sciences and that in their greatest wants and distresses i have heard a foreigner affirm that the german was the inventor of fluxions  that cannot be i replied in the year      dr barrow received from mr newton a demonstration of the rule of the quadrature of curves which the doctor communicated to mr collins and as this is the foundation of fluxions and the differential calculus it is evident mr newton had invented the method before that time  in the beginning of the year      leibnitz was in england again in october      and the interval of this time he spent in france during which he kept a correspondence with oldenburgh and by his means with j collins and sometimes also with newton from the last of whom he received a letter dated june         wherein is taught the method of reducing quantities into infinite series that is of exhibiting the increments of flowing quantities this method was utterly unknown to leibnitz before he received the abovesaid letter of newtons as he himself acknowledges in a letter to oldenburgh dated august         for before that time he says in his letter he was obliged to transform an irrational quantity into a rational fraction and then by division after the method of mercator to reduce the fraction into a series  it is likewise certain that leibnitz did not then understand these series because in the same letter he desires newton would explain to him the manner how he got these series and again in a second letter from newton to leibnitz dated october         he gives yet clearer hints of his method and illustrates it by examples and lays down a rule by which from the ordinates of certain curves their areas may be obtained in finite terms when it is possible  by these lights and assisted by such examples the acute leibnitz might have learned the newtonian method  it is plain he did so for in      he first published in the leipsic acts his elements of the differential calculus without pretending to have had the method before the year      the year he received the two letters from newton and yet when sir isaac published his books of the number of curves of the first kind and of the quadrature of figures the editors of the acts said leibnitz was the first inventor of the differential calculus and newton had substituted fluxions for differences just as honoratus faber in his synopsis geometrica had substituted a progression of motion for cavalleriuss method of indivisibles that is leibnitz was the first inventor of the method newton had received it from him from his elements of the differential calculus and had substituted fluxions for differences but the way of investigation in each is the same and both center in the same conclusions  this excited mr keil to reply and he made it appear very plain from sir isaacs letters published by dr wallis that he newton was the first inventor of the algorith or practical rules of fluxions and leibnitz did no more than publish the same with an alteration of the name and manner of notation this however did not silence leibnitz nor satisfy the foreigners who admired him he abused dr keil and appealed to the royal society against him that they would be pleased to restrain the doctors vain babblings and unjust calumniations and report their judgment as he thought they ought to do that is in his favor but this was not in the power of the society if they did justice for it appeared quite clear to a committee of the members appointed to examine the original letters and other papers relating to the matter which were left by mr oldenburgh and mr j collins that sir isaac newton was the first inventor of fluxions and accordingly they published their opinion this determines the affair when this is the case it is senseless for any foreigner to say leibnitz was the author of fluxions to the divine newton belongs this greatest work of genius and the noblest thought that ever entered the human mind  it must be so  maria replied as the case is stated sir isaac newton was most certainly the inventor of the method of fluxions and supposing leibnitz had been able to discover and work the differential calculus without the lights he received from newton it would not from thence follow that he understood the true method of fluxions for though a differential has been and to this day is by many called a fluxion and a fluxion a differential yet it is an abuse of terms a fluxion has no relation to a differential nor a differential to a fluxion the principles upon which the methods are founded show them to be very different notwithstanding the way of investigation in each be the same and that both center in the same conclusions nor can the differential method perform what the fluxionary method can the excellency of the fluxionary method is far above the differential  this remark on the two methods surprised me very much and especially as it was made by a young lady i had not then a notion of the difference and had been taught by my master to proceed on the principles of the differential calculus this made me request an explication of the matter and maria went on in the following manner  magnitudes as made up of an infinite number of very small constituent parts put together are the work of the differential calculus but by the fluxionary method we are taught to consider magnitudes as generated by motion a described line in this way is not generated by an apposition of points or differentials but by the motion or flux of a point and the velocity of the generating point in the first moment of its formation or generation is called its fluxion in forming magnitudes after the differential way we conceive them as made up of an infinite number of small constituent parts so disposed as to produce a magnitude of a given form that these parts are to each other as the magnitudes of which they are differentials and that one infinitely small part or differential must be infinitely great with respect to another other differential or infinitely small part but by fluxion or the law of flowing we determine the proportion of magnitudes one to another from the celerities of the motions by which they are generated this most certainly is the purest abstracted way of reasoning our considering the different degrees of magnitude as arising from an increasing series of mutations of velocity is much more simple and less perplexed than the other way and the operations founded on fluxions must be much more clear accurate and convincing than those that are founded on the differential calculus there is a great difference in operations when quantities are rejected because they really vanish  and when they are rejected because they are infinitely small the latter method which is the differential must leave the mind in ambiguity and confusion and cannot in many cases come up to the truth it is a very great error then to call differentials fluxions and quite wrong to begin with the differential method in order to learn the law or manner of flowing  with amazement i heard his discourse and requested to know by what master and what method she obtained these notions for they were far beyond every thing on the subject that i had ever met with what she said concerning the nature and idea of fluxions i though just and beautiful and i believe it was in her power to show the bases on which they are erected  an account of martin murdoch my master sir  maria answered was a poor traveller a scotchman one martin murdoch who came by accident to my fathers house to ask relief when i was about fifteen years old he told us he was the son of one of the ministers of scotland and came from the remotest part of the highlands that his father taught him mathematics and left him at his death a little stock on a small farm but misfortunes and accidents obliged him in a short time to break up house and he was going to london to try if he could get any thing there by teaching arithmetic of every kind my father who was a hospitable man invited him to stay with us a few days and the parson of our parish soon found that he had not only a very extraordinary understanding but was particularly excellent at figures and the other branches of the mathematics my father upon this agreed with him to be my preceptor for five years and during four years and nine months of that time he took the greatest pains to make me as perfect as he could in arithmetic trigonometry geometry algebra and fluxions as i delighted in the study above all things i was a great proficient for so few years and had murdoch been longer with me i should have been well acquainted with the whole glorious structure but toward the end of the fifth year this poor archimedes was unfortunately drowned in crossing one of our rivers in the winter time and went in that uncomfortable way in the thirtysixth year of his age to the enjoyment of that felicity and glory which god has prepared for a virtuous life and honest heart why such men as the poor and admirable murdoch have often such hard measure in this world is not in my power to account for nor do i believe any one can but what i tell you is one of those surprising things and i lamented not a little the loss of such a master still however i continued to study by many written rules he had given me and to this day mathematics are the greatest pleasure of my life  as to our method my master in the first place made me perfectly understand arithmetic and then geometry and algebra in all their parts and improvements the methods of series doctrine of proportions nature of logarithms mechanics and laws of motion from thence we proceeded to the pure doctrine of fluxions and at last looked into the differential calculus in this true way my excellent master led me and in the same difficult path every one must go who intends to learn fluxions i would be but lost labor for any person to attempt them who was unacquainted with these precognita  when we turned to fluxions the first thing my master did was to instruct me in the arithmetic of exponents the nature of powers and the manner of their generation we went next to the doctrine of infinite series and then to the manner of generating mathematical quantities this generation of quantities was my first step into fluxions and my master so amply explained the nature of them in this operation that i was able to form a just idea of a first fluxion though thought by many to be incomprehensible we proceeded from thence to the notation and algorithm of first fluxions to the finding second third etc fluxions the finding fluxions of exponential quantities and the fluents from given fluxions to their uses in drawing tangents to curves in finding the areas of spaces the valves of surfaces and the contents of solids their percussion oscillation and centers of gravity all these things my master so happily explained to my understanding that i was able to work with ease and found no more difficulty in conceiving an adequate notion of a nascent or evanescent quantity than in forming a true idea of a mathematical point in short by the time i had studied fluxions two years i not only understood their fundamental principles and operations and could investigate and give the solution of the most general and useful problems in the mathematics but likewise solve several problems that occur in the phenomenon of nature  here maria stopped and as soon as astonishment would permit me to speak i proposed to her several difficult questions i had heard but was not then able to answer i requested her in the first place to inform me how the time of a bodys descending through any arch of a cycloid was found and if ten hundred weight avoirdupoise hanging on a bar of steel perfectly elastic and supported at both ends will just break the bar what must be the weight of a globe falling perpendicular     feet on the middle of the bar to have the same effect  my next questions were how long and how far ought a given globe to descend by its comparative weight in a medium of a given density but without resistance to acquire the greatest velocity it is capable of in descending with the same weight and in the same medium with resistance  and how are we to find the value of a solid formed by the rotation of this curvilinear space a c d about the axis a d the general equation expressing the nature of the curve being   how is the center of gravity to be found of the space enclosed by an hyperbola and its asymptete and how are we to find the center of oscillation of a sphere revolving about the line p a m a tangent to the generating circle f a h in the point a as an axis  these questions maria answered with a celerity and elegance that again amazed me and convinced me that notwithstanding the right rev metaphysical disputant dr berkley late bishop of cloyne in ireland could not understand the doctrine of fluxions and therefore did all he could to disgrace them and the few mathematicians who have studied magnitudes as generated by motion yet the doctrine as delivered by the divine newton may be clearly conceived and distinctly comprehended that the principles upon which it is founded are true and the demonstrations of its rules conclusive no opposition can hurt it  when i observed that some learned men will not allow that a velocity which continues for no time at all can possibly describe any space at all its effect they say is absolutely nothing and instead of satisfying reason with truth and precision the human faculties are quite confounded lost and bewildered in fluxions a velocity or fluxion is at best we do not know what  whether something or nothing and how can the mind lay hold on or form any accurate abstract idea of such a subtle fleeting thing  disputants  maria answered may perplex with deep speculations and confound with mysterious disquisitions but the method of fluxions has no dependence on such things the operation is not what any single abstract velocity can generate or describe of itself but what a continual and successively variable velocity can produce in the whole and certainly a variable cause may produce a variable effect as well as a permanent cause a permanent and constant effect the difference can only be that the continual variation of the effect must be proportional to the continual variation of the cause the method of fluxions therefore is true whether we can or cannot conceive the nature and manner of several things relating to them though we had no ideas of perpetually arising increments and magnitudes in nascent or evanescent states the knowledge of such things is not essential to fluxions all they propose is to determine the velocity or flowing wherewith a generated quantity increases and to sum up all that has been generated or described by the continually variable fluxion on these two bases fluxions stand  this was clear and just and showed that the nature and idea of fluxions is agreeable to the nature and constitution of things they can have no dependence upon any metaphysical speculations such speculations as that antimathematician my lord of cloyne brought in to cavil and dispute against principles he understood nothing of and maliciously run the account of them into the dark but are the genuine offspring of nature and truth an instance or two may illustrate the matter    a heavy body descends perpendicularly        feet in a second and at the end of this time has acquired a velocity of    feet in a second which is accurately known at any given distance then from the place the body fell take the point a in the right line and the velocity of the falling body in the point may be truly computed but the velocity in any point above a at ever so small a distance will be less than in a and the velocity at any point below a at the least possible distance will be greater than in a it is therefore plain that in the point a the body has a certain determined velocity which belongs to no other point in the whole line now this velocity is the fluxion of that right line in the point a and with it the body would proceed if gravity acted no longer on the bodys arrival at a   take a glass tube open at both ends whose concavity is of different diameters in different places and immerse it in a stream till the water fills the tube and flows through it then in different parts of the tube the velocity of the water will be as the squares of the diameters and of consequence different suppose then in any marked place a plane to pass through the tube perpendicular to the axis or to the motion of the water and of consequence the water will pass through this section with a certain determinate velocity but if another section be drawn ever so near the former the water by reason of the different diameters will flow through this with a velocity different from what it did at the former and therefore to one section of the tube or single point only the determinate velocity belongs it is the fluxion of the space which the fluid describes at that section and with that uniform velocity the fluid would continue to move if the diameter was the same to the end of the tube   if a hollow cylinder be filled with water to flow freely out through a hole at the bottom the velocity of the effluent will be as the height of the water and since the surface of the incubent fluid descends without stop the velocity of the stream will decrease till the effluent be all out there can then be no two moments of time succeeding each other ever so nearly wherein the velocity of the water is the same and of consequence the velocity at any given point belongs only to that particular indivisible moment of time now this is accurately the fluxion of the fluid then flowing and if at that instant more water was poured into the cylinder to make the surface keep its place the effluent would retain its velocity and still be the fluxion of the fluid such are the operations of nature and they visibly confirm the nature of fluxion it is from hence quite clear that the fluxion of a generated quantity cannot retain any one determined value for the least space of time whatever but the moment it arrives at that value the same moment it loses it again the fluxion of such quantity can only pass gradually and successively through the indefinite degrees contained between the two extreme values which are the limits thereof during the generation of the fluent in case the fluxion be variable but then though a determinate degree of fluxion does not continue at all yet at every determinate indivisible moment of time every fluent has some determinate degree of fluxion that is every generated quantity has every where a certain rate of increasing a fluxion whose abstract value is determinate in itself though the fluxion has no determined value for the least space of time whatever to find its value then that is the ratio one fluxion has to another is a problem strictly geometrical notwithstanding the right rev antimathematician has declared the contrary in his hatred to mathematicians and his ignorance of the true principles of mathematics if my lord of cloyne had been qualified to examine and consider the case of fluxions and could have laid aside that unaccountable obstinacy and invincible prejudice which made him resolve to yield to no reason on the subject  not to regard even the great maclaurins answer to his analyst  he would have discovered that it was very possible to find the abstract value of a generated quantity or the contemporary increment of any compound quantity by the binomial theorem the ratio of the fluxion of a simple quantity to the fluxion of that compound quantity may be had in general in the lowest terms and as near the truth as we please whilst we suppose some very small increment actually described and whereas the ratio of these fluxions is required for some one indivisible point of the fluid in the very beginning of the increment and before it is generated we make in the particular case the values of the simple increments nothing which before was expressed in general then all the terms wherein they are found vanish and what is left accurately shows the relation of the fluxions for the point where the increment is supposed to commence as the abstract value of the fluxion belongs only to one point of the fluent the moments are made to vanish after we have seen by their continual diminution whither the ratio tends and what it continually verges to and this becomes as visible as the very character it is written in  but dr berkley was unacquainted with mathematical principles and out of his aversion to these sciences and zeal for orthodoxy cavilled and disputed with all his might and endeavored to bring the matter to a state unintelligible to himself and every body else  here maria had done and for near a quarter of an hour after i sat silently looking at her in the greatest astonishment  but as to our travels the  0th of august we got safe to london and the consequence of the journey was that the last day of the same month i had the honor and happiness of being married to this young lady  section ix i am thinking with myself every day says one of the philosophers how many things are dear to me and after i have considered them as temporary and perishable i prepare myself from that very minute to bear the loss of them without weakness  cleanthes cleanthes was a native of assus in lysia in asia minor and so very poor when he came to athens to study that for his support he wrought at nights in drawing water for the gardens and in grinding behind the mill he attended the lectures of zeno succeeded him in his school and grew into very high esteem with the athenians he lived to    but the year he died we know not his master zeno died     years before christ and had conversed with socrates and plato  the ancient academics were plato the disciple of socrates speucippus zenocrates polemo crates and crantor and from crates the fifth academic sprung the old stoics to wit crates zeno cleanthes chrysippus and diogenes the babylonian not he that was surly and proud cicero in his works often mentions this babylonian the stoic we find in the roman history that he was living in the year of rome     that is     years before christ but when he died we know not these gentlemen of the two old schools were to be sure great philosophers  excellent men but then to be strictly impartial we must own that all they knew in relation to the will of god and a kingdom to come was but poor moral learning in respect to what is written in the new testament for our instruction if we will lay aside our fancies and systems and let reason explain revelation the christian religion is really more for the glore of god and the good of mankind than reason without inspiration has been able to teach christianity without the additions and supplements of monks is not only above all just exception but preferable to any other scheme    the death of the authors  th wife and his behavior thereupon    wise is the man who prepares both for his own death and the death of his friends who makes use of the foresight of troubles so as to abate the uneasiness of them and puts in practice this resolution of the philosopher i thought of this the morning i married the beautiful and ingenious miss spence as related in the latter end of my eighth section and determined if i lost her to make the great affliction produce the peaceable fruits of righteousness the man must feel in such a case the christian will submit before the end of six months she died and i mourned the loss with a degree of sorrow due to so much excellence endearment and delight my complaint was bitter in proportion to the desires of nature but as nature says let this cup pass grace says let thy will be done if the flower of all my comfort was gone  the glory departed yet thy glory is o man to do the will of god and bear the burden he lays upon thee let nature grace and time do their part to close the wound and let not ignorance impeach the wisdom of the most high the cup which my father has given me shall i not drink i will i will not quarrel with providence in short i resigned and not long after i had buried this admirable woman who died at her seat in westmoreland i went into the world again to relieve my mind and try my fortune once more what happened there i will report when i have related the extraordinary case of my wife miss spence and the four physicians i had to attend her it is a very curious thing  the case of a lady in a fever and an account of four physicians who attended her    this young lady was seized with that fatal distemper called a malignant fever something foreign to nature got into her blood by a cold and other accidents it may be and the luctus or strife to get clear thereof became very great the effervescence or perturbation was very soon so violent as to show that it not only endangered but would quickly subvert the animal fabric unless the blood was speedily dispersed and nature got the victory by an exclusion of the noxious shutin particles the thirst the dry tongue the coming causus were terrible and gave me too much reason to apprehend this charming woman would sink under the conflict to save her if possible i sent immediately for a great physician dr sharp a man who talked with great fluency of medicine and diseases  this gentleman told me the alkaline was the root of fevers as well as of other distempers and therefore to take off the effervescence of the blood in the ebullitions of it to incide the viscous humor to drain the tartarous salts from the kidneys to allay the preternatural ferment and to brace up the relaxed tones he ordered orange and vinegar in whey and prescribed spirit of sulphur and vitriol the cream chrystals and vitriolate tartar in other vehicles if any thing can relieve it must be plenty of acid in acidis posita est omni curatio but these things gave no relief to the sufferer  i sent then in all haste for dr hough a man of great reputation and he differed so much in opinion from sharp that he called an acid the chief enemy it keeps up the luctus or struggle and if not expelled very quickly will certainly prove fatal our sheet anchor then must be the testacea in vehicles of mineral water and accordingly he ordered the absorbent powders to conflict with this acidity the principal cause of all diseases pearl and coral crabs eyes and crabs claws he prescribed in diverse forms but they were of no use to the sick woman she became worse every hour  dr pym was next called in a great practitioner and learned man his notion of a fever was quite different from the opinions of sharp and hough he maintained that a fever was a poisonous ferment or venom which seized on the animal spirits it breaks and smites them and unless by alexipharmics the spirits can be enabled to gain a victory in a day or two this ferment will bring on what the greeks call a synochus that is a continual fever in that state the venom holds fast the animal spirits will not let them expand or disengage themselves and then they grow enraged and tumultuating are hurried into a state of explosion and blow up the fabric hence the inflammatory fever according to the diverse indoles of the venom and when the contagious miasms arrive at their highest degree the malignant fever arises the spirits are then knocked down and the marks of the enemies weapons the spots etc appear this the doctor continued is the case of your lady and therefore the thing to be done is to make the malignant tack about to the mild and produce an extinction of the ferment and relief of the symptoms this i endeavor to do by alexipharmics and vesicatories and by subduing the poison by the bark and the warmer antidotes thus did my doctor marshal shall his animal spirits fight them against the enemy venom to great disadvantage if his talk was not romance it was plain his spirits were routed and venom was getting the day his alexipharmics and warm antidotes were good for nothing the malady increased  this being the case i sent again in haste for a fourth doctor a man of greater learning than the other three and therefore in opinion opposite and against their management of the fever this great man was dr frost he was a mechanician and affirmed that the solid parts of the human body are subjected to the rules of geometry and the fluids to the hydrostatics and therefore to keep the machine in right order that is in a state of health an aequilibrium must be maintained or restored if destroyed the balance must not turn to one side or the other to restore sanity in acute cases and in chronic too our business is to prevent the vessels being elevated or deprest beyond the standard of nature when either happens the division of the blood is increased the motion is augmented and so beget a fever there cannot be an inordinate elevation of the oily or fiery parts of the blood till the vessels vibrate above the standard of nature  in a slight fever the blood increases but little above the balance but if more than one day turns to a synochus which is but the same fever augmented beyond the balance of nature this turns to a putrid synochus and this to a causus this is the case of your lady from an elevated contraction the doctor contitinued to my amazement her blood obtains a greater force and motion hence greater division hence an increase of quantity and fluidity and thus from greater division motion and quantity increased arises that heat and thirst with the other concomitant symptoms of her fever for the blood dividing faster than it can be detached through the perspirastory emunctories of the skin is the immediate cause of the hearts preternatural beating and this preternatural division of the blood arises from the additional quantity of obstructed perspirable matter added to the natural quantity of the blood  things being so the doctor went on and the fever rising by the bloods dividing faster than can be detached by the several emunctories and this from an elevation of the solids bove the balance we must then strive to take off the tension of the solids and subtract the cause this makes me begin in a manner quite contrary to the other physicians and i doubt not but i shall soon get the better of the fury and orgasm make an alteration in the black scabrous tongue and by according with the modus of nature throw forth the matter of the disease i will enable nature to extricate herself i hope to disentangle her from the weight  thus did this very learned man enlarge and while he talked of doing wonders the dry and parched skin the black and brushy tongue the crusty fur upon the teeth and all the signals of an incendium within declared her dissolution very near as the serum diminished fast and the intestine motion of the crassamentum increased nature was brought to her last struggles all the dismal harbingers of a general wreck appeared to give the bystanders notice of approaching death she died the ninth day by the ignorance of four learned physicians  had these gentlemen confidered the fever no otherwise than as a disease arising from some unusual ferment stirred up among the humors of the blood disturbing both those natural motions and functions of the body hindering perspiration and thereby giving quick and large accession to such parts of the aliment or liquors taken down as are disposed to ferment and there is always a strong disposition that way for the blood has a threefold motion  fluidity common to all liquors  protrusive from the impulse of the heart and arteries  and fermentative that is a motion throughout of all its parts which quality is owing to the dissimilar parts of the blood  for being a compound of various particles there must be a colluctation when they occur and of consequence a continual fermentation as this is just and moderate it is for the good of the animal and purifies the blood if it is too much it tends to a fever  if it still increases it produces the burning causus hard is the struggle then and if nature cannot dispume even helped by art the patient has no hazard for life hence it is that we are so subject to fevers  and that it carries away more people than all the rest of the diseases out of every fortytwo that have it twentyfive generally die it was so in the time of hippocrates   0 years before christ and so dr sydenham and dr friend found it in their practice  but i say had my four doctors considered the fever as i have plainly stated it without vainly pretending to be so wise as to know the essential causes of it and in the beginning of it before the terrible appearances the vigil delirium subsultus the dry black tongue the furred teeth and the pale unconcocted urine had caused a depletion by large bleeding had opened the pores by a mild sudorific had then given a vomit rad ipecacuanha in small sackwhey or chickenwater and let the sufferer indulge in that thin diluting liquor an emulsion of the seeds and almonds in barley water and if the patient required it a draught of tablebeer with a toast between whiles had this been done very soon there might be relief as quickly or if the fever still run high to bleed again and wash down some proper alexipharmic powder with a proper cordial julap it is possible nature would have been able to accomplish the work and health had been again restored i use the word proper alexipharmic and proper cordial julap because the theriaca and mithridatium of the shops which are commonly almost always ordered as an alexipharmic bole are rather poisons than useful in a fever and because the tincture and syrup of saffron the treaclewater or any other distilled compound are not fit cordials in the case but it should be the conserva lujulae in an emulsion ex sem fr cum amygd in aq hordei this is the true alexipharmic  and the only cordial to be given in a fever  but it was the destructive alexipharmics and cordials of the shops they forced down marias throat and this with the other bad prescriptions and management killed one of the finest and most excellent women that ever lived  and now to give the world a better idea of this admirable woman than any description of mine can exhibit i shall here place a few religious little pieces which she writ while miss spence and which i found among her papers  moral thoughts written by miss spence morality abstract mathematical or physical truth may be above the reach of the bulk and community of mankind they have neither the leisure nor the necessary helps and advantages to acquire the natural knowledge of arts and sciences the many calls and importunities of the animal kind take up the greatest part of their time thoughts and labor so that the more abstract speculations and experimental disquisitions of philosophy are placed by providence quite out of their reach and beyond their sphere of action  on the contrary moral truth right and wrong good and evil the doing as we would be done by and acting toward all men as they really are and stand related in society these things are as evident to the understanding as light and colors are to the eye and may be called the intellectual moral sense here needs no deep learning or trouble and expense of education but the same truths are as evident and as much seen and felt by the learned and unlearned the gentleman and the ploughman the savage or wild indian as by the best instructed philosopher the divine perfections shine through all nature and the goodness and bounty of the creator to all his creatures impress the obligation of imitating this wisest and best of beings upon every mans heart and conscience  but notwithstanding the maxims of morality are thus solidly established and adapted to all capacities and though every man has a happiness to seek and a main end to secure which must be infinitely preferable to any concerns of life yet here it is we find that mankind in general have been most lost and bewildered as if providence had placed their own happiness and the way to it more out of their power than any thing else how this should happen might seem unaccountable at first sight and yet it can be nogreat mystery to any man tolerably acquainted with the world and human nature it is no difficult matter to discover the reasons hereof and it is withal highly useful to give them their due considerarion    the principal cause i take to be the prevailing strength and bias of private corrupt animal affection and desires reason is silenced and borne down by brutal appetite and passion they resolve to gratify their sensual appetites and desires and will therefore never taste or try the superior pleasures and enjoyments of reason and virtue but such men as these having declared open war against their own reason and conscience and being resolved at all risks to maintain the combat must be selfcondemned and cannot plead ignorance or error of judgment in the case    another fundamental cause of moral error is the prejudice and prepossession of a wrong education false principles and absurd notions of god and religion wrought early into the tender unexperienced mind and there radicated and confirmed from time to time from youth to riper age by parents teachers our most intimate friends and acquaintance and such as we have the best opinion of and confide most in such causes make such strong impressions that the grossest errors thus rivetted and fixed are with the greatest difficulty ever conquered or cleared off in this case men turn out wellgrounded believers and are wellarmed against conviction circumcision or baptism fixes their religion in their infancy and their church is as natural to them as their country free enquiry is with them an apostasy from the orthodox party and as the great and sure trial of their faith and fortitude they will hear no reasonings about the holy religion they have taken upon trust    then the few who have applied themselves to the study of morality have done it for the most part in a manner confused and superficial enough and often so as even to build upon principles either entirely false or obscure and uncertain either foreign to its proper business or mixed up with gross errors and absurdities from whence it comes to pass that in all languages the terms of morality both in common discourse and in the writings of the learned are such as have the most obscure confused indetermined and unfixed ideas of any other terms whatever men for the most part despising the things which are plain and ordinary to run after such as are extraordinary and mysterious and that they either will not know or reject even truth itself unless she brings some charm with her to raise their curiosity and gratify their passion for what is mavelous and uncommon  in sum the prejudices of the understanding the illusions of the heart and the tyranny established in the world with relation to opinions form a grand obstacle to the serious study of morality and to the attainment of a more exact knowledge of our duty nor is it to be expected that any will very much apply themselves to make discoveries in these matters whilst the desire of esteem riches or power makes men espouse the wellendowed opinions in fashion and then seek arguments either to make good their beauty or varnish over and cover their deformity  whilst the parties of men cram their tenets down all mens throats whom they can get into their power without permitting them to examine their truth and falsehood and will not let truth have fair play in the world nor men the liberty to search after it what improvements can be expected of this kind what greater light can be hoped for in the moral sciences the subject part of mankind in most places might instead thereof with egyptian bondage expect egyptian darkness were not the candle of the lord set up by himself in mens minds which it is impossible for the breath of man wholly to extinguish how much soever the infallible guides of one church and the orthodox rulers of another may scheme and labor to subject conscience to human jurisdiction and bring the inward principle and motive of action within the cognizance of their political theocracy or theocratic policy  after all this is it to be wondered at that such whose occupations and distractions of life or want of genius and outward helps do not allow them to engage in long and profound meditations are found to have generally understandings so short and narrow and ideas so false or confused in matters of morality  and since this is the case of the greatest part of mankind it has no doubt been always gods will that they who had the greatest light and whom his providence had furnished with the greatest helps should communicate their knowledge to such as were not able of themselves to acquire it so easily or in so great a degree  religion what is religion the true eternal immutable religion of god and nature consists as i opine in the filial love and fear of god and the brotherly love of mankind in the practice of all those moral duties of truth and righteousness which result from it under a fiducial trust in and dependence on god and the constant sense of his power and presence in all our actions as the rewarder of good and punisher of bad men this is the religion founded in nature and reason and which must be at all times and every where the same as this religion was in a great measure lost and neglected amidst the general ignorance superstition and idolatry of the world it was the great business and design of revelation to restore it and set moral truth and reason in its original light by bringing mankind to the right use of their reason and understanding in such matters  after epicurus and zeno of eclectics there were no new succeeding schemes of morality but each man betook himself to that sect where he found what most suited his own sentiments  in the reign of augustus potamo of alexandria introduced a manner of philosophising which was called the eclectic because it consisted in collecting from all the tenets of preceding philosophers such as appeared most reasonable out of which they formed each man his own system of philosophy  it appears from ciceros works that he was an eclectic  and why should it not be good in religion as well as in philosophy i own i am an eclectic in divinis and the sum of my religion is without regard to modes or parties  so to live to the glory of the father  without attachment to the creature  for the sanctification and happiness of mankind that when this fleeting scene of sin and sorrow shall vanish and pass away from sight the angels of god may give my soul a safe transition to that heavenly happiness which no thought can lay hold on and which no art can describe  of reason and truth the practice of reason and truth is the rule of action to god himself and the foundation of all true religion it is the first and highest obligation of all rational beings and our divine lord came down from heaven to earth to teach it to mankind christ preached a plain doctrine to men fitted to reform their hearts and lives  intended to make them perfect in selfdenial humility love goodness and innocence and to enoble them with hearts raised above the world to worship the father in spirit and in truth  but this glorious religion the romish priests have perverted into a system of mysteries and staring contradictions the better to support the worst and most deplorable purposes of temporal wealth power pride malice and cruelty in direct opposition to reason and common sense we must commence generous believers in an ecclesiastical christianity and confess the symbol of their holy athanasius though it be no more or better than the effects of a luxuriant fancy without likeness and correspondency in the real nature and reason of things      and    are    says convocation to his believers and your religion my brethren is all a tremendous mystery you must adore as such what the infidels renounce as a contradiction  thus shamefully do these priests sink the credibility of our gospel and impose upon the silly people a ball of wax for the religion of jesus making them believe contrary to knowledge and prefer a system that is a lie against the light of nature and the gospel  but the chief end duty happiness and highest perfection that man can arrive at consists and is found in a perfect exercise of human reason  we read in chronicles of integrity that hezekiah began his good reign with the revival of religion which had long suffered by the neglect and profanation or through the neglect and omission of his predecessors to this purpose he opened the doors of the house of the lord and issued a decree that all israel should come to keep the passover which they had not done of a long time but as the legal cleansing and purifying could not be performed by great numbers that did eat the passover by the appointed time on account of many things and particularly the force of long interval and disuse therefore this irregularity employed the devotion of the good king as the canon of the passover under the strictest prohibition and the severest penalty forbid any one to eat that did not come with outward and legal purity no unclean person shall eat of it and he prayed for the people saying the good lord pardon every one that prepares his heart to seek god the lord god of their fathers though he be not cleansed according to the purification of the sanctuary and the lord hearkened unto hezekiah says the next verse and healed the people that is took off the penalties of the canon and gave them the benefit of the rite from hence it follows that however defective we may be in outward rites and ceremonies of a church yet inward truth and purity will be accepted in default of outward things inward disposition is the substance of religion and may compound for the want of outward matters but outward service can never be accepted instead of inward purification  and it farther follows if the outward solemnities of religion cannot be obtained upon lawful terms which is the case of many in respect of popery and athanasian worship then will the good lord pardon and be propitious to those who prepare their heart to seek him though they be not cleansed according to the solemn institution and ritual purification  this text is in the vulgar latin dominus bonus propitiabitur cunctis qui in toto cord requirunt dominum deum patrum suorum et non imputabit eis quod minus sanctificati sunt  the good lord will be propitious to all those who in their whole heart seek the lord god of their fathers and will not impute to them their being less sanctified than they ought  of priestcraft in the transmission of movables from the deceased to the living note this article relating to the encroachments of the clergy was not found among miss spences papers but is inserted here as in a proper place histories in all ages the full of the encroachments of the clergy yet they all omit one of the most successful stratagems to ingross money we are indebted to our statutebook for informing us of one of the most notorious pieces of priestcraft that ever was practiced would one believe that there is a country and in europe too where the clergy gained such an ascendant over the minds of the people as tamely to suffer the moveable estate of every man who died intestate to be swallowed up by them yet so prevalent was superstition in our country that it produced a law preferring the bishop to the next of kin and in its extension excluding the children the wife and the relations of the deceased nay the creditor and giving all to the bishop per aversionem such was the shameful rapacity of the clergy here for ages such a monstrous practice was established upon this foundation that the moveable effects of every deceased person his own appointment failing ought to be laid out for promoting the good of his soul and so the ordinary took possession without deigning to account with any mortal  this began temp hen i when the ordinary for the good of the soul of the deceased obtained a directing power and was in the nature of an overseer and somewhat more in the time of king john the ordinary drew blood as bacon well expresses it discourse of laws p   and    and new abridgement of the law p      for though the possession was as formerly yet the dividend must be in the view of the church and by which means the dividers were but mere instruments and the right was vanished into the clouds but temp hen iii it was settled the ordinary had not only gotten the game but gorged it both right and possession were now become the clergys the ordinary was to distribute it according to pious uses and no use so pious as to appoint to himself and his brethren  the  st statute that limited the power of the ordinary was   th ed i c    by this the ordinary was obliged to satisfy the intestates death so far as the goods extended  and   st ed iii cap   the actual possession was taken from the ordinary by obliging him to give a deputation to the next and most lawful friends of the intestate for administrating his goods but this statute proved but a weak check to the avarice of the clergy means were fallen upon to elude it by preferring such of the intestates relations who were willing to offer the best terms this corrupt practice was suffered in the days of hen viii when the clergy losing ground the statute    hen viii was enacted bearing that in case any person die intestate or the executors refuse to prove the testament the ordinary shall grant administration to the widow or to the next of kin or to both taking surety for true administration  this statute as it points out the particular persons who are entitled to letters of administration without leaving any choice to the ordinary was certainly intended to cut him out of all hope of making gain of the effects of persons dying intestate but the church does not easily quit its hold means were fallen upon to elude this law also though the possession given by this statute was wrested out of the hands of the ordinary yet his pretensions subsisted entire of calling the administrator to account and obliging him or her to distribute the effects to pious uses this was an admirable engine in the hands of a churchman for squeezing money an administrator who gave any considerable share to the bishop to be laid out by him without doubt in pious uses would not find much difficulty in making his account this rank abuse moved the judges solemnly to resolve that the ordinary after administration granted by him cannot compel the administrator to make distribution new abridgement of the law p     and at last the right of the next of kin was fully established by statute    and    car ii cap  0 this cuts out the ordinary entirely  of the athanasian creed if i thought the athanasian creed was a part of the religion of jesus i should be induced to entertain a hard thought of christianity i should think it enjoined a slavish submission to the dictates of designing men and instead of a reasonable service required us to renounce our understandings to apostatize from humanity and degenerate into brutes by giving up our reason which alone distinguishes us from them most unjust charge upon our holy religion a religion which enlarges our rational faculties filling the mind with an astonishing idea of an eternal duration and thereby giving us a contempt of the mean transient pleasures of this life and which we and the brutes enjoy in common a religion that requires only the highest degree of reverence toward the most high the most refined purity of heart and mind and the most noble and diffusive charity toward all mankind in short that establishes righteousness upon earth and entire obedience to the will of god that so having put the oil into our lamp according to the gospel parable it may not only measure the course of time but light us beyond it to the coming of the bridegroom and the morning of eternity  but this will not do for the doctors they must have established credenda for judgments of all sizes  they must have a formulary of dogmatic theology  an athanasian jumble to support the holy church though their creed burlesques mathematical certainty and renders their ecclesiastical christianity inferior to the ancient pagan religion a trinity is the ecclesiastical god but whether three distinct conscious beings of coordinate power equal independency and unorigination and so three proper deities  or only three symbols of natural powers  in this the doctors are not agreed but the majority are for the three proper deities this heresy of three gods we must subscribe to or the priests will number us with the infidels and do us all the mischief they can  hence it comes to pass that humanity sweetness of temper and moderation are banished from society religion like a cloak is made use of to authorize hatred violence and injustice and the christian religion as the priests have forged it and show it off that is upon its present footing as an establishment is pernicious to mankind and ought to go that the people may be restored again to christs religion and be led to attend to the command of god which is to believe in the name of his son jesus christ and to love one another  faith faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen heb xi   that is faith is such a firm persuasion as gives as it were a substance or present existence to the good things which we hope for and which are not yet in being and as engages us to depend upon the truth of unseen things as really as upon ocular demonstration   he endured as seeing him who is invisible ver    that is moses as really believed the being and attributes of the invisible god as if he had seen him with his eyes and fully depended upon his conduct and assistance  the better thing provided for christians and these all having obtained a good report through faith received not the promise god having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect heb xi     0 that is  though the upright under the law have a good character in scripture and of consequence were accepted of god upon the account of their faith in the divine power and goodness yet they received not the promised reward of another life immediately on their leaving this world god provided this better thing for us christians that we should be made happy immediately as soon as we leave this world that so they might not be made happy in heaven till christianity commenced and christians should be there received to happiness with them  note   it is plain from what the apostle says before that the thing promised is the better and more enduring substance in heaven    the better thing provided for christians cannot be the resurrection from the dead and the being after that received into the heavenly jerusalem since herein we shall have nothing better than the good people who lived under the law therefore better things can only mean our enjoyment of god immediately upon our leaving this world  it is strange then that bishop fell and whitby say the better thing means the messiah or the heavenly country to be fully possessed at the end of the world  of the same opinion is pyle  he says our pious ancestors under the law though in a state of rest and happiness after death yet received not the full and complete enjoyment of celestial glory that being deferred till the last and great dispensation of the messiah be past that so they and sincere christians may be all rewarded and crowned together with the happiness both of body and soul at the final day of judgment but if so tell me mr pyle where is the better thing provided for us christians    besides if the apostle may be his own interpreter the word perfect means the intermediate state of good souls in paradise and not the complete state after the resurrection in the next chapter he speaks of the spirits of the just made perfect by which he means undoubtedly the separate souls now in glory  in a word the design of the apostle was to prove that since god has provided some better thing for us we appear to be more in his favor and therefore the argument from their being justified to our being justified by faith is stronger that is such a faith as has an operative influence by rendering our lives a comment upon the blessed nature of god  and that this was the meaning of the apostle in the something better provided for us christians appears yet plainer from the consequence drawn by the inspired writer to wit that we ought with the greater patience and courage to endure persecution since god has provided something better for us than for them if the ancient believers held out who expected but a state of sleep till the time of the general resurrection much more should we patiently suffer affliction and even death itfelf for the sake of truth and of the gospel when we know that god has promised us something better to wit that we shall be conducted to paradise immediately after death and be there spirits of just men made perfect and be with christ which is far better than either to sleep after death or to live longer in this world  let us lay aside then every weight and the sin which does so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us let us put away every thing from us that would hinder us from improving in virtue and goodness looking to and imitating jesus the leader and captain of the faithful and an example of spotless virtue and perfect obedience the love of the world is enmity with god and to place our affections here is to vilify that better provision which he has made for us we are but strangers and pilgrims here the human state is but a passage not a place of abode it is a station of exercise and discipline and was not designed for the place of enjoyment that happy country is before us  avoidings avoid all indirect arts in the pursuit of a fortune  all unlawful methods in selfpreservation  and every gratification that militates with reason and benevolence  the offices of a christian these are heavenlymindedness and contempt of the world and choosing rather to die than commit a moral evil such things however are not much esteemed by the generality of christians most people laugh at them and look upon them as indiscretions therefore there is but little true christianity in the world it has never been my luck to meet with many people that had these three necessary qualifications  and as for the people exclusive of their going to church to make a character  or to ogle one another  or out of superstition to perform so much opus operatum a job of lipservice which they idly fancy to be religion they i mean the great and the small might as well be heathens as christians for any real christian purpose they answer in a strict adherence to the three offices aforementioned the name of christian sounds over europe and large parts of asia africa and america but if a christian is what st paul defines it to wit a man that is heavenlyminded that contemns the world and would die rather than commit a moral evil then is the number of christians very small indeed  the meaning of john vi    no man can come to me except the father draw him that is  no one can be a christian unless his regard for the deity and natural religion inclines him to receive a more improved scheme of religion  but dr young in one of his sermons explains this text in the following manner  no one can live up to the religion of jesus and reach christian perfection unless the father enlightens and enables him by the operative influence of his holy spirit we can do nothing in respect of what ought to be done to be more than nominal christians without the inward principle of sanctification  this i think is mere methodism  n b the excellent dr lardner expounds the text in the following words  no man will come to me and receive my pure sublime and spiritual doctrine unless he have first gained some just apprehensions concerning the general principles of religion and if a man have some good notions of god and his perfections and his will as already revealed he will come unto me if any man is well disposed if he has a love of truth and a desire to advance in virtue and religious knowledge he will readily hearken to me and believe in me sermons vol i p  0   of baptism in the name of the father son and holy spirit what is the meaning of baptizing them into the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost  it signifies receiving men by baptism to the profession and privileges of that religion which was taught by the father son and spirit that is which the father taught by the son in his lifetime and by the spirit after his ascension  or to be baptized is solemnly to profess our resolution to adhere to that holy doctrine which is the mind and will of god the father published to the world by his son whom he sent from heaven for that purpose and confirmed by the power of the holy ghost  note an able writer st hillary says  de trinitate lib   ad calcem on matt xxviii    that baptising in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit signifies  in confession of the author of all things and of the only begotten and of the gift  of christian idolatry what a surprising incident is idolatry in the church of christ that after the religion of jesus had accomplished its glorious design and subverted idolatry and superstition throughout the world it should itself be wounded almost to death by the enemy it had subdued this is the case all over the realms of popery and can they be said to have any true religion among them where the theology of athanasius prevails  churchism and creeds i have no very good opinion of creeds jesus christ came with a legatarian power from god the supreme being to declare his will to mankind and the great work to be done so far as i can find in the gospel is the perfecting our minds in all that is truly excellent by laboring to excel in all the virtues of the gospel by loving the whole race of mankind with an universal charity and striving to add to the satisfaction and happiness of all about us and with whom we have any connection  section x thou

in a room the waiter showed me into and had each of them a porringer of mutton broth one of them seemed a little consumptive creature about four feet six inches high uncommonly thin or rather exsiccated to a cuticle his broth and bread however he supped up with some relish he seemed to be past threescore his name was ribble  the other was a young man once very handsome tall and strong but so consumed and weak that he could hardly speak or stir his name was richmond he attempted to get down his broth but not above a spoonful or two could he swallow he appeared to me to be a dying man  while i beheld things with astonishment the servant brought in dinner a pound of rump stakes and a quart of green peace two cuts of bread a tankard of strong beer and a pint of port wine with a fine appetite i soon dispatched my mess and over my wine to help digestion began to sing the following lines   i tell me i charge you o ye fylvan swains who range the mazy grove or flowery plains beside what fountain in what breezy bower reclines my charmer in the noontide hour ii soft i adjure you by the skipping fawns by the fleet roes that bound along the lawns soft tread ye virgin daughters of the grove nor with your dances wake my sleeping love iii come rosalind o come and infant flowers shall bloom and smile and form their charms by yours by you the lilly shall her white compose your blush shall add new blushes to the rose iv hark from yon bowers what airs soft warbled play my soul takes wing to meet the enchanting lay silence ye nightingales attend the voice while thus it warbles all your songs are noise v see from the bower a form majestic moves and smoothly gliding shines along the groves say comes a goddess from the golden spheres a goddess comes or rosalind appears while i was singing these lines and all the while i was at dinner the gentlemen looked with wonder at me and at last as soon as i was silent old ribble expressed himself in the following words  you are the most fortunate of mortals to be sure sir a happy man indeed you seem to have health and peace contentment and tranquillity in perfection you are the more striking when such spectacles as my cousin richmond pointing to the dying gentleman in the room and i are in contrast before you i will tell you our stories sir in return for your charming song and hope what i am going to say may be of service to you as you are coming on and we going off from this world  the picture of beau richmond my kinsman there the dying richmond in that chair was once a sampson and the handsomest man of his time though the remains of beauty or strength cannot now be traced by drinking and whoring he brought himself to what you see to a state that eludes all the arts of medicine he has an aggravated cough which produces a filthy pus of an ash color streaked with blood and mixed with filaments torn from his lungs and membranes and with the utmost difficulty he respires he has a perpetual violent pain in his breast a pricking soreness in his paps when he coughs and defects in in all his functions he has that flux of the belly which is called a lientery and the fluids of his body are wasted in colliquative sweats a stretching pain racks him if he lies on either side by reason of some adhesion of the lungs to the pleura his hair is fallen off and his nails you see are deadcoloured and hooked his countenance you observe is hippocratical the very image of death his face a dead pale his eyes sunk his nose sharp his cheeks hollow his temples fallen and his whole body thin like a skeleton what a figure now is this once curled darling of the ladies it was done good sir by the hand of intemperance  the picture of a temperate man born with a consumption    as to myself  ribble continued i brought a confumption into the world with me and by art have supported under it i was born with the sharp shoulders you see which are called pterogoides or winglike and had a contracted thorax and long chest a thin and long neck a flaccid tone of all the parts about the breast and a very flabby contexture of the muscles all over my body but nevertheless by a strict temperance all my life and by following the directions of dr bennet in his theatrum tabidorum i have not only made life tolerable but so removed the burden of stagnant phlegm from the thorax by throwing it down by stool and up by expectoration  exhaling it sometimes through the skin and at other times digesting it with fasting that i contrive more useful hours to myself than the strong and young can enjoy in their continued scenes of dissipation and riot in me is seen the wonderful effect of rule and sobriety i am now past fifty several years notwithstanding my very weak and miserable constitution and by attending to nature and never indulging in gratification or excess am not only able to live without pain but to divert life by experimental philosophy  ribble went on i came down to this pleasant place chiefly for the benefit of poor richmond my kinsman whom you see with his eyes shut before you the very picture of death and also with a view to do some good to myself as it is the finest air in the world i took a house in the village to live the more easily as the lodginghouses are all crowded here and resolved to amuse the days i have left in cultivating the science of chemistry not in order to finish what nature has begun do you see me as the alchymists talk and procure to the imperfect metals the much desired coction but to examine substances and by the examination obtain ideas of the bodies capable of the three degrees of fermentation spiritous acetous and putrid and of the products of those fermentations to wit ardent spirits acids analogous to those of vegetables and animals and volatile alkalis  to this purpose i made for myself a laboratory and about a year ago began to employ my vessels and furnaces in various processes a vast variety of entertaining things have since occurred and my life is thereby made agreeable and pleasing though to look at my poor frame one would think me incapable of any satisfactions i will give you an instance or two of my amusements and do you judge if they may not afford a mind more delight than the tumultuous joys of love and wine horseracing cockfighting hunting and other violent pleasures can yield  a history of metals    you know good sir i suppose that there are six metals two perfect and four imperfect gold and silver perfect the others copper tin lead and iron quicksilver is by some called a seventh metal but that i think cannot be as it is not malleable yet it is not to be confounded with the semimetals as it differs from the metals no otherwise than by being constantly in fusion which is occasioned by its aptness to flow with such a small degree of heat that be there ever so little warmth on earth there is still more than enough to keep mercury in fusion it must be called then in my opinion a metallic body of a particular kind and the more so let me add as art has not yet found out a way of depriving it wholly of its phlogiston  what phlogiston is i must observe to you good sir in order to be intelligible in what i am saying that the phlogiston in metals is the matter of fire as a constituent principle in bodies it is the element of fire combined with some other substance which serves it as a basis for constituting a kind of secondary principle and it differs from pure fixed fire in these particulars that it communicates neither heat nor light  it causes no change but only renders body apt to fuse by the force of a culinary fire  and it can be conveyed from body to body with this circumstance that the body deprived of the phlogiston is greatly altered as is the body that receives it  what semimetals are and as to the semimetals which i mentioned you will be pleased to observe that they are regulus of antimony bismuth zinc and regulus of arsenic they are not malleable and easily part with their phlogiston zinc and bismuth are free from the poisonous quality but arsenic is the most violent poison especially the shining crystalline calx of it or flowers raised by the fire and named white arsenic and regulus of antimony is likewise a poison not in its nature but because it always contains a portion of arsenic in its composition  the nature and composition of antimony antimony is of a pretty white bright color and has the splendour opacity and gravity of a metal but under the hammer crumbles to dust a moderate heat makes it flow and a violent fire dissipates it into smoke and white vapors they adhere to cold bodies and when the farina is collected we call these vapors flowers of antimony  what butter of antimony is butter of antimony good sir that wonderful corrosive is a compound made by distilling pulverized regulus of antimony and corrosive sublimate the production on operation is a white matter thick and scarce fluid which is the regulus of antimony united with the acid of sea salt here the corrosive sublimate is decompounded the mercury revivified and the acid combined with it quits it to join the regulus of antimony because its affinity with it is greater  little ribble the chemist went on and with difficulty i could refrain from laughing not on account of the mans talking nonsense for his discourse was the very reverse of that but by reason of the gripe he had of my arm the pulls he gave me if i happened to look another way and the surprising eagerness with which he spoke which showed that he was chemically struck to an amazing degree  liver of antimony but liver of antimony good sir is made of equal parts of nitre and antimony on the mixtures being exposed to the action of fire a violent detonation ensues and the deflagrating nitre consumes the sulphur of the antimony and even a part of its phlogiston a greyish matter remains after the detonation and this is what we call liver of antimony it contains a fixed nitre a vitriolated tartar and the reguline part of antimony vitrified  how antimony separates gold from other metals the principal use the chemists make of antimony is to separate gold from the other metals all metals gold excepted have a greater affinity with sulphur than the reguline part of antimony as to gold it is incapable of contracting any union with sulphur if therefore i have a mass compounded of various metals and want to get the gold out i melt it with antimony and as soon as it flows every thing in the mass which is not gold unites with the sulphur in or of the antimony and causes two separations that of the sulphur of antimony from its reguline part and that of the gold from the metals with which it was mixed this produces two new combinations the metals and the sulphur in fusion being lighter rise to the surface and the gold and the reguline part of antimony being heaviest the combination of them sinks to the bottom now the business is to part these two and to this purpose i expose the combination to a degree of fire capable of dissipating into vapors all the semimetal the mass contains the reguline being volatile goes off by the great heat and my gold remains pure and fixed in my crucible  the excellence of antimonial wine as to the antimonial wine made by the essence of antimony that is by impregnating the most generous white wine with the minims or lests of antimony which the physicians have found out it is not the part of a chemist to speak of that and therefore i shall only observe to you that it is the best vomit the best purge and the best thing for a sweat in the world i will tell you good sir what i heard an eminent doctor say of it  affirmo sanctissime nihil inde melius nihil tutius nihil efficacius deprehendi unquam quam tritum illum ac simplicem vini automonialis infusum ex vino albo generoso aromate aliquo stomachico adjecto epotus largiter maximas movit vomitiones in minuta tantum quantitate ad guttas puta viginta aut triginta adhibitus sudores elicit benignos paulo tamen majorae aleum solvit leniter medicamentum paratu quidem facillimum at viribus maximum  and therefore good sir when any thing ails you let me recommend the antimonial wine to you thirty drops will sweat you effectually about forty or fifty purges in a happy manner  the nature of bismuth but as to the second semimetal bismuth it has almost the same appearance as regulus of antimony but of a more dusky cast inclining somewhat to red it requires less heat than antimony to flow and like it and the other semimetals is volatile by the action of a violent fire and under the hammer is dust in fusion it mixes well with all metals and whitens them by union but destroys their malleability in flowing it loses its phlogiston with its metallic form and it has a singular property which the other semimetals have not of attenuating lead so as to make it amalgamatic with mercury so perfectly as to make it pass with it through shamoy leather as soon as the amalgama is made the bismuth goes off or separates but the lead for ever remains united with the mercury  an extraordinary sympathetic ink it is of a solution of the ore of bismuth we make that very curious and useful thing called sympathetic ink which is a liquor of a beautiful color like that of the lilach or pipetree blossom the process in preparing this liquor is tedious and difficult by aqua fortis aqua regis and fire and therefore the ink is rarely to be met with it is not to be had unless some gentleman who makes chemistry his employment gives one a present of a bottle of it as i do now to you in hopes it may some time or other be of singular service to you for i have conceived a great regard for you though i never saw you before as you seem not only more teachable than any i have met with but to delight in the information i give you relating to chemical things  here i returned my chemist many thanks and professed my eternal obligation to him that i could listen for years to him and wished it was possible to become his disciple that i might see him by experiment facilitate the study of a science more entertaining instructive and extensively useful than any other but how dear sir am i to use this ink you are so vastly good as to give me to make it more useful than any other ink could be  i will tell you  ribble replied you must write with this lilachcoloured liquor on good well gummed paper that does not sink and the singularity of the ink consists in its property of disappearing entirely and becoming invisible though it be not touched with any thing whatever and this distinguishes it from all others the writing must dry in a warm air and while it is cold no color can be perceived but gently warming it before the fire the writing gradually acquires a greenish blue color which is visible as long as the paper continues a little warm and disappears entirely when it cools when other sympathetic inks are made to appear by proper application they do not disappear again but this liquor from the ore of bismuth must have the fire or heat kept to it to render it legible if a man writes to his mistress suppose or to a minister of state with lemon juice once the writing has been warmed by the fire and the letters by that means appear the epistle may be afterward read at any time and place but if the ladys father should by accident get your letter written in lilachcoloured liquor it must still remain a secret to him for if on getting it and opening the seal he could see no writing and therefore imagining it was writ with lemon juice or some other sympathetic ink he should hold it himself to the fire or bid his servant hold it to the heat that the letters might be produced and made visible yet the moment bismuthink is taken away from the fire and begins to cool it is as invisible again as a sheet of white paper how serviceable this may be on various occasions may be easily conceived  of zinc but as to our third semimetal called zinc this is so like bismuth to appearance that some have confounded it with zinc though it differs from it essentially in its properties and will unite with all metalline substances except bismuth it is volatile by fire above all things and makes a sublimate of the metallic substances with which it is fused zinc mixed with copper in the quantity of a fourth part produces brass if the zinc is not very pure the composition proves tombac or princes metal  the nature of regulus of arsenic regulus of arsenic the fourth semimetal has a color resembling lead unites readily with metallic substances and renders them brittle unmalleable and volatile the calx of it produced by fire may be made volatile by more fire and in this differs from the calx of all metalline substances for all other calxs are fixed and cannot be moved it has likewise a saline character in which its corrosive quality or poison consists a quality from which the other metallic substances are free when they are not combined with a saline matter these things being noticed in relation to metals and semimetals in general i will now proceed to relate a few curious cases in respect of the metals  the characters of gold gold our first metal has ten sensible criterions it is the heaviest and densest of all bodies the most simple of all bodies the most fixed of all bodies the only body that cannot be turned into scoriae by antimony and lead the most ductile of all bodies so soft as to be scarcely elastic or sonorous must be red hot to melt is dissolvable by sea salt and its preparations but remains untouched by any other species of salts and of consequence not liable to rust as aqua regia and spirit of sea salt do not float in the air unless in laboratories or chemists shops where we find them sometimes it unites spontaneously with pure quicksilver it never wastes by emitting effluvia or exhalations these are the ten sensible properties or characteristics of this metal it is certainly pure gold if it has these criterions and they are of great use in life especially to persons who have to do with that subtle tribe the alchemists  as to the weight of gold it is more than nineteen times heavier than water bulk for bulk and this property is inseparable from it it being impossible to render gold more or less heavy and for this reason the specific gravity of gold if it had no other criterion might demonstrate real gold to make gold other metals must be rendered equiponderant to it and therefore if an alchemist should offer to obtrude a metal on you for gold hang an equal weight of pure and of suspected gold by two threads to a nice balance and on immerging them in water if the alchemists gold be pure the water will retain both pieces in oequilibrio otherwise the adulterate metal will rise and the pure descend  the reason is all bodies lose some of their weight in a fluid and the weight which a body loses in a fluid is to its whole weight as the specific gravity of the fluid is to that of the body the specific gravity of a body is the weight of it when the bulk is given    grains of gold weighed in the air is not the true weight of it for there it loses the weight of an equal bulk of air it weighs only    grains in the water and there it loses the weight of as much water as is equal in bulk to itself that is   grains and as the gold weighs    grains it follows that the weight of water is to that of gold bulk for bulk as   to    that is as the weight lost in the fluid is to the whole weight  and so if a piece of gold and a piece of copper are equiponderant in air yet in water the gold will outweigh the copper because their bulks though of equal weight are inversely as their specific gravities that is the gold must be as much less than the copper as the specific gravity of gold is greater than that of copper and as they must both lose weight in proportion to bulk in water therefore the gold the lesser of the two loses less of its weight than the copper does and consequently outweighs the copper in water i hope this is clear the case is the same in proportion in pure gold and gold mixed with other metals the bulk of the pure gold must be less than that of allayed gold and its weight greater in water though both equiponderate a pound suppose in air  it is very plain sir and i request you will proceed you give me valuable information and oblige me very much this pleased the chemist and the ingenious little ribble went on  as to the simplicity of gold we mean by a simple body that whose minutest part has all the physical properties of the whole mass now dissolve a grain of gold in aqua regia and from a single drop of the solution a particle of gold may be separated and have all the characters of gold except those of magnitude though the separated particle of gold shall only be the millionth part of the grain  or fuse a single grain of gold with a mass of silver and mix the whole together so that the gold shall be equally distributed then take a particle thereof and you will have a particle of perfect gold for dissolve the least part of the mixture in aqua fortis and a quantity of gold will precipitate to the bottom it will bear the same proportion to the grain that the part dissolved did to the whole mass  having mentioned aqua regia and aqua fortis i must to be intelligible say two or three words in relation to them aqua regia is an extract by fire from sea salt and spirit of nitre the acid liquor that comes over from them into the receiver is aqua regis  aqua fortis or spirit of nitre is a nitrous acid separated from its basis nitre by the vitriolic acid aqua regis only will dissolve gold silver is not soluble by aqua regis its proper solvent is the acid of nitre or aqua fortis  but if you want to separate a mass of gold and silver either will do you may dissolve the gold by aqua regia and let the silver remain pure or dissolve the silver by aqua fortis and let the gold remain pure only note in this case of a mixed lump of gold and silver the operation by aqua fortis is preferable for this reason that aqua regis in dissolving the gold takes up likewise a little silver but aqua fortis has not the least effect on gold  and note further that if there be equal parts of gold and silver in the mixture they cannot be parted by aqua fortis it has not then the least effect on the silver which is very strange to make aqua fortis act duly on silver mixed with gold the silver must be at least in a triple proportion to that of the gold the reason of the singular effect is that when the gold exceeds or the parts of both are equal in quantity then as both are intimate united in the mass the parts or minims of the gold coat over the parts of the silver and defend them from the action of the aqua fortis in this case aqua regia must be used to dissolve the gold and leave the silver pure or as aqua regia takes up a little of the silver when it dissolves the gold melt the metalline mass and add as much silver as will make it a triple proportion to the gold then you may by aqua fortis take up all your silver in the dissolution and leave all the gold pure  but as to the third criterion of gold its being the most fixed of all bodies this is evident from the violence of fire having no effect on it an ounce of it exposed for the space of two months in the eye of a glass furnace does not lose half a grain it may from thence be said to be incorruptible  as to golds resisting antimony and not turning into scoriae by its force it is most certain from hence that if you take a mass consisting of gold silver copper the other metals with stones etc and fuse it with antimony the bodies will flow on the surface and be easily blown off by the bellows the antimony all evaporates and leaves the gold alone this is called the last test of gold to try the purity of it if the remaining gold have lost nothing of its weight it is allowed perfectly pure and called gold of twentyfour carats or if it be found     lighter it is said to be twentythree carats fine  the wonderful ductility of gold but as to the ductility of gold this is the most extraordinary property of it the arts of goldbeating and wiredrawing show us things quite amazing in leafgold a grain and a quarter of the metal may be made to cover an area of fifty square inches and if the leaf be divided by parallel lines   00 part of an inch a grain of gold will be divided into five hundred thousand minute squares all discernible by the eye yet this is not the most can be done by the hammer a single grain of gold may be stretched into a leaf that will cover a house and yet the leaf remain so compact as not to transmit the rays of light nor ever admit spirit of wine to transude this however is nothing to the effects of wiredrawing  a gold wire is only a silver one gilt and if you coat a silver cylinder of fortyeight ounces weight with one ounce of gold which is sufficient this cylinder may be drawn out into a wire so very fine that two yards thereof shall weigh only one grain and    yards only    grains so that one grain of gold gilds    yards and of course the ten thousandth part of a grain is above one third part of an inch long and since the third part of an inch is yet capable of being divided into ten lesser parts visible to the eye it is evident that the hundred thousandth part of a grain of gold may be seen without the help of a microscope and yet so intimately do its parts cohere that though the gold wherewith the wire is coated be stretched to such a degree there is not any appearance of the color of silver underneath nor is this all  in supergildings that is to make the richest lace they employ but   ounces of gold to cover or gild    marks of silver that is twentytwo pounds and a half avordupoise weight rounded into the form of a cylinder or roller which has fifteen lines in diameter and twentytwo inches in length and here the stratum of gold which invelopes the ingot that is to be drawn into wire has no more thickness than the fifteenth part of a line which is extremely thin as a line is the twelfth part of an inch  but to make the common goldthread they do not use more than two ounces of gold and sometimes not more than one to gild or cover ingot i have mentioned and then the inveloping stratum is not more in thickness if two ounces be employed than the   th part of a line and if one ounce be used but the  0th part of a line two ounces of gold is generally used in gilding or covering the ingot i have mentioned and vastly thinner must the stratum be when the ingot is drawn till it surpasses the fineness of a hair and the diameter is nine thousand times smaller than what it had in the mass by weighing out half a dram of this thread or wire it is found by measuring the length of the half dram that the ingot of    pounds and    inches long is changed into a length of       0 feet that is ninetysix leagues and     fathom for the half dram of wire or thread measures  0  feet by consequence an ounce of it      feet a mark of it or eight ounces       feet and yet astonishing as this length is for two ounces of bold to be drawn to the gold which covers the silver never ceases to gild it the gold still keeps pace with the wire stretch it to what length the drawers can through the wiredrawing irons and holes much smaller one than another the silver never appears  it does not however rest there before the thread or wire is wound on silk and before they spin it it must be flatted by passing it between steel wheels extremely well polished and this flatting increases its length to more than a seventh part one ingot therefore of   marks or    pounds and    inches long by this increase of a  th part is brought to the length of     leagues that is about  00 english miles  but amazing as this extent is it is not the utmost bounds to which the ductility of gold may be carried one ounce only of gold is sometimes used to cover one ingot and drawn to the length i have mentioned and by the time it has passed the flatting wheels the gold that covers the silver laminae must have its thickness reduced to less than the millionth part of a line that is a twelve millionth of an inch this is beyond the reach of our conception imagination cannot plumb her line so low  but sir i said may not the gold be divided into small grains separate one from another but yet near enough to give their color to the silver though we may not be able to see the thing yet i think it may be imagined the gold on the laminae does not form a continued leaf  experience good sir demonstrates the contrary  that every point of silver has its cover of gold put a piece of this gilt wire in aqua fortis the silver will be dissolved and the gold left a perfect continuous tube it is an amazing thing and shows the astonishing power of the first cause as to the reason of this ductility and why gold in such a manner adheres to silver so as never to part from it if the    pounds of silver gilded with one ounce of gold could be extended by art for ever this is past our finding out it is a secret of nature we cannot form any idea of  calignosa nocte premit deus  ribble went on these are the things most remarkable in relation to gold and i have only to add that as to the manner of getting it it is found sometimes in glebes or clods consisting of gold alone sometimes in a powdry form and then called gold dust or sandgold in the sands and mud of rivers and brooks but most commonly in whitish clods dug out of mines of vast depth and intermixed with silver and various fossils this they reduce by fire to a mass of metal and by aqua regia or aqua fortis the gold is easily taken out of the ore  and as to golds being so yielding and ductile by human art it is to be observed that in return it exerts a greater power on the human mind passive it is in its ductility but more active in its influence on man it is a greater tyrant than a slave it drives repeated millions of the human race to death and hell king of metals as it is bright and glorious to behold and what procures innumerable blessings to mankind yet without the grace of god to moderate the passion for it and to direct the mind in a true use of it it is more dangerous to beings on a trial in a first state than even poverty can be in this lower hemisphere what villainies are daily committed to get it what iniquities daily perpetrated by those who have plenty of it lead us not into temptation should relate as well to too much of it as to a total want of it and it is well prayed  in all time of our wealth good lord deliver us  mr ribbles conclusion containing his religious thoughts and advice in my opinion neither poverty nor riches but a middle state is the thing we should desire it is in this condition we can best live soberly or with a sound mind and conduct ourselves as those who have an intelligent spirit to preside in body too much gold most commonly inverts this order and produces an apostasy that sets the inferior powers in the throne and enslaves the mind to the body it gives the passions the commanding influence and makes reason receive law from appetite  if we look into the world we find too often in this case that wealth is big with innumerable sins the rich are filled with wine wherein is excess and show an unbridled dissoluteness of manners their eyes behold strange women and their hearts utter perverse things instead of regarding the common good they commit the most extravagant injuries of such a hardening nature is too much gold that it tends to make conscience insensible and stupid and renders it for ever unapt for impression then whoredom and wine and new wine take away the heart and men are made to forget the law of god  but having neither poverty nor riches in the calm middle state having all reasonable conveniences we can fairly come by a vast variety of creatures for our food and wine in its season to make glad the heart we may then partake of the bounties of providence with a sober freedom and at the same time can best lay up for ourselves a good foundation or secuity for the time to come that we may lay hold of eternal life  though it is with a prospect of difficulties that all must enter upon religion and with labor and difficulty maintain our ground and acquit ourselves like christians that is resist the devil in all his assaults overcome the world in its ensnaring influence and mortify the irregular inclinations of nature yet in the happy middle state where there is no poverty nor riches that is great wealth we can make everlasting glory and felicity our governing aim and bound our ambition and desires by nothing short of the resurrection of the dead we may live in a full and ready submission of the soul to the authority of gods word things eternal may have the ascendant in our practical judgment and then with pleasure we become followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises  good sir this is all our sowing time and whatsoever a man sows that shall he also reap he that sows to his flesh shall of his flesh reap corruption but he that sows to the spirit shall of the spirit reap everlasting life and therefore whether your lot be cast in the happy middling state or you were born to thousands a year let wisdom be your rule and prefer that happiness which has everlasting duration in the realms of light above to any present good that can come in competition with it do not spend money for that which is not bread  and your labor for that which satisfies not do not employ your pains for that which has vanity written upon it by the word of god by the testimony of the wisest men and by frequent experience but let your principal regard be for your immortal soul when nothing can be given in exchange for the soul implore the light and grace of the good spirit and by the quickening influences of the father of the universe and the exertion of your whole strength let it be the principal labor of your every day to make advances in the divine life and be a blessing to society wherever you come in virtue and charity may you excel  you will pardon old ribble i hope good sir and excuse his addressing himself to you in this manner it is an odd conclusion i own to a discourse on metals and semimetals but it is from an extreme regard i have conceived for you that i talk as i do and presume to call upon you as you are a young man of fortune i suppose to consider seriously of that decree which is the result of unerring wisdom and the will of the rector of the universe to wit that we are all under the law of death and through that gate must pass perhaps at a days an hours warning to the resurrection of the dead to be adjudged to happiness or misery as time has been employed and life spent here this is the decree of the most high god and of consequence it is incumbent on us to prepare for the awful hereafter and endeavor by good actions and a virtuous mind by purity of conscience and an exalted piety to come off well in judgment happy  thrice happy they that do so  here little ribble the chemist had done and i had reason to return him my very hearty thanks for the favor of his whole discourse i was vastly obliged to him for the knowledge he had given me in relation to the philosophy of metals and taking him by the hand promised him that i would ever gratefully remember his moral conclusion this pleased the old gentleman and at four in the afternoon we parted  a charming vale and country house in nottinghamshire the feat of mr moncktes   reflecting on the wonders of the metals which i had heard old ribble so well discourse of and being more intent on what had been told me of these things that i might never forget such useful learning i trotted on for several hours without minding the road and arrived as the sun was setting in a deep and melancholy vale through which a pleasant river run that by the murmur of its streams seemed to be marked out for the rendezvous of the thoughtful who love the deep recesses and embowring woods with the soft thrillings of gliding streams as much as the sprightly court the gayest scenes in this sweet spot i found a pretty country house and not knowing where i was rid up to the door to enquire my way a gentleman who seemed to be about forty immediately appeared let me know i was at a considerable distance from any town and as it was near ten told me i had best rest with him that night and i was most heartily welcome this was humane and civil i accepted the kind invitation and immediately went in with him he brought me into a decent room and gave me a handsome meal we had a couple of bottles after supper talked of a thousand things and then withdrew to wind up the machines he would not let me stir the next morning and after dinner we became well acquainted six days this gentleman prevailed with me to stay at his house and then i left him with regret he was so generous so civil and in every thing so agreeable that i could not avoid admiring him and regarding him to an extreme degree his name was monckton  character of mr monckton   avery monckton had seen the world when he was a young man and by reading much and thinking a great deal had acquired an extensive knowledge and a deep penetration in him the gentleman and the scholar were visible he seemed superior to folly and his philosophy appeared to be an assiduous examination of his ideas fancies and opinions in order to render them true and just his religion consisted in a cheerful submission to the divine pleasure with respect to all things independent of us or absolutely external to us and in a continued exertion of benevolence in doing all the good he could what the theology of sects was and the notions of divines he never minded it was his opinion that an active charity is the only thing that can liken and approve us to the original benevolent mind and that it is reasonable to submit to all his dispensations since the providence of an infinitely perfect being must do all for the best in the whole this was avery monckton esquire in his person he was tall and very thin  this gentleman told me the following remarkable story relating to himself on my asking him if he had ever been married  yes sir he replied when i was about five and twenty a young lady came in my way who had all the external charms that ever adorned a woman and i thought her mind as perfect in goodness of every kind as minds can be on this earth i made my addresses to her and with some difficulty persuaded her to accept of a good jointure and be a wife for she had got it into her head that christian perfection consisted in a virginlife i loved her to an extreme degree and fancied myself beyond mortals happy as her fondness seemed equal to my passion and she expressed it in a most transporting way three months passed on in this delightful manner and i should have thought an age but minutes if the scene was to have no change but every thing must have an end in this poor state business called me one morning early into the city and till it was late at night i thought not to return back however i was compelled to go for some papers i had forgot and designing to surprise agreeably my wife came in by a key i had at the washhouse door and unseen went softly up to my chamber where i expected to find my beloved in a sweet sleep gently i touched the lock and intended as my charmer slumbered to give this idol of my heart a kiss but as i opened the door without being heard i saw a man by my bedside and my fond faithful wife buttoning up his breeches amazement seized me but i was not in a rage i only said is that louisa i see and shut the door down stairs i went immediately and out again the same way i came in i was done with love for ever and from that time never saw my wife more a ship being to sail the next day for constantinople i went a passenger in it and resolved to live abroad some years  six years i resided in greece and visited every curious place four i spent in asia minor and two in italy and france i diverted myself with noting down the extraordinary things i saw and i purchased several fine antiquities by the way when done i came back to my country again and this little seat i now live at being to be sold i bought it immediately and have resided here ever since my study my garden and my horse divert me fully and finely every day i have all i desire in this world and reign more happily over my few subjects in this airy silent secret spot than the greatest monarch can do on a throne my people are only one young man who is my gardener my footman and my groom and two old women my maids these are ever attentive to my will and by their good behavior and management make my lodge as agreeable and life as pleasing as can be expected in this system of things  moncktons story pleased me much and i wondered greatly at his happy temper when he saw his beloved wife buttoning up the breeches of the man but did you ever hear what became of her after  and faulty as she was may there not be found an honest charming woman to render your hours more delightful than study and contrivance can make them without a soft partner through life come into the world with me sir and i will engage to find out for you a mere primitive christian of a woman with all the beauties of body that lucian gives his images  you are very good sir  monckton replied in offering to look out for another wife for me and i thank you very heartily for your wellmeant kindness but as i never enquired what became of my first wife from the morning i left her and know only that she is dead as her jointure has not been demanded for several years past so shall i never be concerned with a second perhaps there are some honest women in the world i hope so but i have had enough of marriage beside i think it time now to turn my thoughts a better way in the fortyfifth year of my age it cannot be weak to begin to consider the great change before me and fix my hopes on a good remove into some better and happier region if i was unfortunate with a wife when a young man i have little reason to expect better days with one as age comes on i might find myself again most sadly mistaken but there can be no disappointment in making it the principal work of life to prepare in such a retirement as this for that approaching hour when we must submit to the power and tyranny of death and corruption by this means the greatest happiness may be secured in every thing else there is uncertainty and vanity i speak principally in respect of my time of life who am hastening fast to fifty but at every time it is my opinion that men as rationals and beings who take on themselves the honorable profession of the christian religion should not comply with the criminal liberties allowed in the world and give into the illicit usages and customs of place and company for fear of ridicule or to avoid giving offense but keep strictly to the will and laws of their higher country and in all things have a special regard to holiness and truth and purity  i do not say this by way of preaching but that you may thereby have a truer idea of the man you chanced to find in a lone house on this vast common seven years have i now lived here and in all that time have not been once in london but sometimes i ride to a neighboring village and if on the road or at an inn i can pick up a sensible agreeable man i love to dine with him and drink a pint of wine such a man i frequently ride in quest of and if he be entirely to my mind which is very rarely the case i invite him home with me to pass at my lodge two or three days far then am i from being unsocial though i live in solitude but i left the world because i was illused in it and happen to think very differently from the generality of men here monckton ended his story and a little after we parted  a bait at a lone inn and the arrival of miss turner of skelsmore vale    i rid for six hours without meeting with any thing remarkable but as i baited about three oclock at a lone inn the situation of which was so fine in forest and water that i determined to go no further that day there arrived a little after a young lady her maid and two men servants they were all wellmounted and the ladys beast in particular as great a beauty of its kind as its mistress was among women i thought i had seen the face before and had been some where or other in her company but as it must be several years ago and her face and person were a little altered i could not immediately recollect her but finn my lad coming up to me asked me if i did not remember miss turner of skelsmorevale see the life of john buncle vol i p  0   miss turner i said  to be sure now i think it is she but this lady just arrived here is much fatter and if it be possible something handsomer it is her believe me quoth finn and you ought to wait upon her instantly i went it was miss turner one of the beauties that adorns a gallery of pictures in the north and who is with great truth in the following lines described in a poem written on this collection of paintings  the picture of miss turner but see emilia rises to the sight in every virtue in every beauty bright see those victorious eyes that heavenly mien behold her shine like loves resistless queen thou fairest wonder of thy fairest kind by heaven some image of itself designed as if in thee it took peculiar care and formed thee like some favorite seraph there but though thy beauty strikes the ravished sight thy virtue shines distinguishingly bright and all the graces of thy form combined yield to the charms of thy unblemished mind where all is spotless gentle and serene one calm of life untouched by guilt or pain could i in equal lays thy worth design or paint exalted merit such as thine to latest ages should thy name survive and in my verse emilia ever live the admiring world should listen to thy praise and the fair portrait charm succeeding days this lady knew me at once on my entering the room where she was and we dined together she told me her brother my friend died in italy on his return home and miss jaquelot her cousin and companion was happily married and that being thus left alone by these two accidents she was going up to london to reside in the world  my address to miss turner    miss turner i said then as you are now your own mistress i may with justice make my addresses and tell you that from the first hour i saw you i was in love with you and am so still that if you will do me the honor to be my wife i will make the best of husbands i have now some fortune and if you will allow that an honest man is the best companion for an honest woman let us marry in the country and instead of going up to that noisy tumultuous place called london retire to some still delightful retreat and there live content with each other as happy as it is possible for two young mortals to be in this lower hemisphere what do you say miss turner  miss turners answer and our marriage    you shall have my answer sir in a few days but as to going up to london i think i had best see it since i am come so far it may give me a new relish for still life and make the country seem more charming than i thought it before on the other hand it may perhaps make me in love with the town and put me out of conceit with the country in short on second thoughts i will not go up to the capital i will return to skelsmorevale i think so now but how i may think in the morning at present i do not know in the mean time  caesia continued ring if you please for a pack of cards and let us pass the evening in play the cards were brought in the game began and before we had played many hours i saw this dear charming creature was all my own she sat before me like blushing beauty in the picture in the gallery of venus enriched with thought warm with desire and with delicate sensations covered over i could not help wishing for father fleming my friend to qualify us for the implanted impulse and sanctify the call early the next morning i sent finn for him and he was with me in a few days the evening he arrived we were married man and wife we sat down to supper  the authors apology for marrying again so soon    here the morose the visionary and the dunce will again fall upon me for marrying a fifth wife so quickly after the decease of the fourth who had not been three months in her grave but my answer is that a dead woman is no wife and marriage is ever glorious it is the institution of heaven a blessing to society and therefore hated by the devil and masspriests satan by opposing it promotes fornication and perdition the priests by preaching against it drive the human race into cloisters destroy every thing gentle generous and social and rob the people of their property celibacy is popery and hell in perfection it is the doctrine of devils and a war with the almighty it is against the institutions of nature and providence and therefore for ever execrable be the memory of the masspriests who dare to call it perfection  my dear reader if you are unmarried and healthy get a wife as soon as possible some charming girl or pretty widow adorned with modesty robed with meekness and who has the grace to attract the soul and heighten every joy continually  take her to thy breast and bravely in holy wedlock propagate despise and hiss the masspriests and every visionary who preaches the contrary doctrine they are foes to heaven and mankind and ought to be drummed out of society  section xi quid quaeri labiene jubes  an noceat vis ulla bono summaque perdat opposita virtute minas laudandaque velle sit satis et nunquam

he turned him with disdain about and left scorned ammon to amuse the rout the temple of jupiter ammon was situated on the south part of the deserts of lybia about  00 miles from the borders of egypt these deserts consisting of fluctuating sands are of a vast unknown extent and by the rising of the wind roll like waves of the sea fall like snow and have buried whole armies but the spot in the middle of which the temple stood is fine fixed land seven miles in circumference richly planted and watered with fountains and streams a delightful and healthful place though the vast deserts all round are scorching sands without so much as one well or rivulet to be seen any where alexander the great was there in the year     or   before christ and cato in the year before christ    lucan gives a fine description of this march of cato in his ixth book  and of the spot where ammon reigned says   here and here only through wide lybias space tall trees the land and verdant herbage grace here the loose sands by plenteous springs are bound knit to a mass and molded into ground here smiling nature wears a fertile dress and all things here the present god confess the latin is vastly fine

most horrible deserts but instead of corniger as lucan calls ammon an african prince named abu derar now reigns there and his palace stands where the temple stood in alexanders and catos time i saw not long ago a gentleman who had been on the spot and told me this he further said that this king and his people had been converted to the christian religion by an abyssinian priest and had better notions of christianity than many of our great divines for they have not a thought of trinity in unity nor would they say to gain the whole world what the great dr potter does in one of his sermons to wit that whatsoever pain or misery god himself did suffer in his human nature or as trapp expresses himself in his discourse on the marriage at cana  a sweet smile sat on the face of the great god  meaning jesus  horrible sayings o wretched orthodoxy but they think without daring to invent and add to the gospel that jesus christ was and was no more than the messiah sent by god for the salvation of mankind  at what time this oracle of jupiter ammon ceased is not certain we are sure it was of no reputation in the time of trajan all the oracles ceased when men opened their eyes and laid aside their impertinent credulity this was the true cause of the cessation though the fathers ascribe it to the coming of the savior of the world it was mere priestcraft to make money    non exploratum populis ammona relinquens  the unfortunate death of miss turner the authors fifth wife    for six weeks after our marriage we resided at the inn on account of the charms of the ground and seemed to be in possession of a lasting happiness it is impossible for words to describe every thing was so smooth and so round that we thought prosperity must be our own for many years to come and were quite secure from the flames of destruction but calamity laid hold of us when we had not the least reason to expert it and from a fullness of peace and felicity we sunk at once into an abyss of afflictions instead of going back to skelsmorevale as we had resolved my wife would go up to london and pass a few weeks there and thereabout before she retired to the mountains i was against it but her will was my law we set out for the capital and the first days journey was delightful but her fine beast having met with an accident in the night by a rope in the stable which got about it is foot cut it deep and rendered it unable to travel we took a chariot and four to finish our way but on driving by the side of a steep hill the horses took fright ran it down over came the carriage and my charmer was killed this was a dismal scene she lived about an hour and repeated the following fine lines from boissard when she saw me weeping as i kneeled on the ground by her   nil prosunt lacrumae nec possunt fata moveri nec pro me queror hoc morte mihi est tristius ipsa moeror atimeti conjugis ille mihi homonoea and atimetus and the epitaph of homonoea at large these lines from the antiquities of boissard are a real inscription on a tomb in italy which this antiquary found in his travels and copied it as a curiosity to the world it is to be seen on the monument to this day homonoea was a great beauty at the court of the emperor honorius and married to atimetus a courtier and favorite who preferred her to the most illustrious of ladies of that time on account of her extraordinary charms and uncommon perfections but the did not long enjoy the honor and happiness she was married into before the was twenty death snatched her away in the year of the reign of honorius a d  0  and the following beautiful epitaph was cut on her monument and remains to this day i place it here for the entertainment of my readers and likewise la fontaines elegant translation of it  homoeas epitaph si pensare animas sinerent crudelia fata et posset redimi morte aliena salus quantulacunque meae debentur tempora vitae pensarem pro te cara homonoea libens at nunc quod possum fugiam lucemque deosque ut to matura per stuga morte sequar atimetus the husband is the speaker of these six lines  parce tuam conjux fletu quassare juventam fataque merendo sollicitare mea nil prosunt lacrumae nec possunt fata moveri viximus hic omnes exitus unus habet parce ita non unquam similem experiare dolorem et faveant votis numina cuncta tuis quodque mihi cripuit mors immatura juventae hoc tibi victuro proroget ulterius homonoea is supposed to speak these eight lines to her hushand and then relates her case to the traveller who is passing by  tu qui secura procedis mente parumper siste gradum quaeso verbaque

compleverat annos injecere manus invida fata mihi nec pro me queror hoc morte mihi est tristius ipsa moeror atimeti conjugis ille mihi sit tibi terra levis mulier dignissima vita quaeque tuis olim perfruerere bonis  these two lines may be the words of the public or of whoever crected the monument to the memory of homonoea  now see how finely la fontaine has done this inscription into verse  si

que tu a perdu  n b the reader who does not understand french will find this in english at the end of this xith section    just as she expired she took me by the hand and with the spirit of an old roman bid me adieu  can you form an idea reader of the distress i was then in if is not possible i think unless you have been exactly in the same situation unless you loved like me and have been as miserably separated from as charming a woman but it was in vain for me to continue lamenting she was gone for ever and lay as the clod of the valley before me her body i deposited in the next churchyard and immediately after rid as fast as i could to london to lose thought in dissipation and resign the better to the decree for some days i lived at the inn i set up at but as soon as i could went into a lodging and it happened to be at the house of the famous curl the bookseller a man well known in the dunciad and popes letters to his friends on account of curls frauds in purchasing and printing stolen copies of mr popes works it is in relation to these tricks that pope mentions curl in his dunciad and letters a succinct history of him i shall here give but had i complied with his requests it would have been a long relation to the advantage and glory of this extraordinary man for he came one morning into my closet with an apron full of papers being letters memorandums parodies and notes written by or concerning himself and requested i would on a good consideration write his life to his profit and honor and make it a five shilling book that i said was not then in my power to do but i would one time or other give the public a true account of him and make it conclude i hoped to the glory of his character here it is  the picture and character of curl the bookseller    curl was in person very tall and thin an ungainly awkward whitefaced man his eyes were a lightgrey large projecting gogle and purblind he was splayfooted and bakerkneed  he had a good natural understanding and was well acquainted with more than the title pages of books he talked well on some subjects he was not an infidel as mrs row misrepresents him in one of her letters to lady hartford afterward duchess of somerset he told me it was quite evident to him that the scriptures of the old and new testament contained a real revelation there is for it a rational a natural a traditionary and a supernatural testimony which rendered it quite certain to him he said he no more doubted the truth of the christian religion than he did the existence of an independent supreme creator but he did not believe the expositions given by the divines so far curl was right enough his fault was that with such a belief he took no pains with his heart trusting entirely to the merits the savior like too many other mistaken christians he had no notion of religion as an invisible thing within us called the kingdom of god he did not even consider it as a good outside thing that recommends a man to his fellow creatures he was a debauchee to the last degree and so injurious to society that by filling his translations with wretched notes forged letters and bad pictures he raised the price of a four shilling book to ten thus in particular he managed burnets archiology and when i told him he was very culpable in this and other articles he sold his answer was what would i have him do he was a bookseller his translators in pay lay three in a bed at the pewterplatter inn in holborn and he and they were for ever at work to deceive the public he likewise printed the lewdest things he lost his ears for the nun in her smock and another thing as to drink he was too fond of money to spend any in making himself happy that way but at anothers expense he would drink every day till he was quite blind and as incapable of selfmotion as a block this was edmund curl but he died at last as great a penitent i think in the year      as ever expired i mention this to his glory  as curl knew the world well and was acquainted with several extraordinary characters he was of great use to me at my first coming to town as i knew nobody nor any place he gave me the true characters of many i saw told me whom i should avoid and with whom i might be free he brought me to the play houses and gave me a judicious account of every actor he understood those things well no man could talk better on theatrical subjects he brought me likewise to sadlers wells to the nightcellars and to tom kings the famous nighthouse at covent garden as he was very knowing and wellknown at such places he soon made me as wise as himself in these branches of learning and in short in the space of a month i was as well acquainted in london as if i had been there for years my kind preceptor spared no pains in lecturing  but what of all things i thought most wonderful was the company i saw at the sieur curls as he was intimate with all the high whores in town many of them frequented his shop to buy his dialogues and other lively books some of these girls he often asked to dine with him and then i was sure to be a guest many very fine women i thereby saw but none worth mentioning till carola bennet arrived she did surprise me her mind and body were very wonderful and i imagine a description of her and her story afterward will not be ungrateful to my readers  the picture of carola bennet    carola bennet was at this time in the two and twentieth year of her age a dazzling beauty in the height of life and vigor her eyes were black and amazingly fine her mouth charming her neck and breast very beautiful her stature was just what it ought to be she had a glow of health a luscious air and a bewitching vivacity her manners were wonderfully winning and the tone of her voice so sweet and insinuating that her words and looks went directly to the heart she had read many books of gaiety wit and humor especially the french and talked delightfully on such subjects she sang to perfection but her conversation was too free and she seemed to have no sense of any religion it was a fine entertainment to be in her company as i often was yet i could not help sighing to see so many any perfections on the brink of everlasting destruction  this young lady all of a sudden disappeared curl knew not what was become of her but as i rid ten years after through devonshire in the finest part of that romantic county i saw her one morning as i stopped to water my horse in a brook that ran from a park sitting on a seat under a vast beautiful cedar tree with a book in her hand i thought i was no stranger to the fine face and as i was pretty near to her i called out and asked if she was not miss bennet she knew me at once and pointing to a gate that was only latched desired i would come to her i went and found she was the mistress of the fine seat at a small distance off she brought me into the house would not suffer me to stir that day and told me the story of her life i think it worth placing here  history of miss bennet    carola bennet was the daughter of john bennet esquire a yorkshire gentleman who died when she was in her   th year and left her in the care of her aunt an old lady who was outwardly all saint and within a devil this carola knew well and requested her father to get another guardian for her or leave her to manage herself for mrs hunfleet her aunt was far from being that primitive christian he took her for and so great a miser that exclusive of all her other vices her avarice alone was enough to ruin her niece she would sacrifice the whole human race for half a thousand pounds but all his daughter said was in vain he believed his sister was godliness itself in its utmost latitude and extent that she lived a continued opposition to our mortal enemies the world sin and the devil and that her heart was a mere magazine of universal honesty probity of manners and goodness of life and conversation integrity and rectitude and benevolence as he thought were the bright criterions of her soul she will teach you carola to fast and pray and make you like herself a mere saint  it was to no purpose then for the daughter to remonstrate she could only weep as her father was positive and after his death was obliged to go home with mrs hunfleet there as she expected she had too much of the outward bodily exercise of religion every thing that can be named within the circle of external worship such as public and private services fastings macerations bowings expanded hands and lifted eyes which lord halifax in his advice to a daughter calls the holy goggle but that all this accompanied the internal acts of the old womans mind and went along with her heart and soul carola had reason to doubt she saw it was but outward profession  all hypocrisy  that her life belied her creed and her practice was a renunciation of the christian religion this appeared to be the case very quickly the aunt sold her to one cantalupe for five hundred pounds under pretense of taking her to visit a friend she brought her to a private bagnio or one of those houses called convents  a description of a london convent and an adventure there    such houses stand in back courts narrow lanes or the most private places and seem to be uninhabited as the front windows are seldom opened or like some little friary where a company of visionaries reside but within are elegantly furnished and remarkable for the best wines the woman who keeps the house is the only person to be seen in them unless it be sometimes that a highpriced whore who passes for the gentlewomans daughter by accident appears  in these brothels the sieur curl was well known and as the wine in them is always excellent but a shilling a bottle dearer than at the tavern and one sits without hearing the least noise or being seen by any one i have often gone with this ingenious man to such places on account of the purity of the wine and the stillness of the house as there are no waiters there nor any welldrest hussies to come in the way you are as silent as in a cave nor does a woman appear except as before excepted unless it be by appointment at this kind of meeting house as such places may well be called for there not seldom does many a married woman meet her gallant one evening that i was there with curl there came in the wife of a very eminent merchant a lady of as excellent a character as any in the world who was never so much as suspected by any of her acquaintance but allowed by every body to be a woman of pure morals and unspotted chastity she came in first with a black mask on her face from her chair and was by the woman of the house shown into a chamber up stairs half an hour after there was another soft tap at the door and a gentleman was let in who was showed up to the chamber the lady was in as the door of the room curl and i were sitting in happened to be open as this adventurer passed by i knew the man he was an irish gentleman of large fortune with whom i was well acquainted he was ever engaged in amors and was some years after this hanged at cork for ravishing sally squib the quaker his name then can be no secret but as to the the ladys name i shall never tell it as she left several children who are now living in reputation but only observe that there are to my knowledge many women of such strict virtue in the world if you ask me reader how i came to know who she was i will tell you as she came down stairs in a mask at ten at night in the manner she went up i concluded she was a married woman of distinction and followed her chair when it went off she changed at temple bar and then took a hackney coach which drove beyond the royal exchange i followed till it stopped at a grand house into which she went without a mask and had a full view of her fine face i enquired next day who lived in the house i saw her go into and was told it was mr  a merchant of the greatest repute often did i see this lady after this was several times in her company and if i had not known what i did should have thought her a woman of as great virtue as ever lived there was not the least appearance of levity or indecency in her to all outward appearance she was chastity and discretion in flesh and blood  but as to carola bennet  the history of miss bennet continued    soon after her aunt and she arrived at mrs bedewells in came cantalupe as a visiter and after tea they went to cards then followed a supper and when that was over they gave the innocent miss bennet a dose which deprived her of her senses put her to bed and in the morning she found herself ruined in the arms of that villain cantalupe distraction almost seized her but he would not let her stir she called but no one came near to her relief he swore a million of oaths that it was pure love made him buy her of her aunt as he heard she was going to marry another man and if she would but share with him in his great fortune since the thing was done he would by every sacred power he vowed marry her that evening or the next the first time they went out and be the truest and most tender husband that ever yet appeared in the world this and the situation she was in naked and clasped in his strong arms without a friend to aid her within doors or without made her sensible her resentments were in vain and that she had better acquiesce and make the man her husband if she could since it was her hard fate and that in all probability she might conceive from the transactions of the night this made her have done she lay as he requested till noon and hoped he would prove as faithful as he had solemnly swore to be  but when the night came an indisposition he feigned made him unable to stir out that evening and he requested the idol of his heart whom he loved more than life to give him leave to defer it till the next for six days he put it off in the same manner during which time they never stirred out of the bagnio and the seventh day he left her fast asleep in bed a billetdoux on the dressingtable informed her that he was obliged to set out that morning for france and as he intended to be back in a few months he hoped she would not think him faithless at once he left her a hundred pound bank note which was all he had then to spare as he had paid to her aunt  00 l a few days before  thus fell the beautiful miss bennet by the treachery of her evercursed aunt and was made a whore very much against her will the aunt in the mean time had shut up her house and was gone no one knew where she took several jewels with her and a large sum of money both the property of her niece she left her but little of her fortune and reported every where that carola was gone into keeping with a great man and had before been debauched by her footman in short all that could be done this woman did to impoverish and defame her niece and as she had passed upon the world for a praying virtuous old piece her reports were thought so true that all the female acquaintance miss bennet had laughed at the story she told and shunned her as a foul fiend she was banished from all modest company they considered her as the most detestable prostitute for excusing herself they said by blackning the character of so pious and upright a woman as mrs hunfleet her aunt was  a reflection on hypocrites    thus did iniquity ruin and triumph over innocence in the mask of religion and a thousand times to my own knowledge it has done the same thing i have often known wretches pretend to seek the kingdom of god and his righteousness in the first place and by believing all the monks have invented by constantly attending public worship and an unnatural kind of sobriety pass for people that were ready and willing to suffer every thing the cause of god and truth can require from rationals yet these holy mortals could make the service of god not only stand with unwilling infirmities the common case of the best humanity but consist with wilful and presumptuous sinning and a malevolence as great as the devil had against our first parents a minister of the gospel who passed for an admirable man did his best to ruin my character for ever with my father one of the holiest men in the world cheated me of a thousand pounds left in his hands for my use for fear i should spend it myself and a rich man commonly called piety and goodness from the seeming simplicity of his manners the softness of his temper and the holy goggle of his eyes in his public devotion arrested me on a note of hand one third of which was interest thrown into the principal and made me pay interest upon interest without mercy or waiting as i intreated till it was more convenient many more such praying sanctified villains i could mention in respect of whom edmund curl was a cherubim fond as he was of a girl and a flask curl owned he was a sinner and that he was led by thirst and repletion to indulge but the hypocrites with professions of esteem for the pearl of great price and that they have parted with their herodias for the sake of eternal life yet wilfully disobey from a passion for substance and the shrine of bright mammon in this world has a greater influence on their souls than all the joys of an everlasting heaven to come what they do is a farce upon what they have they rest their all  but as to miss bennet in this sad condition she secreted herself for some months from the world and notwithstanding her constitution and taste intended to retire among the mountains of wales and live upon the little she had left but unfortunately for so good a design the matchless sir frederic dancer came in her way and by money and the force of love persuaded her to be his companion while he lived which was but for a short time a young nobleman prevailed on her next by high rewards to be the delight of his life for a time and at his death she went to the arms of an irish peer she had what money she pleased from these great men and being now very rich she determined on the marriage of her last lord to go into keeping no more but to live a gay life among the agreeable and grand she had lost all her notions of a weeping and gnashing of teeth to come in the conversation of these atheistical men and on account of her living as happily as she could in this world what religion she had remaining was placed in giving money to the sick and poor which she did with a liberal hand and her charity in all its charms she often showed to the most deserving men those who had much of this worlds goods paid dear but she had compassion on the worthy though they could not drive in a chariot to her door this was the case of miss bennet when i saw her at curls  but all of a sudden she disappeared and no one could tell what was become of her that i learned from herself when i chanced to see her under the cedar tree as before related in the park  a young clergyman mr tench an irishman of the county of galway who was very rich and had a fine seat in devonshire saw her at the opera and fell in love with her he soon found out who she was waited upon her and offered to marry her if she would reform at first she showed very little inclination to a virtuous course and as her manner was ridiculed the interest of another life the blessedness of heaven she laughed at and made a jest of riches honors and pleasures to be found on the other side the grave this did not however dishearten tench he was a scholar and a man of sense and as he loved most passionately and saw she had a fine capacity he was resolved if possible to reclaim her by applying to her bright understanding  mr tenchs conversation with miss bennet in relation to religion    he observed to her in the first place as she informed me that exclusive of future happiness godliness was profitable in all things that is even in this life in prosperity and adversity in plenty and in want in peace and in war in confusion and security in health in honor and disgrace in life and in death and in what condition soever we may be this he proved to her satisfaction and made it plain to her conception that by it only we can acquire a right judgment of persons and things and have a just and due estimate of ourselves that unless held in by reason and religion pleasure though innocent of itself becomes a thing of deadly consequence to mortals and if we do not use it in due time place circumstance measure and limits it necessarily involves us in difficulties and troubles pain and infamy if we stifle the grand leading principles reason and religion by sin and vice and let desire and inclination range beyond bounds we must not only plunge into various woes in this world but as creatures degenerated below the beast become the contempt and abhorrence of the wise and honest to this sad condition must be annexed a reflective misery as we have conscience or reason that will examine now and then the whole procedure of life do all we can to prevent it and the remorse that must ensue on account of our wretched and ridiculous conduct is too bitter a thing for a reasonable creature to acquire for the sake of illicit gratification only and this becomes the more grievous in reflection as pleasures are not forbidden by religion but allowed to the most upright and ordained for the holy service of god to recruit nature and enliven the spirits to propagate the human species and preserve the flame of love in the married state if there was then no other life but this it is most certainly our interest in regard to fame and advantage to be governed by reason and religion  and if we are not to be annihilated with the beast but are to answer hereafter for what we have done whether it be good or bad surely the main business of life should be to govern ourselves by godliness that is to be christians in our principles holy in our conversation and upright in our behavior if the gospel be true as has been proved a thousand and a thousand times by the wisest men in the world to the confusion and silence of infidelity and the son of god came into the world not to make judea the seat of absolute and universal empire and establish a temporal dominion in all possible pomp and magnificence as the jews most erroneously and ridiculously fancied and to this day believe but to prepare greater things for us to relieve us from the power of sin and the endless and unspeakable miseries of the life which is to come to propose a prize far more worthy of our expectations than the glories of civil power and to secure to us the happiness both of soul and body to all eternity in the kingdom of god then certainly in regard to ourselves we ought to attend to his heavenly lessons and turn from the unlawful enjoyments of this life to the endless and solid happiness of a future state as this is the case we should cherish and improve a faith of invisible things by serious and impartial consideration we should attend to the evidence which god has given us for the truth of christianity evidence very cogent and sufficient and then show our faith by works suited to the doctrine of christ that is by recommending the practice of virtue and the worship of one god the creator of the universe  consider then miss bennet that you stand on the brink of death resurrection and judgment and it is time to begin by serious and humble enquiry to arrive at a faith of strength and activity that by your eminence in all virtue and holiness you may make the glorious attempt to be greatest in the kingdom of heaven this will be a work worthy of an immortal soul nor will it hinder you from enjoying as much happiness in this lower hemisphere as reason can desire for godliness is profitable unto all things having promise of the life that now is and of that which is to come  thus miss bennet that was continued did this excellent young clergyman talk to me and by argument and reasoning in the gentlest manner by good sense and good manners made me a convert to christianity and goodness he snatched me from the gulf of eternal perdition and from the realms of darkness and the society of devils brought me into the kingdom of the messiah to make me as happy as it was possible even in this world he married me and landed me in this charming spot you found me in for seven years we lived in great happiness without ever stirring from this fine solitude and since his death i have had no inclination to return to the world i have one lady for my companion an agreeable sensible woman a near relation of mr tenchs and with her and some good books and three or four agreeable neighbors have all the felicity i care for in this world when you saw me at curls i had no taste for any thing but the comedy the opera and a tale of la fontaine but you found me with a volume of tillotson in my hand under that aged and beautiful cedar near the road and in those sermons i now find more delight in the solemn shade of one of those fine trees than ever i enjoyed in the gayest scenes of the world in these sweet silent walks i am really happy riches and honor are with me yea durable riches and righteousness to the blessings of time i can here add the riches of expectation and comfort the riches of future glory and happiness this makes me fond of this fine retreat in contentment peace and comfort of mind i now live by harkening to the commandments my peace is a river  here mrs tench had done and i was amazed beyond expression this charming libertine was quite changed it was formerly her wont when i have sat an evening with her at curls to make a jest of the christian scheme  to laugh at the devil and his flames her life was all pleasure and her soul all whim but when i saw her last she was serious and seemed to enjoy as happy a serenity and composure of mind as ever mortal was blessed with even her eyes had acquired a more sober light and in the place of a wild and luscious air a beautiful modesty appeared  a reflection on the conversion of miss bennet    and now to what shall i ascribe this astonishing alteration shall i say with our methodists and other visionaries that it must be owing to immediate impulse and proceeded from inward impression of the spirit no this will not do it was owing to be sure to the word not inspoken but taught by christ in his gospel when her friend tench opened the new testament to her her good understanding inclined her to hearken she began to consider she pondered and had a regard to the gospel now laid before her by that sensible and excellent young clergyman she became a believer and as the apostle says we can do all things through christ who strengthens us that is says dr hunt in one of his fine sermons through the directions of christ and through the arguments and motives of the christian doctrine well said hunt it must be our own choice to be sure to be good and virtuous so far as men are passive and are acted upon they are not agents without power to do good or evil men cannot be moral or accountable beings and be brought into judgment or receive according to their works  dr lardner in his excellent sermon on the power and efficacy of christs doctrine has a fine observation  would any say that the necessity of immediate and particular influences from christ himself is implied in this context where he says that he is a vine and his disciples branches and that their bearing fruit depends as much upon influences from him as the life and vigor of branches do upon the sap derived from the root of the tree it would be easy to answer that the argument in the text is a similitude not literal truth neither is christ literally a vine nor are his disciples strictly speaking branches men have a reasonable intellectual nature above animals and vegetables they are not governed by irresistible and necessary or mechanical powers but it is sound doctrine and right principles particularly the words of christ which are the words of god that are their life and may and will if attended to powerfully enable them to promote good works and to excel and persevere therein  two irish gentlemen call upon me and bring me to a gaming table kept by a company of sharpers where i lose all my fortune   0 but it is time to my own story  while i lodged at curls two irish gentlemen came to see me jemmy king an attorney and that famous master in chancery who debauched nelly hayden the beauty and kept her several years i knew these men were as great rakes as ever lived and had no notion of religion that they were devoted to pleasure and chased away every sober thought and apprehension by company by empty vicious and unmanly pleasures the voice of the monitor was lost in the confused noise and tumult of the passions but i thought they had honor at the bottom according to the common notion of it i never imagined they were sharpers nor knew that being ruined in ireland they came over to live by a gaming table the doctor especially i thought was above ever becoming that kind of man as he had a large estate and the best education always kept good company and to appearance was as fine a gentleman as ever was seen in the world with these two i dined and after dinner they brought me as it were out of curiosity to a gaming table they had by accident discovered where there was a bank kept by men of the greatest honor who played quite fair and by hazarding a few guineas i might perhaps as they did come off with some hundreds  at entering the room i saw about twenty welldrest men sitting round a table on which lay a vast heap of gold we all began to play and for two or three hours i did win some hundreds of pounds the doctor and the other cheat his friend seemed to lose a large sum but before morning they won it all back from me with a great deal more and i not only lost what i had got then but excepting a few pounds what i was worth in the world the thousands i had gained by my several wives i had sold their estates and lodged the money in my bankers hands the villains round this table got it all and my two irishmen were not to be seen they disappeared and left me madly playing away my all i heard no more of them till i was told several years after that they were in the isle of man among other outlawed abandoned wicked men where they drank night and day according to the custom of the place and lived in defiance of god and man there these two advocates of impiety dwelt for some time and died as they had lived enemies to all good principles and friends to a general corruption  as to the welldrest company round the table they went off one by one and left me all alone to the bitter thought which led me to what i was some hours before by what i then found myself to be i was almost distracted what had i to do with play i said i wanted nothing and now by villains with a set of dice that would deceive the devil i am undone by sharpers and false dice i have sat to be ruined the reflection numbed my senses for some time and then i started was wild and raved  curls scheme to carry off an heiress which i did in a successful manner     this transaction made me very thoughtful and i sat within for several days thinking which way to turn curl saw i was perplexed and on his asking me if i had met with any misfortune i told him the whole case that i had but one hundred pounds left and requested he would advise me what i had best do to do justice to every one curl seemed deeply concerned and after some silence as we sat over a bottle at a coffeehouse he bid me take notice of an old gentleman who was not far from us that is dunk the miser who lives in a wood about  0 miles off he has one daughter the finest creature in the universe and who is to succeed to his great estate whether he will or not it being so settled at his marriage but he confines her so much in the country and uses her so cruelly every way that i believe she would run away with any honest young fellow who could find means to address her know then continued curl that i serve mr dunk with paper pens ink wax pamphlets and every thing he wants in my way once a quarter of a year i generally go to his country house with such things as he is glad to see me sometimes or if i cannot go myself i send them by some other hand next week i am to forward some things to him and if you will take them i will write a line by you to miss his daughter recommend you to her for a husband as one she may depend on for honor and truth she knows i am her friend and who can tell but she may go off with you she will have a thousand a year when the wretch her father dies if he should leave his personal estate another way  this thought pleased me much and at the appointed time away i went to mr dunks country house with a wallet full of things and delivered curls letter to miss as soon as she had read it i began my address and in the best manner i could made her an offer of my service to deliver her from the tyrant her father i gave her an account of a little farm i had on the borders of cumberland a purchase i had made on account of the charms of the ground and a small pretty lodge which stood in the middle of it by a clump of old trees near a murmuring stream that if she pleased i would take her to that sweet silent spot and enable her to live in peace with contentment and tranquillity of mind though far away from the splendors and honors of the world and considering that a christian is not to conform to the world or to the pomps and vanities of it its grand customs and usages its dress and entries its stage representations and masquerades as they minister to vice and tend to debauch the manners but are to look upon ourselves as beings of another world and to form our minds with these spiritual principles it follows then i think that a pleasing country situation for a happy pair must be grateful enough there peace and love and modesty may be best preserved the truth and gravity of our religion be strictly maintained and every lawful and innocent enjoyment be for ever the delights of life away from the idle modes of the world perpetual love and unmixed joys may be our portion through the whole of our existence here and the inward principles of the heart be ever laudable and pure so will our happiness as mortals be stable  subject to no mixture or change and when called away from this lower hemisphere have nothing to fear as we used this world as though we used it not as we knew no gratifications and liberties but what our religion allows us as our enjoyments will be but the necessary convenience and accommodation for passing from this world to the realms of eternal happiness follow me then miss dunk i will convey you to a scene of still life and felicity great and lasting as the heart of woman can wish for  the charming agnes seemed not a little surprised at what i had said and after looking at me very earnestly for a minute or two told me she would give me an answer to mr curls letter in less than half an hour which was all she could say at present and with it i returned to give him an account of the reception i had it will do he said after he had read the letter i brought him from miss dunk but you must be my young man for a week or two more and take some more things to the same place he then showed me the letter and i read the following lines  sir i am extremely obliged to you for your concern about my happiness and liberty and will own to you that in my dismal situation i would take the friend you recommend for a guide through the wilderness if i could think his heart was as sound as his head if his intentions were as upright as his words are fluent and good i need not be long in pondering on the scheme he proposed  but can we believe him true as lucinda says in the play  the sunny hill the flowery vale the garden and the grove have echoed to his ardent tale and vows of endless love the conquest gained he left his prize he left her to complain to talk of joy with weeping eyes and measure time by pain  to this curl replied in a circumstantial manner and vouched very largely for me i delivered his letter the next morning when i went with some acts of parliament to old dunk and i found the beauty his daughter in a rosy bower  simplex munditiis neat and clean as possible in the most genteel undress and her person so vastly fine her face so vastly charming that i could not but repeat the lines of otway   man when created first wandered up and down forlorn and silent as his vassal brutes but when a heavenborn maid like you appeared strange pleasures filled his soul unloosd his tongue and his first talk was love  a deal i said upon the occasion we became well acquainted that day as her father had got a disorder that obliged him to keep his bed and by the time i had visited her a month longer under various pretenses of business invented by the ingenious curl agnes agreed to go off with me and commit herself entirely to my care and protection but before i relate this transaction i think it proper to give my readers the picture of this lady and then an apology for her flying away with me with whom she was but a month acquainted  the picture of miss dunk agnes in her person was neither tall nor thin but almost both young and lovely graceful and commanding she inspired a respect and compelled the beholder to admire and love and reverence her her voice was melodious her words quite charming and every look and motion to her advantage taste was the characteristic of her understanding her sentiments were refined and a sensibility appeared in every feature of her face she could talk on various subjects and comprehended them which is what few speakers do but with the finest discernment she was timid and so diffident of her opinion that she often concealed the finest thoughts under a seeming simplicity of soul this was visible to a hearer and the decency of ignorance added a new beauty to her character in short possessed of excellence she appeared unconscious of it and never discovered the least pride or precipitancy in her conversation  her manner was perfectly polite and mixed with a gaiety that charmed because it was as free from restraint as from boldness  in sum exclusive of her fine understanding in her dress and in her behavior she was so extremely pleasing so vastly agreeable and delightful that she ever brought to my remembrance when i beheld her the corinna described in the beautiful lines of tibullus  illam quicquid agit quoquo vestigia flectit componit furtim subsequiturque decor seu solvit crines fusis decet esse capillis seu compsit comptis est veneranda comis urit seu tyria voluit procedere pulla urit seu nivea candida vest venit talis in aeterno felix vertumnus olympo mill habet ornatus mill decenter habet when love would set the gods on fire he flies to light his torches at her sparkling eyes whatever corinna does wherever she goes the graces all her motions still compose how her hair charms us when it loosely falls combed back and tied our veneration calls if she comes out in scarlet then she turns us all to ashes  though in white she burns vertumnus so a thousand dresses wears so in a thousand ever grace appears such was the beautiful agnes who went off with me and in so doing acted well and wisely i affirm on her taking me only for an honest man for there is no more obedience due from a daughter to her father when he becomes an unrelenting oppressor than there is from a subject to an english king when the monarch acts contrary to the constitution passive obedience is as much nonsense in a private family as in the government of the prince the parent like the king must be a nursing father a rational humane sovereign and so long all service and obedience are due but if like the prince he becomes a tyrant deprives his daughter of her natural rights and liberties will not allow her the blessings of life but keep her in chains and misery selfpreservation and her just claim to the comforts of existence and a rational freedom give her a right to change her situation and better her condition if she can have bread serenity and freedom peace and little with an honest man she is just to herself in going off with such a deliverer reason and revelation will acquit her  thus justly thought miss dunk and therefore with me she fled at midnight we met within half a mile of her fathers house by the side of an ancient wood and a running stream which had a pleasing effect as it happened to be a bright moonshine with her foot in my hand i lifted her into her saddle and as our horses were excellent we rid many miles in a few hours by eight in the morning we were out of the reach of old dunk and at the sign of the pilgrim a lone house in esurvale in hertfordshire we breakfasted very joyfully the charming agnes seemed well pleased with the expedition and said a thousand things that rendered the journey delightful twelve days we traveled in a fullness of delights happy beyond description and the thirteenth arrived at a village not far from my little habitation here we designed to be married two days after when we had rested as there was a church and a parson in the town and then ride on to foley farm in cumberland as my small spot was called and there sit down in peace and happiness  but the second day instead of rising to the nuptial ceremony to crown my life with unutterable bliss and make me beyond all mankind happy the lovely agnes fell ill of a fever a sense of weight and oppression discovered the inflammation within and was attended with sharp and pungent pains the blood could not pass off as it ought in the course of circulation and the whole mass was in a violent fluctuation and motion in a word she died in a few days and as she had requested if it came to that i laid her out and put her into the coffin myself i kept her seven days according to the custom of the old romans and then in the dress of sorrow followed her to the grave  thus was my plan of happiness broken to pieces i had given a roundness to a system of felicity and in the place of it saw death and horror and disappointment before me  what to do next i could not tell one question was should i return to ortonlodge to my two young heiresses no they wanted two years of being at age  then shall i stay at foleyfarm where i was and turn hermit no i had no inclination yet to become a father of the deserts  will you return to london then and see if fortune has any thing more in reserve for you this i liked best and after six months deliberation on the thing i left my farm in the care of an old woman and set out in the beginning of january  a winter nightscene on the mountains of westmoreland     it was as fine a winters morning as i had seen which encouraged me to venture among the fells of westmoreland but at noon the weather changed and an evening very terrible came on a little after three it began to blow rain and snow very hard and it was not long before it was very dark we lost the way quite and for three hours wandered about in as dismal a night as ever poor travelers had the storm rattled the tempest howled we could not see the horses heads and were almost dead with cold we had nothing to expect but death as we knew not which way to turn to any house and it was impossible to remain alive till the day appeared it was a dismal scene but my time was not yet come and when we had no ground to expect deliverance the beasts of a sudden stopped and soto found we were at the gate of a walled yard there he immediately made all the noise he could and it was not long before a servant with a lantern came he related our case within and had orders to admit us he brought me into a common parlour where there was a good fire and i got dry things the man brought me half a pint of hot alicant and in about half an hour i was alive and well again on enquiring where i was the footman told me it was doctor stanvils house that his master and lady were above in the dining room with some company and he had directions to light me up when i had changed my clothes and was recovered upon this i told him i was ready and followed him  my arrival at dr stanvils house and introduced to the doctor and company on the servants opening a door i entered a handsome apartment well lighted with wax and which had a glorious fire blazing in it the doctor received me with great politeness and said many civil things upon fortunes conducting me to his house the conversation naturally fell upon the horrors of the night as it still continued to rain hail and blow beyond what any of the company had ever heard and one of the ladies said she believed the winter was always far more boisterous and cold among the fells of westmoreland than in any other part of england for which she gave several good reasons the solemn mountains the beautiful valleys the falling streams form one of the most charming countries in the world in summertime but in winter it is the most dreadful spot of earth to be sure  the surprising story of mrs stanvil the voice of the lady who talked in this manner i thought i was well acquainted with but by the position of the candles and the angle of a screen in which she sat i could not very well see her face amazement however began to seize me and as an elegant supper was soon after brought in i had an opportunity of seeing that miss dunk whom i had buried was now before my eyes in the character of dr stanvils wife or at least it was one so like her it was not possible for me to distinguish the figures  there was the same bright victorious eyes and chestnut hair the complexion like a blush and a mouth where all the little loves for ever dwelt there was the fugitive dimple the enchanting laugh the rosy fingers the fine height and the mein more striking than calypsos o heavens i said to myself on sitting down to supper what is this i see but as she did not seem to to be at all affected or showed the least sign of her having ever seen me before that time i remained silent and only continued to look with admiration at her unmindful of the many excellent things before me  in a minute or two however i recovered myself i ate my supper and joined in the festivity of the night we had music and several songs we were easy free and happy as wellbred people could be  finns obserration and discourse in my bedchamber on the companys retiring to their apartments at midnight we parted and finding an easychair by the side of my bed i threw myself into it and began to reflect on what i had seen finn standing before me with his arms folded and looking very seriously at me this lasted for about a quarter of an hour and then the honest fellow spoke in the following manner  i beg leave sir to imagine you are perplexing yourself about the lady of this house whom i suppose you take for miss dunk we brought from the other side of england half a year ago and buried in the next churchyard to blenkern this if i may be so free is likewise my opinion i would take my oath of it in a court of justice if there was occasion for that however she got out of the grave and by whatever casualty she came to be mrs stanvil and mistress of this fine house yet i could swear to her being the lady who traveled with us from the west to cumberland but then it seems very wonderful and strange that she should forget you so soon or be able to act a part so amazing as to seem not to have ever seen you before this night this has astonished me as i stood behind your chair at supper looking full at her and i observed she looked at me once or twice what to say to all this i know not but i will make all the enquiry i can among the servants as to the time and manner of her coming here and let you know tomorrow what i have been able to collect in relation to her in the mean time be advised by me sir though i am but a poor fellow and think no more of the matter to the loss of your nights rest we have had a wonderful deliverance from death by getting into this house i am sure and we ought to lie down with thankfulness and joy without fretting ourselves awake for a woman or any trifling incident that could befall beside she is now another mans property however it came to pass and it would be inconsistent with your character to think any more of her this may be too free but i hope sir you will excuse it in a servant who has your interest and welfare at heart  here the sage finn had done he withdrew and i went to sleep  finns account of mrs stanvil which he had from the servants betimes the next morning finn was with me and on my asking what news he said he had heard something from all the servants and more particularly had got the following account from the doctors own man  that dr stanvil had a small lodge within three miles of the house we were in and retired there sometimes to be more alone than he could be in the residence we were at that this lodge was a mere repository of curiosities in the middle of a garden full of all the herbs and plants that grew in every country of the world and in one chamber of this house was a great number of skeletons which the doctor had made himself for it was his wont to procure bodies from the surrounding churchyards by men he kept in pay for the purpose and cut them up himself at this lodge that some of these dead were brought to him in hampers and some in their coffins on light railed cars as the case required that near six months ago the last time the doctor was at this lodge there was brought to him by his men the body of a young woman in her coffin in order to a dissection as usual and the bones being wired but as it lay on the back on the great table he cuts up on and the point of his knife at the pit of the stomach to open the breast he perceived a kind of motion in the subject heard a sigh soon after and looking up to the head saw the eyes open and shut again that upon this he laid down his knife which had but just scratched the body at the beginning of the linea alba as my informer called it and helped himself to put it into a warm bed that he took all possible pains by administering every thing he could think useful to restore life and was so fortunate as to set one of the finest women in the world on her feet again as she had no raiment but the shroud which had been on her in the coffin he got every thing belonging to dress that a woman of distinction could have occasion for and in a few days time she sparkled before her preserver in the brightness of an eastern princess he was quite charmed with the beauties of her person and could not enough admire her uncommon understanding he offered to marry her to settle largely on her and as she was a single woman she could not in gratitude refuse the request of so generous a benefactor my informer further related that they have both lived in the greatest happiness ever since and the doctor who is one of the best of men is continually studying how to add to the felicities of her every day that he offered to take her up to london to pass the winters there but this she refused and desired she might remain where she was in the country as it was really most agreeable to her and as he preferred it to the town  a reflection on miss dunks marrying dr stanvil this account made the thing quite plain to me and to judge impartially considering the whole case i could neither blame the lovely agnes for marrying the doctor nor condemn her for pretending to be a stranger to me she was fairly dead and buried and all connection between us was at an end of course as there had been no marriage nor contract of marriage and as to reviving the affair and renewing the tenderness which had existed it could answer no other end than producing unhappiness as she was then mrs stanvil in a decent and happy situation and further in respect of her marrying the doctor so soon after her separation from me it was certainly the wisest thing she could do as she had been so entirely at his disposal was without a stitch to cover her and i in all probability after burying her being gone up to london or in some place where she could never hear of me more i might likewise have been married if any thing advantageous had offered after laying her in the churchyard and beside she neither knew the place she fell sick in nor the country the doctor removed her to as soon as ever he could get any clothes to put on her so that naked and friendless as she was without any money and ignorant of what became of me without a possibility of informing herself i could not but acquit her i even admired her conduct and resolved so far to imitate her in regard to the general happiness that nothing should appear in my behavior which could incline any one to think i had ever seen her before the night the tempest drove me to her house i was vexed i own to lose her but that could be no reason for making a senseless uproar that could do nothing but mischief  as composed then as i could be i went down to breakfast on a servants letting me know they waited for me and found the same company who had so lately parted to slumber all quite alive and cheerful easy and happy as mortals could be at the request of dr stanvil who was extremely civil i staid with them two months and passed the time in a delightful conversation intermixed with music cards and feasting my departure from dr stanvils house with sadness i left them all but especially on account of parting for ever with the late miss dunk it was indeed for the pleasure of looking at her that i staid so long as i did at dr stanvils and when it came to an eternal separation i felt that morning of my departure an inward distress it is impossible to give an idea of to another it had some resemblance i imagine of what the visionaries call a dereliction when they sink from ecstasy to the black void of horror by the strength of fancy and the unnacountable operation of the animal spirits  some observations on mrs stanvils coming to life again after being taken out of the grave here before i proceed i think i ought to remove some objections that may be made against my relation of mrs stanvils coming to life again and her being brought from the couch of lasting night to a bridal bed it is not easy to believe that after i seemed certain she was dead and kept her the proper number of days before interment saw her lie the cold wan subject for a considerable time and then let down into the grave yet from thence she should come forth and now be the desire of a husbands eyes this is a hard account sure but nevertheless it is a fact as to my being mistaken no less a man than dr cheyne thought colonel townsend dead see his nervous cases and that several have lived for many years after they had been laid in the tomb is a thing too certain and wellknown to be denied in bayles dictionary there is the history of a lady of quality belonging to the court of catharine de medicis who was brought from the church vault where she had been fortyeight hours and afterward became the mother of several children on her marriage with the marquis dauvergne  the learned dr connor in his history of poland gives us a very wonderful relation of a gentlemans reviving in that country after he had been seemingly dead for near a fortnight and adds a very curious dissertation on the nature of such recoveries the case of dun scotus who was found out of his coffin on the steps going down to the vault he was deposited in and leaning on his elbow is full to my purpose and i can affirm from my own knowledge that a gentleman of my acquaintance a worthy excellent man was buried alive and found not only much bruised and torn on opening his coffin but turned on one side this many still living can attest as well as i the reason of opening the grave again was his dying of a high fever in the absence of his lady who was in a distant county from him and on her return three days after he was buried would have a sight of him as she had been extremely fond of him his face was sadly broke and his hands hurt in striving to force up the lid of the coffin the lady was so affected with the dismal sight that she never held up her head after and died in a few weeks i could likewise add another extraordinary case of a man who was hanged and to all appearance was quite dead yet three days after his execution recovered as they were going to cut him up  how these things happen is not easy to account for but happen they do sometimes and this case of mrs stanvil may be depended on as a fact  n b the following is the thing promised the english reader at page      the legend on the monument of homonoea translated into english atimetus if it was allowed to lay down ones life for another and possible by such means to save what we loved from the grave whateever length of days was allotted me i would with pleasure offer up my life to get my homonoea from the tomb but as this cannot be done what is in my power i will do  fly from the light of heaven and follow you to the realms of lasting night   homonoea my dearest atimetus cease to torment your unhappy mind nor let grief thus feed on your youth and make life bitterness itself i am gone in the way appointed for all the mortal race all must be numbered with the dead and since fate is inexorable and tears are in vain weep not for me once more i conjure you but may you be ever happy may providence preserve you and add to your life those years which have been taken from mine   the person who erected the monument to the memory of homonoea stop traveller for a few minutes and ponder on these lines  here lies homonoea whom atimetus preferred to the greatest and most illustrious women of his time she had the form of venus the charms of the graces and an understanding and sensibility which demonstrated that wisdom had given to an angels form a mind more lovely before she was twenty she was dissolved and as she had practiced righteousness by carrying it well to those about her and to all that were specially related she parted with them as she had lived with them in justice and charity in modesty and submission in thankfulness and peace filled with divine thoughts inured to contemplate the perfections of god and to acknowledge his providence in all events she died with the humblest resignation to the divine will and was only troubled that she left her husband a mourner excellent homonoea  may the earth lie light upon thee and in the morning of the resurrection may you awake again to life and rise to that immortality and glory which god the righteous judge will give to true worth and dignity  as rewards to a life adorned

of this fine mythological picture is not good i shall place another version of this table at the end of this section i made it at the request of a young lady who did not like mr colliers version the

make the learned men of a beerhouse laugh than to delight and improve people of breeding and understanding    a reflection as i rid from dr stanvils house    with this advice of the genius in my head which by chance i had read the morning i took my leave of dr stanvil i set out as i had resolved for york and designed to go from thence to london hoping to meet with something good and purposing if it was possible to be no longer the rover but turn to something useful and fix i had lost almost all at the gamingtable as related and had not thirty pounds of my last hundred remaining this with a few sheep cows and horses at ortonlodge and a very small stock at my little farm on the borders of cumberland was all i had left it made me very serious and brought some dismal apprehensions in view but i did not despair as my heart was honest i still trusted in the providence of god and his administration of things is this world as the infinite power and wisdom of the creator was evident from a survey of this magnificent and glorious scene  as his care and providence over each particular in the administration of the great scheme was conspicuous can man the favorite of heaven have reason to lift up his voice to complain if he calls off his affections from folly and by natural and supernatural force by reason and revelation overbears the prejudices of flesh and blood  if he ponders the hopes and fears of religion  and gives a just allowance to a future interest hearken to the commandments says the lord and your peace shall be as a river  a tempest    on then i trotted brave as the man of wood we read of in an excellent french writer in claudes reply to arnaud the french papist we are told it was the humor of the prince of conde to have a man of wood on horseback dressed like a fieldofficer with a lifted broad sword in its hand which figure was fastened in the great saddle and the horse it was on always kept by the great condes side when he traveled or engaged in the bloody field fearless the man of wood appeared in many a wellfought day but as they pursued the enemy one afternoon through a forest in riding hard a bough knocked off the wooden warriors head yet still he galloped on after flying foes to the amazement of the enemy who saw a hero pursuing without a head claude applies this image to popery   and hoped at the end of every mile to meet with something fortunate but nothing extraordinary occurred till the second evening when i arrived at a little lone publichouse on the side of a great heath by the entrance of a wood for an hour before i came to this resting place i had rid in a tempest of wind rain lightning and thunder so very violent that it brought to my remembrance old hesiods description of a storm  then jove omnipotent displayed the god and all olympus trembled as he trod he grasps ten thousand thunders in his hand bares his red arm and wields the forky brand then aims the bolts and bids his lightnings play they flash and rend through heaven their flaming way redoubling blow on blow in wrath he moves the singed earth groans and burns with all her groves a night of clouds blots out the golden day full in their eyes the writhen lightnings play nor slept the wind the wind new horror forms clouds dash on clouds before the outrageous storms while tearing up the sands in drifts they rise and half the deserts mount the encumbered skies at once the tempest bellows lightnings fly the thunders roar and clouds involve the sky it was a dreadful evening upon a heath and so much as a bush was not to be met with for shelter but at last we came to the thatched habitation of a publican and i thought it a very comfortable place we had bread and bacon and good ale for supper and in our circumstances it seemed a delicious meal  the author is informed of an old acquaintance of his who lived not far from the inn he arrived at    this man informed me that about a mile from his habitation in the middle of the wood there dwelt an old physician one dr fitzgibbons an irish gentleman who had one very pretty daughter a sensible woman to whom he was able to give a good fortune if a man to both their liking appeared but as no such one had as yet come in their way my landlord advised me to try the adventure and he would furnish me with an excuse for going to the doctors house this set me a thinking dr fitzgibbons an irish gentleman i said i know the man i saved his sons life in ireland when he was upon the brink of destruction and the old gentleman was not only then as thankful as it was possible for a man to be in return for the good i had done him at the hazard of my own life but assured me a thousand times over that if ever it was in his power to return my kindness he would be my friend to the utmost of his ability he must ever remember with the greatest gratitude the benefit i had so generously conferred on him and his all this came full into my mind and i determined to visit the old gentleman in the morning     next day as i had resolved i went to pay my respects to dr fitzgibbons who remembered me perfectly well was most heartily glad to see me and received me in the most affectionate manner he immediately began to repeat his obligations to me for the deliverance i had given his son and that if it was in his power to be of service to me in england he would leave nothing undone that was possible for him to do to befriend me the case was this as i was returning one summers evening from tallowhills where i had been to see a young lady mentioned in the beginning of my first volume i saw in a deep glen before me two men engaged a black of an enormous size who fought with one of those large broad swords which they call in ireland andrew ferraro and a little thin man with a drawn rapier the white man i perceived was no match for the black and must have perished very soon as he had received several wounds if i had not hastened up to his relief i knew him to be my acquaintance young fitzgibbons my neighbor in the same square of the college that i lived in and immediately drawing an excellent spanish tuck i always wore took the moor to myself fitzgibbons not being able to stand any longer and a glorious battle ensued as i was a master at the small sword in those days i had the advantage of the black by my weapon as the broad sword is but a poor defense against a rapier and gave him three wounds for every slight one i received but at last he cut me quite through the left collarbone and in return i was in his vast body a moment after this dropped the robber who had been a trumpeter to a regiment of horse and fitzgibbons and i were brought by some people passing that way to his fathers house at dolfinsbarn a village about a mile from the spot where this affair happened a surgeon was sent for and we recovered in a few weeks time but my collarbone was much more troublesome to me than the wounds fitzgibbons had were to him though he lost much more blood this was the ground of the obligation the doctor mentioned in his conversation with me   he told me that darling son of his whose life i had saved was an eminent physician at the court of russia where he lived in the greatest opulence and reputation and as he owed his existence as such to me his father could never be grateful enough in return can i any way serve you sir have you been fortunate or unfortunate since your living in england are you married or unmarried i have a daughter by a second wife and if you are not yet engaged will give her to you with a good fortune and in two years time if you will study physic here under my direction will enable you to begin to practice and get money as i have done in this country i have so true a sense of that generous act you did to save my son that i will with pleasure do any thing in my power that can contribute to your happiness  to this i replied by thanking the doctor for his friendly offers and letting him know that since my coming to england several years ago which was occasioned by a difference between my father and me i had met with several turns of fortune good and bad and was at present but in a very middling way having only a little spot among the mountains of richmondshire with a cottage and garden on it and three or four beasts which i found by accident without an owner as i traveled through that uninhabited land and a small farm of fifty acres with some stock on the borders of cumberland which i got by a deceased wife this with about fifty guineas in my purse was my all at present and i was going up to london to try if i could meet with any thing fortunate in that place but that since he was pleased to make me such generous offers i would stop study physic as he proposed and accept the great honor he did me in offering me his daughter for a wife i told him likewise very fairly and honestly that i had been rich by three or four marriages since my being in this country but that i was unfortunately taken in at a gamingtable by the means of two irish gentlemen he knew very well and there lost all which vexed me the more as i really do not love play  that as to my father i had little to expect from him though he had a great estate as our difference was about religion which kind of disputes always have the cruellest tendency and the wife you know he married a low cunning woman does all she can to maintain the variance and keep up his anger to me that her nephew may do the better on my ruin i have not writ to him since my being in england nor have i met with any one who could give me any account of the family this is my case sir  and what dr fitzgibbons said is this fine religious dispute which has made your father fall out with a son he was once so fond of  it was about trinity in unity sir a thing i have often heard your son argue against by lessons he had from you as he informed me my father is as orthodox as gregory nazienzen among the ancient fathers or trapp and potter webster and waterland among the modern doctors and when he found out that i was become an unitarian and renounced his religion of three gods the horrible creed of athanasius and all the despicable explications of his admired divines on that subject  that i insisted that notwithstanding all the subtle inventions of learned men through the whole christian world yet god almighty has not appointed himself to be worshipped by precept or example in any one instance in his holy word under the character of father son and holy ghost  that the worship of three persons and one god is expressly contrary to the solemn determination of christ and his apostles  and in numbers of instances in the new testament it is declared that the one god and father of all is the only supreme object to whom all religious worship should be directed  that for these reasons i renounced the received doctrine of a coequal trinity and believed our great and learned divines who labored to prevent people from seeing the truth as it is in jesus would be in some tribulation at christs tribunal where they are to appear stripped of all worldly honors dignities and preferments poor naked wretched mortals and to answer for their supplement to the gospel in an invented heresy of three gods  when my father heard these things and saw the religious case of his son his passion was very great he forbid me his table and ordered me to shift for myself he renounced me as i had done the triune god  the doctor wondered not a little at the account i had given him as my father was reckoned a man of great abilities and taking me by the hand said i had acted most gloriously that what lost me my fathers affection was the very thing that ought to have induced him to erect a statue to my honor in his garden  that since i was pleased to accept of his offer his friendship i might depend on  that if i would i should begin the next day the study of physic under his direction and at the end of two years he would give me his daughter who was not yet quite twenty  the picture of julia fitzgibbons    just as he had said this miss fitzgibbons entered the room and her father introduced me to her the sight of her astonished me though i had before seen so many fine women i could not help looking with wonder at her she appeared one of those finished creatures whom we cannot enough admire and upon acquaintance with her became much more glorious  what a vast variety of beauty do we see in the infinity of nature among the sex we may find a thousand and a thousand perfect images and characters all equally striking and yet as different as the pictures of the greatest masters in italy what amazing charms and perfections have i beheld in women as i journeyed through life when i have parted from one well i said i shall never meet another like this inimitable maid and yet after all julia appeared divinely fair and happy in every excellence that can adorn the female mind without that exact regularity of beauty and elegant softness of propriety which rendered miss dunk whom i have described in these memoirs a very divinity julia charmed with a graceful negligence and enchanted with a face that glowed with youthful wonders beauties that art could not adorn but always diminished the choice of dress was no part of julias care but by the neglect of it she became irresistible in her countenance there ever appeared a bewitching mixture of sensibility and gaiety and in her soul by converse we discovered that generosity and tenderness were the first principles of her mind to truth and virtue she was inwardly devoted and at the bottom of her heart though hard to discover it her main business to serve god and fit herself for eternity in sum she was one of the finest originals that ever appeared among womankind peculiar in perfections which cannot be described and so inexpressibly charming in an attractive sweetness a natural gaiety and a striking negligence a fine understanding and the most humane heart that i found it impossible to know her without being in love with her her power to please was extensive indeed in her one had the loveliest idea of woman  the author marries miss fitzgibbons his seventh wife    to this fine creature i was married at the end of two years from my first acquaintance with her that is after i had studied physic so long under the care and instruction of her excellent father who died a few weeks after the wedding which was in the beginning of the year      and the   th of my age dying he left me a handsome fortune his library and house and i imagined i should have lived many happy years with his admirable daughter who obliged me by every endearing means to be excessively fond of her i began to practice upon the old gentlemans death and had learned so much in the two years i had studied under him from his lecturing and my own hard reading that i was able to get some money among the opulent round me not by art and collusion the case of too many doctors in town and country but by practicing upon consistent principles the method of my reading by dr fitzgibbons directions was as follows and i set it down here for the benefit of such gentlemen as choose to study in the private manner i did  a method of studying physic in a private manner by which means a gentleman with the purchase of a diploma may turn out doctor as well as if he went to padua to hear morganni the first books i got upon my table were the lexicons of castellus and quincy one for the explication of ancient terms and the other of modern these as dictionaries lay at hand for use when wanted  i then opened the last edition of schelhammers herman conringiuss introductio in universam artem medicam singulasque ejus parts i say the last edition      because that has an excellent preface by hoffman this book which comes down to the beginning of the   th century i read with great care especially gonthier christopher schelhammers notes and additions which have enriched the work very much by the way they were both very great men and bright ornaments to their profession they writ an amazing number of books on medicine conringius died december      aged    schelhammer in january      in the   th year of his age  the next introductory book to the art was lindenius renovatus de scriptis medicis quibus praemittitur manuductio ad medicinam this book was first called libro duo de scripturis etc and written by vander linden a famous leyden professor who published it in the year      in a small octavo in the same form it was printed in      and      these three editions at amsterdam but the valuable edition is that of nuremburg      by george abraham merklinus who made very many and excellent additions to this fourth edition and called it lindenius renovatus as he had augmented it to a vast   to john antonides vander linden died in march      aged    and merklinus in april   0  in the   th year of his age they both writ many books in physic but there have been such improvements made by the diligence and success of modern physicians that it would be only loss of time to read over all their works or all the authors of the   th century  the next books i opened were the learned daniel le clercs history of physic which commences with the world and ends at the time of galen and the great dr friends history which is a continuation of le clerc down to linacre the founder of the college of physicians in the reign of henry viii  these books showed me the origin and revolutions of physic and the ancient writers and their works on this subject by the way daniel le clerc died in june      aged    and some months  when i had read these things if mangetus had published his bibliotheca scriptorum medicorum   vols folio at the time i am speaking of the doctor my friend would have recommended it to a beginner i turned next to botany and read raii methodus plantarum emendata londini   0  raii synopsis methodica stirpium ed   and tourneforts institutiones rei herbariae these books with a few observations of my own as i walked in the gardens the fields and on the plains furnished me with sufficient knowledge of this kind for the present the vast folios on this subject are not for beginners  chemistry was the next thing my director bid me look into and to this purpose i perused boerhaaves elementa chemiae and hoffmans observationes physicochemiae these afford as much chemistry as a young physician need set out with but as books alone give but an imperfect conception i performed most of the common operations in the portable furnace of becher  the materia medica in the next place had my attention that is those animal vegetable and fossil substances which are used to prevent cure or palliate diseases and in order to know the names of all the drugs their history the adulterations they are subject to their virtues their dose their manner of using them and the cautions which they require  to get a sufficient knowledge of this kind i looked into geoffreys materia medica and made a collection of the materia at the same time that i might conceive and remember what i read  pharmacy or the art of preparing and compounding medicines was the next thing i endeavored to be a master of and that i might know how to exalt their virtues to obviate their ill qualities and to make them less nauseous i read to this purpose quincys pharmaceutical lectures and dispensatory and took care to be well versed in all the pharmacopoeias those of london edinburgh paris boerhaave bate and fuller and i read very carefully gaubins methodus praescribendi this gave me the materials and taught me the form of prescribing  anatomy i studied next that is the art of dividing the several parts of a body so as to know their size figure situation connexions and make i began with drake and keil and then read over winslow i had likewise open before me at the same time at my entrance upon this study a good set of plates the tables of eustachius and cooper and turned them carefully over as i read the doctor then showed me how to dissect but chiefly by the direction of a book called the culter anatomicus of michel lyserus ou method court facile and claire de dissequer les corpse humaines i was soon able to perform myself it was the third edition of lyserus      which has many curious anatomical observations added to it by gaspard bartholin the son of the celebrated thomas bartholin copenhagen professor  michel lysere was the disciple of the great thomas bartholin thomas died december    0 in his   th year michel in     a young man regrette a cause de son merit i had also nichols compendium and hunters compendium by these means and by reading the authors who have written upon some one part only such as peyerus de glandulis intestinus experimenta circa pancras de graaf de organis generationis gasp bartholin de diaphragm malpigius de pulmonibus  de venibus  de liene et de cornuum vegetatione lower de cord  de ventriculo et de cerebri anat willis de respiratione glisson de hepatoe cassrius de vocis auditusque organis walsalou de aure havers on the bones munro on the bones douglas on the muscles morgagni adversaria ruyshii opera nucks adenographia whartons adenographia ridleys anatomy of the brain santorini observationes boneti sepulchrum anatomicum blasii anatomia animalium tysons anatomy of the oranoutang by these means i cut up the body of a young woman i had from a neighboring churchyard and acquired knowledge enough of anatomy  n b if all the pieces written upon some one part of the body are not to be had single the reader inclined to the delightful study of physic will find them in the bibliotheca anatomica   vols folio  here before i proceed i will mention a very curious case which occurred in my dissecting the body i have spoken of it was as remarkable an example of a preternatural structure as ever appeared case of a young woman with a double vagina in cutting her up there was found two vaginas and a right and left uterus each uterus had its corresponding vagina and the uteri and the vaginae lay parallel to each other there was only one ovarium but two perfect hymens the labia stretched so as to take in the anus terminating beyond it and as they were in large ridges and well armed the whole had a formidable appearance if it should be asked could a perfect superfoetation take place in such a person most certainly there might be one conception upon the back of another at different times therefore i should not choose to marry a woman with two vaginas if it was possible to know it before wedlock  but to proceed  the next things i read were the institutes of medicine that is such books as treat of the economy and contrivance of nature in adapting the parts to their several uses the books purely physiological are keils tentamina sanctorii aphorismi bellini de pulsibus et urina borellus de motu animalium harvey de motu cordis  and de generation animalium two admirable pieces friends emmenologia simpsons system of the womb and pitcairnes tracts these are the best things relating to physiology which may be called the first part of the institutions of physic  the  d part of the institutes is the art of preserving such a system as the body in an order fit for the exercise of its functions as long as possible the  d part is pathology which teaches the different manners in which diseases happen and the various causes of these disorders with their attendants and consequences the  th part is the doctrine of signs by which a judgment is formed of the sound or bad state of the animal and the  th is therapentica that is the means and method of restoring sanity to a distempered body treatises on all these matters are what we call institutions of physic and in relation to the four last mentioned the best books are hoffmans systema medicinoe rationalis and boerhaaves institutions with his lectures upon them these books i read with great attention and found them sufficient  being instituted in this manner i turned next to the practical writers and read the history of diseases and their cure from observations of nature this is called pathologia particularis and is the great business of a physician all that has been said is only preparatory to this study here then i first very carefully read the authors who have written a system of all diseases and then such writers as have considered particular cases the best system writers are boerhaaves aphorisms and comment hoffmans pathologia particularis being the last part of his systema medicinae jumhers cospectus medicinae allens synopsis shaws practice of physic and lomnii opusculum aureum  the writers on a few and particular distempers are sydenham opera moretons puretologia bellini de morbis capitis et pectoris ramazzini de morbis artificium wepsemus de apoplexia floyer on the asthma astruc de lue venerea turners synopsis and of the skin musgrave de arthritide highmore de passione hysterica et hypocondria glisson de rachitide clericus de lumbrico lato daventer ars obstetricandi mauriceau des femmes grosses harris de morbis infantium turners letter to a young physician all these books very carefully i read and to your reading add the best observations you can any where get or make yourself i writ down in the shortest manner abstracts of the most curious and useful things especially the representations of nature and refreshed my memory by often looking into my notebook every thing taken from nature is valuable hypothesis is entertaining rather than useful  and when i was reading the history of diseases in the authors i have just mentioned i looked into the ancient greek and latin medical writers for all their merit lies in this kind of history their pharmacy and anatomy is good for nothing they scarce knew any thing of the human bodies but from the dissections of other animals took their descriptions the great vesalius in the beginning of the   th century was the first that taught physicians to study nature in dissecting human bodies which was then considered by the church as a kind of sacrilege when vesalius began to dissect human bodies he was considered by the people as an impious cruel man and before he could practice publicly he was obliged to get a decision in his favor from the salamanca divines cest ce qui engagea charles v de fair fair une consultation aux theologiens de salamanque pour savoir si en conscience on pouvoit dissequer un corpse humain pour en connoitre la structure  niceron memoirs they would not let him settle in france but the republic of venice gave him a professors chair at padua where he dissected publicly and taught anatomy seven years he was but    when he published his famous book la fabrique du corpse humain which was the admiration of all men of science and a little after he made a present of the first skeleton the world ever saw to the university of bale where it is still to be seen this great man andrew vesal was born the last of april      and in the   th year of his age october         he was shipwrecked on the isle of zante and in the deserts there was famished to death his body was found by a goldsmith of his acquaintance who happened to land there not long after and by this man buried vesals works are two volumes in folio published by herman boerhaave lugduni batavorum      every physician ought to have them   as to chemistry they had no notion of it it was not heard of till some hundred years after the latest of them in botany they had made little progress in short as they knew little of botany  nothing of chemistry as their systems of natural philosophy and anatomy were false and unnatural and it is upon anatomy and natural philosophy that physiology or the use of the parts is founded we can expect nothing from the ancients upon these heads but mere imaginations or notions unsupported by observation or matter of fact it is their history of diseases supports their character hippocrates in particular excels all others on this head but this great man was not perfect even in this knowledge in nature is the daughter of time and experience many notions of the animal economy were then absurd and if hippocrates was too wise to act always up to his theory yet he could not be entirely free from its influence  the names of the ancient original greek medical writers are hippocrates dioscorides aritaeus galen and alexander the latin writers of physic are celsus scribonius largus caelius aurelianus marcellus empericus theodorus priscianus and sextus placitus we have besides several collectors as oribasius aetius paulus aeginita etc nicander the medical poet and the fragments of soranus rufus ephesius zonorates vindicianus diocles carystius cassius and a few others but all these may be looked into afterward the original authors are sufficient in the noviciate  as to the latin medical writers celsus and caelius aurelianus only are worth reading celsus lived in the latter end of the reign of augustus and is admirable for the purity of his latin and the elegance of his sense you must have him night and morning in your hands till you are a master of the terms and expressions peculiar to physic which occur in him the style of caelius is very bad and his cavils tedious but his description of diseases is full and accurate in this respect he is a very valuable writer he lived in the second century as did galen likewise  as to hippocrates who was contemporary with socrates he was born the first year of the soth olympiad   0 before christ rene chartiers edit paris      is the most pompous but vander lindens leyden        vols in  vo is the best when i read hippocrates i did also look into prosper alpinis good book de presagienda vita et morte aegrotantium in which he has with great care collected and methodized all the scattered observations of hippocrates relating to the dangerous or salutary appearances in difeases at the same time i likewise read this great mans medicina methodica he died professor of botany at padua feb      aet    and was born november      i did likewise look into the best commentators on hippocrates whose names you will find in conringiuss introduction which i have mentioned  n b the best edition of dioscoridess materia medica is that of frankfort      folio the best edition of aritaeus who lived before julius cesars time as dioscorides did ad    is boerhaaves      folio the best edition of galens works are that of bale      in   vols and that of venice      in   volumes alexander of tralles flourished in the  th century under justinian the great and left the following works therapentica lib    de singularum corporis partium vitiis aegritudinibus and injuriis lib   epist de lumbricis tractatus de puerorum morbis liber de febribus the best greek copy is that of stephens paris      folio in greek and latin basil      but in neither of these editions is to be found the epistle de lumbricis you must look for that in the   th volume of fabriciuss bibliotheca graeca  in the last place besides all the authors i have mentioned i likewise looked into the original observation writers and miscellaneous books relating to physic they afford excellent knowledge where the authors are faithful and judicious such are the observationes medicae of nicolaus tulpius a curious book and the dedication of it to his son peter a student in physic good advice  d edition      is the best it is a fourth part larger than the  st edition that came out in      the observationes et curationes medicinales of petrus forestus lib     the observationes medicae of joannes theodorus schenkius  and the various journals and transactions of learned societies which are repositories in which the physician finds much rare and valuable knowledge and as a physician ought to have a little acquaintance with the modern practice of surgery i concluded with heisters turners and sharps surgery  by this method of studying physic in the middle of a wood and employing my time and pains in reading the ancients and considering their plain and natural account of diseases i became a doctor as well as if i had been a regular collegiate in the world  but it is time to think of my various story and i shall detain my reader no longer from it than while he reads the following translation of the charming mythological picture of cebes which is placed here as the golden  0th satire of juvenal is put after the xiiith section of this work by way of entertainment between the acts  a translation of the table of cebes the thing is a dialogue between an old man and a traveller while we were walking in the temple of saturn in the city of thebes and viewing the votive honors of the god the various offerings which had been presented to that deity we observed at the entrance of the fane a picture tablet that engaged our attention as it was a thing entirely new both with regard to the painting and the design for some time we stood considering the device and fable but still found ourselves unable to guess the meaning the piece did not seem to be either a city or a camp but was a kind of a walled court that had within it two other enclosures and one of them was larger than the other the first court opened at a gate before which a vast crowd of people appeared impatient to enter and within a group of female figures was represented stationed at the porch without was seen a venerable form who looked like some great teacher and seemed to warn the rushing multitude long we gazed at this work but were not able to understand the design till an old man came up to us and spoke in the following manner    o it is no wonder strangers that you cannot comprehend this picture for even our inhabitants are not able to give a solution of the allegoric scene the piece is not an offering of any of our citizens but the work of a foreigner a man of great learning and virtue and a zealous disciple of the samian or elean sages who arrived here many years ago and by his conversation instructied us in the best learning which is morality it was he built and consecrated this temple to saturn and placed here this picture you see before you  a translation of the mythological picture of cebes by the rev and famous jeremy collier as we were taking a turn in saturns temple we saw a great many consecrated presents remarkable enough for their curiosity amongst the rest we took particular notice of a picture hung over the door the piece we perceived was all emblem and mythology but then the representation was so singular and out of custom that we were perfectly at a loss whence it should come and what was the meaning of it upon a strict view we found it was neither a city nor a camp but a sort of court with two partitions of the same figure within it though one of them was larger than the other the first court had a crowd of people at the gate and within we saw a great company of women just at the entrance of the first gate there stood an old man who by his gesture and countenance seemed to be busy in giving advice to the crowd as they came in and being long at a stand about the design of the fable a grave man somewhat in years making up begins to discourse us in this manner gentlemen says he i understand you are strangers and therefore it is no wonder the history of this picture should puzzle you for there are not many of our own countrymen than can explain it for you are to observe this is none of our town manufacture the greek words which mr collier renders townmanufacture are  but along while ago a certain outlandish man and what he calls outlandish is  of great sense and learning and who by his discourse and behavior seemed to be a disciple of pythagoras and parmenides this gentleman i say happening to travel hither built this structure and dedicated both the temple and this piece of painting to saturn sir said i had you any acquaintance with this gentleman yes says he i had the benefit of his conversation and was one of his admirers a long time for to my thinking though he was but young he talked at a strange significant rate the greek is    n b the remainder of colliers facetious version is omitted for want of room  t and did you know i said and converse with this wise man   o yes he replied i was long acquainted with him and as he was but young and talked with great judgment upon the most important subjects with astonishment i have listened to him and with pleasure heard him explain the moral of this fable   t expound to us then i conjure you the meaning of the picture if business does not call you away for we long to be instructed in the design of the piece   o i am at leisure the old man answered and willingly consent to your request but i must inform you first there is some danger in what you ask if you hearken with attention and by consideration understand the precepts you will become wise virtuous and blessed   if otherwise you will be abandoned blind and miserable  the explanation of the picture resembles the enigma of the sphinx which she proposed to every passenger that came that way if they could expound the riddle they were safe but if they failed in the attempt they were destroyed by the monster this monster who lived near thebes was said to be the daughter of typhon and echidna and had a head and face like a girl wings like a bird and in the rest like a dog folly is as it were a sphinx to mankind she asks you how is good and ill defined if you cannot explain the problem and happen to misjudge you perish by degrees and become the victim of her cruelty you do not die immediately as the unhappy did by the theban monster but by the force and operation of folly you will find yourself dying from day to day your rational part wounded and decayed every noble power of the foul confounded and like those given up to punishment for life feel the last of those pangs which guilt prepares for the stupid but if by thinking you can understand and discern the boundaries of good and ill then folly like the sphinx must perish and your life will be blessed with happiness and serenity  hear me then with all your attention  these things being previously observed by the old man and we entreating him to begin he lifted up a wand he held and pointing to the picture said the first enclosure represents human life and the multitude at the gate those who are daily entering into the world that aged person you see on an eminence directing with one hand and holding in the other a roll which is the code of reason is the genius of mankind benevolent he seems to bend and teach the people what they ought to do shows them as they enter into life the path they ought to take the way which leads to danger and that which bears to safety and happiness   t and which is the way i said and how are they to find it   o that you shall know hereafter but at present you must take notice of that painted woman seated on a throne very near the gate she is called delusion and by every art with fawn and soft infection presents a bowl of ignorance and error to all that enter into life they take the cup and in proportion to what they have drank of the intoxicating mixture are led away by the women you see at a little distance from imposture to destruction some and some to safety less erring and less blind those being who have but tasted of delusions cup  these women so variously dressed and so profusely gay are called the opinions desires and pleasures you observe how they embrace each mortal as he arrives within the gate promise the greatest blessings and compel their votaries to wander with them where they please   t but who i asked is that woman placed on a globe who appears not only blind but seems to be wild and distracted incessantly she walks about and flings her favors capriciously from some she snatches their effects and possessions and bestows them upon others   o they call her fortune replied the old man her attitude marks her character her gifts are as unstable as her tottering ball and all who depend upon her specious promises are deceived when most they trust her and find themselves exposed to the greatest misfortunes   t there is a great crowd i perceive surrounding her and if too commonly she meditates mischief whenever the smiles what is the meaning of their attendance   o these are the inconsiderate and stand there to catch the toys she blindly scatters among them wealth fame titles an offspring strength or beauty the victors laurel and arbitrary power those who rejoice and are lavish in their praises of this divinity have received some favors from her and call her the goddess of good fortune but those whom you see weeping and wringing their hands are such whom she has deprived of every good they curse her as the goddess of ill fortune   t but replied i as to riches glory nobility a numerous posterity power and honor which you called toys why are they not real advantages   o of these things our instructor answered we shall speak hereafter more fully at present it is better to continue the explication of the picture    cast your eyes next then on that higher enclosure proceeded the old man and take notice of the women on the outside thereof you observe how wantonly they are dressed the first of them is incontinence loosely zoned her bosom bare and the other three are riot covetousness and flattery they watch for the favorites of fortune you see they caress them and try to bring them to the pleasures of their soft retreat where the bowl sparkles the song resounds and joys to joys succeed in every jocund hour but at length distress appears and the favorite of a day discovers that his happiness was merely imaginary under a delusion but the evils that attend his pleasures real when he has wasted all he had received from fortune he is forced to enter himself into the service of those mistresses and by them compelled to dare the foulest and most desperate deeds villain and knave he becomes stabs for a purse his country sells for gold and by deceit and sacrilege by perjury treachery and theft endeavors for some time to live but shiftless at length and unable to acquire support by crimes they are consigned to the dire gripe of punishment   t what is she i beg you will inform us   o look beyond those women called the opinions continued the old man and you will see a low gate opening into a dark and narrow cave you may observe at the entrance of it three female figures very swarthy and foul covered with rags and filthiness and near them standing naked by their side a frightful lean man this man mr collier calls an illlooking skeleton of a fellow with scarce a tatter to his limbs cant the greek is   close to him is another woman so meagre and ghastly you perceive that it is not possible for any thing to resemble him more   t we see them and request to be informed who they are   o the first with a whip in her hand is punishment and next to her sits sadness with her head reclining on her knees that woman tearing her hair is trouble the naked lean man is sorrow and the image by his side wild despair you see they are all going to seize the unhappy man of pleasure and make him feel the greatest pain and anguish for they carry him to the house of misery and in the pit of woe he is to pass the remainder of life unless repentance comes to his relief   t and what then follows i said if repentance interposes   o she rescues him from his tormentors and gives him a new view of things he has from her some account of true learning but the hint so short that it may lead him likewise to false learning if he be so happy as to understand and choose right he is delivered from prejudice and error and passes the rest of his days in tranquillity and peace but if he be mistaken instead of wisdom he only gains that amusing counterfeit which turns him from vice to studious folly   t great i replied are the risks we mortals run but who is this false learning       o at the entrance of the second enclosure the three enclosures in cebes allude to the division of human life into the sensual the studious and the virtuous  you may observe a woman neatly dressed and of a good appearance decent the port  spotless the form this is the counterfeit but the vulgar call her true learning even the happy few who succeed in the pursuit of wisdom are commonly detained too long by this deceiving fair one nor is it strange for skilled as she is in all the learning and in every art can grace the head you see what crowds of admirers she has poets orators logicians musicians arithmeticians geometricians astrologers and critics   t but who i asked my instructor are those women so busy on every side and so earnest in their addresses to this company they look like incontinence and her companions and the opinions whom you showed us in the first court do they also frequent the second enclosure   o yes replied the old man incontinence is sometimes seen here the opinions do likewise enter for the early potion these men received from imposture still operates ignorance finds a place here and even extravagance and folly they remain under the power of these till having left false learning they enter upon the path that leads to wisdom when they arrive at the enlightened ground of truth they get her sovereign remedy mr collier translates it  they enter into a course of physic the greek is  and what mr collier a little before translates  she opens a vein and gives then a glass of her constitution  when the have taken the stirrup cup  brimmers  the lasses frisk about salute with a deal of welcome and the lug them off  some to ruin and some to the gallows  all this and much more nightcellar stuff the theban philosopher had not an idea of as any one may see who can turn to the greek how collier learned such guardphrases and why he use them seemed for some time very strange to me till i was informed by one who knew this divine well that in the days of his youth he kept very low company and was known at several nighthouses in that period of his life he translated cebes  and are freed from the ill effects of ignorance and error this enables them to throw off the wild hypothesis  the learned romance  and to employ the precious hours of life in thinking to the wisest purposes had they staid with false learning they never could have delivered themselves from these evils   t proceed then i pray you said i and show us the way that leads to happiness and wisdom       o do you see proceeded the venerable man that rising ground which appears so desert and uninhabited you may observe upon it a little gate that opens in a narrow and unfrequented path the avenue a rugged rocky way you perceive a little onward a steep and craggy mountain with precipices on either side which sink to a frightful depth this is the way to wisdom   t it seems a dreadful way as painted in this table   o yet higher still observe that rock toward the mountains brow and take notice of the two figures which sit upon it is edge and appear to be as beautiful and comely as the goddess of health they are sisters temperance the one patience the other with friendship in their looks and arms protended over the verge of the cliff you see them lean to encourage those who pass this way and rouse the spirits of the fainting sons of wisdom who has stationed these two sisters there they urge the brave men on tell them the hardships will lessen by degrees  the passage will become more easy and agreeable as they advance and offer them their assistance to ascend the summit and reach the top of the rock that being gained they show them the easiness and pleasantness of the rest of the way to wisdom the charming road invites ones eyes how smooth and flowery green and delightful does it appear   t it does indeed       o look next the excellent old man continued at that distant blooming wood and near it you will see a beautiful meadow on which there seems to fall a light as from a purer heaven a kind of double day in this lightsome field   you may perceive a gate which opens into another enclosure which is the abode of the blessed here the virtues dwell with happiness in this region of eternal beauty the righteous rest   t it does appear a charming place   o observe then near the portal a beauteous form of a composed aspect she seems mature in life and her robe is quite plain without affectation or ornaments her eyes are piercing her mien sedate she stands not on a globe like fortune but upon a cube of marble fixed as the rock she is on before the gate you see on either side of her two lovely nymphs the very copies of her looks and air this matron in the middle is true learning wisdom herself and the two young beauties are truth and persuasion her standing on a square is an expressive type of certainty in the way to her and denotes the unalterable and permanent nature of the blessings she bestows on those who come to  constanti vultu or constans vultum her from her they receive courage and serenity that confidence and contempt of fear which exempts the happy possessors from any disturbance by the accidents and calamities of life   t these are valuable gifts but why without the walls does wisdom stand   o to present the purifying bowl to those who approach and restore them to themselves as a physician by degrees first finds out the cause of a violent disorder and then removes it in order to restore the man to health so wisdom as she knows their malady administers her sovereign medicine and frees them from all their evils she expels the mischiefs they had received from delusion their ignorance and error and delivers them from pride lust anger avarice and all the other vices they had contracted in the first enclosure in a word she restores them to sanity and then sends them in to happiness and the virtues   t who are they i said       o do you not see within the gate my instructor replied a society of matrons beautiful and modest dressed unaffected and without any thing of the gay excess these are science and her sisters fortitude justice and integrity temperance modesty liberality continence clemency and patience they hail their guests and the company seem to be in raptures   t but when the friends to virtue are admitted into this charming society where do they lead then to   o see you not resumed the good old man the hill beyond the grove that eminence which is the highest point of all the enclosures and commands a boundless prospect there on a glorious throne you may observe a majestic person in her bloom well dressed but without art or lavish cost and her temples adorned with a beautiful tiar this is happiness the regent of that blessed abode and as the moral heroes approach her you may perceive her with the virtues who stand assistant round her going to reward the friends of wisdom with such crowns as are bestowed on conquerors   t conquerors i said in what conflicts have these persons been victorious   o they have in their way to the realm of happiness destroyed the most formidable and dangerous monsters who would have destroyed them if they had not been subdued these savage beasts at war with man are ignorance and error grief vexation avarice intemperance and every thing that is evil these are vanquished and have lost all their power the moral hero triumphs now though their slave before   t great achievements indeed a glorious conquest but exclusive of the honor of being crowned by happiness and the virtues is there any salutary power in the crown that adorns the heros head   o there is young man the virtue of it is great possessing this he is happy and blessed he derives his felicity from no external object but from himself alone   t o happy victory and being thus crowned what does the hero do  where next his steps   o conducted by the virtues he goes back to survey his first abode and see the crowd he left  how miserably they pass their time waste all their hours in crimes and in the whirl of passions live slaves to ambition pride incontinence vanity and avarice they appear tormented with endless anxiety they have forgot the instructions the good genius gave them at their entrance into life and suffer thus because they cannot find the way to wisdom   t true i said but i cannot comprehend why the virtues should bring the heroes back to the place they came from why should they return to view a wellknown scene   o the reason answered my instructor is because they had not a true idea of what they had seen surrounded by a confusion of things as they passed on they could not distinctly perceive what was done the mists of ignorance and error obscured the prospect as they journied on and by that means they were subject to mistakes they could not always distinguish between good and evil but now that they have attained to true learning with concern they behold the mad world the virtues show them again and being enlightened by wisdom are perfectly happy in themselves the misery of the numberless fools they behold now strikes them very strongly and gives them a delightful relish for their present happiness   t it must be so and when they have seen these things where do they then go   o wherever they please safely they may travel where they will in all times and in all places they are secure as their integrity is their defense every where they live esteemed and beloved by all the female monsters i have mentioned grief trouble lust avarice or poverty have now no power to hurt them but as if possessed of some virtuous drug they can grasp the viper and defy destruction   t what you say is just but who are all these persons descending the hill   o those that are crowned the old man said are the happy few i have described you see what joy is in their faces and those who seem forlorn and desperate under the command of certain women are such who by their folly have not found the way to true learning or stopping at the rough and narrow ascent you observed went to look for an easier path and so quite lost the road the tormentors who drive them on are trouble despair ignominy and ignorance wretched you see them return into the first enclosure to luxury and incontinence and yet they do not accuse themselves as the authors of their own ruin which is very strange but rail at wisdom and revile her ways asserting that the true pleasures of life are only to be found in luxury and riot like the brutes they place the whole satisfaction of man in the gratification of sensual appetite   t but who are those other lovely women who return down the hill so full of gaiety and mirth   o they are the opinions who having conducted the virtuous to the region of light are coming back to invite and carry others thither by showing them the felicity and success of those they brought to the mansion of wisdom   t and do the opinions never enter with those they bring into that happy place where the virtues and true learning reside   o no opinion can never reach to science they only deliver their charge into the hands of wisdom and then like ships that give up their lading in order to sail for a new cargo they return to bring other eleves to reason and felicity   t this explanation of the table i said is quite satisfactory but you have not yet informed us what the good genius bids the multitude do as they appear on the verge of life   o he charges them to act with courage and be magnanimous and brave in all events a thing i recommend to you young man and that you may have a true idea of this i will tell you what i mean by a bold spirit in passing through this world      o then lifting up his arm again and pointing with his wand to a figure in the picture that blind woman standing on a globe as i told you before is fortune the genius forbids us to trust her or imagine her smiles will be lasting happiness reason is never concerned in what the does it is fortune still without principle she acts is arbitrary and capricious and inconsiderately and rashly for ever proceeds regard not then her favors nor mind her frowns but as she gives and takes away and often deprives of what we had before we are neither to esteem or despise her but if we should receive from her a gift take care to employ it immediately to some good purpose and especially in the acquisition of true science the most lasting and precious possession if we act otherwise in respect of fortune we imitate those wretched usurers who rejoice at the money paid in to them as if they received it for their own use but pay it back with regret forgetting the condition that it was to be returned to the proprietor on demand regardless of fortune then and all her changes in this mortal life the genius advises to pass bravely on without harkening to the solicitations of incontinence and luxury in the first enclosure to reject their temptations and go on to false learning with her he would have us make a short stay to learn what may be of service to use in our journey to wisdom this is the advice of the genius to those who enter into life   t here the good old man had done and i thanked him for his explanation of the picture only one thing i said there was more which i must request he would tell me the meaning of what is it we can get by our stay with false learning   o things he answered that may be of use to us the languages and other parts of education which plato recommends may hinder us from being worse employed and keep us from illicit gratification they are not absolutely necessary to true happiness but they contribute to make us better something thing good and useful they do afford though virtue which ought to be the principal business in view may be acquired without them we may become wise without the assistance of the arts though as observed before they are far from being useless as by a good translation made into our own tongue we may know what an author means and yet by taking the pains to become masters of the original language might gain more advantages  such as entering better into the writers sense and discovering some beauties which cannot otherwise be found so the useful things in the sciences may be very quickly and easily learned and though by great labor in becoming accurately acquainted with them we might fill our heads with speculations yet this cannot make us the wiser and better men without being learned we may be wise and good   t and are the learned then in no better a condition than the people in respect of moral excellence i said are the speculations of the scholar and the arts and fine inventions of the schools of no use in perfecting the moral character this to me seems a little strange   o blind as the crowd is the man of letters in this particular my instructor replied all his studies and curious knowledge have no relation to his living right with all the tongues and all the arts he may be a libertine a sot a miser or a knave a traitor to his country and have no moral character at all this we see every day   t but what is the cause of so strange a thing i requested to know i observe that these men of letters seem to sit down contented in the second enclosure and do not attempt to go on to the third where wisdom resides though they see continually before their eyes so many passing on from the first court where they had lived for some time in lewdness and excess to the habitation of true learning   o it is their remaining in this second enclosure that occasions their being inferior in moral things to those who have not had a learned education proud and selfsufficient on account of their languages arts and sciences they despise what wisdom could teach them and will not give themselves the trouble of ascending with difficulty to the mansion of true learning they have no taste for the lessons of wisdom while the humble mount to her exalted dwelling those scholars as you see are satisfied with their speculations and vain conceits dull and untractable in the improvement of their hearts and regardless of that exact rectitude of mind and life which is only worth a rationals toiling for as he is an eleve for eternity they never think of true wisdom nor mind her offered light their curious ingenious notions are what they only have a relish for the imaginations of those men of letters cannot reach that ineffable peace and contentment that satisfaction and pleasure which flow from a virtuous life and an honest heart this is the case of our learned heads uless repentance interferes to make them humble and scatters the vain visions they had from false opinion  this concluded the venerable teacher is the explication of this parable or allegory may you often revolve upon these lessons and lend your whole attention to the attainment of true wisdom that you may not embrace her shadow the speculations and inventions of the learned but by this instruction acquire the true principles of morality and goodness this is not all the table of cebes there follows a disputation in the socratic method concerning the claim of wealth and other externals to the title of good things but it is dry and no part of the picture or mythology for this reason i stop here  as to the picture of cebes it is to be sure a fine thing and greatly to the honor of the theban philosopher who was one of the disciples of socrates and about twenty at the time of the death of his master socrates died by the executioner in the  0th year of his age before our lord  0   cebes was about eighty at the birth of epicurus  a remark on the table of cebes but after all that can be said in praise of this excellent remain of antiquity still the little systen of ethics is but a poor performance in respect of any section of the gospel of christ cebes says nothing of the deity nor does he mention the mischiefs of vice and the benefits of virtue as a divine constitution  an apostle on the contrary to mention only one particular out of a thousand from the christian books calls to the human race in the following manner i beseech you brethren by the mercies of almighty god the father of the universe who has graciously admitted you to the faith and revealed the terms of acceptance that ye present your bodies now a living sacrifice holy and acceptable to the deity which is the reasonable and spiritual service required of you in the time of the gospel and not offer the bodies of beasts any more as the heathen world were wont to do  and as persons now wholly devoted to the lord of heaven and earth be not conformed to the fashions and ways of this world but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind that ye may prove what is the good the acceptable and perfect will of god abhor that which is evil in all your dealings cleave to that which is good let love be without dissimulation and be kindly affectioned one to another not advancing yourselves but in honor preferring one another be not slothful in business but fervent in spirit as serving the lord jehovah in your several stations rejoice in hope of a refreshment to come in the realms of bliss be patient in tribulation which god will reward and continue instant in prayer  in sum let us follow the steps of christ and in imitation of his divine humility his devotion his love be for ever meek and forbearing gentle and charitable and live in the spirit of prayer  what is there in the table of cebes like this spiritual and religious virtue this love to god this zeal for his honor and service and an entire dependence upon him in all conditions of life the virtues of the heroes of antiquity are noble and excellent qualities  their courage and justice and temperance and gratitude and love to their country are fine things but they seem to have been calculated for the civil life those heroes were virtuous without being pious and appear rather as selfsufficient independent beings than as servants and votaries of god almighty it is these christian virtues i hove mentioned that adorn and perfect human nature it is these things that mostly contribute to the happiness of the world and of every man in it  n b mr scott at the end of his notes on cebes has the following remark  if this philosopher had represented the effects of virtue and vice as a divine constitution he would have ennobled his instruction and done greater service to the interest of morality but those important interests are effectually provided for by revelation there the precepts of virtue are the laws of god there we find a clear and complete system of his will there our obedience is encouraged by hope in his pardoning mercy and powerful assistance by the life death and resurrection of his own son and by promises and threatenings which extend the reward of righteousness and the punishment of wickedness unto a future state of existence      section xiii look round the habitable world how few know their own good or knowing it pursue how void of reason are our hopes and fears what in the conduct of our life appears so well designed so luckily begun but when we have our wish we wish undone the tenth satire of juvenal dryden omnibus in terris quae sunt a gadibus usque auroram et gangem pauci dignoscere possunt

with reason do we hope or fear what have thou by thy happiest project gained but thou repentst thy pains and wish obtained mr drydens translation is by far the finest to be sure it is a charming thing but whether it comes so near the intended humor and brisk turns of juvenal as a third translation the reader will find at the end of this section may admit of some consideration  i add here the sixteen last lines of drydens version the most beautiful part of the satire that it may be near for comparing with the translation i have mentioned  and for the same reason i likewise place here the same number of lines done by stapylton  yet not to rob the priests of pious gain that altars be not wholly built in vain forgive the gods the rest and stand confined to health of body and content of mind a soul that can securely death defy and count it natures privilege to die serene and manly hardened to sustain the load of life and exercised in pain guiltless of hate and proof against desire that all things weighs and nothing can admire that dares prefer the toils of hercules to dalliance banquets and ignoble ease the path to peace is virtue what i show thyself may freely on thyself bestow fortune was never worshipped by the wise but set aloft by fools usurps the skies dryden yet that for sacrifice thou may prepare thy white hog and for something make thy prayer pray that the gods be graciously inclined to grant thee health of body and of mind ask a strong soul that may deaths terrors scorn and think to die as good as to be born as great a gift of nature that no cross can daunt that knows no passion fears no loss that hercules his labors can digest far better than sardanapaluss feast his wenches or his featherbeds i show what thou thyself may on thyself bestow the path to peace is virtue all the powers will be our own if wisdom be but ours and yet to thee vain fortune we have given the name of goddess and placed thee in heaven stapylton ut tamen et poscas aliquid voveasque sacellis exta et candiduli divina tomacula porci orandum est ut sit mens sana in corpore sano fortem posce animum et mortis terrore carentem qui spatium vitae extremum inter munera ponat naturae qui far queat quoscunque labores et venere et coenis et pluma sardanapali monstro quod ipse tibi possis dare semita certe tranquillae per virtutem patet unica vitae nullum numen habes si sit prudentia sed te nos facimus fortuna deam coeloque locamus juvenal the unfortunate death of julia    having married the illustrious julia as related in my last section and by the death of her father soon after the wedding acquired a handsome settlement a considerable sum of money and a valuable collection of books i thought myself so happily situated in the midst of flourishing mercies and so well secured from adversity that it was hardly possible for the flame of destruction to reach me but when i had not the least reason to imagine calamity was near me and fondly imagined prosperity was my own infelicity came stalking on unseen and from a fullness of peace plunged us at once into an abyss of woe it was our wont when the evenings were fine to take boat at the bottom of a meadow at the end of our garden and in the middle of a deep river pass an hour or two in fishing but at last by some accident or other a slip of the foot or the boats being got a little too far from the bankside julia fell in and was drowned this happened in the tenth month of our marriage the loss of this charming angel in such a manner sat powerfully on my spirits for some time and the remembrance of her perfections and the delights i enjoyed while she lived made me wish i had never seen her to be so vastly happy as i was and be deprived of her in a moment in so shocking a way was an affliction i was hardly able to bear it struck me to the heart i sat with my eyes shut ten days  a reflection on the death of julia    but losses and pains i considered were the portion of mortals in this trying state and from thence we ought to learn to give up our own wills and to get rid of all eager wishes and violent affection that we may take up our rest wholly in that which pleases god carrying our submission to him so far as to bless his correcting hand and kiss that rod that cures our passionate eagerness perverseness and folly  we ought likewise to learn from such things to look upon the sad accidents of life as not worthy to be compared with what christ underwent for our sakes who though he was a son yet he learnt obedience by the things that he suffered and with christian resignation live in a quiet expectance of a future happy state after our patience has had its perfect work considering that these light and momentary afflictions are not worthy to be compared with the glory that christ has purchased for us and if we are faithful to death has promised to bestow upon us  in all these things resigning to the wisdom of god and not merely to his will and authority believing his disposal to be wisest and best and that his declarations and promises are true though we cannot in some cases discern the reason of such an end and such means being connected nor can imagine how some promises can be made good patience i said my soul patience and what thou know not now thou shall know in a little time thus i reasoned as i sat with my eyes shut  thoughts on wives and whores    and when i had done i called to soto o finn my man to bring the horses out immediately and i would go some where or other to see new scenes and if i could get another wife as i was born with the disease of repletion and had made a resolution not to fornicate it was incumbent on me to have a sister and companion with whom i might lawfully carry on the succession as a friend to society and passivelyobedient to the laws of my higher country a wife for ever i declared for if on losing one we can be still so fortunate as to get another who is pretty without pride witty without affectation to virtue only and her friends a friend  whose sense is great and great her skill for reason always guides her will civil to all to all she is just and faithful to her friend and trust whose character in short is such that none can love or praise too much if such a charmer should again appear and ten thousand such there ever are among the sex silly and base though the majority may be what man could say he had had enough of wedlock because he had buried seven such wives i am sure i could not and if like the men who were but striplings at fourscore in the beginning of this world i was to live for ages and by accidents lost such partners as i have described i would with rapture take hundreds of them to my breast one after another and piously propagate the kind the most despicable of all creatures is a whore an abomination to heaven and if god was a mere fanciful fear yet such a wretch the prostitute is that neither honor nor honesty can ever be expected from her but in defiance to divine and human laws she lives a fee to mankind to ruin the fortune pox the body and for ever damn the soul of the miserable man who is dunce enough to become a limberham to the execrable wretch the misfortunes i have known happen to gentlemen of my acquaintance by streetwhores chamberwhores and keptwhores would make a volume as large as this i am writing and leave another world quite out of the history i have seen gentlemen of the best fortunes and education become wornout beggars in the streets of london without any thing hardly to cover them by the means of those execrable harlots some have become bullies to bawdyhouses and many i have beheld going to the gallows by maintaining the falsest and leastengaging of women but take a modest sensible woman to your heart who has the fear of the great god before her eyes and a regard to the laws of her country share your fortune generously with her that she may have her innocent amusements and dress be for ever goodhumoured be true to her bed and every felicity you may taste that it is possible to enjoy in this lower hemisphere let a wife be our choice as we are rationals  the state of ortonlodge on my arrival there    with these notions in my head i mounted my horse and determined in the first place to pay a visit to my two beauties at ortonlodge who were by this time at age and see what opinions they had acquired and if they had any command for me but when i arrived at my romantic spot i found the ladies were gone all places shut up and no soul there the key of the housedoor was left for me and a note fastened to it to inform me how the affair was  sir not having had the favor of hearing from you for almost three years and despairing of that honor and happiness any more we have left your fine solitude to look after our fortunes as we are of age and on enquiry have found that old cock our cruel guardian is dead and gone we are under infinite obligations to you have an extreme sense of your goodness and hope if you are yet in the land of the living that we shall soon be so happy as to get some account of you to the end we may return the weighty balance due from  sir your most obliged and ever humble servants   from the date of this letter it appeared that they were not a month gone before my arrival but to what place they said not and it was in vain for me to enquire i found every thing in good order and all the goods safe the garden full of fruits and vegetables and plenty of various eatables in the house pickled potted and preserved as it was in the month of june the solitude looked vastly charming in it is vales and forest its rocks and waters and for a month i strove to amuse myself there in fishing shooting and improving the ground but it was so dull so sad a scene when i missed the bright companions i had with me in former days who used to wander with me in the valleys up the hills by the streams and make the whole a paradise all the long day that i could not bear it longer than four weeks and rid from thence to dr stanvils seat to ask him how he did and look once more at that fine curiosity miss dunk that was but at the time i am speaking of his wife however before i left my lodge i made a discovery one day as i was exploring the wild country round my little house that was entertaining enough and to this day in remembrance seems to me so agreeable that i imagine a relation of this matter may be grateful to my readers it contains the story of a lady who cannot be enough admired can never be sufficiently praised  the history of the beautiful leonora    as i rambled one summers morning with my gun and my dog over the vast mountains which surrounded me at ortonlodge i came as the sun was rising to a valley about four miles from my house which i had not seen before as the way to it over the fells was a dangerous road it was green and flowery had clumps of oaks in several spots and from the hovering top of a precipice at the end of the glin a river falls ingulphed in rifted rocks it is a fine rural scene  here i sat down to rest myself and was admiring the natural beauties of the place when i saw three females turn into the vale and walk toward the waterfall one of them who appeared to be the mistress had an extravagance of beauty in her face and a form such as i had not often seen the others were pretty women dressed like quakers and very clean they came very near the water where i was but did not see me as i was behind two rocks which almost joined and after they had looked a while at the headlong river they went back and entering a narrowway between two hills disappeared i was greatly surprised at what i had seen not imagining i had such a neighbor in richmondshire and resolved to know who this beauty was the wonders of her face her figure and her mien were striking to the last degree  arising then as soon as they were out of sight i walked on to the turning i saw them enter and in half an hours time came to a plain through which several brooks wandered and on the margin of one of them was a grove and a mansion it was a sweet habitation at the entrance of the little wood and before the door on banks of flowers sat the illustrious owner of this retreat and her two maids in such a place in such a manner so unexpectedly to find so charming a woman seemed to me as pleasing an incident as could be met with in traveling over the world  at my coming near this lady she appeared to be astonished and to wonder much at seeing such an inhabitant in that part of the world but on pulling off my hat and telling her i came to visit her as her neighbor to pay my humble respects to her and beg the honor of her acquaintance she asked me from what vale or mountain i came and how long i had been a resident in that wild part of the world this produced a compend of some part of my story and when i had done she desired me to walk in coffee and hot rolls was soon brought and we breakfasted cheerfully together i took my leave soon after having made her a present of some black cocks and a hare i had shot that morning and hoped if it was possible to find an easy way to my lodge which i did not yet know that i should some time or other be honored with her presence at my little house which was worth her seeing as it was situated in the most delightful part of this romantic silent place and had many curiosities near it that in the mean time if it was agreeable i would wait upon her again before i left richmondshire which would be soon for i only came to see how things were and was obliged to hasten another way this beauty replied that it would give her pleasure to see me when i had a few hours to spare three times more then i went very soon we became well acquainted and after dinner one day she gave me the following relation  my name was leonora sarsfield before i married an irishman one burk whom i met at avignon in france he is one of the handsomest men of the age though his hopes were all his fortune but proved a villain as great as ever disgraced mankind his breeding and his eloquence added to his fine figure induced me to fancy him an angel of a man and imagine i had well bestowed a hundred thousand pounds to make him great and as happy as the day is long for three months he played the god and i fondly thought there was not such another happy woman as myself in all the world i was mistaken burk found out by some means or other that i had concealed five thousand pounds of my fortune from his knowledge and that i was in my heart so good a protestant that it was impossible to bring me over to popery or ever get me to be an idolater at the mass before the tiny god of dough  that i could never be brought to look upon the invented superstitions and horrible corruptions of the church of rome as the true religion nor be ever persuaded to assist at the latin service in that communion as it must be an abomination to christ and to god if the gospel may be depended upon as the rule of faith  when burk perceived these things he threw off the disguise and appeared a monster instead of a man as he was a bigot of the first order a furious papist which i did not know when we married and as he was by nature as cruel as he was avaricious by principle he began to use me in the vilest manner and by words and deeds did all he could to make my life a burden to me he was for ever abusing me in the vilest language cursing me for a heretic for ever damned and by blows compelling me to inform him where my money was he has left me all over blood very often and when he found i still held out and would not discover to him what remained of my fortune nor which i valued much more than my money violate my religion by renouncing the customs and practice of the reformed church and joining in the sinful worship of the mass he came to me one night with a small oak sapling and beat me in such a manner as left me almost dead he then went out of the house told me he would return by twelve and make me comply or he would break every bone in my body this happened at a countryseat of mine in this shire all the servants being obliged to lie every night in an outhouse that he might have the more power over me his excessive avarice was but one cause of this inhuman behavior it was the zeal of this raging bigot for his evercursed popery that made him act the unrelenting inquisitor  a reflection on popery i asked you sir before i began my story if you were a catholic and as you assured me you were the very reverse i may indulge myself a little in expressing my resentments against that religion of satan which the popish doctors drew out of the bottomless pit it is a religion formed in hell by devils and from them brought by those archpoliticians the masspriests to make the world their slaves or rack the human race to death by torments that would perhaps melt even devils o bloody and infernal scheme of worship surely there is some chosen curse some hidden thunder in the stores of heaven red with uncommon wrath to blast the men who owe their greatness to their apostasy from the religion of christ jesus and to the woes and pains they lay on mankind by the religion of modern rome you see in me a wife almost tortured to extinction by a holy roman catholic husband nor am i the only married protestant woman who has felt the stripes and bruises of a merciless popish companion thousands to be sure have suffered as well as i upon the same account though none in so miserable a manner even fathers have lost all bowels for their children and become the most violent persecutors when the blessed religion of popery has been in dispute children for it is sake have destroyed their parents and the world has been turned into a field of blood to feed and support those dreadful slaughterers the masspriests and gratify the blind and impious religious fancies of their welltaught religionists commonly called catholics what i have suffered gives me a true sense of popery it has made me consider its errors and iniquities with double attention i tremble at the thoughts of its prevailing in this land an address to the protestant ladies of great britain what a thing ladies is popery whether we consider it in a religious view or regard it as a political contrivance to gratify the avarice and ambition of the clergy it appears the just object of our contempt as well as of our abhorrence it does not only make its priests the slaughterers of mankind witness the inquisition the moriscos thorn the moriscos were expelled spain a d       the inquisition was erected four years after  and the doings at thorn by which the quantity of blood formerly spilt on the ground by evercursed popery was increased in the year       england ireland france the low countries hungary and other theaters of barbarity the most shocking and inhuman but it causes even husbands to become mere devils to wives who are angels of women in mind and body and can only be charged with their being protestants so burk the papist behaved to one of the finest and most excellent women i have seen nor was this lady the only unhappy one i have known made so by popish husbands i have seen a thousand protestant wives the most amiable and worthy women as wretched as cruelty could make them by their husbands zeal for the masspriests religion a religion fit only for hell and that ought to make every protestant female tremble at the idea of a catholic husband he may be as kind and good to a romish wife as it is possible for man to be to a woman but if he marries a protestant he must be a satan to her by virtue of his religion never hearken then o ye protestant ladies to a popish suitor however rich or outwardly agreeable he may be think of the principles and spirit of that church whose unsuccessful attempts on our religion and liberties have given occasion for the solemnity of the  th of november and that of the   d of october blood and cruelty are her constitution and by those principles and practices with regard to civil society as well as by her doctrines she promotes infidelity and strives to render the word of god of none effect she destroys the credibility of the gospel  could that religion come down from heaven which claims a right not only to persecute single persons but to devote whole nations to destruction by the blackest treachery and most inhuman massacres  and which teaches such absurdities as transubstantiation masses purgatory penances indulgences and attrition  absurdities that dissipate the poor romans of those guilty fears which natural conscience might otherwise keep alive in men such things without mentioning the adoration of the cross and other images and the increasing multitude of imaginary mediators entirely destroy the credibility of any system with which they are connected god cannot be the author of a scheme which weakens and corrupts the law of nature  no popery then for you       but as to my tragical relation continued leonora  being thus left by burk in this sad situation bleeding and miserable with pains but still in dread of worse usage on his return i crawled down stairs to a small door in a back place which opened to a private way out of the house this was known only to myself as it was a passage my father had made in case of thieves or any villains from a little unfrequented cellar by a narrow ascending arch to a thicket in the corner of a shrubby field at a small distance from the house to a labyrinth made in this small grove i made what haste i could and had not been long there before i perceived through the trees my inhuman husband and as he came near me heard him say she shall tell me where my money is for all she has is mine and worship our lady and the host or i will burn her flesh off her bones and make her feel as many torments here as the heretics are tortured with in everlasting pain the sight of the monster made me tremble to so violent a degree that i was scarcely able to proceed to the cottage of a poor woman my sure friend about two miles from the place i was hid in but i did my best to creep through cross ways and after many difficulties and suffering much by going over ditches i got to my resting place the old woman my nurse screeched at the sight of me as i was sadly torn and all over gore such a spectacle to be sure has seldom been seen but by peace and proper things i got well again in two months and removed to this lone house which my father had built in this spot for his occasional retirement here i have been for two years past and am as happy as i desire to be nay vastly so as i am now free and delivered from a monster whose avarice and cruelty made me a spectacle to angels and men because sir i would not reduce myself to the state of a beggar to satisfy his insatiable love of money nor worship his deadwoman and bit of bread his rabble of saints images relics and that sovereign cheat the pope because i would not give up all i had and become an idolater as far more despicable and sinful than the ancient pagans as the romish ritual and devotions are more stupid and abominable than the heathen religion for disobedience in these respects pains and penalties without ceasing were my appointment and i was for some months as miserable as the damned  such sir was my fatal marriage which i thought would be a stock of such felicities that time only by many years could reduce to an evanescent state and deprive me of as venus was at the bridal with her whole retinue the ardent amorous boy the sistergraces in their loose attire aglavia thalia and euphrosine bright blooming and gay and was attended by youth that wayward thing without her was conducted by mercury the god of eloquence and by pitho the goddess of persuasion as all seemed pleasurable and enchanting my young imagination formed golden scenes and painted a happiness quite glorious and secure but how precarious and perishing is what we mortals call felicity love and his mother disappeared very soon as i have related and to them succeeded impetuous passion intense raging terrible with all the furies in the train the masked hero i had married was a phalaris a miser a papist a wretch who had no taste for love no conception of virtue no sense of charms but to gold and popery would sacrifice every thing that is fair and laudable le diable a quatre he shined in as a player and was the devil himself in flesh and blood where is the rest of your with uplifted arm was the thundering cry in my ears you shall be a catholic damn you or i will pinch off the flesh from your bones  a remark on this lady here the beautiful leonora had done and i wondered very greatly at her relation nor was her action in speaking it and the spirit with which she talked less surprising with admiration i beheld her and was not a little pleased that i had found in my neighborhood so extraordinary a person and so very fine an original this lady had some reason to abhor the word catholic and might well be angry with popery though she carried her resentment a little too far but had the reader seen her attitude her energies and the faces she made when she mentioned the corruptions of popery or the word husband sure i am it would be thought much more striking than garrick in richard or shuter in his exhibition of old philpot i was greatly delighted with her and as she was very agreeble in every thing i generally went every second day to visit her while i continued in richmondshire but this was not long i journeyed from thence to pay my respects to dr stanvil and his lady whom i have mentioned before and what happened there i shall relate in the next section only stop a few minutes my good reader to peruse the translation of the tenth satire of juvena  which is placed here by way of entertainment as i said in another place and to make good my assertion that we know not what we would be at in our fancies and our fears  the tenth satire of

the happy rule to live chance bears no sway where wisdom rules an empty name adored by fools folly blind fortune did create a goddess and to heaven translate as i had not room for all the xth satire what is seen here is rather an abridgement than an entire version but the whole sense of the author is preserved though several of his examples and illustrations are left out  and so excellent a thing dr burnet bishop of salisbury thought this satire that in his famous pastoral letter he recommmends it and the satires of persius to the perusal and practice of the divines in his diocese as the best common places for their sermons and what may be taught with more profit to the audience than all the new speculations of divinity and controversies concerning faith which are more for the profit of the shepherd than for the edification of the flock in the satires nothing is proposed but the quiet and tranquillity of the mind virtue is lodged at home as mr dryden expresses it in his fine dedication to the earl of dorset and diffused to the improvement and good of human kind passion interest ambition mystery fury and every cruel consequence are banished from the doctrine of these stoics and only the moral virtues inculcated for the perfection of mankind  but so unreasonable and infatuated are our shepherds too many of them i mean that a rational christian cannot go to church without being shocked at the absurd and impious work of their pulpits in town and country almost every sunday those bright theologers are for ever on the glories of trinity in unity and teaching their poor people that god almighty came down from heaven to take flesh upon him and make infinite satisfaction to himself this is the cream of christianity in the account of those teachers the moral virtues are nothing compared to a man or a womans swallowing the divine mystery of an incarnate god almighty over and over have i heard a thousand of them on this holy topic sweating and drivelling at each corner of their mouths with eagerness to convert the world to their mysteries  the adorable mystery says one little priest in my neighborhood in westminster  the more incomprehensible and absurd it appears to human reason the greater honor you do to heaven in believing it says another wise man in the country but tell me ye excellent divines tell me in print if you please if it would not be doing more honor to the law of heaven to inform the people that the true christian profession is to pray to god our father for grace mercy and peace through the lord jesus christ without ever mentioning the athanasian scheme or trinity in unity which you know no more of than so many pigs do because it is a mere invention and not to be found in the bible and in the next place to tell your flocks in serious and practical address that their main business is as the disciples of the holy jesus a good life  to strive against sin continually and be virtuous and useful to the utmost of our power  to imitate the purity and goodness of their great master the author of eternal salvation to all them that obey him and by repentance and holiness of heart in a patient continuance in welldoing make it the labor of their every day to live soberly righteously and godly in this present world you must become partakers of a divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and by acquiring the true principles of christian perfection render yourselves fit for the heavenly bliss this my dearly beloved brethren is the great design of christ and his gospel you must receive jesus christ as your savior and mediator  you must be exercised unto godliness and have the ways of god in your hearts by a course of obedience and patience you must follow the captain of our salvation to his glory  to this purpose i say our clergy ought to preach and if in so saying they think me wrong i call upon them to tell me so in print by argument that i may either publicly acknowledge a mistaken judgment  or prove that too many ministers mislead christian people in the article of faith and practice by the strict rules of christian simplicity and integrity i shall ever act    section xiv bear me ye friendly powers to gentler scenes to shady bowers and neverfading greens to flowery meads the vales and mazy woods some sweet soft seat adorned with springs and floods where with the muses i may spend my days and steal myself from life by slow decays with age unknown to pain or sorrow blessed to the dark grave retiring as to rest while gently with one sigh this mortal frame dissolving turns to ashes whence it came and my freed soul departs without a groan in transport wings her flight to worlds unknown  the author goes to visit dr stanvil and his lady aet    july           from ortonlodge i went to bassora to pay my respects to dr stanvil and his charming consort i was received by them both with the greatest goodness and civility but as before this lady did not seem to have had any former acquaintance one might well think from the part she acted that she had never seen me till the accident i have related brought me to her husbands house i did not however even hint any thing to the contrary but turning to the doctor a little after my arrival began to ask him some questions  a question proposed to dr stanvil how the spanish fly acts in blisterstupors    as he had an essay on fevers in his hand when i entered the room i requested to know how he accounted for the effects of cantharides in raising and strengthening a low trembling pulse and driving the natural heat and efflatus of the blood outward  in giving relief in delirious ravings stupors and loss of reason  in reducing continual fevers to distinct remissions  and in cleansing and opening the obstructed glands and lymphatics so as to bring on the critical sweats let loose the saliva and glandular secretions and bring down the thick soluble urine how does blistering so happily brought in by the physical bully of this age dr radcliff so wonderfully cool and dilute the blood it seems to me somewhat strange  the doctors opinion how the cantharides act on the body in blisters    dr stanvil replied it is easily accounted for the spanish fly that extremely hot and perfectly caustic insect is stocked with a subtle active and extremely pungent salt which enters the blood upon the application of the blister and passes with it through the several glandular strainers and secretory ducts this stimulating force of the flys salt occasions the pain felt in making the water with a blister which may be taken off by a thin emulsion made with the pulp of roasted apples in milk and water and causes the liberal foul and stinking sweats while the epispastic is on  this being evident it is plain from thence that the penetrating salts of the fly that is the volatile pungent parts of the cantharides act in the blood by dissolving attenuating and ratifying the viscid cohesions of the lymph and serum by stimulating the nervous coats of the vessels throw off their stagnating viscidities and by cleansing the glands and forcing out the coagulated serum restore the circulation and freedom of lymph from the arteries to the veins opening scouring and cleansing at the same time the expurgatory glands  the wisdom and goodness of god in the production of the spanish fly for the benefit of man in short as common cathartics purge the guts and cleanse and throw off their clammy stagnating and obstructing contents by rarifying and dissolving the viscid cohesions of the fluids and by stimulating the solids so do the active salts of the fly penetrate the whole animal machine become a glandular lymphatic purge and perform the same thing in all the small straining conveying pipes that common purgatives effect in the intestines and as by this means all the sluices and outlets of the glandular secretions are opened the cantharides must be cooling diluting and refrigerating in their effects to the greatest degree though so very hot caustic and pungent in themselves so wonderfully has the great creator provided for his creature man in giving him not only a variety of the most pleating food but so fine a medicine among a thousand others as the spanish fly to save him from the destroying fever and restore him to health again it is not by a discharge of serum as too many doctors imagine that a blister relieves for five times the quantity may be brought off by bleeding vomiting or purging but the benefit is entirely owing to that heating attenuating and pungent salt of this fly and this fly only which the divine power and goodness has made a lymphatic purgative or glandular cathartic for the relief of man in this fatal and tormenting malady vast is our obligation to god for all his providential blessings great are the wonders that he does for the children of men  dr stanvils sudden death and the cause of it    here the doctor dropped off his chair just as he had pronounced the word men and in a moment became a lifeless sordid body his death was occasioned by the blowing up of his stomach as i found upon opening his body at the request of his lady  when the blood which is confined within the vessels of the human body is agitated with a due motion it maintains life but if there be a stagnation of it in an artery it makes an aneurism in a vein a varix under the skin a bruise in the nose it may excite an haemorrhage in the vessels of the brain an apoplexy in the lungs an haemoptoe in the cavity of the thorax an empyema and when it perfectly stagnates there immediate death  an animal observe me reader must live so long as this fluid circulates through the conical pipes in his body from the lesser base in the center the heart to the greater in the extreme parts and from the capillary evanescent arteries by the nascent returning veins to the heart again but when this fluid ceases to flow through the incurved canals and the velocities are no longer in the inverse duplicate ratio of the inflated pipes then it dies the animal has done for ever with food and sex the two great principles which move this world and produce not only so much honest industry but so many wars and fightings such cruel oppressions and that variety of woes we read of in the tragical history of the world even one of them does wonders cunnus teterrim belli causa and when united the force is irresistible  but as i was saying when this fluid ceases to flow the man has done with lust and hunger the pope the warrior and the maid are still the machine is at absolute rest that is in perfect insensibility and the soul of it is removed to the vestibulum or porch of the highest holy place in and burnet of the charter house as needful to our contact with the material system  as it must exist with a spiritual body to be sure says the rev mr caleb fleming in his survey of the search after souls because of its being present with its savior beholding his glory who is in human form and figure which requires some similitude in the vehicle in order to the more easy and familiar society and enjoyment or as the learned master of peterhouse dr edmund law and dr sherlock bishop of london informs us it remains insensible for ages till the consummation of all things  from the dissolution of the body is stupid senseless and dead asleep till the resurrection  such was the case of my friend dr stanvil he dropped down dead at once a rarefaction in his stomach by the heat and fermentation of what he had taken the night before at supper destroyed him that concave viscus or bowel which is seated in the abdomen below the diaphragm i mean the stomach was inflamed and as the descending trunk of the aorta passes down between it and the spine that is between the stomach and back part of the ribs the inflation and distention of the bowel compressed and constringed the transverse section of the artery aorta in its descending branch and by lessening it impeded the descent of the blood from the heart and obliged it to ascend in a greater quantity than usual to the head by this means the parts of the head were distended and stretched with blood which brought on an apoplexy and the operation upward being violent the equilibrium was entirely broken and the vital tide could flow no more this i found on opening the body i likewise observed that exclusive of the compressure of the descending trunk of the artery aorta the muscular coats of the stomach were stretched inflated and distended and of consequence the blood vessels which enter into the constitution of those muscles were stretched dilated and turgid with blood and therefore the blood could not be driven forward in the course of its circulation with its natural and due velocity but must prove an obstacle to the descent of the blood from the heart and oblige almost the whole tide to move upwards this and the constringing the aorta at its orifice or transverse section between the costae and the bowel called the stomach is enough i assure you reader to knock up the head of a giant and put a stop to all the operations of nature thus fell this gentleman in the   d year of his age  the character of dr stanvil    whether the learned dr edmund law n b dr law is still master of peterhouse cambridge and not only one of the most learned men of the age but as fine a gentleman and as good a man as lives his merits i am sure as a scholar and a christian entitled him to the mastership of st johns on the death of dr newcomb though he lost it as often the best men do in respect of things temporal but notwithstanding all the fine learning of dr law i think he is mistaken in many of his notions and especially in his notes on archbishop kings book of evil as i intend to show in my notes aforementioned his tritheism likewise requires a few animadversions which i shall humbly offer with plainness fairness and freedom    and the great dr sherlock bishop of london n b dr sherlock bishop of london died at fulham after a long and lingering illness saturday july         three months after the great and excellent bishop hoadley who departed this life at chelsea april  0      sherlock and hoadley never agreed and which of them was right i attempt to show in my notes on men and things and books which will be published as soon as possible why i think hoadleys sermons far preferable to sherlocks vastly beautiful though some things are in the discourses of the latter and that my lord of winchesters plain account of the supper is a most rational and fine performance as gold to earth in respect of all that has been written against this book  why i say all hoadleys tracts are matchless and invulnerable and that he was victor in the bangorian controversy the reader will find in many considerations on these subjects in the book called notes etc aforementioned    be right in asserting the human soul sleeps like a bat or a swallow in some cavern for a period till the last trumpet awakens the hero of voltaire and henault i mean lewis xiv to answer for his treachery falsehood and cruelty or whether that excellent divine mr fleming has declared the truth in maintaining in his late survey that the conscious scheme was the doctrine of christ and his apostles this however is certain that my friend stanvil is either now present with his savior beholding his glory in a vehicle resembling the body of our lord as the dissenter just mentioned teaches  or if according to the author of the considerations on the state of the world archdeacon law and my lord of london in his sermons the scriptures take no account of an intermediate state in death and we shall not awake or be made alive until the day of judgment then will my friend have eternal life at the resurrection he was as worthy a man as ever lived an upright christian deist whose life was one unmixed scene of virtue and charity he did not believe a tittle of our priestly mysteries or regard that religion which skulks behind the enormous columns of consecrated opinions but as christianity was revealed from heaven to bring mankind to the worship of the one supreme god and governor of the world and lead them into the paths of humanity he rejected the superstition of monks and their disciples and in regard to the voice of reason and the words of the gospel adored only the supreme being manifested his love of god by keeping the commandments and his love of his neighbor by doing all the good in his power such a man was dr john stanvil if men of fortune would form their manners on such a model virtue by degrees would spread through the inferior world and we should soon be free from superstition     having mentioned the sleeping and the conscious schemes i would here examine these opinions and show why i cannot think a dead inconscious silence is to be our case till the consummation of the ages as a happiness so remote would weaken i believe the energy and influence of our conceptions and apprehensions in respect of faith hope and expectations to curb desire or suffer severely here for the sake of truth and virtue and then cease to be perhaps for ten thousand years to come or much longer for there is not any thing in revelation or an appearance out of it that can incline a rational man to think he is near the day of judgment or general resurrection this seems to be an obstacle in the progress of the pilgrim and therefore why i rather think we step immediately from the dark experiences of this first state to a blissful consciousness in the regions of day and by death are fixed in an eternal connection with the wise the virtuous and the holy  this i say i would in the next place proceed to treat of by considering what the scriptures reveal in relation to death and what is most probable in reason but that it is necessary to proceed in my story  mrs stanvils behavior on the death of her husband    when the beautiful mrs stanvil saw her husband was really dead and had paid that decent tribute of tears to his memory which was due to a man who left her in his will all his estates real and personal to be by her disposed of as she pleased she sent for me to her chamber the next morning and after a long conversation with her told me she could now own who she was and instead of acting any longer by the directions of her head let me know from her heart that she had still the same regard for me as when we traveled away together from her fathers house in the west to the north of england and if i would stay at bassora where i was but for three months she must be away she would then return and her fortune and hand i might command this i readily consented to and when the funeral was over she departed for the time agreed on i continued in the house and to a day she was punctual in her return we were married the week after and i was even happier than i had ever been before which must amount to a felicity inconceivably great indeed six months we resided at her seat and then thought it best to pay a visit to my father in ireland we arrived at bagatrogh castle in the western extremity of that island in the spring of the year      and were most kindly received  my father longed to see me and was very greatly rejoiced at my coming but i found him in a dying way paralytic all over and scarcely able to speak to my amazement he was become as strict a unitarian as myself and talked with abhorrence of athanasian religion this was owing he said to my ms remarks i left with him on lord nottinghams answer to mr whistons letter to his lordship which ms of mine he had often read over when i was gone and thereby was thoroughly convinced on considering my reasoning that christians are expressly commanded upon pain of gods displeasure to worship one supreme god and him only in the name and through the mediation of jesus christ upon this religious practice as a fundamental rule he had at last fixed he saw it was the safe way and would never depart from it he told me the parson of his parish a right orthodox divine who had been his chum in the university and very intimate with him was greatly troubled at this change in his sentiments and said many severe things but he no more minded the athanasians now than he did the idolatrous papists this gave me great pleasure and recompensed me for what i had suffered on a religious account i gave thanks to god that truth through my means had prevailed the reader will find these remarks of mine on lord nottinghams letter to mr whiston in my notes relating to men things and books which will be published as soon as possible   the conclusion and now my candid reader to take my leave of you at this time i have only to observe that as this volume is full large i cannot add my intended xvth section but only say in a short summary that soon after my arrival at bagatrogh castle my fathers seat on mallbay on the coast of galway in ireland the old gentleman died and as in a passion he had irrevocably settled the greatest part of his large estate on a near relation of mine and had it not in his power to leave me more than a hundred a year a little ready money and a small ship which lay before his door in the bay he descended to the grave in great trouble with many tears like old isaac over esau he wept bitterly and wished in vain that it was in his power to undo what he had done  as soon as my father was buried i returned to england with my wife in the little vessel now my own which lay in the bay and immediately after landing and laying up my ship in a safe place we went to bassora again there lived for one year as happy as two mortals could be but in the beginning of the year      she died of the small pox and to divert my mind it came into my head to go to sea and make some voyages in my own little ship which was an excellent one for strength and sailing though but a sloop of twentyfive tons i went captain myself and had an ingenious young gentleman one jackman for my mate who had been in the east indies several times six good hands and two cabbinboys every thing necessary convenient and fit books mathematical instruments etc we took on board and weighed anchor the  th of july       we went on shore at the canary islands the cape de verd islands and other places we passed the sun in    degrees north latitude and from that time standing south crossed the line the heats intolerable and the musquitoes and bugs insufferable we soon lost sight of the northern star and had the crosiers and magellan clouds in view in three months time we anchored at st catharines on the coast of brazil the  d of december we saw the streights la maine that run betwixt terra del fuego and staten and is the boundary between the atlantic and pacific oceans but instead of venturing into them and hazarding our lives among the impetuous blasts and waves which sweep round cape horn as admiral anson did the  th of march      two months too late by the fault of the ministry in his way to the south seas we kept out at sea to the east of statenland and ran to the latitude    before we stood to the westward the weather was fine as it was then the height of summer to wit in december and january all the occurrences in this course the discovery we made in the latitude abovementioned of an inhabited island governed by a young queen and what appeared and happened there and in our run from thence to borneo and asia round the globe and from china to europe on our return home with the events we afterward met with and the observations i made in other places the reader will find in a book called the voyages and travels of dr lorimer  nine years of my life was spent in traveling and sailing about and at last i returned to rest and reflect and in rational amusements pass the remainder of my time away i retired to a little flowery retreat i had purchased within a few miles of london that i might easily know what was doing in this hemisphere while i belong to it and in the midst of groves and streams fields and lawns have lived as happily ever since as a mortal can do on this planet  dr cheyne by the way i observe calls it a ruined planet in his wild posthumous book it is a question with some if this book was not written by the doctors visionary daughter or by her and the rev athanasian bigot her brother but as i knew the doctor after he was a little cracked with imaginary religion and have heard him talk as in this book i am positive it is his   a notion he had from his master enthusiastic law n b the rev nonjuror mr william law the father of our methodists and the disciple of jacob behmen the theosopher died at kings cliff near nottingham april         seven days before bishop hoadley against whom he was a bitter writer in the bangorian controversy  i knew this famous visionary very well and shall remark largely on his writings in my notes relating to men and things and books  law was the most amazing compound i have ever seen he was a man of sense a fine writer and a fine gentleman and yet the wildest enthusiast that ever appeared among men his temper was charming sweet and delightful and his manners quite primitive and uncommonly pious he was all charity and goodness and so soft and gentle in conversation that i have thought myself in company with one of the men of the first church at jerusalem while with him he had likewise the justest notions of christian temper and practice and recommended them in so insinuating a manner that even a rake would hear him with pleasure i have not seen any like him among the sons of men in these particulars it was wrong to put him in the dunciad and call him one law as pope does he was really a very extraordinary man and to his honor be it remembered that he had the great concern of human life at heart took a deal of pains in the pulpit and from the press witness his two fine books on a devout life to make men fear god and keep his commandments he was a good man indeed  but what strange books did he write his appeal to the deists  his spirit of prayer and love  his earnest and serious answer to trapp  his notes and illustrations on behmen  his replies to hoadley and what is stranger still his abuse of bishop hoadley in his appeal i have mentioned  here had i room i would relate a very curious conversation that passed between dr theophilus bolton archbishop of cashell in ireland a most excellent most sensible and most learned man and me at the third nights sale of archbishop kings library in dublin in relation to mr law it happened on his lordships buying jacob behmens works for a pound and then asking me who stood by him if i had read them and could enable him to understand them but this i must place in my notes aforementioned   but from what i have seen on three continents and in traversing the ocean round the globe from west to east and from the southern latitude    to    north a planet in reality so divinely made and perfect that one can never sufficiently adore and praise an infinitely wise god for such a piece of his handy work  a world so wisely contrived so accurately made as to demonstrate the creators being and attributes and cause every rational mortal to acknowledge that jehovah is our god and fear and obey so great and tremendous a being  the power and glory of our god  but as i was saying after my return i bought a little spot and country house where i might rest from my labors and easily know what is doing in this hemisphere  how gloriously our most gracious and excellent king endeavors to advance the felicity of his people and promote the honor and dignity of great britain  how indefatigable the present ministry is in pursuing such measures as demonstrate they have the interest of their country at heart as evince how well they supply the deficiencies of their predecessors in office  and how zealously the combined wisdom of the whole legislature acts for the preservation of the britannic constitution and the liberties and properties of the people that the ends of the late war may be answered and the peace at last give universal satisfaction  to hear such news and know what france and spain are doing  and what the renowned antisejanus is writing  antisejanus who deserves the curse and hatred of the whole community as an abetter of arbitrary power and for attempting to raise the prerogative  i purchased a retirement near the capital a spot surrounded with woods and streams plants and flowers and over which a silence hovers that gives a relish to still life and renders it a contrast to the busy bustling envious crowds of men  here i sat down at last and have done with hopes and fears for ever  here grant me heaven to end my peaceful days and pass what is left of life in studious ease here court the muses whilst the sun on high flames in the vault of heaven and fires the sky soon as aurora from her golden bowers exhales the fragrance of the balmy flowers reclined in silence on a mossy bed consult the learned volumes of the dead fallen realms and empires in description view live over past times and build whole worlds anew often from the bursting tombs in fancy raise the sons of fame who lived in ancient days often listen till the raptured soul takes wings while plato reasons or while homer sings or when the nights dark wings this globe surround and the pale moon begins her solemn round when night has drawn her curtains over the plain and silence reassumes her awful reign bid my free soul to starry orbs repair those radiant orbs that float in ambient air and with a regular confusion stray oblique direct along the aerial way fountains of day stupendous orbs of light which by their distance lessen to the sight and if the glass you use timprove your eyes millions beyond the former millions rise for no end were they made or but to blaze through empty space and useless spend their rays or ought we not with reason to reply each lucid point which glows in yonder sky informs a system in the boundless space and fills with glory its appointed place with beams unborrowd brightens other skies and worlds to thee unknown with heat and life supplies but chiefly o my soul apply to loftier themes the opening heavens and angels robbed with flames read in the sacred leaves how time began and the dust moved and quickened into man here through the flowery walks of eden rove court the soft breeze or range the spicy grove there tread on hallowed ground where angels trod and reverend patriarchs talked as friends with god or hear the voice to slumbering prophets given or gaze on visions from the throne of heaven thus lonely thoughtful may i run the race of transient life in no unuseful ease enjoy each hour nor as it fleets away think life too short and yet too long the day of right observant while my soul attends each duty and makes heaven and angels friends can welcome death with faiths expecting eye and mind no pangs since hope stands smiling by nor studious how to make a longer stay views heavenly plains and realms of brighter day shakes off her load and winged with ardent love spurns at the earth and springs her flight above soaring through air to realms where angels dwell pities the shrieking friends and leaves the lessning bell the end
