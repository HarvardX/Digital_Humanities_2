elements of the practice of physic  part the first  containing the natural history of the human body  by george fordyce md  of the royal college of physicians and reader on the practice of physic in london  london printed for johnson and pain at no   in paternoster row  m dcc lxx  price one shilling and sixpence  this essay on the art of healing in testimony of the authors gratitude is with the greatest respect inscribed to his grace hugh duke of northumberland a lover and a promoter of useful arts by his graces most obedient servant george fordyce  the natural history of the human body a disease is such an alteration of the chemical properties of the fluids or solids or of their organization or of the action of the moving power as produces an inability or difficulty of performing the functions of the whole or any part of the system or pain or a preternatural evacuation  the chemical properties of the fluids the fluids may be divided into  st the blood  dly those formed during digestion before the food is converted into blood  dly the secreted fluids   the blood consists of  st the serum  dly the coagulable lymph  dly the red part  thly the superfluous water  thly extraneous substances introduced   the serum coagulable lymph and superfluous water are diffused through one another and the red part is mechanically mixed with them some of the extraneous substances are also mechanically mixed with them and some diffused through them  properties of the serum it is fluid in any degree of heat between  0 and   0 of fahrenheits thermometer  in a lesser heat it freezes in a greater it coagulates  coagulation is a separation of an animal or vegetable matter from the water in which it was dissolved and is at the same time a change of the properties of that matter rendering it insoluble in water again by commixture alone  the serum consists chemically of a coagulable matter and water in which common sal ammoniac and phosphoric ammoniac and generally common salt and frequently selenites and fixed ammoniac are dissolved but it is a question whether the water chemically combined in the serum is also united with those neutral salts or whether the serum and the solution of these are only diffused through one another  it is probably in itself colorless and inodorous but it receives a yellowish or brownish hue from the putrescent part of the blood and acquires a smell from the essential oil  if it contained no neutral salts it would be insipid and incapable of stimulating  the superfluous water may be separated from it by filtration in the body but that which is chemically combined with the other parts cannot  all the water may be evaporated from it by a lesser heat than   0 degrees of fahrenheits thermometer if it be exposed to the air the other parts remain after this operation solid and soluble again in water by commixture alone  the separation or addition of superfluous water does not affect its viscidity so far as that is of any consequence in the circulation but the separation of that water which is in chemical combination may render it more viscid  the water in chemical combination is never separated while the serum is contained in the blood vessels and of consequence this part of the blood is always equally viscid so far as its viscidity can affect the circulation or secretions  it may be coagulated by acids oils alcohol etc but no substance can get into the blood vessels in a sufficient degree of concentration to coagulate it excepting by injection  it may be coagulated by a juice secreted in the stomach  it has seldom if ever been found coagulated in the body  the only perceptible difference which has appeared in the coagulable part of the serum from any observation hitherto made public is that sometimes in coagulating its parts adhere more or less firmly and that sometimes it is of a deeper or lighter brown color  properties of the coagulable lymph it is a compound of water and a coagulable matter  as long as it continues in the course of circulation it is fluid in any degree of heat between  0 and   0 degrees of fahrenheits thermometer  when it is taken out of the blood vessels it coagulates whether it be in motion or at rest exposed to the air or not or in the heat of the human body or in any other degree of heat  if it be retained in a bloodvessel it continues fluid for more than three hours in any degree of heat between  0 and   0 of fahrenheits thermometer and that whether it be in motion or at rest the smaller the bloodvessel the longer it continues fluid  it has hardly ever been found coagulated in the blood vessels of a living animal unless they have been enlarged into aneurisms or varices  it has generally been found coagulated in the large vessels of the human body on dissection and sometimes separated from the other parts but to all appearance these coagulations have almost always taken place after death  when it is taken out of the blood vessels it may be prevented from coagulating by saturating the whole blood with common sea salt and perhaps by some of the other neutral salts  although the coagulable part of the serum and coagulable lymph have different properties the coagulum formed from both is pretty nearly the same  the coagulum may be dissolved in water by boiling or putrefaction and may be united with concentrated acids with caustic alkalis and calcarious earth and with some metallic salts into a substance soluble in water but none of these can get into the system by absorption so as to produce this effect  both the superfluous water and serum are capable of being separated from the coagulable lymph by filtration in the body  when the blood is received into a proper vessel the coagulation of this part gives an appearance of solidity to the whole but soon after the whole becomes thus apparently solid part of the serum of the superfluous water and of the water which was combined with the coagulable lymph ouzes out from the whole mass and brings along with it part of any extraneous fluid that may be contained in the blood vessels leaving behind what is commonly called the red globules the coagulum of the coagulable lymph and any solid particles that may have been in the blood this is called the spontaneous separation  when the arteries are acting strongly whether the whole habit be strong or not the coagulable lymph is more fluid and longer in coagulating of consequence it lets the red particles which are the heaviest part of the blood fall down toward the bottom before it coagulates and upon the spontaneous separation the coagulum is divided into two parts the upper consisting of the coagulum of the coagulable lymph alone which has in this case been called the buff the under consisting partly of this and partly of the red particles  although part of the coagulable lymph would separate from the red particles may be prevented by taking the blood from a small vessel or from a small orifice or by letting it run along the skin before it falls into the vessel into which it is received or by receiving it into a vessel whose surface is large in proportion to its contents as in all these cases the coagulation is forwarded on the other hand if it stagnate in the bloodvessel for some time before it is taken out there will be a separation when none would otherwise have happened  whether the coagulable lymph separates in part from the red particles or not it coagulates sometimes into a firmer sometimes into a looser mass generally in proportion to the strength of the system  all the substances which coagulate the serum have the same effect on the coagulable lymph but none can be applied to it in the blood vessels excepting by injection in a sufficient degree of concentration to coagulate it  the coagulable lymph is probably in itself colorless insipid inodorous and incapable of stimulating  whilst it remains in the blood vessels it is chemically combined with a certain proportion of water from which it cannot be separated but by coagulation neither will it combine with a larger proportion  water mechanically mixed with it has no effect on its viscidity so far as that affects the circulation or secretions  no other differences besides those already taken notice of are observable in its properties  the coagulable lymph and serum are both capable of putrefaction and are converted by it into a mucilaginous matter not coagulable by any of the methods recited above  if this mucilaginous matter should undergo a further putrefaction it emits a foetid vapor and is converted into saline substances and calcarious earth  properties of the red part upon viewing this part of the blood with a deep magnifier in the solar microscope as it circulates in the blood vessels of a living animal it appears to be divided into a number of small particles which are apparently annular and exceedingly flexible  while the animal is respiring and the blood circulating it is of a scarlet color in the arteries and of a modena red in the veins but if the respiration be stopped that blood which circulates afterward through the lungs continues of a modena red if it be taken out of the veins kept moist and exposed to respirable air it becomes of a scarlet color if it be taken out of the arteries and covered from the air or if it stagnate in them its color is changed to a modena red a light shade of modena red is not scarlet neither is a deep scarlet a modena red various other substances alter the color of this part  it seems to have a sweetish tasle to be inodorous and void of stimulus  its specific gravity is but a very little more than the serum or coagulable lymph  it is more inflammable than the other parts and on performing its chemical analysis it yields a large proportion of empyreumatic oil  it is readily soluble in water but not in the serum  it is not soluble in a saturated solution of neutral salts  it is capable of undergoing the putrefactive fermentation the first stage of which breaks it down into smaller particles and renders it of a dark color it afterward is converted into a mucilage and becomes soluble in the serum  the superfluous water it is diffused through the serum and coagulable lymph  it contains a part perhaps the whole of the salts  these salts are chemically combined with a part of it only and this solution is diffused through the remaining part  the water diffused may be separated from the solution by filtration in the body  the solid part of the blood left after evaporation of the water by a beat lest than that of boiling water amounts to from one fourth to one fifth of the whole  extraneous substances a great variety of extraneous substances both fluid and solid may be introduced into the blood vessels by absorption but none of them in such proportion as to produce any alteration in the blood except by fermentation  when any ferment is introduced into the blood vessels it acts upon a part of the blood only the greatest part remaining to all experiment exactly the same as before  of the putrefaction of the blood fermentation is the conversion of one compound into another by a new arrangement or manner of combination of its elements  what is commonly called putrefaction consists of two fermentations which we shall call by the names of the first and second stage  all animal solid and fluids may be reduced by the first into a mucilaginous mass soluble in water and diffusible through any quantity of it  the red part of the blood first breaks down into smaller particles before it is formed into a perfect mucilage  the first stage takes place without any effervescence  the second stage converts this mucilage into earths and salts a foetid vapor and fixable air  the first and second stage of putrefaction take place in a small part of the blood or it is destroyed by some other operation for  after having coagulated the serum if we squeeze out the water and evaporate it there is left a mucilaginous matter similar to that formed by putrefaction  the sails formed in the blood vessels excepting phosphoric ammoniac may be formed by the last stage of putrefaction and those formed by the last stage are found in the blood vessels excepting nitrous selenites and nitrous ammoniac  this mucilage and these salts are always carrying off by urine the present blood is always diminishing and die vessels require a fresh supply from the food  the blood is always in the most powerful circumstances of putrefaction which are a heat of    degrees of fahrenheits thermometer fluidity a moderate exposure to air and motion but it is prevented from petrifying by the action of the vessels nor can any ferment or other circumstance induce the fermentation till this action is altered except perhaps the introduction of chyle intermixed with putrid matter  in diseases the first stage often takes place in part of the blood the second stage sometimes although seldom  of digestion digestion is the conversion of the food into chyle and afterward into blood  the food may consist of farinaceous or mucilaginous vegetable substances or native vegetable acid or sugar or expressed oil or animal solids or animal fluids containing a mucilaginous matter  these substances may be digested if they be taken singly or if they be mixed together  the blood formed does not differ sensibly in its properties whether the one or the other of them be used singly or several of them together provided the organs of digestion be sufficiently powerful convert them into blood  if the food be solid it is generally broke down by the teeth or by some other apparatus  but mashing it down with water is not sufficient to alter its chemical properties and convert it into chyle and blood  it is mixed in the stomach with the watery fluids we drink and with the mucilaginous watery fluids secreted by the salivary and other glands  it is sometimes dissolved in water before it is used but it is often rendered solid by a previous preparation or coagulated by a substance secreted in the stomach  simple solution in water does not convert it into chyle or blood  if it be previously dissolved in water it affords less nourishment than if exhibited solid  it is necessary that it remain in the stomach for some time in order to its digestion  the only process it can go through in the organs of digestion that is capable of altering its chemical properties is fermentation  its fermentation is not attended with effervescence in a healthy stomach  if vegetable food be used an acid is produced this acid is destroyed in the duodenum by the bile  if animal food be used alone no acid is produced  the stronger the stomach and the more perfect the digestion the lose acid is formed from vegetable food  no stage of the putrefactive fermentation takes place during the conversion of it into chyle and blood if the digestion be perfect  the fermentation which takes place is peculiar to the organs of digestion and has never been produced by any artificial means yet attempted  the fermentation which takes place in the stomach forwards the solution of solid food in the watery menstruums  solid foods dissolve sooner in the stomach than they can be dissolved in water in the same heat by any means hitherto found out  if the stomach does not act properly solid food remains undissolved vegetable and mixtures of vegetable and animal substances become more acid animal substances putrify a quantity of air is separated and the food is not digested and converted into chyle  only that part of the food which is digested affords nourishment the nourishment therefore is in proportion to the food and the digestion  when food either from its quantity or quality cannot be digested it is apt to occasion great disturbances in the system while it is contained in the stomach and intestines  the only sensible alterations produced in the blood by different foods are in its quantity or in the proportion of superfluous water or that sometimes a long use of animal food brings on a degree of putrefaction  of the chyle the chyle is formed from the food in the intestines and absorbed by the lacteals  the whole fluid absorbed is not chyle but a mixture of chyle and the solution of those substances which were simply dissolved in water without being digested  quere whether a simple solution of mucilaginous animal or vegetable substances can be converted into blood without being formed into chyle in the stomach and intestines  chyle is fluid while in the lacteals when exposed to the air it coagulates it is rendered white from a mixture of expressed oil  when coagulated a fluid may be squeezed out which probably contains a coagulable matter and sugar  the secreted fluids they either  exist in the blood vessels being mechanically mixed with the other fluids and require only a mechanical separation  or they do not exist in the blood vessels their elements only being contained there but these elements are not combined so as actually to form the secreted fluid it is therefore requisite that some chemical operation should take place in the secretory organ by which the elements shall be combined so as to form the matter secreted  the chemical operation by which they are formed is fermentation  the fluids separated mechanically are the matter of the insensible perspiration the urine the sweat the milk   the fluids formed in the secretory organ by a chemical operation are the mucus the saliva the pancreatic juice the semen the bile the wax in the ear the sebaceous matter the coagulating matter of the stomach etc   the matter of the insensible perspiration it is separated from the surface of the lungs and from the skin by evaporation  the quantity evaporated depends upon the quantity of superfluous water in the blood vessels the heat of the air the quantity of air applied and the contraction or relaxation of the vessels from whence the evaporation takes place  when the body is in its natural state that part of the insensible perspiration which is capable of condensation consists of water with a very small proportion of a mucilaginous matter and essential oil and sometimes perhaps volatile alkali  there is no reason to suppose that any matter flies off that cannot be condensed from any experiment hitherto made but it is rather probable that there is not  should any other substance capable of emitting vapor in the heat of the human body get into the blood vessels or be formed on the surface of the skin lungs or in any of the passages of the air in breathing it may be mixed with the insensible perspiration  some of these substances may be putrid vapor variolous morbillous and other infectious matters alcohol and other extraneous volatile substances etc  the matters thrown off by insensible perspiration may be evacuated by the other excretions  the health is not in proportion to the quantity of insensible perspiration  the urine the urine in the common state of the body is a transparent brownish fluid which upon cooling has a mucilaginous matter separated capable of being redissolved in heat  in health the separating mucilage is generally in such quantity as to remain suspended in the urine after its reparation forming what has been called the cloud  it is sometimes totally absent in health but much more frequently in diseases sometimes it is in quantity sufficiently to carry the cloud to the bottom and form a mucous sediment and sometimes it falls down in a flaky powder and forms what bas been called a lateritious sediment which is commonly of a brick color and now and then white  this last appearance often takes place on the going off of acute diseases but it also happens in health and while diseases subsist in their full force particularly when they affect the urinary passages or parts near them  sometimes the separating mucilage is separated in a powder remains suspended in the urine and renders it turbid  after the separating mucilage is separated if the urine be filtrated from it it is transparent consisting of water which contains a mucilage and salts   st a mucilage similar to that formed by the first stage of putrefaction  this mucilage is of a brownish color and gives the greatest part of the color to the urine  its quantity varies considerably but the proportion of it in the urine is always small  if the water be evaporated from it it will redissolve and it may be diffused through any quantity of water in any heat  it is not coagulable   dly the salts are common salt common sal ammoniac phosphoric ammoniac vitriolic selenites and muriatic selenites  common salt is contained in the urine in consequence of its being used in the food or drink and it is in proportion to the quantity used  the other salts are contained in the urine independent of any saline substance taken into the body except perhaps the vitriolic selenites  the quantity of selenitic salts is commonly very small but sometimes the urine is saturated with vitriolic selenites which separates and chrystalizes upon the urines standing to cool  the proportion of the salts varies considerably but is always so small as to form a diluted solution  the solution is generally sufficiently concentrated to stimulate a very irritable part but not always  the dilution depends on the quantity of superfluous water in the blood vessels and on the quantity of that superfluous water evacuated by the kidneys so that when the quantity secreted is large the solution is generally diluted when small more concentrated  watery fluids may pass through the blood vessels and by the kidneys hardly carrying off any thing with them especially if large quantities be drank at a time and the external vessels be contracted  sometimes a quantity of calcareous earth is found in the urine suspended by mechanical mixture or at least not combined with an acid  any extraneous substance soluble in water that may get into the blood vessels may be evacuated along with the urine such as acids alkalies neutral and other saline substances infusion of rhubarb and other mucilaginous vegetable juices bile pus and other fluids formed in the body  if the kidneys are relaxed or stimulated chyle serum coagulable lymph and even the red part of the blood may be thrown out  the red part may also be broke down by putrefaction and pass off by the kidneys of a very dark color disturbing the transparency and sometimes forming a sediment  if the heart and arteries act more strongly or frequently than they do in their natural state a quantity of expressed oil comes away with the urine and forms a film on the surface or a ring round the vessel into which it is received  the urine always contains a portion of the essential oil of the urinary passages and sometimes a portion of their mucus  the sweat as far as we are capable of judging from the small quantity that can be collected it contains nearly the same substances as the urine only that instead of the essential oil of the urinary passages it is mixed with the sebacious matter of the skin which gives it a degree of whiteness and a smell different from that of the urine  the milk it is secreted naturally in the breasts of women for the nourishment of their young sometimes during pregnancy and always after childbirth there are said to have been instances of its being secreted at other times and from other parts of the body  it is a whitish fluid which separates into two parts upon being left at rest in a moderate degree of heat the upper part consists principally of expressed oil with a mixture of the other part and is whiter and more opaque  the under part consists of a solution of coagulable matter and sugar in water with a small mixture of expressed oil and is called the skimmilk  the expressed oil is fluid in the heat of the human body but solid in the heat of the atmosphere  it is only mechanically mixed with the other part  it is tinged with and receives a flavor from the essential oil of the food and of the body  it is found not only in different proportions in the milk of different women but also in the milk of the same woman at different times and even in that which issues from the different excretory ducts of the glands of the same breast  the coagulable matter only differs from the coagulable matter of the serum in its coagulability and its proportion to the water  it is not coagulable by a less heat than that of boiling water and by that only if the water be evaporated from it  it may be coagulated by acids alcohol several metallic and aluminous salts and vegetable juices but it requires that they should be applied to it in a greater degree of concentration than the serum does in order to its coagulation  heat assists the coagulating power of these substances  it is readily coagulable by the coagulating juices of the stomach and coagulates in the stomach of a living animal whether any acid be contained in it or not  the sugar contained in the milk does not differ in its properties from that of the sugarcane  its proportion is always small  when a woman makes use of vegetable food it seems to be in greater proportion than when she uses animal  the milk of a bitch using animal food alone contains sugar  if milk be kept for some time exposed to the air and in the heat of the atmosphere or of the human body the sugar ferments and is converted into vinegar which coagulates the coagulable matter  the same change may take place in the breast if it stagnate there for some time or if the woman be suddenly affected with any of the passions of the mind that are attended with anxiety  if blood be taken from the arm after a full meal the serum is often mixed with a substance which gives it a degree of whiteness and opacity  the milk is secreted after a full meal in larger proportion than after a woman has fasted for some time  in the latter case the proportion of the expressed oil coagulable matter and sugar likewise diminishes and the milk contains besides these the neutral salts of the blood and acquires a bitterness from the sebacious matter of the glands of the nipples  in some women the milk always contains the salts of the blood or the sebacious matter of the nipples  the sebacious matter not only gives it a bitter taste but also sometimes a yellowish color and a thicker appearance  the milk may contain any substance which is thrown into the stomach and simply dissolved in water without going through the digestive fermentations and being converted into chyle  the mucus it covers the surfaces of the membranes that are exposed to any extraneous matter such as the skin and internal membrane of the mouth nose lungs aesophagus stomach intestines urinary passages etc  it is a fluid of an adhesive viscidity approaching to a solid and of greater viscidity in one part than in another  it is a compound of a coagulable matter and water  it is more or less viscid according to the quantity of water with which it is combined  it is of different degrees of viscidity in different parts of the body  it will not combine with more water than what is already contained in it neither can its viscidity be altered by digesting it with water unless it begin to putrify nor can the more viscid mucus of one part be converted into the less viscid of another  if the water be evaporated from it by a gentle heat the coagulable matter remains solid if this be immersed in water it will absorb that quantity which evaporated from it but no more and it will regain its former fluidity and viscidity  it for the most part contains either no neutral salts or so small a proportion as cannot easily be rendered sensible to experiment it is colorless insipid inodorous and incapable of stimulating  it combines with concentrated vitriolic nitrous and muriatic acids with concentrated solutions of some metallic salts and also with concentrated or diluted solutions of caustic alkalies and caustic calcarious earth into compounds soluble in and diffusible through water  acids and some metallic salts dissolved in water and concentrated but not to that degree as to dissolve it alcohol and aluminous salts coagulate it it is also coagulable by the heat of boiling water but not by a less degree of heat  the mucus defends the membranes from being so much stimulated by any application as they would be if they were not covered with it  if the secretion be suddenly increased the matter secreted is often a thin watery fluid containing the salts of the blood and in consequence of them capable of stimulating and the membranes are not defended from external applications  if a greater secretion should continue than what naturally takes place the mucus retains the salts but often acquires a viscidity and becomes incapable of being diffused through water its color also often grows white greenish or yellow and now and then it acquires a smell  the saliva it is secreted by several glands in the mouth and the principal part of it is thrown down into the stomach to answer some purpose in the digestion of the food  it is a fluid of an adhesive viscidity with difficulty diffusible through water  it consists of water a coagulable matter similar to that of the mucus and the salts of the blood but not in so large a proportion as they are contained in the serum  it contains a larger proportion of water than the mucus  in its other properties it is similar to the mucus  the pancreatic juice it appears to be similar to the saliva except that it is less viscid and contains a larger proportion of the salts of the blood  the saliva and pancreatic juice are probably watery menstrua for the solution of the food in the stomach and intestines their viscidity preventing them from being absorbed before they produce that effect  they have been said to act as ferments during the digestion but as the fermentations of the stomach have never been made to take place out of it we cannot judge of this by any experiment hitherto communicated to the public  the bile the blood from which the bile is formed has probably gone through one circulation without being exposed to the air in the lungs or mixed with the fluids brought by the lymphatics from the different parts of the body  the blood from which the bile is formed passes through the vessels of the abdominal viscera before it arrives at the liver but it does not take up any substance from them or at least not in such a quantity as to be sensible to any experiment yet made but on the contrary it appears perfectly similar in all sensible qualities to the blood returning by the veins from the other parts of the body  there is no appearance of bile in the vena portarum of a living animal  when bile in the jaundice is contained in the blood vessels it is secreted by all the secretory organs and it is evidently contained in all the secretions  the bile is formed from the blood in the secretory vessels of the liver  it runs along the hepatic ducts into the ductus communis cholidochus and from thence partly into the duodenum and partly into the gallbladder  it continues for some time in the gallbladder and becomes more perfect in its properties there from thence it returns into the ductus communis cholidochus and passes into the duodenum  the bile is a fluid of an oleaginous viscidity consisting of a solution of a solid matter in water  if the water be not evaporated from it no alteration is produced on it by any heat between    and     degrees of fahrenheits thermometer  the bile is diffusible in any proportion of water  if the water be evaporated from the solid part by a heat not exceeding     degrees of fahrenheits thermometer it is soluble in and diffusible through any quantity of water  the solid matter of the bile melts if it be heated and is decomposed if the heat be increased  if it is distilled by itself it yields a larger proportion of empyreumatic oil than any of the other fluids except the expressed oil and red part of the blood  it is of a yellow color and a sweetish bitter taste  when it is not combined with more water than it generally is in the gallbladder it does not putrify more readily than the blood but if it be diluted with water or watery fluids it putrifies more readily  acids and some of their compounds decompose it and precipitate from it a resinous matter  the acidity of the acid is lost by its combination with the other part but if more acid be employed than what is necessary for the decomposition the acidity of the superfluous quantity remains  the matter precipitated has the peculiar smell of the animal  it is solid in the heat of the atmosphere melts in a moderate degree of heat and burns very readily  it is not soluble in water  it is partly soluble in alcohol  if the passage of the bile into the duodenum be stopped acidities are apt to take place in the intestinal canal the peristaltic motion does not go on properly the faeces lose their peculiar color and smell and often acquire a more putrid foetor and the digestion is hurt but not entirely prevented  the properties of the other secreted fluids have not been sufficiently investigated by experiments for us to be able to give any satisfactory account of them  the chemical properties of the animal solids they are a compound of coagulable matter and water  they are naturally flexible but if the water be evaporated from them by a gentle heat they become friable  the water chemically combined cannot be separated from them by expression exposed to about a red heat they are decomposed and if they be distilled by themselves volatile alcali empyreumatic oil water and calcareous earth are formed  when free from essential oil blood and the salts of the fluids they are colorless insipid and inodorous  they differ in their flexibility and elasticity  fibers and membranes are readily flexible not capable of being broke by bending and have a less degree of elasticity  cartilage is less flexible capable in general of being broke by bending and more elastic  cartilage often supplies the place of bone in young animals  heat dilute acids neutral saits alcohol metalic and aluminous saits astringent juices of vegetables and several other substances coagulate them i e separate part of the water chemically combined and of consequence contract them diminish their flexibility and harden them substances coagulating the animal solids are called astringents  if they be exposed to a freezing cold the water freezes and upon thawing their texture is found to be altered  concentrated vitriolic nitrous and muriatic acids caustic alkalis even in a diluted solution quick lime and several of the metallic salts combine with them into a substance diffusible through or soluble in water and destroy their texture  they are capable of putrefaction in the same manner as the animal fluids  the general structure of the body the blood vessels there are cavities in the body called blood vessels in which the red part of the blood the coagulable lymph and part of the serum and superfluous water are usually contained  they consist of the heart arteries capillaries and veins  the heart consists essentially of two cavities there being two hearts properly speaking joined together in the human body serving for two circulations of the blood one through every part of the body and one through the lungs  the left side of the heart serves for the general circulation and consists of two cavities the auricle and the ventricle  the auricle is a cavity which opens into the pulmonary veins at one end and into the ventricle at the other there is a valve placed at the opening into the ventricle which prevents any fluid from passing from the ventricle into the auricle  the auricle is in part covered with muscular fibers  the ventricle is a cavity surrounded with muscular fibers having one opening into the auricle and another into a pipe called the aorta or great artery  at the opening into the aorta there are valves which prevent any fluid from passing from the aorta into the ventricle  the aorta is a tube which begins at the heart and dividing into several branches goes to every part of the body  it does not divide at once but branches out as it passes along  when it has arrived at any part and divided into very small branches these open into one another so as to have a free and perfect communication every way from these arise a smaller set of tubes which also communicate in the same manner and from them again arise a larger set which have likewise a free communication  the first set have been called capillary or anastomosing arteries the second have not got a name the third have been called capillary veins but i would term all of them capillary vessels  from the third set arise tubes which terminate in the heart joining together as they go on toward it and forming principally two large tubes which open into the right auricle  these are called veins  the veins which are subject to frequent compression from the action of the muscles have valves which open toward the heart  each artery capillary and vein is nearly cylindrical but somewhat irregular in its diameter  no muscular fibers appear on the arteries capillaries or veins in the human body  these vessels are all of them elastic and capable of being distended so as to contain a larger quantity of fluid than what is necessary to render them cylindrical  their elasticity is not sufficient to overcome the weight of their sides and keep them cylindrical if they are not filled with a fluid excepting in that part of the aorta nearest the heart  when an animal is dead and no chemical or mechanical change has taken place in the vessels the elasticity is the same as when the animal was alive  when an animal is dead and the vessels act by their elasticity alone they are incapable of contracting to half the size they are of at their utmost distention supposing them to continue cylindrical  when an animal is alive the blood vessels are always cylindrical excepting when they are compressed by a considerable external force  they are always full of blood  when an animal is alive the veins capillaries and small arteries are sometimes contracted to less than half the size they are of at other times therefore the veins capillaries and small arteries in a living animal have a contractile power independent of their elasticity by which they adapt themselves to the blood and continue cylindrical  this power is similar to the muscular power  when the vessels contain more blood they become longer or their diameter is enlarged or both and e contra  when they contain less blood they become shorter or their diameter diminishes or both  the contractile power of the vessels is capable of diminishing either their length or diameter  when an animal dies the arteries and veins lose their cylindrical form and are flattened and the capillaries contain less blood in them  the arteries veins and capillaries of a living animal are commonly contracted to a greater degree than they can be by their elasticity  the elasticity is commonly endeavoring to distend them  if the vessels are emptied to such a degree that they cannot adapt themselves to the blood and continue cylindrical the animal dies  the most essential effort of the living power is to adapt the vessels to the blood  the course of the circulation of the blood the blood passes from the left auricle of the heart into the left ventricle from the left ventricle into the aorta and from thence by the smaller arteries to the capillaries in every part of the body from these it returns by the veins to the right auricle of the heart the blood for the most part moves in one uniform direction in each artery viz from the heart toward the capillaries it also moves in one uniform direction in each vein viz from the capillaries toward the heart but although it moves in general from the arteries through the capillaries into the veins yet its direction in any one capillary may be and often is altered and reversed  both the general velocity with which the blood moves through the whole system and the proportional velocity of its motion in particular vessels are constantly varying  the powers producing the circulation of the blood the force with which the blood moves in the veins and the muscular contraction of the auricle which takes place during the relaxation of the ventricle propels the blood into the ventricle  when a certain quantity of blood is propelled into the ventricle its muscular fibers contract being probably stimulated thereto by the blood  this contraction of the muscular fibers of the right ventricle diminishes or obliterates it and propels the whole or part of the blood contained in it into the aorta the valve placed at the opening of the auricle into the ventricle preventing its return into the auricle  when the ventricle has emptied itself into the aorta it relaxes and receives a fresh quantity of blood from the auricle the blood being prevented from returning from the aorta by the valves placed at its opening into the heart  the action of the heart tends to produce an equal and uniform circulation in every part of the body  the circulation does not depend on the action of the heart alone the circulation is not equal and uniform through the whole body but the same quantity of blood flowing from the heart a greater proportion of it sometimes circulates through one part sometimes through another  if the heart be the sole power propelling the blood forward the circulation can only be increased in any one part by an increase in the size of the vessels or removal of some obstruction to the circulation there or a diminution of the size of the vessels or obstructtion to the circulation in the rest of the body and e contra the circulation can only be diminished in one part by a diminution of the size of the vessels or obstruction to the circulation there or an increase of the size of the vessels or a removal of some obstructtion to the circulation in the other parts of the body  the principal causes producing an alteration of the size of the vessels or an obstruction to the circulation are  st an increase or diminution in the disposition to contraction in the capillary vessels or in the external pressure  dly the meeting of the streams of blood in the anastomosing vessels  dly the attraction of the blood to the sides of the vessels   the disposition to contraction in the capillaries of a particular part or the external pressure may be increased so as actually to produce a diminution of the size of the vessels of that part notwithstanding the action of the heart and by consequence a diminution of the circulation of the blood in that part  as the obstruction arising from the meeting of the streams of blood in the anastomosing vessels depends on the velocity with which it moves it tends to render the circulation in a part equal by preventing an increase or diminution of it  as the blood is thoroughly mixed in the right ventricle of the heart and is distributed from thence to the different parts no alteration in its attraction to the sides of the vessels can produce an increase or diminution of the circulation in a particular part  it has been supposed that a viscidity in the fluids or an increase of the size of their particles often produced an obstruction to the circulation but this opinion has not been proved or rendered probable by any experiment hitherto made public oh the contrary the red globules appear to be always nearly of the same size except when they are broke down by putrefaction the serum and coagulable lymph seldom or ever appear more viscid than when in their common state and if they were their viscidity would affect the system equally  the disposition to contraction in the capillary vessels or the external pressure may be so much diminished as that the action of the heart continuing the same the size of the vessels of a part may be increased so as actually to occasion a greater circulation of blood in that part  if the heart be the sole cause of the circulation the only material alteration that could take place in the proportion of the circulation in the different parts must depend on an increase or diminution of the disposition to contraction in the vessels or on an alteration in the external pressure  but the circulation may be increased in a particular part the motion of the heart continuing the same by causes which do not diminish the disposition to contraction of the vessels of that part nor increase the disposition to contraction in the vessels in the other parts of the body nor produce any effect on the external pressure  therefore the heart is not the sole power which propels the fluids through the part in which the circulation is thus increased  the causes capable of increasing the circulation in a part are generally such as tend to excite muscular motion and are called stimuli  some part of the body brought into action by these stimuli is capable of increasing the circulation independent of the action of the heart  the arteries are endowed with a muscular motion by which they may increase the circulation in a particular part or assist the heart in the general circulation of the blood  the arteries at each contraction of the heart are distended at each relaxation they contract  this alternate contraction and dilatation might depend on their elasticity  if their contractions and dilatations depended on their elasticity their size at their utmost contraction in the living body should be equal to that produced by a fluid injected into them with a force capable of overcoming the resistance the blood meets with in the capillary vessels which in the human body is probably equal to eight feet perpendicular height of water  but their size even at their utmost state of dilatation is less than that produced by a fluid injected into them with a force equal to one foot perpendicular height of water when the animal is dead  therefore their contractions and dilatations do not depend on their elasticity  the additional force which occasions an increase of the circulation in a particular part must depend on the action of the arteries or capillaries  as the capillaries do not contract and dilate alternately and as the direction of the blood in any one of them is quite undetermined this additional force cannot depend on the action of the capillaries  if the arteries contracted and dilated by their elasticity no additional force could be applied from their contraction and dilatation since the heart would lose more force in distending the arteries than they would reapply to the blood in contracting  if the arteries upon being distended by the blood thrown into them by the heart are excited to a muscular contraction and when they have performed this contraction relax and like the ventricle of the heart receive the blood easily into them and when they are again distended are excited to a second contraction they may apply an additional force to that of the heart so as to promote the circulation through the whole body  if such contractions and dilatations be greater in any particular part they will promote the circulation in that part in as much as when they are relaxed to a greater degree they will suffer the blood to pass through them more readily into the capillaries and when they contract they will empty themselves more thoroughly into the capillaries  the arteries have a muscular contraction and dilatation similar to that of the ventricles of the heart by which they apply an additional power to that of the heart so as to promote the general circulation through the whole body and often to increase the proportional circulation in a particular part  the motion of the blood is regulated by the action of the heart and arteries and the contraction of the capillary vessels and these arc measured by the pulse  the pulse indicates by it is called  st the strength of the contraction of the heart strength strong weakness weak  dly the quantity of blood thrown out at each contraction fullness full smallness small  dly the number of contractions frequency frequent slowness slow  thly the regularity of its action as to strength quanity or frequency regularity regular irregularity irregular intermission intermittent  thly the strength of the action of the arteries hardness hard softness soft redoubling redoubling trembling trembling  thly the irritability of the vessels quickness quick regularity regular slowness slow  thly the medium diameter of the arteries dilatation great contraction small  thly the quantity of blood in the vessels oppression oppressed smallness empty  thly the contraction of the capillaries obstruction obstructed freedom free  the structure of the lungs there is a set of vessels in the lungs which contain air and another which contain blood  the air vessels the air vessels consist of a pipe called the trachea one end of which opens into the throat and communicates with the amtosphere by the nostrils and mouth the other divides into branches which go to every part of the lungs and whose ends open into small cavities or cells  the air in the lungs is generally in motion for either that which is at present contained in the cells is passing through the trachea into the atmosphere or a fresh parcel is passing from the external atmosphere through the trachea into the cells  the whole of this motion is called respiration when the air is passing in it is called inspiration when it is thrown out expiration  when the thorax is enlarged by the action of one set of its muscles the pressure of the external atmosphere forces the air into the lungs the other set of muscles which contract the thorax when put in action force the air out of the lungs into the atmosphere but the pressure of the atmosphere on the surface of the body counterbalancing its pressure on the surface of the lungs neither the muscles of inspiration nor those of expiration are assisted or counteracted by it  if the air continues at rest in the lungs for many minutes or if a man continues to respire the same air or if he breathes air that has served for the inflammation of fuel or pure fixable air he dies  it is not determined whether pure inflammable air will serve for respiration  some vapors kill immediately if taken into the lungs independent of their being unfit for respiration  the blood vessels the  vessels of the lungs consist of two sets viz  st the pulmonary  dly the bronchial   the pulmonary vessels the right side of the heart is similar to the left excepting that both the auricle and ventricle have fewer muscular fibers and that the auricle receives blood from the venae cavae and the ventricle throws it into the pulmonary artery  the pulmonary artery begins at the right ventricle of the heart and goes from thence to every part of the lungs in the same manner that the aorta goes to every part of the body  when the pulmonary artery has divided into very small branches these do not open into one another and form anastomosing vessels like the small branches of the aorta but they join again and form veins which uniting together go to the left auricle of the heart commonly in five trunks  the circulation of the blood through the pulmonary vessels the blood passes from the right auricle into the right ventricle from the right ventricle into the pulmonary artery from the pulmonary artery into the pulmonary veins and from the pulmonary veins into the left auricle  the powers propelling the blood through the lungs the muscular fibers of the right auricle contracting propel part of the blood contained in it into the right ventricle and they are assisted by the force with which the blood moves in the veins  the muscular fibers of the right ventricle being stimulated to contract when it is full propel part or the whole of the blood contained in it into the pulmonary artery the blood being prevented from returning into the auricle by the valve placed at the opening of the auricle into the ventricle  after the ventricle has contracted it relaxes and receives the blood from the auricle it being prevented from returning from the pulmonary artery by the valves placed at the opening of the pulmonary artery into the ventricle  the blood is thrown by the right ventricle through the pulmonary artery and veins into the left auricle  perhaps the pulmonary artery has a muscular power similar to the muscular power of the other arteries by which it promotes the circulation of the blood through the lungs  the blood meets with the same obstructions in its passage through the lungs that it does in its passage through the other parts of the body excepting that there being no anastomosing vessels there is no obstruction from the streams of the blood meeting in them and opposing each others motion  the blood meets with some additional obstructions in its passage through the pulmonary vessels besides those it meets with in the other parts of the body viz  st the motion of the lungs in respiration as there are no valves in the vessels tends to retard the circulation although the reverse has been asserted  dly if a sufficient quantity of respirable air be not received into and thrown out of the lungs the motion of the blood in the pulmonary vessels is considerably retarded   the bronchial vessels an artery arises from the aorta and spreads itself through the lungs terminating in anastomosing capillary vessels which open into veins in the same manner as the other branches of the aorta in other parts of the body  the blood circulates in these vessels in the same manner as in the other vessels arising from the aorta in other parts of the body  the extravasation and absorption of the lymph part of the superfluous water and serum is continually passing through the sides of the vessels particularly the capillaries into the cellular membrane and all the cavities of the body so as to keep their surfaces moist  it has been supposed that they passed through tubes appended to the sides of the blood vessels but such vessels have never been demonstrated nor is there any reason for supposing that they exist excepting in the glands  the fluids commonly extravasated have been called the lymph  it is uncertain whether it passes through the accidental pores in the sides of the vessels or by cylindrical organized holes but it is most probable that it passes through organized holes as the secretion is regular and constant  the pores or vessels it passes through are called exhalants  it is absorbed by the lymphatics  a lymphatic is a tube nearly cylindrical divided by valves so at to have the resemblance of joints  they arise from the cellular membrane and cavities and the greatest part of them go to the thoracic duct  the valves allow the lymph to pass from the cavities to the thoracic duct but prevent its passing from the thoracic duct to the cavities  the lymphatics in passing from the cavities to the thoracic duct go through the lymphatic glands  the structure and use of these glands are not as yet ascertained  the thoracic duct is a tube which begins near the diaphragm and commonly terminates in the left subclavian vein  at its opening into the left subclavian vein there is a valve which allows the lymph to pass from it into the vein but prevents the running of the blood from the vein into the thoracic duct  some of the lymphatics terminate in veins these are similar in structure to those which terminate in the thoracic duct  the powers producing the extravasation and absorption of the lymph the contractile power of the blood vessels squeezes the lymph into the cellular membrane and cavities  the quantity thrown out is in proportion to the force of the circulation the fluidity of the substances contained in the blood vessels or the quantity of the more fluid substances and the degree of contraction of the capillaries and exhalants  the joint of a lymphatic opening into a cavity endeavors to fill itself from that cavity by its action as a capillary tube the valves preventing the return of the lymph from the other part of the lymphatic in like manner a lymphatic may fill itself entirely from the cavity in which it terminates but its action as a capillary tube will not tend in the smallest degree to propel the lymph into the veins  it is most probable that the joint of the lymphatic next to the cavity having absorbed a sufficient quantity of lymph to fill it is stimulated to contract and propel the fluid into the next joint and so on to the thoracic duct or vein in which it terminates and having emptied itself and being relaxed it fills itself again from the cavity and so continues to act for there is apparently no other power in the body capable of producing a regular flow of the lymph through the lymphatics into the blood vessels  for in a living animal where the veins are contracting and pressing the blood if one end of a capillary tube terminate in a vein and the other in a cavity and if there be no action in that tube excepting that which arises from its being a capillary one or from the motion of the blood in the vein if there be any motion in that tube after it is full it will always be from the vein into the cavity and never from the cavity into the vein let the tube be of any size or shape whatever  further the alternate pressure of the lymphatics arising from the alternate contractions and relaxations of the blood vessels or muscles is not sufficiently powerful universal or equal to produce a regular flow of the lymph through the lymphatics into the blood vessels  neither does the cellular membrane and cavities force the lymph into the lymphatics and through them into the veins  the extravasation of fluids from the blood vessels in to the cellular membrane and cavities and their reabsorption generally take place in the above manner  sometimes the coagulable lymph is thrown out by the exhalants  when the coagulable lymph is thrown out it most commonly coagulates  if it coagulate it cannot be taken up by the lymhatics till it be redissolved  in many cases it redissolves and is absorbed much sooner than it can be rendered soluble in water by putrefaction when out of the body at other times it continues in the cavity for many years  the red part of the blood is also sometimes thrown out by the exhalants in this case its particles are broke down probably by the first stage of putrefaction and it is afterward reabsorbed  the same things may happen if the red particles and coagulable lymph are extravasated in consequence of the rupture of a bloodvessel  in particular parts as in the corpora cavernosa penis the extravasation and absorption is probably performed in a different manner and by different vessels  all absorbent vessels must have a power of propelling the fluids into the blood vessels sufficient to overcome the force of their contraction by which they endeavor to propel the blood out of any opening  the heat of the human body the bodies of quadrupeds have a disposition to maintain the same degree of heat nearly  the heat of quadrupeds of the same species is generally the same especially in mankind  the common heat of the human body in health is ninetyeight degrees of fahrenheits thermometer  the heat is the same throughout the whole body excepting that a cold substance applied to the skin diminishes its heat and the heat of the blood flowing from a vein in an extremity that is exposed to a cold atmosphere is reduced two or three degrees  otherwise the heat continues the same whether that of the atmosphere or other surrounding bodies be greater or less than ninetyeight degrees unless when it produces a disease the consequence of which is an increase or diminution of the heat of the body  the body is capable of resisting different degrees of external heat or cold according to the habit it has acquired there are instances of its bearing  0 degrees below 0 of fahrenheits thermometer with very moderate clothing and     above without alteration  the heat may be increased or diminished by alterations in the body itself especially in diseases  the heat has seldom been observed to be less than ninetyfour or more than a hundred and ten degrees of fahrenheits thermometer  an increased action of the living power in any part or in the whole body increases the heat and e contra a diminution of the action of the living power diminishes the heat either in quantity or degree  fluids rubbing against solids or very small particles of a solid immersed in a fluid rubbing against one another or against a solid produce no sensible heat therefore neither the friction of the blood against the vessels nor the friction of the red particles against one another or against the vessels produces maintains or regulates the heat of the body  it has not been proved by any experiment hitherto made public that the fermentations producing or destroying the fluids generate heat and if it were these fermentations do not go on so regularly universally or constantly as to produce maintain or regulate the heat of the body  the heat is not at all proportion to the evaporation as a double quantity evaporated by the insensible perspiration makes no alteration in the heat  the power which produces maintains and regulates the heat of the human body in health produces heat when the surrounding substances are heated to a less degree than    of fahrenheits thermometer and cold when they are heated to a greater degree  the nervous system the brain is a soft mass internally of a white color externally of a greyish or ash color  it is furnished with blood vessels in the same manner as the other parts excepting that larger arteries anastomose and the smaller veins enter more suddenly into a large trunk whose sides are of a firmer texture  in quadrupeds it is contained in the cavity of the head  in man it is in a larger proportion to the whole body than in any other quadruped or any bird or fish hitherto known  from the white part masses of fibers arise which go to every part of the body these are called nerves  one large mass passes down through the cavity of the spine and is called the spinal marrow  a little of the cineritious part is contained in the middle of this and also in the optic nerves  the brain spinal marrow and nerves are covered with membranes of a much firmer texture  the nerves proceed from the brain in trunks which branch out as they pass to the different part of the body  upon examining the trunks with a microscope they appear to consist of very small fibers which are only separated from one another in the branching  in their passage they sometimes join again forming roundish masses called ganglions from whence they proceed to the different parts  when they divide into very small branches they have been supposed to become softer and seem to go to every the smallest part  the sensibility mobility and irritability of the body the sensibility is a property of the body by which external substances applied to it excite sensations in the mind  the mobility is an original power of motion by which certain parts of the body are capable of moving themselves without any external motion impressed  the irritability is a property of the body by which external applications to particular parts excite a motion in the moveable parts independent of the motion impressed  these properties depend on the brain and nerves  the sensibility the sensibility depends entirely on a parts being connected with the brain by the nerves for  if the nerves going to any part be cut through the sensibility is lost  if the nerves going to any part be moderately comprest the sensibility is diminished  if the nerves be comprest strongly the sensibility is lost  if the pressure be soon removed the sensibility recurs  if the pressure be continued for a long time before it is removed the sensibility returns more slowly or not at all  pressure on the brain diminishes the sensibility of the whole body  if a small branch of a nerve be cut through so as to take off the sensibility of a part of the skin it may be restored in time  the sensibility may be impaired or lost without any sensible pressure on the nerve or alteration of its structure  when there is no wound in the body the sensations appear to be in the place where the application exciting them is made  if an extremity be cut off an application made to the stump may produce sensations which appear to be in the part amputated  query can a sensation be excited apparently in a part by an affection of the nerve going to it the body being whole   every part of the body is capable of sensation in a sound or morbid state  the bones and cartilages do not appear to be sensible in a sound state whatever application be made to them but in a morbid one they may become sensible  all the other parts of the body appear to be sensible in a sound state for the distention of a part considerably beyond its present disposition to contract either by its muscular power or elasticity is capable of exciting sensations in every other part of the body  there are applications which are capable of exciting sensations in one part that produce no such effect in another  some of the sensible parts are only capable of sensation from distention in a sound state such as the membranes  one part may be sensible to an application which another is not and the second part may be sensible to another application which the first is not as the effluvia of musk do not affect the eyes although they affect the nostrils and the rays of light affect the eyes but not the nostrils  some parts of the body are only capable of the sensation of pain others are capable of various sensations of which pain is always one  some applications are capable of exciting pain only others may excite various sensations  every sensation excited in a very great degree is painful and several are also painful from being very weak  those parts of the body which are capable of a veriety of sensations are generally called the organs of the senses these are  the skin the mouth the nostrils the eyes the ears the stomach is capable of several sensations besides pain but not of so great a variety as the organs of the senses  some other parts of the body are also capable of some sensations not painful  all the sensible parts may have their sensibility increased or diminished  the mobility and irritability part capable of original motion are called the moving parts  in many of the parts capable of original motion there are red fibers called muscular fibers  in some of the parts capable of original motion no such fibers have hitherto been demonstrated  all the parts of the body are not capable of original motion  the muscles blood vessels lymphatics secretories of the glands and skin are capable of original motion  the moving parts are capable of contracting beyond that degree of contraction which would arise from their elasticity  all the actions of the body and all the power which it exerts depend upon the contraction of the moving parts  when a muscular fiber or any other moving part continues in action for a considerable time it does not in general exert one continued contraction but a number of alternate contractions and relaxations the relaxations when the body is strong or the whole strength is not exerted are often hardly distinguishable but when the habit is weak or the whole force exerted they become very apparent  a contraction may however probably continue for a very long time without any intermediate relaxation as in a spasm  when any motion takes place in consequence of a relaxation it is from the elasticity or weight of the part or from some external power  the original motions are produced by volition ideas of the mind or certain external applications called stimuli  there must be the same intercourse which is necessary for sensation between the moving part and the brain by means of the nerves to render volition capable of exciting a motion in it  many of the moveable parts are incapable of being put in motion by the will  an idea of the mind may excite a motion independent of and contrary to the will provided the part be connected with the brain by the nerves as for sensation  the will may acquire a power over a moving part which it could not affect originally  the motions excited by the will are called voluntary motions those excited by ideas or stimuli independent of or contrary to the will are called involuntary  all the parts of the human body capable of voluntary motions have red muscular fibers  the will and ideas are both capable of producing contractions and relaxations in the moving parts  if the communication between the brain and a moving and irritable part be cut off by cutting through the nerve a motion may be still excited in it by a stimulus hence stimuli may excite motion without affecting the brain and therefore all the motions excited by them are not begun in the brain and carried along the nerves to the moving part  if a nerve be cut through so as to leave a portion of it adhering to a moving part a stimulus applied to the nerve may excite a motion in the moving part hence the action of a nerve upon a part may excite a motion in it and the motions excited by the nerves do not all arise in the brain  if the communication between the brain and a moving part by the nerves continues a stimulus applied to the brain may excite a contraction of the moving part  the motions produced by the application of stimuli to moving and irritable parts are apparently the same whether the part be connected with the brain by the nerves or not excepting that the motions excited become more languid after the moving part has been separated some time from the brain and at last the power of motion in it is entirely lost  the same things are true of the motions excited by the application of stimuli to the nerves going to a moving part  hence it is probable that the motions excited by the application of stimuli to a moving and irritable part or to the nerve going to a moving part do not arise in the brain but immediately in the nerves or in the part the brain in this case only keeping up the life of the part and rendering it capable of motion  when a stimulus produces a contraction in a moving fiber the force of that contraction is often far greater than the force with which the stimulus was applied therefore when a stimulus excites a motion it is not in consequence of a communication of the power employed in applying that stimulus nay the motion may be the very reverse of that which would have been produced by the exertion of that power  when a stimulus applied to a nerve produces a contraction in a moving fiber it is a question whether the motion is excited in the nerve and communicated to the fiber or produced immediately in the fiber without any motions being excited in the nerve for in this last there is often no apparent motion excited  it has been conjectured by some that the motion was communicated by a fluid flowing through the nerves as tubes by others that it was communicated by vibrations and by others that it arises from an elastic vapor surrounding the nerves but none of these conjectures are founded on experiment neither are any of them any ways capable of accounting for the appearances  as the influence of a stimulus on a moving fiber is not occasioned by any mechanical communication of motion may not a stimulus applied to a nerve exert its influence on a contractile fiber without any mechanical communication by any motion running along the nerve  if the brain is not diseased and two parts of the body communicate with it by the nerves as for sensation an application made to one of these parts may excite a contraction or relaxation in the other although none of the substance applied be carried from the one to the other and although no sensation be excited by the stimulus hence a medicine applied to one part of the body may produce an effect upon another although none of that medicine be carried to the part on which that effect is produced  the effect of an application upon a part at a distance from that where it is made may be the same which it would have produced if applied to that part or it may be the reverse or totally unconnected with it  quer may not the application in this case influence the distant part without any communication from a mechanical motion running along the nerves of the one part to the brain and from the brain by the nerves to the other part  an application to one part may produce a motion in another although it would have had no effect if it had been made to the part itself  a stimulus applied to a part incapable of original motion may excite a motion in a moving part at a distance  if the communication between the brain and any part of the body by means of the nerves be cut off applications made to that part will not affect the other parts nor will applications to the other parts produce motions in that unless the nerves be cut off from a muscle whose fibers have been accustomed to contract at one and the same time such as the heart in that case if you stimulate one of these fibers the whole are brought into immediate contraction those not stimulated contract to all appearance as soon as the one to which the stimulus is applied  as in this case the communication between the fibers by the nerves is cut off and as after cutting through the nerves of a small part of the body the sensation may in time be restored is there not a communication of nervous influence between the parts that are in contact independent of the nerves  the parts on which stimuli are capable of acting so as to produce motion are called the irritable parts  all the parts of the body are irritable in a sound state excepting the bones cartilages and tendons  all the parts of the body may become irritable in a morbid state  stimuli may produce motion in a distant part when applied to a part incapable of original motion or in other words all the irritable parts are not moving parts  an application that produces relaxation or diminishes contraction is called a sedative  a substance may act on one part as a stimulant on another as a sedative  a substance may act on one part as a stimulant or sedative and have a lest effect or none at all when applied to another although otherwise equally irritable such stimuli are called specific  there are some parts upon which stimuli in general produce greater effects than they do upon others  a greater number of substances act also upon these parts  the membranes ligaments and blood vessels excepting the heart are incapable of being affected by any other stimulus but distention  some of the applications capable of affecting the moving parts tend to destroy the fibers by mechanical or chemical effects some of them have no mechanical or chemical power of action  the irritability and mobility of a part may be increased diminished or entirely lost  custom and habit custom is the frequent repetition of any application to the body capable of affecting the sensible or irritable parts or it is the repetition of any action or motion of the body  habit is the effect of such repetition  an application producing a sensation may have its power increased or diminished by custom  if the mind pays particular attention to any impression its force and distinctness is increased hence arises the improvement of the eye ear etc in distinguishing objects in painting tones in music etc  if the impressions are very strong so as to excite great attention their force is increased  if the impressions are not attended to their force is diminished hence after living for some time near any thing producing a great noise the noise is hardly heard  the power of the will in producing motion may be increased by custom and diminished by disuse  the will in frequently producing a motion may not only have its power increased but it is also capable of producing that motion with greater accuracy and by frequent attempts may acquire a power over a moving part upon which it has naturally little or no influence  a motion may arise from a volition in consequence of custom which was not naturally connected with it as a man in turning in a loom does not will the motion of his hand but of the end of the chizel  quer can a man produce two distinct motions by his will at once or when two distinct motions are produced does the will produce them successively the impression arising from one volition remaining till the mind renews it after having produced the other in the same manner as the impression of a flame making a circular motion remains on the eye so as to give an idea of a complete circle  the power of producing two distinct motions apparently at the same time is greatly increased by custom  from the above circumstances the facility of execution acquired by custom arises  the power of an idea in exciting motion may be increased or diminished by custom  an idea strongly impressed on the mind is for the most part more powerful in exciting a motion than one weakly impressed  the power of an application in impressing an idea may be increased or diminished by custom as is above described and of consequence the power of an idea in exciting motion  supposing the impression on the mind the same if an idea has frequently produced a motion its power is increased on the contrary if in idea has been often excited and if the motion depending upon it has by any means been prevented its power is diminished or lost  the action of an application producing diminishing or altering the mode of contraction of a moving part and which at the same time has no effect on the mind may be increased or diminished by custom  if it be often applied so as always to produce its effect its power or the certainty of its action is for the most part increased  an application of an equal apparent force does not always produce the same effect if the same quantity of ipecacuhan be twice exhibited at the interval of several days it may vomit at the first exhibition and not at the second or it may produce vomiting at the second exhibition and not at the first  in applying medicines which do not act as simple stimuli their particular effect cannot be increased by increasing the dose they being converted into simple stimuli thus small doses of saccharum saturni produce costiveness but a very large dose frequently purges  an application frequently repeated so as to produce its proper effect often becomes more constant and uniform in its action although it may become necessary that it should be applied in a greater degree  if an evacuating medicine be repeatedly exhibited it generally requires a larger dose at the second and some of the subsequent exhibitions to produce the same effect as the first but if these produce the effect the power of the medicine is afterward increased  the more violent the effect of any application the more is its power increased by repetition  if an application be made in so small a degree as not to produce any effect or if its effects are by any means counteracted its power is diminished or lost  the repeated application of some medicines in any circumstance diminishes their powers  all the natural powers of action in the body are increased by frequent exertion  if two or more fibers have been accustomed to contract together either by the action of the will by an idea or by stimuli or if the contraction in one of them be produced by the will while the other is brought into action at the same time by a stimulus the producing of a contraction in the one by an application to it alone will produce a contraction in the other if they be fibers of the same muscle and acted upon by a stimulus this will happen after the communication with the brain by the nerves is cut off but not otherwise  if after this habit is acquired one of these fibers is made to contract frequently while the other is prevented from contracting the habit is lost or destroyed  if any motion or state of the body be repeated at a particular period of time it will often return at that period although no other cause be applied but the habit acquired  a habit may be destroyed by counteracting and preventing its effects  two habits may be so connected that preventing the one from taking place may prevent the effects of the other  custom has also a powerful influence on the mind  exercise rest sleep when a moving part is brought into action by the will an idea or stimulus that action sometimes ceases upon removing the cause sometimes it continues after the cause is removed this last frequently happens in the production of diseases  when it is necessary for the continuation of an action that its cause should be continually or repeatedly applied the original power seems gradually to be exhausted so that the motions for the most part become gradually weaker and at last are not to be produced as in the case of exercise  there are some actions which are necessary for life that are continued by the application of stimuli and nevertheless do not exhaust the original power such as the action of the heart the peristaltic motion of the intestines etc  if these actions are increased beyond their common pitch or beyond what can be allowed by the present strength of the system they also exhaust the original power  a great exertion of the faculties of the mind also exhausts its powers  rest restores both to the body and mind their powers of action  in perfect sleep both the body and mind are at rest excepting in those particulars where an exertion is necessary to life these exertions are in the alternate contractions of the heart and arteries the motion of the muscles in respiration the tone of the muscular fibers blood vessels and other moving parts the action of the lymphatics and excretory ducts the peristaltic motion of the intestines etc  the common exertions of the body and mind when a man is awake exhaust to such a degree as to require that rest which is found in sleep to allow the original power to recruit itself  in sleep the mind is often brought into action sometimes from affections of its own sometimes from affections of the body the body also exerts other powers besides those necessary for life in these cases the original power is less recruited and that in proportion to the exertion  although the original power may be so far exhausted as to require to be recruited by sleep that state may nevertheless be prevented by any thing exciting great attention of the mind by applications to the body producing uneasiness or pain or by an increased action of any of its parts or by any action or contraction which continues after its cause is removed  the same causes may render sleep less perfect although not sufficient to prevent it altogether  although rest is not complete at the beginning of sleep it has a tendency to become so during this state of the body in particular all actions and contractions remaining after their cause has been removed are apt to go off  during sleep the original power appears to be so much accumulated as to give a disposition to action both to the mind and body from the slightest cause and this state of the body goes off of course  at the beginning of sleep the rest is generally less perfect it becomes gradually more so for a certain time afterward when the original power is recruited the mind begins to be put in action and at last the whole system at which time sleep goes off  a continued or strong action of one part of the body may not only exhaust the original power in that part but also in all the others  a great exertion of the powers of the body may exhaust the powers of die mind and e contra a great exertion of the powers of the mind may exhaust those of the body  a frequent exertion of the original power in one part of the body tends to strengthen that part but to weaken the other  an exertion of the original power increases the loss of fluids and renders a greater quantity of food necessary hence animals that require a considerable quantity of nourishment when awake may sleep for several months without any being taken in  a loss of fluids generally increases the powers of digestion excepting when they are disordered by disease  a moderate exertion of the powers of the body in proportion to the present strength powers of digestion food and sleep tends to strengthen the whole body  a violent or continued exertion of the original power if it be not recruited by food and sleep may weaken to that degree as to kill  a repeated exertion of the powers of the mind tends to strengthen its faculties but at the same time to weaken the original power in the body  unless the body be endowed with a certain degree of strength the mind cannot exert itself powerfully  exercise of the powers of the body tends to weaken the mind except so far as is necessary to give the body the proper strength  but a moderate exercise of the body and mind together tends to strengthen the whole system so that by custom the original power in the whole may be increased  finis
