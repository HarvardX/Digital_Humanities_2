 addison     maxims observations and reflections moral political and divine  by mr addison  london printed for e curll in fleet street mdccxix  advertisement since these small extracts maxims etc collected from the writings of dr south and archbishop tillotson are become lately so much in vogue and mr archdeacon echard has spoken so fully of their general use it is only thought proper to assure the reader that these collections are faithfully selected from the writings of that excellent author whose name they bear  sir richard steel has been chiefly my guide in this matter for i have consulted no other guardians but those marked with a hand nor no other spectators but those marked with the letters c l i o those upon miltons paradise lost i have passed over being informed that they are to be speedily published with a new edition of that poem  as for the freeholder i never heard of any competitor and among the tatlers i cannot find any topics that properly fall within the scheme i have proposed  the hurry of the bookseller occasioned as he tells me by the pressing demand of the public has obliged me to divide this collection into two parts i thought i could not better conclude this first part than with that admirable spectator upon the immortality of the soul and the remaining papers from which i design my farther extracts shall follow with all convenient speed

pursuit after it    a check to inordinate desires    a reflection on mortality    upon the immortality of the soul    maxims observations and reflections taken from the guardian methodized and connected conscience a good conscience is to the soul what health is to the body it preserves a constant ease and serenity within us and more than countervails all the calamities and afflictions which can possibly befall us i know nothing so hard for a generous mind to get over as calumny and reproach and cannot find any method of quieting the soul under them besides this single one of our being conscious to our selves that we do not deserve them  religious fear religious fear when it is produced by just apprehensions of a divine power naturally overlooks all human greatness that stands in competition with it and extinguishes every other terror that can settle itself in the heart of man it lessens and contracts the figure of the most exalted person it disarms the tyrant and executioner and represents to our minds the most enraged and the most powerful as altogether harmless and impotent  there is no true fortitude which is not founded upon this fear as there is no other principle of so settled and fixed a nature courage that grows from constitution very often forsakes a man when he has occasion for it and when it is only a kind of instinct in the soul breaks out on all occasions without judgment or discretion that courage which proceeds from the sense of our duty and from the fear of offending him that made us acts always in a uniform manner and according to the dictates of right reason  what can the man fear who takes care in all his actions to please a being that is omnipotent a being who is able to crush all his adversaries a being that can divert any misfortune from befalling him or turn any such misfortune to his advantage the person who lives with this constant and habitual regard to the great superintendant of the world is indeed sure that no real evil can come into his lot blessings may appear under the shape of pains losses and disappointments but let him have patience and he will see them in their proper figures dangers may threaten him but he may rest satisfied that they will either not reach him or that if they do they will be the instruments of good to him in short he may look upon all crosses and accidents sufferings and afflictions as means which are made use of to bring him to happiness this is even the worst of that mans condition whose mind is possessed with the habitual fear of which i am now speaking but it very often happens that those which appear evils in our own eyes appear also as such to him who has human nature under his care in which case they are certainly averted from the person who has made himself by this virtue an object of divine favor  justice there is no virtue so truly great and godlike as justice most of the other virtues are the virtues of created beings or accommodated to our nature as we are men justice is that which is practiced by god himself and to be practiced in its perfection by none but him omniscience and omnipotence are requisite for the full exertion of it the one to discover every degree of uprightness or iniquity in thoughts words and actions the other to measure out and impart suitable rewards and punishments  as to be perfectly just is an attribute in the divine nature to be so to the utmost of our abilities is the glory of a man such an one who has the public administration in his hands acts like the representative of his maker in recompensing the virtuous and punishing the offender  when a nation once loses its regard to justice when they do not look upon it as something venerable holy and inviolable when any of them dare presume to lessen affront or terrify those who have the distribution of it in their hands when a judge is capable of being influenced by any thing but law or a cause may be recommended by any thing that is foreign to its own merits we may venture to pronounce that such a nation is hastening to its ruin  justice discards party friendship kindred and is therefore always represented as blind that we may suppose her thoughts are wholly intent on the equity of a cause without being diverted or prejudiced by objects foreign to it  charity charity is a virtue of the heart and not of the hands says an old writer gifts and alms are the expressions not the essence of this virtue a man may bestow great sums on the poor and indigent without being charitable and may be charitable when he is not able to bestow any thing charity is therefore a habit of good will or benevolence in the soul which disposes us to the love assistance and relief of mankind especially of those who stand in need of it the poor man who has this excellent frame of mind is no less entitled to the reward of this virtue than the man who founds a college  knowledge knowledge is indeed that which next to virtue truly and essentially raises one man above another it finishes one half of the human soul it makes being pleasant to us fills the mind with entertaining views and administers to it a perpetual series of gratifications it gives ease to solitude and gracefulness to retirement it fills a public station with suitable abilities and adds a luster to those who are in the possession of them  learning by which i mean all useful knowledge whether speculative or practical is in popular and mixed governments the natural source of wealth and honor if we look into most of the reigns from the conquest we shall find that the favorites of each reign have been those who have raised themselves the greatest men are generally the growth of that particular age in which they flourish a superior capacity for business and a more extensive knowledge are the steps by which a new man often mounts to favor and outshines the rest of his conemporaries but when men are actually born to titles it is almost impossible that they should fail of receiving an additional greatness if they take care to accomplish themselves for it  nobility we ought in gratitude to honor the posterity of those who have raised either the interest or reputation of their country and by whose labors we ourselves are more happy wise or virtuous than we should have been without them besides naturally speaking a man bids fairer for greatness of soul who is the descendant of worthy ancestors and has good blood in his veins than one who is come of an ignoble and obscure parentage for these reasons i think a man of merit who is derived from an illustrious line is very justly to be regarded more than a man of equal merit who has no claim to hereditary honors nay i think those who are indifferent in themselves and have nothing else to distinguish them but the virtues of their forefathers are to be looked upon with a degree of veneration even upon that account and to be more respected than the common run of men who are of low and vulgar extraction  after having thus ascribed due honors to birth and parentage i must however take notice of those who arrogate to themselves more honors than are due to them on this account the first are such who are not enough sensible that vice and ignorance taint the blood and that an unworthy behavior degrades and disennobles a man in the eye of the world as much as birth and family aggrandize and exalt him  the second are those who believe a new man of an elevated merit is not more to be honored than an insignificant and worthless man who is descended from a long line of patriots and heroes or in other words behold with contempt a person who is such a man as the first founder of their family was upon whose reputation they value themselves  there are some whose quality fits uppermost in all their discourses and behavior an empty man of a great family is a creature that is scarce conversible you read his ancestry in his smile in his air in his eyebrow he has indeed his nobility to give employment to his thoughts rank and precedence are the important points which he is always discussing within himself  to conclude there is nothing more easy than to discover a man whose heart is full of his family weak minds that have imbibed a strong tincture of the nursery younger brothers that have been brought up to nothing superannuated retainers to a great house have generally their thoughts taken up with little else  but on the other hand as the actions of our ancestors and forefathers should excite us to every thing that is great and virtuous so a regard to our posterity and those who are to descend from us ought to have the same kind of influence on a generous mind a noble soul would rather die than commit an action that should make his children blush when he is in the grave and be looked upon as a reproach to those who shall live a hundred years after him on the contrary nothing can be a more pleasing thought to a man of eminence than to consider that his posterity who lie many removes from him shall make their boast of his virtues and be honored for his sake  false gallantry there are a sort of knightserrant in the world who quite contrary to those in romance are perpetually seeking adventures to bring virgins into distress and to ruin innocence when men of rank and figure pass away their lives in these criminal pursuits and practices they ought to consider that they render themselves more vile and despicable than any innocent man can be whatever low station his fortune or birth have placed him in title and ancestry render a good man more illustrious but an ill one more contemptible  i have often wondered that these deflowrers of innocence though dead to all the sentiments of virtue and honor are not restrained by compassion and humanity to bring sorrow confusion and infamy into a family to wound the heart of a tender parent and stain the life of a poor deluded young woman with a dishonor that can never be wiped off are circumstances one would think sufficient to check the most violent passion in a heart which has the least tincture of pity and goodnature would any one purchase the gratification of a moment at so dear a rate and entail a lasting misery on others for such a transient satisfaction to himself nay for a satisfaction that is sure at some time or other to be followed with remorse  of the conduct of families it is a melancholy thing to see a coxcomb at the head of a family he scatters infection through the whole house his wife and children have always their eyes upon him if they have more sense than himself they are out of countenance for him if less they submit their understandings to him and make daily improvements in folly and impertinence i have been very often secretly concerned when i have seen a circle of pretty children cramped in their natural parts and prattling even below themselves while they are talking after a couple of silly parents the dullness of a father often extinguishes a genius in the son or gives such a wrong cast to his mind as it is hard for him ever to wear off in short where the head of a family is weak you hear the repetitions of his insipid pleasantries shallow conceits and topical points of mirth in every member of it his table his fireside his parties of diversion are all of them so many standing scenes of folly  this is one reason why i would the more recommend the improvements of the mind to my female readers that a family may have a double chance for it and if it meets with weakness in one of the heads may have it made up in the other it is indeed an unhappy circumstance in a family where the wife has more knowledge than the husband but it is better it should be so than that there should be no knowledge in the whole house it is highly expedient that at least one of the persons who sits at the helm of affairs should give an example of good sense to those who are under them in these little domestic governments  if folly is of ill consequence in the head of a family vice is much more so as it is of a more pernicious and of a more contagious nature when the master is a profligate the rake runs through the house you hear the sons talking loosely and swearing after their father and see the daughters either familiarized to his discourse or every moment blushing for him  the very footman will be a fine gentleman in his masters way he improves by his tabletalk and repeats in the kitchen what he learns in the parlour invest him with the same title and ornaments and you would scarce know him from his lord he practices the same oaths the same ribaldry the same way of joking  it is therefore of very great concern to a family that the ruler of it should be wise and virtuous the first of these qualifications does not indeed lie within his power but though a man cannot abstain from being weak he may from being vicious it is in his power to give a good example of modesty of temperance of frugality of religion and of all other virtues which though the greatest ornaments of human nature may be put in practice by men of the most ordinary capacities  as wisdom and virtue are the proper qualifications in the master of a house if he is not accomplished in both of them it is much better that he should be deficient in the former than in the latter since the consequences of vice are of an infinitely more dangerous nature than those of folly  the qualifications of a good wife from sir thomas mores latin original may you meet with a wife who is not always stupidly silent nor always prattling nonsense may she be learned if possible or at least capable of being made so a woman thus accomplished will be always drawing sentences and maxims of virtue out of the best authors of antiquity she will be herself in all changes of fortune neither blown up in prosperity nor broken with adversity you will find in her an even cheerful goodhumoured friend and an agreeable companion for life she will infuse knowledge into your children with their milk and from their infancy train them up to wisdom whatever company you are engaged in you will long to be at home and retire with delight from the society of men into the bosom of one who is so dear so knowing and so amiable if she touches her lute or sings to it any of her own compositions her voice will sooth you in your solitudes and sound more sweetly in your ear than that of the nightingale you will waste with pleasure whole days and nights in her conversation and be ever finding out new beauties in her discourse she will keep your mind in perpetual serenity restrain its mirth from being dissolute and prevent its melancholy from being painful  pride there is no passion which steals into the heart more imperceptibly and covers itself under more disguises than pride i have been always wonderfully delighted with that sentence in holy writ pride was not made for man there is not indeed any single view of human nature under its present condition which is not sufficient to extinguish in us all the secret seeds of pride and on the contrary to sink the soul into the lowest state of humility and what the schoolmen call selfannihilation pride was not made for man as he is i a sinful ii an ignorant iii a miserable being there is nothing in his understanding in his will or in his present condition that can tempt any considerate creature to pride or vanity  these three very reasons why he should not be proud are notwithstanding the reasons why he is so were he not a sinful creature he would not be subject to a passion which rises from the depravity of his nature were he not an ignorant creature he would see that he has nothing to be proud of and were not the whole species miserable he would not have those wretched objects of comparison before his eyes which are the occasions of this passion and which make one man value himself more than another  a wise man will be contented that his glory be deferred till such time as he shall be truly glorified when his understanding shall be cleared his will rectified and his happiness assured or in other words when he shall be neither sinful nor ignorant nor miserable  if there be any thing which makes human nature appear ridiculous to beings of superior faculties it must be pride they know so well the vanity of those imaginary perfections that swell the heart of man and of those little supernumerary advantages whether in birth fortune or title which one man enjoys above another that it must certainly very much astonish if it does not very much divert them when they see a mortal puffed up and valuing himself above his neighbors on any of these accounts counts at the same time that he is obnoxious to all the common calamities of the species  industry it has been observed by writers of morality that in order to quicken human industry providence has so contrived it that our daily food is not to be procured without much pains and labor the chase of birds and beasts the several arts of fishing with all the different kinds of agriculture are necessary scenes of business and give employment to the greatest part of mankind if we look into the brute creation we find all its individuals engaged in a painful and laborious way of life to procure a necessary subsistence for themselves or those that grow up under them the preservation of their being is the whole business of it an idle man is therefore a kind of monster in the creation all nature is busy about him every animal he sees reproaches him let such a man who lies as a burden or dead weight upon the species and contributes nothing either to the riches of the commonwealth or to the maintenance of himself and family consider that instinct with which providence has endowed the ant and by which is exhibited an example of industry to rational creatures  the reproach of idleness in comparing together the industry of man with that of other creatures i cannot but observe that notwithstanding we are obliged by duty to keep ourselves in constant employ after the same manner as inferior animals are prompted to it by instinct we fall very short of them in this particular we are here the more inexcusable because there is a greater variety of business to which we may apply ourselves reason opens to us a large field of affairs which other creatures are not capable of beasts of prey and i believe of all other kinds in their natural state of being divide their time between action and rest they are always at work or asleep in short their waking hours are wholly taken up in seeking after their food or in consuming it the human species only to the great reproach of our natures are filled with complaints that the day hangs heavy on them that they do not know what to do with themselves that they are at a loss how to pass away their time with many of the like shameful murmurs which we often find in the mouths of those who are styled reasonable beings how monstrous are such expressions among creatures who have the labors of the mind as well as those of the body to furnish them with proper employments who besides the business of their proper callings and professions can apply themselves to the duties of religion to meditation to the reading of useful books to discourse in a word who may exercise themselves in the unbounded pursuits of knowledge and virtue and every hour of their lives make themselves wiser or better than they were before  i shall conclude with recommending to them the same short selfexamination if every one of them frequently lays his hand upon his heart and considers what he is doing it will check him in all the idle or what is worse the vicious moments of life lift up his mind when it is running on in a series of indifferent actions and encourage him when he is engaged in those which are virtuous and laudable in a word it will very much alleviate that guilt which the best of men have reason to acknowledge in their daily confessions of leaving undone those things which they ought to have done and of doing those things which they ought not to have done  honor every principle that is a motive to good actions ought to be encouraged since men are of so different a make that the same principle does not work equally upon all minds what some men are prompted to by conscience duty or religion which are only different names for the same thing others are prompted to by honor  the sense of honor is of so fine and delicate a nature that it is only to be met with in minds which are naturally noble or in such as have been cultivated by great examples or a refined education  but as nothing is more pernicious than a principle of action when it is misunderstood i shall consider honor with respect to three sorts of men first of all with regard to those who have a right notion of it secondly with regard to those who have a mistaken notion of it and thirdly with regard to those who treat it as chimerical and turn it into ridicule  in the first place true honor though it be a different principle from religion is that which produces the same effects the lines of action though drawn from different parts terminate in the same point religion embraces virtue as it is enjoined by the laws of god honor as it is graceful and ornamental to human nature the religious man fears the man of honor scorns to do an ill action the former considers vice as something that is beneath him the other as something that is offensive to the divine being the one as what is unbecoming the other as what is forbidden thus seneca speaks in the natural and genuine language of a man of honor when he declares that were there no god to see or punish vice he would not commit it because it is of so mean so base and so vile a nature  in the second place we are to consider those who have mistaken notions of honor and these are such as establish any thing to themselves for a point of honor which is contrary either to the laws of god or of their country who think it more honorable to revenge than to forgive an injury who make no scruple of telling a lie but would put any man to death that accuses them of it who are more careful to guard their reputation by their courage than by their virtue true fortitude is indeed so becoming in human nature that he who wants it scarce deserves the name of a man but we find several who so much abuse this notion that they place the whole idea of honor in a kind of brutal courage by which means we have had many among us who have called themselves men of honor that would have been a disgrace to a gibbet in a word the man who sacrifices any duty of a reasonable creature to a prevailing mode or fashion who looks upon any thing as honorable that is displeasing to his maker or destructive to society who thinks himself obliged by this principle to the practice of some virtues and not of others is by no means to be reckoned among true men of honor  in the third place we are to consider those persons who treat this principle as chimerical and turn it into ridicule men who are professedly of no honor are of a more profligate and abandoned nature than even those who are acted by false notions of it as there is more hopes of a heretic than of an atheist these sons of infamy consider honor as a fine imaginary notion that leads astray young unexperienced men and draws them into real mischiefs while they are engaged in the pursuits of a shadow these are generally persons who in shakespeares phrase are worn and hackneyed in the ways of men whose imaginations are grown callous and have lost all those delicate sentiments which are natural to minds that are innocent and undepraved such old battered miscreants ridicule every thing as romantic that comes in competition with their present interest and treat those persons as visionaries who dare stand up in a corrupt age for what has not its immediate reward joined to it the talents interest or experience of such men make them so very often useful in all parties and at all times but whatever wealth and dignities they may arrive at they ought to consider that every one stands as a blot in the annals of his country who arrives at the temple of honor by any other way than through that of virtue  complaisance complaisance renders a superior amiable an equal agreeable and an inferior acceptable it smooths distinction sweetens conversation and makes every one in the company pleased with himself it produces goodnature and mutual benevolence encourages the timorous sooths the turbulent humanizes the fierce and distinguishes a society of civilized persons from a confusion of savages in a word complaisance is a virtue that blends all orders of men together in a friendly intercourse of words and actions and is suited to that equality of human nature which every one ought to consider so far as is consistent with the order and economy of the world  if we could look into the secret anguish and affliction of every mans heart we should often find that more of it arises from little imaginary distresses such as checks frowns contradictions expressions of contempt and what shakespeare in hamlet reckons among other evils under the sun  the poor mans contumely the insolence of office and the spurns that patient merit of the unworthy takes than from the more real pains and calamities of life the only method to remove these imaginary distresses as much as possible out of human life would be the universal practice of such an ingenuous complaisance as i have been here describing which as it is a virtue may be defined to be a constant endeavor to please those whom we converse with so far as we may do it innocently i shall here add that i know nothing so effectual to raise a mans fortune as complaisance which recommends more to the favor of the great than wit knowledge or any other talent whatsoever  political maxims observations and reflections taken from the freeholder of the love which we owe to our country i what one would think should be natural to every man  under a well instituted government is a desire to be happy and a good will toward those who are the instruments of making them so  ii ladies are always of great use to the party they espouse and never fail to win over numbers to it it has been an uncontroverted maxim in all ages that though a husband is sometimes a stubborn sort of a creature a lover is always at the devotion of his mistress  iii as selflove is an instinct planted in us for the good and safety of each particular person the love of our country is impressed on our minds for the happiness and preservation of the community there is no greater sign of a general decay of virtue in a nation than a want of zeal in its inhabitants for the good of their country  iv as the love of ones country is natural to every man any particular nation who by false politics shall endeavor to stifle or restrain it will not be upon a level with others  v all casuists are unanimous in determining that when the good of ones country interferes even with the life of the most beloved relation dearest friend or greatest benefactor it is to be preferred without exception  vi no nation was ever famous for its morals which was not at the same time remarkable for its public spirit and there is no remark more common among the ancient historians than that when the state was corrupted with avarice and luxury it was in danger of being betrayed or sold  the guilt of perjury vii all casuists who have gained any esteem for their learning judgment or morality have unanimously determined that an oath is always to be taken in the sense of that authority which imposes it and that those whose hearts do not concur with their lips in the form of these public protestations or who have any mental reserves or who take an oath against their consciences upon any motive whatsoever or with a design to break it or repent of it are guilty of perjury any of these or the like circumstances instead of alleviating the crime make it more heinous as they are premeditated frauds which it is the chief design of an oath to prevent and the most flagrant instances of insincerity to men and irreverence to their maker for this reason the perjury of a man who takes an oath with an intention to keep it and is afterward seduced to the violation of it though a crime not to be thought of without the greatest horror is yet in some respects not quite so black as the perjury abovementioned it is indeed a very unhappy token of the great corruption of our manners that there should be any so inconsiderate among us as to sacrifice the standing and essential duties of morality to the views of politics and that when the love of our country is acknowledged to be a virtue there should be any occasion to show that perjury is a sin  viii perjury with relation to public oaths has in it all the aggravating circumstances which can attend that crime we take them before the magistrates of public justice are reminded by the ceremony that it is a part of that obedience which we learn from the gospel expressly disavow all evasions and mental reservations whatsoever appeal to almighty god for the integrity of our hearts and only desire him to be our helper as we fulfill the oath we there take in his presence what then must be the success that a man can hope for who turns a rebel after having disclaimed the divine assistance but upon condition of being a faithful and loyal subject he first of all desires that god may help him as he shall keep his oaths and afterward hopes to prosper in an enterprise which is the direct breach of them since therefore perjury by the common sense of mankind the reason of the thing and from the whole tenor of christianity is a crime of so flagitious a nature we cannot be too careful in avoiding every approach toward it  ix in a nation which is tied down by such religious and solemn engagements the peoples loyalty will keep pace with their morality and in proportion as they are sincere christians they will be faithful subjects  x the most fruitful source of falsehood and calumny is that which one would think should be the least able to produce them i mean a pretended concern for the safety of our established religion were people as anxious for the doctrines which are essential to the church of england as they are for the nominal distinction of adhering to its interests they would know that the sincere observation of public oaths allegiance to their king submission to their bishops zeal against popery and abhorrence of rebellion are the great points that adorn the character of the church of england and in which the authors of the reformed religion in this nation have always gloried  xi when a leading man begins to grow apprehensive for the church you may be sure that he is either in danger of losing a place or in despair of getting one it is pleasant on these occasions to see a notorious profligate seized with a concern for his religion and converting his spleen into zeal  xii partyfictions are the proper subjects of mirth and laughter their deluded believers are only to be treated with pity or contempt but as for those incendiaries of figure and distinction who are the inventors and publishers of such gross falsehoods and calumnies they cannot be regarded by others but with the utmost detestation and abhorrence nor one would think by themselves without the greatest remorse and compunction of heart when they consider that in order to give a spirit to a desperate cause they have by their false and treacherous insinuations and reports betrayed so many of their friends into their own destruction  xiii the people are made to believe that passiveobedience and nonresistance unlimited power and indefeasible right have something of a venerable and religious meaning in them whereas in reality they only imply that the king has a right to be a tyrant and that his subjects are obliged in conscience to be slaves  the guilt of rebellion xiv rebellion is a violation of all those engagements which every government exacts from such persons as live under it and consequently the most base and pernicious instance of treachery and perfidiousness  xv when in the division of parties men only strive for the first place in the princes favor when all are attached to the same form of government and contend only for the highest offices in it a prudent and an honest man may look upon the struggle with indifference and be in no great pain for the success of either side  xvi men who have any natural love to their country or sense of their duty should exert their united strength in a cause that is common to all parties in such a case an avowed indifference is treachery to our fellow subjects and a lukewarm allegiance may prove as pernicious in its consequences as treason  how ministers of state should bear an undeserved reproach xvii a statesman who is possessed of real merit should look upon his political censurers with the same neglect that a good writer regards his critics who are generally a race of men that are not able to discover the beauties of a work they examine and deny that approbation to others which they never met with themselves patriots therefore should rather rejoice in the success of their designs than be mortified by those who misrepresent them and consider that not only envy but vanity has a share in the detraction of their adversaries  xviii publickministers would likewise do well to consider that the principal authors of such reproaches as are cast upon them are those who have a mind to get their places and as for censure arising from this motive it is in their power to escape it when they please and turn it upon their competitors  xix malcontents of an inferior character are acted by the same principle for so long as there are employments of all sizes there will be murmurers of all degrees  xx i have heard of a country gentleman who made a very long and melancholy complaint to the late duke of buckingham when he was in great power at court of several public grievances the duke after having given him a very patient hearing my dear friend says he this is but too true but i have thought of an expedient which will set all things right and that very soon his country friend asked him what it was you must know says the duke there is a place of five hundred pounds a year fallen this very morning which i intend to put you in possession of the gentleman thanked his grace went away satisfied and thought the nation the happiest under heaven during that whole ministry  xxi a virtuous man who lays out his endeavors for the good of his country should never be troubled at the reports which are made of him so long as he is conscious of his own integrity he should rather be pleased to find people descanting upon his actions because when they are thoroughly canvassed and examined they are sure in the end to turn to his honor and advantage the reasonable and unprejudiced part of mankind will be of his side and rejoice to see their common interest lodged in such honest hands  xxii a strict examination of a great mans character is like the trial of a suspected chastity which was made among the jews by the waters of jealousy moses assures us that the criminal burst upon the drinking of them but if she was accused wrongfully the rabbis tell us they heightened her charms and made her much more amiable than before so that they destroyed the guilty but beautified the innocent  xxiii the political faith of a malecontent is altogether founded on hope he does not give credit to any thing because it is probable but because it is pleasing his wishes serve him instead of reasons to confirm the truth of what he hears there is no report so incredible or contradictory in itself which he does not cheerfully believe if it tends to the advancement of the cause  xxiv a malecontent who is a good believer has generally reason to repeat the celebrated rant of an ancient father credo quia impossible est i e it must be true because it is impossible  xxv it has been very well observed that the most credulous man in the world is the atheist who believes the universe to be the production of chance in the same manner a malecontent who is the greatest believer in what is improbable is the greatest infidel in what is certain  xxvi king charles the second when he was at windsor used to amuse himself with the conversation of the famous vossius who was full of stories relating to the antiquity learning and manners of the chinese and at the same time a freethinker in points of religion the king upon hearing him repeat some incredible accounts of these eastern people turning to those who were about him this learned divine said he is a very strange man he believes every thing but the bible  xxvii when you cannot refute an adversary the shortest way is to libel him and to endeavor at the making his person odious when you cannot represent his notions as absurd  xxviii as adversity makes a man wise in his private affairs civil calamities give him prudence and circumspection in his public conduct  xxix the miseries of the civil war under the reign of king charles the first and the consequences which ensued upon them did for many years deter the inhabitants of our island from the thoughts of engaging anew in such desperate undertakings and convinced them by fatal experience that nothing could be so pernicious to the english and so opposite to the genius of the people as the subversion of monarchy  xxx an army of trumpeters would give as great a strength to a cause as a confederacy of tonguewarriours who like those military musicians content themselves with animating their friends to battle and run out of the engagement upon the first onset  xxxi nothing can be more contemptible and insignificant than the scum of a people when they are instigated against a king who is supported by the two branches of the legislature a mob may pull down a meeting house but will never be able to overturn a government  of the practice of morality xxxii common sense as well as the experience of all ages teaches us that no government can flourish which does not encourage and propagate religion and morality among all its particular members  xxxiii justice temperance humility and almost every other moral virtue do not only derive the blessings of providence upon those who exercise them but are the natural means for acquiring the public prosperity  xxxiv religious motives and instincts are so busy in the heart of every reasonable creature that a man who would hope to govern a society without any regard to these principles is as much to be contemned for his folly as to be detested for his impiety  xxxv the world is never sunk into such a state of degeneracy but they pay a natural veneration to men of virtue and rejoice to see themselves conducted by those who act under the awe of a supreme being and who think themselves accountable for all their proceedings to the great judge and superintendant of human affairs  xxxvi prejudice and selfsufficiency naturally proceed from inexperience of the world and ignorance of mankind  xxxvii as it requires but very small abilities to discover the imperfections of another we find that none are more apt to turn their neighbors into ridicule than those who are the most ridiculous in their own private conduct  xxxviii punishments are necessary to show there is justice in a government and pardons to show there is mercy and both together convince the people that under a good administration there is not only a difference made between the guilty and the innocent but even among the guilty between such as are more or less criminal  xxxix it was a famous saying of william rufus and is quoted to his honor by historians whosoever spares perjured men robbers plunderers and traitors deprives all good men of their peace and quietness and lays a foundation of innumerable mischiefs to the virtuous and innocent  xl mercy in the true sense of the word is that virtue by which a prince approaches nearest to him whom he represents and whilst he is neither remiss nor extreme to animadvert upon those who offend him that logic will hold true of him which is applied to the great judge of all the earth with thee there is mercy therefore shall thou be feared  the absurdity of a party spirit xli we seem to have such a relish for faction as to have lost that of wit and are so used to the bitterness of party rage that we cannot be gratified with the highest entertainment that has not this kind of seasoning in it but as no work must expect to live long which draws all its beauty from the color of the times so neither can that pleasure be of greater continuance which arises from the prejudice or malice of its hearers  xlii since the present hatred and violence of parties is so unspeakably pernicious to the community and none can do a better service to their country than those who use their utmost endeavors to extinguish it we may reasonably hope that the more elegant part of the nation will give a good example to the rest and put an end to so absurd and foolish a practice which makes our most refined diversions detrimental to the public and in a particular manner destructive of all politeness  xliii it were happy for us could we prevail upon our selves to imagine that one who differs from us in opinion may possibly be an honest man and that we might do the same justice to one another which will be done us hereafter by those who shall make their appearance in the world when this generation is no more  the inconsistence of a popish prince and protestant subjects xliv among all the paradoxes in politics which have been advanced by some among us there is none so absurd and shocking to the most ordinary understanding as that it is possible for great britain to be quietly governed by a popish sovereign  xlv we are convinced by the experience of our own times that our constitution is not able to bear a popish prince at the head of it if any of our english monarchs might have hoped to reign quietly under such circumstances it would have been king charles the second who was received with all the joy and good will that are natural to a people newly rescued from a tyranny which had long oppressed them in several shapes but this monarch was too wise to own himself a roman catholic even in that juncture of time or to imagine it practicable for an avowed popish prince to govern a protestant people his brother king james the second tried that experiment and though he was endowed with many royal virtues and might have made a nation of roman catholics happy under his administration yet the grievances we suffered in his reign proceeded purely from his religion and they were such as made the whole body of the nobility clergy and commonalty rise up as one man against him and oblige him to quit the throne of his ancestors  xlvi we have only the vices of a protesttant prince to fear and may be made happy by his virtues but in a popish prince we have no chance for our prosperity his very piety obliges him to our destruction and in proportion as he is more religious he becomes more insupportable  xlvii can we imagine that our british clergy would be quiet under a prince who is zealous for his religion and obliged by it to subvert those doctrines which it is their duty to defend and propagate nay would any of those men themselves who are the champions for a popish successor unless such of them as are professed roman catholics or disposed to be so live quiet under a government which at the best would make use of all indirect methods in favor of a religion that is inconsistent with our laws and liberties and would impose on us such a yoke as neither we nor our fathers were able to bear all the quiet that could be expected from such a reign must be the result of absolute power on the one hand and a despicable slavery on the other and i believe every reasonable man will be of the roman historians opinion that a disturbed liberty is better than a quiet servitude  xlviii there is not indeed a greater absurdity than to imagine the quiet of a nation can arise from an establishment in which the king would be of one communion and the people of another especially when the religion of the sovereign carries in it the utmost malignity to that of the subject what harmony and correspondence can be expected between them when they cannot join together in the most joyful the most solemn and most laudable action of reasonable creatures in a word where the prince considers his people as heretics and the people look upon their prince as an idolater  of the decay of piety xlix it is a melancholy reflection that our country which in times of popery was called the nation of saints should now have less appearance of religion in it than any other neighboring state or kingdom whether they be such as continue still immersed in the errors of the church of rome or such as are recovered out of them  l it was formerly thought dangerous for a young man to travel lest he should return an atheist to his native country but at present it is certain that an englishman who has any tolerable degree of reflection cannot be better awakened to a sense of religion in general than by observing how the minds of all mankind are set upon this important point how every nation is serious and attentive to the great business of their being and that in other countries a man is not out of the fashion who is bold and open in the profession and practice of all christian duties  li this decay of piety is by no means to be imputed to the reformation which in its first establishment produced its proper fruits and distinguished the whole age with shining instances of virtue and morality if we would trace out the original of that flagrant and avowed impiety which has prevailed among us for some years we should find that it owes its rise to that opposite extreme of cant and hypocrisy which had taken possession of the peoples minds in the times of the great rebellion and of the usurpation that succeeded it the practices of these men under the covert of a feigned zeal made even the appearances of sincere devotion ridiculous and unpopular  lii the raillery of the wits and courtiers in king charles the seconds reign upon every thing which they then called precise was carried to so great an extravagance that it almost put christianity out of countenance the ridicule grew so strong and licentious that from this time we may date that remarkable turn in the behavior of our fashionable englishmen that makes them shamefaced in the exercises of those duties which they were sent into the world to perform  the character of a stateswoman liii it is the ambition of the male part of the world to make themselves esteemed and of the female to make themselves beloved there is nothing which makes the fair sex more unamiable than partyrage the finest woman in a transport of fury loses the use of her face instead of charming her beholders she frights both friend and foe the latter can never be smitten by so bitter an enemy nor the former captivated by a nymph who upon occasion can be so very angry the most endearing of our beautiful fellow subjects are those whose minds are the least imbittered with the passions and prejudices of either side and who discover the native sweetness of the sex in every part of their conversation and behavior a lovely woman who thus flourishes in her innocence and good humor amidst that mutual spite and rancour which prevails among her exasperated sisterhood appears more amiable by the singularity of her character and may be compared with solomons bride to a lilly among thorns  live a stateswoman is as ridiculous a creature as a cotquean each of the sexes should keep within its particular bounds and content themselves to excel within their respective districts when venus complained to jupiter of the wound which she had received in battle the father of the gods smiled upon her and put her in mind that instead of mixing in a war which was not her business she should have been officiating in her proper ministry and carrying on the delights of marriage the delicacy of several modern critics has been offended with homers billingsgate warriors but a scolding hero is at the worst a more tolerable character than a bully in petticoats to which we may add that the keenest satyrist among the ancients looked upon nothing as a more proper subject of raillery and invective than a female gladiator  britons freethinkers in politics lv there is scarce any man in england of what denomination soever that is not a freethinker in politics and has not some particular notions of his own by which he distinguishes himself from the rest of the community almost every age profession and sex among us has its favorite set of ministers and scheme of government  lvi our children are initiated into factions before they know their right hand from their left they no sooner begin to speak but whig and tory are the first words they learn they are taught in their infancy to hate one half of the nation and contract all the virulence and passion of a party before they come to the use of their reason  lvii as for our nobility they are politicians by birth and though the commons of the nation delegate their power in the community to certain representatives every one reserves to himself a private jurisdiction or privilege of censuring their conduct and rectifying the legislature  lviii there is scarce a freshman in either university who is not able to mend the constitution in several particulars we see squires and yeomen coming up to town every day so full of politics that to use the thought of an ingenious gentleman we are frequently put in mind of roman dictators who were called from the plough you can scarce see a bench of porters without two or three casuists in it that will settle you the right of princes and state the bounds of the civil and ecclesiastical power in the drinking of a pot of ale what is more usual than on a rejoicing night to meet with a drunken cobbler bawling out for the church and perhaps knocked down a little after by an enemy in his own profession who is a lover of moderation  lix in short there is hardly a female in this our metropolis who is not a competent judge of our highest controversies in church and state we have several oysterwomen that hold the unlawfulness of episcopacy and cinderwenches that are great sticklers for indefeasible right  the preference of the whigscheme to that of the tories lx the tories tell us that the whigscheme would end in presbyterianism and a commonwealth the whigs tell us on the other side that the toryscheme would terminate in popery and arbitrary governments were these reproaches mutually true which would be most preferable to any man of commonsense presbyterianism and a republican form of government or popery and tyranny both extremes are indeed dreadful but not equally so both to be regarded with the utmost aversion by the friends of our constitution and lovers of our country but if one of them were inevitable who would not rather choose to live under a state of excessive liberty than of slavery and not prefer a religion that differs from our own in the circumstantials before one that differs from it in the essentials of christianity  lxi i would recommend to our malcontents the advice given by a great moralist to his friend upon another occasion that he would show it was in the power of wisdom to compose his passions and let that be the work of reason which would certainly be the effect of time  characters of the royal family his majestys character we have the pleasure at this time to see a king upon the throne who has too much goodness to wish for any power that does not enable him to promote the welfare of his subjects and too much wisdom to look upon those as his friends who would make their court to him by the profession of an obedience which they never practiced and which has always proved fatal to those princes who have put it to the trial his majesty gave a proof of his sovereign virtues before he came to the exercise of them in this kingdom his inclination to justice led him to rule his german subjects in the same manner that our constitution directs him to govern the english he regarded those which are our civil liberties as the natural rights of mankind and therefore indulged them to a people who pleaded no other claim to them than his known goodness and humanity this experience of a good prince before we had the happiness to enjoy him must give great satisfaction to every thinking man who considers how apt sovereignty is to deprave human nature and how many of our own princes made very ill figures upon the throne who before they ascended it were the favorites of the people  what gives us the greatest security in the conduct of so excellent a prince is that consistency of behavior whereby he inflexibly pursues those measures which appear the most just and equitable as he has the character of being the most prudent in laying proper schemes he is no less remarkable for being steady in accomplishing what he has once concerted indeed if we look into the history of his present majesty and reflect upon that wonderful series of successes which have attended him i think they cannot be ascribed to any thing so much as to this uniformity and firmness of mind which has always discovered itself in his proceedings it was by this that he surmounted those many difficulties which lay in the way to his succession and by which we have reason to hope he will daily make all opposition fall before him the fickle and unsteady politics of our late british monarchs have been the perpetual source of those dissensions and animosities which have made the nation unhappy whereas the constant and unshaken temper of his present majesty must have a natural tendency to the peace of his government and the unanimity of his people  whilst i am enumerating the public virtues of our sovereign which are so conducive to the advantage of those who are to obey him i cannot but take notice that his majesty was bred up from his infancy with a love to this our nation under a princess who was the most accomplished woman of her age and particularly famous for her affection to the english our countrymen were dear to him before there was any prospect of their being his subjects and every one knows that nothing recommended a man so much to the distinguishing civilities of his court as the being born in great britain  to the fame of his majestys civil virtues we may add the reputation he has acquired by his martial achievements it is observed by sir william temple that the english are particularly fond of a king who is valiant upon which account his majesty has a title to all the esteem that can be paid the most warlike prince though at the same time for the good of his subjects he studies to decline all occasions of military glory and chooses rather to be distinguished as a father than as the captain of his people i am glad his rebellious subjects are too inconsiderable to put him upon exerting that courage and conduct which raised him so great a reputation in hungary and the morea when he fought against the enemies of christianity and in germany and flanders where he commanded against the great disturber of the peace of europe one would think there was reason for the opinion of those who make personal courage to be an hereditary virtue when we see so many instances of it in the line of brunswick to go no farther back than the time of our present king where can we find among the sovereign houses of europe any other family that has furnished so many persons of distinguished fortitude three of his majestys brothers have fallen gloriously in the field fighting against the enemies of their native country and the bravery of his royal highness the prince of wales is still fresh in our memory who fought with the spirit of his father at the battle of andenarde when the children of france and the pretender fled before him  his love and regard for our constitution is so remarkable that as we are told by those whose office it is to lay the business of the nation before him it is his first question upon any matter of the least doubt or difficulty whether it be in every point according to the laws of the land he is easy of access to those who desire it and is so gracious in his behavior and condescension on such occasions that none of his subjects retire from his presence without the greatest idea of his wisdom and goodness his continued application to such public affairs as may conduce to the benefit of his kingdoms diverts him from those pleasures and entertainments which may be indulged by persons in a lower station and are pursued with eagerness by princes who have not the care of the public so much at heart the least return which we can make to such a sovereign is that tribute which is always paid by honest men and is always acceptable to great minds the praise and approbation that are due to a virtuous and noble character common decency forbids opprobrious language even to a bad prince and common justice will exact from us toward a good prince the same benevolence and humanity with which he treats his subjects those who are influenced by duty and gratitude will rise much higher in all the expressions of affection and respect and think they can never do too much to advance the glory of a sovereign who takes so much pains to advance their happiness  when we have a king who has gained the reputation of the most unblemished probity and honor and has been famed through the whole course of his life for an inviolable adherence to his promises we may acquiesce after his many solemn declarations in all those measures which it is impossible for us to judge rightly of unless we were let into such schemes of council and intelligence as produce them and therefore we should rather turn our thoughts upon the reasonableness of his proceedings than busy ourselves to form objections against them the consideration of his majestys character should at all times suppress our censure of his conduct and since we have never yet seen or heard of any false steps in his behavior we ought in justice to think that he governs himself by his usual rules of wisdom and honor till we discover something to the contrary  these considerations ought to reconcile to his majesty the hearts and tongues of all his people but as for those who are obstinate irreclaimable professed enemies to our present establishment we must expect their calumnies will not only continue but rise against him in proportion as he pursues such measures as are likely to prove successful and ought to recommend him to his people  having thus far considered our happiness in his majestys civil and military character i cannot forbear pleasing my self with regarding him in the view of one who has been always fortunate cicero recommends pompey under this particular head to the romans with whom the character of being fortunate was so popular that several of their emperors gave it a place among their titles good fortune is often the reward of virtue and as often the effect of prudence and whether it proceeds from either of these or from both together or whatever may be the cause of it every one is naturally pleased to see his interests conducted by a person who is used to good success the establishment of the electoral dignity in his majestys family was a work reserved for him finally to accomplish a large accession of dominion fell to him by his succeeding to the dukedom of zell whereby he became one of the greatest princes of germany and one of the most powerful persons that ever stood next heir to the throne of great britain the duchy of bremen and the bishopric of osnaburg have considerably strengthened his interests in the empire and given a great additional weight to the protestant cause but the most remarkable interpositions of providence in favor of him have appeared in removing those seemingly invincible obstacles to his succession in taking away at so critical a juncture the person who might have proved a dangerous enemy in confounding the secret and open attempts of his traitorous subjects and in giving him the delightful prospect of transmitting his power through a numerous and stillincreasing progeny  upon the whole it is not to be doubted but every wise and honest subject will concur with providence in promoting the glory and happiness of his present majesty who is endowed with all those royal virtues that will naturally secure to us the national blessings which ought to be dear and valuable to a free people  the princesss character when this excellent princess was yet in her fathers court she was so celebrated for the beauty of her person and the accomplishments of her mind that there was no prince in the empire who had room for such an alliance that was not ambitious of gaining her into his family either as a daughter or as a consort he who is now the chief of the crowned heads in europe and was then king of spain and heir to all the dominions of the house of austria sought her in marriage could her mind have been captivated with the glories of this world she had them all laid before her but she generously declined them because she saw the acceptance of them was inconsistent with what she esteems more than all the glories of this world the enjoyment of her religon providence however kept in store a reward for such an exalted virtue and by the methods of its wisdom opened a way for her to become the greatest of her sex among those who profess that faith to which she adhered with so much christian magnanimity  this her illustrious conduct might in the eye of the world have lost its merit had so accomplished a prince as his royal highness declared his passion for the same alliance at that time it would then have been no wonder that all other proposals had been rejected but it was the fame of this heroic constancy that determined his royal highness to desire in marriage a princess whose personal charms which had been before so universally admired were now become the least part of her character we of the british nation have reason to rejoice that such a proposal was made and accepted and that her royal highness with regard to these two successive treaties of marriage showed as much prudence in her compliance with the one as piety in her refusal of the other  the princess was no sooner arrived at hanover than she improved the luster of that court which was before reckoned among the politest in europe and increased the satisfaction of that people who were before looked upon as the happiest in the empire she immediately became the darling of the princess sophia who was acknowledged in all the courts of europe the most acomplished woman of the age in which she lived and who was not a little pleased with the conversation of one in whom she saw so lively an image of her own youth  but i shall insist no longer on that reputation which her royal highness has acquired in other countries we daily discover those admirable qualities for which she is so justly famed and rejoice to see them exerted in our own country where we ourselves are made happy by their influence we are the more pleased to behold the throne of these kingdoms surrounded by a numerous and beautiful progeny when we consider the virtues of those from whom they descend not only the features but the mind of the parent is often copied out in the offspring but the princess we are speaking of takes the surest method of making her royal issue like herself by instilling early into their minds all the principles of religion virtue and honor and seasoning their tender years with all that knowledge which they are capable of receiving what may we not hope from such an uncommon care in the education of the children of great britain who are directed by such precepts and will be formed by such an example  the conjugal virtues are so remarkable in her royal highness as to deserve those just and generous returns of love and tenderness for which the prince her husband is so universally celebrated  but there is no part of her royal highnesss character which we observe with greater pleasure than that behavior by which she has so much endeared herself to his majesty though indeed we have no reason to be surprised at this mutual intercourse of duty and affection when we consider so wise and virtuous a princess possessing in the same sacred person the kindest of fathers and the best of kings and here it is natural for us to congratulate our own good fortune who see our sovereign blessed with a numerous issue among whom are heirs male in two direct descents which has not happened in the reign of any english king since the time of his majestys great ancestor edward iii and is a felicity not enjoyed by the subjects of any other of the kings of europe who are his contemporaries we are like men entertained with the view of a spacious land skip where the eye passes over one pleasing prospect into another till the sight is lost by degrees in a succession of delightful objects and leaves us in the persuasion that there remain still more behind  but if we regard her royal highness in that light which diffuses the greatest glory round a human character we shall find the christian no less conspicuous than the princess she is as eminent for a sincere piety in the practice of religion as for an inviolable adherence to its principles she is constant in her attendance on the daily offices of our church and by her serious and devout comportment on these solemn occasions gives an example that is very often too much wanted in courts  her religion is equally free from the weakness of superstition and the sourness of enthusiasm it is not of that uncomfortable melancholy nature which disappoints its own end by appearing unamiable to those whom it would gain to its interests it discovers itself in the genuine effects of christianity in affability compassion benevolence evenness of mind and all the offices of an active and universal charity  as a cheerful temper is the necessary result of these virtues so it shines out in all the parts of her conversation and dissipates those apprehensions which naturally hang on the timorous or the modest when they are admitted to the honor of her presence there is none that does not listen with pleasure to a person in so high a station who condescends to make herself thus agreeable by mirth without levity and wit without ill nature  her royal highness is indeed possessed of all those talents which make conversation either delightful or improing as she has a fine taste of the elegant arts and is skilled in several modern languages her discourse is not confined to the ordinary subjects or forms of conversation but can adapt itself with an uncommon grace to every occasion and entertain the politest persons of different nations i need not mention what is observed by every one that agreeable turn which appears in her sentiments upon the most ordinary affairs of life and which is so suitable to the delicacy of her sex the politeness of her education and the splendour of her quality  maxims observations and reflections taken from the spectator the good mans security against the fear of death the horror with which we entertain the thoughts of death or indeed of any future evil and the uncertainty of its approach fill a melancholy mind with innumerable apprehensions and suspicions and consequently dispose it to the observation of many groundless prodigies and predictions for as it is the chief concern of wise men to retrench the evils of life by the reasonings of philosophy it is the employment of fools to multiply them by the sentiments of superstition  there is but one way of fortifying the soul against these gloomy presages and terrors of mind and that is by securing to ourselves the friendship and and protection of that being who disposes of events and governs futurity he sees at one view the whole thread of our existence not only that part of it which we have already passed through but that which runs forward into all the depths of eternity when we lay us down to sleep let us recommend ourselves to his care when we awake let us give up ourselves to his direction amidst all the evils that threaten us let us look up to him for help and question not but he will either avert them or turn them to our advantage though we know neither the time nor the manner of the death we are to die we need not be at all solicitous about it because we are sure that he knows them both and that he will not fail to comfort and support us under them  true happiness true happiness is of a retired nature and an enemy to pomp and noise it arises in the first place from the enjoyment of ones self and in the next from the friendship and conversation of a few select companions it loves shades and solitude and naturally haunts groves and fountains fields and meadows in short it feels every thing it wants within itself and receives no addition from multitudes of witnesses and spectators on the contrary false happiness loves to be in a crowd and to draw the eyes of the world upon her she does not receive any satisfaction from the applauses which she gives herself but from the admiration she raises in others she flourishes in courts and palaces theaters and assemblees and has no existence but when she is looked upon  calumny or the danger of satire there is nothing that more betrays a base and ungenerous spirit than the giving of secret stabs to a mans reputation lampoons and satires that are written with wit and spirit are like poisoned darts which not only inflict a wound but make it incurable for this reason i am very much troubled when i see the talents of humor and ridicule in the possession of an illnatured man there cannot be a greater gratification to a barbarous and inhuman wit than to stir up sorrow in the heart of a private person to raise uneasiness among near relations and to expose whole families to derision at the same time that he remains unseen and undiscovered if besides the accomplishments of being witty and illnatured a man is vicious into the bargain he is one of the most mischievous creatures that can enter into a civil society his satire will then chiefly fall upon those who ought to be the most exempt from it virtue merit and every thing that is praiseworthy will be made the subject of ridicule and buffoonry it is impossible to enumerate the evils which arise from these arrows that fly in the dark and i know no other excuse that is or can be made for them than that the wounds they give are only imaginary and produce nothing more than a secret shame and sorrow in the mind of the suffering person it must indeed be confessed that a lampoon or a satire do not carry in them robbery or murder but at the same time how many are there that would not rather lose a considerable sum of money or even life itself than be set up as a mark of infamy and derision and in this case a man should consider that an injury is not to be measured by the notions of him that gives but of him that receives it  those who can put the best countenance upon outrages of this nature which are offered them are not without their secret anguish for my own part i would never trust a man that i thought was capable of giving these secret wounds and cannot but think that he would hurt the person whose reputation he thus assaults in his body or in his fortune could he do it with the same security there is indeed something very barbarous and inhuman in the ordinary scribblers of lampoons an innocent young lady shall be exposed for an unhappy feature a father of a family turned to ridicule for some domestic calamity a wife be made uneasy all her life for a misinterpreted word or action nay a good a temperate and a just man shall be put out of countenance by the representation of those qualities that should do him honor so pernicious a thing is wit when it is not tempered with virtue and humanity i have indeed heard of heedless inconsiderate writers that without any malice have sacrificed the reputation of their friends and acquaintance to a certain levity of temper and a silly ambition of distinguishing themselves by a spirit of raillery and satire as if it were not infinitely more honorable to be a goodnatured man than a wit where there is this little petulant humor in an author he is often very mischievous without designing to be so for which reason i always lay it down as a rule that an indiscreet man is more hurtful than an illnatured one for as the former will only attack those he wishes well to the other injures indifferently both friends and foes  the dignity and excellency of tragedy as a perfect tragedy is the noblest production of human nature so it is capable of giving the mind one of the most delightful and most improving entertainments a virtuous man says seneca struggling with misfortunes is such a spectacle as gods might look upon with pleasure and such pleasure it is which one meets with in the representation of a wellwritten tragedy diversions of this kind wear out of our thoughts every thing that is mean and little they cherish and cultivate that humanity which is the ornament of our nature they soften insolence sooth affliction and subdue the mind to the dispensations of providence  avarice and luxury when a government flourishes in conquests and is secure from foreign attacks it naturally falls into all the pleasures of luxury and as these pleasures are very expensive they put those who are addicted to them upon raising fresh supplies of money by all the methods of rapaciousness and corruption so that avarice and luxury very often become one complicated principle of action in those whose hearts are wholly set upon ease magnificence and pleasure  the most elegant and correct of all the latin historians observes that in his time when the most formidable states of the world were subdued by the romans the republic sunk into those two vices of a quite different nature luxury and avarice and accordingly describes catiline as one who coveted the wealth of other men at the same time that he squandered away his own this observation on the commonwealth when it was in its height of power and riches holds good of all governments that are settled in a state of ease and prosperity at such times men naturally endeavor to outshine one another in pomp and splendour and having no fears to alarm them indulge themselves in the enjoyment of all the pleasures they can get into their possession which naturally produces avarice and an immoderate pursuit after wealth and riches  of fame and the pursuit after it it is very strange to consider that a creature like man who is sensible of so many weaknesses and imperfections should be actuated by a love of fame that vice and ignorance imperfection and misery should contend for praise and endeavor as much as possible to make themselves objects of admiration  but notwithstanding mans essential perfection is but very little his comparative perfection may be very considerable if he looks upon himself in an abstracted light he has not much to boast of but if he considers himself with regard to others he may find occasion of glorying if not in his own virtues at least in the absence of anothers imperfections this gives a different turn to the reflections of the wise man and the fool the first endeavors to shine in himself and the last to outshine others the first is humbled by the sense of his own infirmities the last is lifted up by the discovery of those which he observes in other men the wise man considers what he wants and the fool what he abounds in the wise man is happy when he gains his own approbation and the fool when he recommends himself to the applause of those about him  but however unreasonable and absurd this passion for admiration may appear in such a creature as man it is not wholly to be discouraged since it often produces very good effects not only as it restrains him from doing any thing which is mean and contemptible but as it pushes him to actions which are great and glorious the principle may be defective or faulty but the consequences it produces are so good that for the benefit of mankind it ought not to be extinguished  a check to inordinate desires there is not in my opinion a consideration more effectual to extinguish inordinate desires in the soul of man than the notions of plato and his followers upon that subject they tell us that every passion which has been contracted by the soul during her residence in the body remains with her in a separate state and that the soul in the body or out of the body differs no more than the man does from himself when he is in his house or in open air when therefore the obscene passions in particular have once taken root and spread themselves in the soul they cleave to her inseparably and remain in her for ever after the body is cast off and thrown aside as an argument to confirm this their doctrine they observe that a lewd youth who goes on in a continued course of voluptuousness advances by degrees into a libidinous old man and that the passion survives in the mind when it is altogether dead in the body nay that the desire grows more violent and like all other habits gathers strength by age at the same time that it has no power of executing its own purposes if say they the soul is the most subject to these passions at a time when it has the least instigation from the body we may well suppose she will still retain them when she is entirely divested of it the very substance of the soul is festered with them the gangrene is gone too far to be ever cured the inflammation will rage to all eternity  in this therefore say the platonists consists the punishment of a voluptuous man after death he is tormented with desires which it is impossible for him to gratify solicited by a passion that has neither objects nor organs adapted to it he lives in a state of invincible desire and impotence and always burns in the pursuit of what he always despairs to possess it is for this reason says plato that the souls of the dead appear frequently in coemiteries and hover about the places where their bodies are buried as still hankering after their old brutal pleasures and desiring again to enter the body that gave them an opportunity of fulfilling them  a reflection on mortality when i look upon the tombs of the great every emotion of envy dies in me when i read the epitaphs of the beautiful every inordinate desire goes out when i meet with the grief of parents upon a tombstone my heart melts with compassion when i see the tomb of the parents themselves i consider the vanity of grieving for those whom we must quickly follow when i see kings lying by those who deposed them when i consider rivalwits placed side by side or the holy men that divided the world with their contests and disputes i reflect with sorrow and astonishment on the little competitions factions and debates of mankind when i read the several dates of the tombs in westminsterabbey  of some that died yesterday and some six hundred years ago i consider that great day when we shall all of us be contemporaries and make our appearance together  upon the immortality of the soul i am now led into a subject upon which i always meditate with great delight i mean the immortality of the soul when i run over in my mind the several arguments that established this great point which is the basis of morality and the source of all the pleasing hopes and secret joys that can arise in the heart of a reasonable creature i consider those several proofs drawn  first from the nature of the soul itself and particularly its immateriality which though not absolutely necessary to the eternity of its duration has i think been evinced to almost a demonstration  secondly from its passions and sentiments as particularly from its love of existence its horror of annihilation and its hopes of immortality with that secret satisfaction which it finds in the practice of virtue and that uneasiness which follows in it upon the commission of vice  thirdly from the nature of the supreme being whose justice goodness wisdom and veracity are all concerned in this great point  but among these and other excellent arguments for the immortality of the soul there is one drawn from the perpetual progress of the soul to its perfection without a possibility of ever arriving at it which is a hint that i do not remember to have seen opened and improved by others who have written on this subject though it seems to me to carry a great weight with it how can it enter into the thoughts of man that the soul which is capable of such immense perfections and of receiving new improvements to all eternity shall fall away into nothing almost as soon as it is created are such abilities made for no purpose a brute arrives at a point of perfection that he can never pass in a few years he has all the endowments he is capable of and were he to live ten thousand more would be the same thing he is at present were a human soul thus at a stand in her accomplishments were her faculties to be full blown and incapable of farther enlargements i could imagine it might fall away insensibly and drop at once into a state of annihilation but can we believe a thinking being that is in a perpetual progress of improvements and traveling on from perfection to perfection after having just looked abroad into the works of its creator and made a few discoveries of his infinite goodness wisdom and power must perish at her first setting out and in the very beginning of her enquiries  a man considered in his present state seems only sent into the world to propagate his kind he provides himself with a successor and immediately quits his post to make room for him   haeres haeredem alterius velut unda supervenit undam he does not seem born to enjoy life but to deliver it down to others this is not surprising to consider in animals which are formed for our use and can finish their business in a short life the silkworm after having spun her task lays her eggs and dies but a man can never have taken in his full measure of knowledge has not time to subdue his passions to establish his soul in virtue and come up to the perfection of his nature before he is hurried off the stage would an infinitely wise being make such glorious creatures for so mean a purpose can he delight in the production of such abortive intelligencies such shortlived reasonable beings would he give us talents that are not to be exerted capacities that are never to be gratified how can we find that wisdom which shines through all his works in the formation of man without looking on this world as only a nursery for the next and believing that the several generations of rational creatures which rise up and disappear in such quick successions are only to receive their first rudiments of existence here and afterward to be transplanted into a more friendly climate where they spread and flourish to all eternity  there is not in my opinion a more pleasing and triumphant consideration in religion than this of the perpetual progress which the soul makes toward the perfection of its nature without ever arriving at a period in it to look upon the soul as going on from strength to strength to consider that she is to shine for ever with new accessions of glory and brighten to all eternity that she will be still adding virtue to virtue and knowledge to knowledge carries in it something wonderfully agreeable to that ambition which is natural to the mind of man nay it must be a prospect pleasing to god himself to see his creation for ever beautifying in his eyes and drawing nearer to him by greater degrees of resemblance  methinks this single consideration of the progress of a finite spirit to perfection will be sufficient to extinguish all envy in inferior natures and all contempt in superior that cherubim which now appears as a god to a human soul knows very well that the period will come about in eternity when the human soul shall be as perfect as he himself now is nay when she shall look down upon that degree of perfection as much as she now falls short of it it is true the higher nature still advances and by that means preserves his distance and superiority in the scale of being but he knows how high soever the station is of which he stands possessed at present the inferior nature will at length mount up to it and shine forth in the same degree of glory  with what astonishment and veneration may we look into our own souls when there are such hidden stores of virtue and knowledge such in exhausted sources of perfection we know not yet what we shall be nor will it ever enter into the heart of man to conceive the glory that will be always in reserve for him the soul considered with its creator is like one of those mathematical lines that may draw nearer to another for all eternity without a possibility of touching it and can there be a thought so transporting as to consider ourselves in these perpetual approaches to him who is not only the standard of perfection but of

  a contemplation of the omnipresence and omniscience of god   0 the happiness of souls in heaven     the benefit of death i am very much pleased with a consolatory letter of phalaris to one who had lost a son who was a young man of great merit the thought with which he comforts the afflicted father is to the best of my memory as follows that he should consider death had set a kind of seal upon his sons character and placed him out of the reach of vice and infamy that while he lived he was still within the possibility of falling away from virtue and losing the fame of which he was possessed death only closes a mans reputation and determines it as good or bad  this among other motives may be one reason why we are naturally averse to the launching out into a mans praise till his head is laid in the dust whilst he is capable of changing we may be forced to retract our opinions he may forfeit the esteem we have conceived of him and some time or other appear to us under a different light from what he does at present in short as the life of any man cannot be called happy or unhappy so neither can it be pronounced vicious or virtuous before the conclusion of it  it was upon this consideration that epaminondas being asked whether chabrias iphicrates or he himself deserved most to be esteemed you must first see us die said he before that question can be answered  as there is not a more melancholy consideration to a good man than his being obnoxious to such a change so there is nothing more glorious than to keep up an uniformity in his actions and preserve the beauty of his character to the last  cheerfulness preferable to mirth i have always preferred cheerfulness to mirth the latter i consider as an act the former as an habit of the mind mirth is short and transient cheerfulness fixed and permanent those are often raised into the greatest transports of mirth who are subject to the greatest depressions of melancholy on the contrary cheerfulness though it does not give the mind such an exquisite gladness prevents us from falling into the depths of sorrow mirth is like a flash of lightning that breaks through a gloom of clouds and glitters for a moment cheerfulness keeps up a kind of daylight in the mind and fills it with a steady and perpetual serenity  men of austere principles look upon mirth as too wanton and dissolute for a state of probation and as filled with a certain triumph and insolence of heart that is inconsistent with a life which is every moment obnoxious to the greatest danger writers of this complexion have observed that the sacred person who was the great pattern of perfection was never seen to laugh  cheerfulness of mind is not liable to any of these exceptions it is of a serious and composed nature it does not throw the mind into a condition improper for the present state of humanity and is very conspicuous in the characters of those who are looked upon as the greatest philosophers among the heathens as well as among those who have been deservedly esteemed as saints and holy men among christians  its effects if we consider cheerfulness in three lights with regard to ourselves to those we converse with and to the great author of our being it will not a little recommend itself on each of these accounts the man who is possessed of this excellent frame of mind is not only easy in his thoughts but perfect master of all the powers and faculties of his soul his imagination is always clear and his judgment undisturbed his temper is even and unruffled whether in action or in solitude he comes with a relish to all those goods which nature has provided for him tastes all the pleasures of the creation which are poured about him and does not feel the full weight of those accidental evils which may befall him  if we consider him in relation to the persons whom he converses with it naturally produces love and good will toward him a cheerful mind is not only disposed to be affable and obliging but raises the same good humor in those who come within its influence a man finds himself well pleased he does not know why with the cheerfulness of his companion it is like a sudden sunshine that awakens a secret delight in the mind without her attending to it the heart rejoices of its own accord and naturally flows out into friendship and benevolence toward the person who has so kindly an effect upon it  when i consider this cheerful state of mind in its third relation i cannot but look upon it as a constant habitual gratitude to the great author of nature an inward cheerfulness is an implicit praise and thanksgiving to providence under all its dispensations it is a kind of acquiescence in the state wherein we are placed and a secret approbation of the divine will in his conduct toward man  the enemies to this happiness there are but two things which can reasonably deprive us of this cheerfulness of heart the first of these is the sense of guilt a man who lives in a state of vice and impenitence can have no title to that evenness and tranquillity of mind which is the health of the soul and the natural effect of virtue and innocence cheerfulness in an ill man deserves a harder name than language can furnish us with and in many degrees beyond what we commonly call folly or madness  atheism by which i mean a disbelief of a supreme being and consequently of a future state under whatsoever titles it shelters itself may likewise very reasonably deprive a man of this cheerfulness of temper there is something so particularly gloomy and offensive to human nature in the prospect of nonexistence that i cannot but wonder with many excellent writers how it is possible for a man to outlive the expectation of it for my own part i think the being of a god is so little to be doubted that it is almost the only truth we are sure of and such a truth as we meet with in every object in every occurrence and in every thought if we look into the characters of this tribe of infidels we generally find they are made up of pride spleen and cavil it is indeed no wonder that men who are uneasy to themselves should be so to the rest of the world and how is it possible for a man to be otherwise than uneasy in himself who is in danger every moment of losing his entire existence and dropping into nothing  the vicious man and atheist have therefore no pretense to cheerfulness and would act very unreasonably should they endeavor after it it is impossible for any one to live in good humor and enjoy his present existence who is apprehensive either of torment or of annihilation of being miserable or of not being at all  after having mentioned these two great principles which are destructive of cheerfulness in their own nature as well as in right reason i cannot think of any other that ought to banish this happy temper from a virtuous mind pain and sickness shame and reproach poverty and old age nay death itself considering the shortness of their duration and the advantage we may reap from them do not deserve the name of evils a good mind may bear up under them with fortitude with indolence and with cheerfulness of heart the tossing of a tempest does not discompose him which he is sure will bring him to a joyful harbor a man who uses his best endeavors to live according to the dictates of virtue and right reason has two perpetual sources of cheerfulness in the consideration of his own nature and of that being on whom he has a dependence  if he looks into himself he cannot but rejoice in that existence which is so lately bestowed upon him and which after millions of ages will be still new and still in its beginning how many selfcongratulations naturally arise in the mind when it reflects on this its entrance into eternity when it takes a view of those improveable faculties which in a few years and even at its first setting out have made so considerable a progress and which will be still receiving an increase of perfection and consequently an increase of happiness the consciousness of such a being spreads a perpetual diffusion of joy through the soul of a virtuous man and makes him look upon himself every moment as more happy than he knows how to conceive  the second source of cheerfulness to a good mind is its consideration of that being on whom we have our dependence and in whom though we behold him as yet but in the first faint discoveries of his perfections we see every thing that we can imagine as great glorious or amiable we find ourselves every where upheld by his goodness and surrounded with an immensity of love and mercy in short we depend upon a being whose power qualifies him to make us happy by an infinity of means whose goodness and truth engage him to make those happy who desire it of him and whose unchangeableness will secure us in this happiness to all eternity  such considerations which every one should perpetually cherish in his thoughts will banish from us all that secret heaviness of heart which unthinking men are subject to when they lie under no real affliction all that anguish which we may feel from any evil that actually oppresses us to which i may likewise add those little cracklings of mirth and folly that are apter to betray virtue than support it and stablish in us such an even and cheerful temper as makes us pleasing to ourselves to those with whom we converse and to him whom we were made to please  the benefit of cheerfulness with regard to the body and the objects that give rise to this cheerfulness having spoken of cheerfulness as it is a moral habit of the mind and accordingly mentioned such moral motives as are apt to cherish and keep alive this happy temper in the soul of man i shall now consider cheerfulness in its natural state and reflect on these motives to it which are indifferent either as to virtue or vice  cheerfulness is in the first place the best promoter of health repinings and secret murmurings of the heart give imperceptible strokes to those delicate fibers of which the vital parts are composed and wear out the machine insensibly not to mention those violent ferments which they stir up in the blood and those irregular disturbed motions which they raise in the animal spirits health and cheerfulness mutually beget each other with this difference that we seldom meet with a great degree of health which is not attended with a certain cheerfulness but very often see cheerfulness where there is no great degree of health  cheerfulness bears the same friendly regard to the mind as to the body it banishes all anxious care and discontent sooths and composes the passions and keeps the soul in a perpetual calm the world in which we are placed is filled with innumerable objects that are proper to raise and keep alive this happy temper of mind  if we consider the world in its subserviency to man one would think it was made for our use but if we consider it in its natural beauty and harmony one would be apt to conclude it was made for our pleasure the sun which is as the great soul of the universe and produces all the necessaries of life has a particular influence in chearing the mind of man and making the heart glad  those several living creatures which are made for our service or sustenance at the same time either fill the woods with their music furnish us with game or raise pleasing ideas in us by the delightfulness of their appearance fountains lakes and rivers are as refreshing to the imagination as to the soil through which they pass  to consider farther this double end in the works of nature and how they are at the same time both useful and entertaining we find that the most important parts of the vegetable world are those which are the most beautiful these are the seeds by which the several races of plants are propagated and continued and which are always lodged in flowers or blossoms nature seems to hide her principal design and to be industrious in making the earth gay and delightful while she is carrying on her great work and intent upon her own preservation the husbandman after the same manner is employed in laying out the whole country in a kind of garden or landscape and making every thing smile about him whilst in reality he thinks of nothing but of the harvest and increase which is to arise from it  we may farther observe how providence has taken care to keep up this cheerfulness in the mind of man by having formed it after such a manner as to make it capable of conceiving delight from several objects which seem to have very little use in them as from the wildness of rocks and deserts and the like grotesque pieces of nature those who are versed in philosophy may still carry this consideration higher by observing that if matter had appeared to us endowed only with those real qualities which it actually possesses it would have made but a very joyless and uncomfortable figure and why has providence given it a power of producing in us such imaginary qualities as tastes and colors sounds and smells heat and cold but that man while he is conversant in the lower stations of nature might have his mind cheared and delighted with agreeable sensations in short the whole universe is a kind of theater filled with objects that either raise in us pleasure amusement or admiration  the readers own thoughts will suggest to him the vicissitude of day and night the change of seasons with all that variety of scenes which diversify the face of nature and fill the mind with a perpetual succession of beautiful and pleasing images  i shall not here mention the several entertainments of art with the pleasures of friendship books conversation and other accidental diversions of life because i would only take notice of such incitements to a cheerful temper as offer themselves to persons of all ranks and conditions and which may sufficiently show us that providence did not design this world should be filled with murmurs and repinings or that the heart of man should be involved in gloom or melancholy  every one ought to fence against the temper of his climate or constitution and frequently to indulge in himself those considerations which may give him a serenity of mind and enable him to bear up cheerfully against those little evils and misfortunes which are common to human nature and which by a right improvement of them will produce a satiety of joy and an uninterrupted happiness  compassion a laudable virtue compassion does not only refine and civilize human nature but has something in it more pleasing and agreeable than what can be met with in such an indolent happiness such an indifference to mankind as that in which the stoics placed their wisdom as love is the most delightful passion pity is nothing else but love softened by a degree of sorrow in short it is a kind of pleasing anguish as well as generous sympathy that knits mankind together and blends them in the same common lot  hypocrisy the various kinds of it hypocrisy at the fashionable end of the town is very different from hypocrisy in the city the modish hypocrite endeavors to appear more vicious than he really is the other kind of hypocrite more virtuous the former is afraid of every thing that has the show of religion in it and would be thought engaged in many criminal gallantries and amors which he is not guilty of the latter assumes a face of sanctity and covers a multitude of vices under a seeming religious deportment  but there is another kind of hypocrisy which differs from both these and which i intend to make my present subject i mean that hypocrisy by which a man does not only deceive the world but very often imposes on himself that hypocrisy which conceals his own heart from him and makes him believe he is more virtuous than he really is and either not attend to his vices or mistake even his vices for virtues it is this fatal hypocrisy and selfdeceit which is taken notice of in these words  who can understand his errors cleanse thou me from my secret faults if the open professors of impiety deserve the utmost application and endeavors of moral writers to recover them from vice and folly how much more may those lay a claim to their care and compassion who are walking in the paths of death while they fancy themselves engaged in a course of virtue i shall endeavor therefore to lay down some rules for the discovery of those vices that lurk in the secret corners of the soul and to show my reader those methods by which he may arrive at a true and impartial knowledge of himself  instructions how to endeavor at the knowledge of our selves the usual means prescribed for this purpose are to examine our selves by the rules which are laid down for our direction in sacred writ and to compare our lives with the life of that person who acted up to the perfection of human nature and is the standing example as well as the great guide and instructor of those who receive his doctrines though these two heads cannot be too much insisted upon i shall but just mention them since they have been handled by many great and eminent writers  i would therefore propose the following methods to the consideration of such as would find out their secret faults and make a true estimate of themselves  in the first place let them consider well what are the characters which they bear among their enemies our friends very often flatter us as much as our own hearts they either do not see our faults or conceal them from us or soften them by their representations after such a manner that we think them too trivial to be taken notice of an adversary on the contrary makes a stricter search into us discovers every flaw and imperfection in our tempers and though his malice may set them in too strong a light it has generally some ground for what it advances a friend exaggerates a mans virtues an enemy inflames his crimes a wise man should give a just attention to both of them so far as they may tend to the improvement of the one and diminution of the other  plutarch has written an essay on the benefits which a man may receive from his enemies and among the good fruits of enmity mentions this in particular that by the reproaches which it casts upon us we see the worst side of our selves and open our eyes to several blemishes and defects in our lives and conversations which we should not have observed without the help of such illnatured monitors  in order likewise to come at a true knowledge of our selves we should consider on the other hand how far we may deserve the praises and approbations which the world bestow upon us whether the actions they celebrate proceed from laudable and worthy motives and how far we are really possessed of those virtues which gain us an applause among those with whom we converse such a reflection is absolutely necessary if we consider how apt we are either to value or condemn ourselves by the opinions of others and to sacrifice the report of our own hearts to the judgment of the world  in the next place that we may not deceive ourselves in a point of so much importance we should not lay too great a stress on any supposed virtues we possess that are of a doubtful nature and such we may esteem all those in which multitudes of men dissent from us who are as good and wise as ourselves we should always act with great cautiousness and circumspection in points where it is not impossible that we may be deceived intemperate zeal bigotry and persecution for any party or opinion how praiseworthy soever they may appear to weak men of our own principles produce infinite calamities among mankind and are highly criminal in their own nature and yet how many persons eminent for piety suffer such monstrous and absurd principles of action to take root in their minds under the color of virtues for my own part i must own i never yet knew any party so just and reasonable that a man could follow it in its height and violence and at the same time be innocent  we should likewise be very apprehensive of those actions which proceed from natural constitution favouritepassions particular education or whatever promotes our worldly interest or advantage in these and the like cases a mans judgment is easily perverted and a wrong biass hung upon his mind these are the inlets of prejudice the unguarded avenues of the mind by which a thousand errors and secret faults find admission without being observed or taken notice of a wise man will suspect those actions to which he is directed by something beside reason and always apprehend some concealed evil in every resolution that is of a disputable nature when it is conformable to his particular temper his age or way of life or when it favors his pleasure or his profit  there is nothing of greater importance to us than thus diligently to sift our thoughts and examine all these dark recesses of the mind if we would establish our souls in such a solid and substantial virtue as will turn to an account in that great day when it must stand the test of infinite wisdom and justice  the use and excellency of churchmusick frequent entertainments of divine music among us in our religious worship would not a little purify and exalt our passions give our thoughts a proper turn and cherish those divine impulses in the soul which every one feels that has not stifled them by sensual and immoderate pleasures  music when thus applied raises noble hints in the mind of the hearer and fills it with great conceptions it strengthens devotion and advances praise into rapture it lengthens out every act of worship and produces more lasting and permanent impressions in the mind than those which accompany any transient form of words that are uttered in the ordinary method of religious worship  the benefit of conversation conversation with men of a polite genius is a very useful method for improving our natural taste it is impossible for a man of the greatest parts to consider any thing in its whole extent and in all its variety of lights every man besides those general observations which are to be made upon an author forms several reflections that are peculiar to his own manner of thinking so that conversation will naturally furnish us with hints which we did not attend to and make us enjoy other mens parts and reflections as well as our own this is the best reason i can give for the observation which several have made that men of great genius in the same way of writing seldom rise up singly but at certain periods of time appear together and in a body as they did at rome in the reign of augustus and in greece about the age of socrates i cannot think that corneille racine moliere boileau la fontaine bruyere bossu or the daciers would have written so well as they have done had they not been friends and contemporaries  the nature of courts i consider courts with the same regard to the governments which they superintend as ovids palace of fame with regard to the universe the eyes of a watchful minister run through the whole people there is scarce a murmur or complaint that does not reach his ears they have newsgatherers and intelligencers distributed into their several walks and quarters who bring in their respective quotas and make them acquainted with the discourse and conversation of the whole kingdom or commonwealth where they are employed the wisest of kings alluding to these invisible and unsuspected spies who are planted by kings and rulers over their fellowcitizens as well as to those voluntary informers that are buzzing about the ears of a great man and making their court by such secret methods of intelligence has given us a very prudent caution curse not the king no not in thy thought and curse not the rich in thy bedchamber for a bird of the air shall carry the voice and that which has wings shall tell the matter  of the infamy of a spy and the caution that is necessary in trusting him as it is absolutely necessary for rulers to make use of other peoples eyes and ears they should take particular care to do it in such a manner that it may not bear too hard on the person whose life and conversation are inquired into a man who is capable of so infamous a calling as that of a spy is not very much to be relied upon he can have no great ties of honor or checks of conscience to restrain him in those covert evidences where the person accused has no opportunity of vindicating himself he will be more industrious to carry that which is grateful than that which is true there will be no occasion for him if he does not hear and see things worth discovery so that he naturally inflames every word and circumstance aggravates what is faulty perverts what is good and misrepresents what is indifferent nor is it to be doubted but that such ignominious wretches let their private passions into these their clandestine informations and often wreak their particular spite or malice against the person whom they are set to watch  inquisitive suspicions rejected by great minds it is observed of great and heroic minds that they have not only shown a particular disregard to those unmerited reproaches which have been cast upon em but have been altogether free from that impertinent curiosity of enquiring after them or the poor revenge of resenting them  the inquisitive person troublesome to himself a man who in ordinary life is very inquisitive after every thing which is spoken ill of him passes his time but very indifferently he is wounded by every arrow that is shot at him and puts it in the power of every insignificant enemy to disquiet him nay he will suffer from what has been said of him when it is forgotten by those who said or heard it for this reason i could never bear one of those officious friends that would be telling every malicious report every idle censure that passed upon me the tongue of man is so petulant and his thoughts so variable that one should not lay too great a stress upon any present speeches and opinions praise and obloquy proceed very frequently out of the same mouth upon the same person and upon the same occasion a generous enemy will sometimes bestow commendations as the dearest friend cannot sometimes refrain from speaking ill the man who is indifferent in either of these respects gives his opinion at random and praises or disapproves as he finds himself in humor  a reliance on god the christians only support against misfortunes man considered in himself is a very helpless and a very wretched being he is subject every moment to the greatest calamities and misfortunes he is beset with dangers on all sides and may become unhappy by numberless casualties which he could not foresee nor have prevented had he foreseen them  it is our comfort while we are obnoxious to so many accidents that we are under the care of one who directs contingencies and has in his hands the management of every thing that is capable of annoying or offending us who knows the assistance we stand in need of and is always ready to bestow it on those who ask it of him  the natural homage which such a creature bears to so infinitely wise and good a being is a firm reliance on him for the blessings and conveniences of life and an habitual trust in him for deliverance out of all such dangers and difficulties as may befall us  the man who always lives in this disposition of mind has not the same dark and melancholy views of human nature as he who considers himself abstractedly from this relation to the supreme being at the same time that he reflects upon his own weakness and imperfection he comforts himself with the contemplation of those divine attributes which are employed for his safety and his welfare he finds his want of foresight made up by the omniscience of him who is his support he is not sensible of his own want of strength when he knows that his helper is almighty in short the person who has a firm trust on the supreme being is powerful in his power wise by his wisdom happy by his happiness he reaps the benefit of every divine attribute and loses his own insufficiency in the fullness of infinite perfection  to make our lives more easy to us we are commanded to put our trust in him who is thus able to relieve and succor us the divine goodness having made such a reliance a duty notwithstanding we should have been miserable had it been forbidden us  among several motives which might be made use of to recommend this duty to us i shall only take notice of those that follow  the first and strongest is that we are promised he will not fail those who put their trust in him  but without considering the supernatural blessings which accompanies this duty we may observe that it has a natural tendency to its own reward or in other words that this firm trust and confidence in this disposer of all things contributes very much to the getting clear of any affliction or to the bearing it manfully a person who believes he has his succor at hand and that acts in the sight of his friend often exerts himself beyond his abilities and does wonders that are not to be matched by one who is not animated with such a confidence of success i could produce instances from history of generals who out of a belief that they are under the protection of some invisible assistance did not only encourage their soldiers to their utmost but have acted themselves beyond what they would have done had they not been inspired by such a belief i might in the same manner show how such a trust in the assistance of an almighty being naturally produces patience hope cheerfulness and all other dispositions of mind that alleviate those calamities which we are not able to remove  the practice of this virtue administers great comfort to the mind of man in times of poverty and affliction but most of all in the hour of death when the soul is hovering in the last moments of its separation when it is just entering on another state of existence to converse with scenes and objects and companions that are altogether new what can support her under such tremblings of thought such fear such anxiety such apprehensions but the casting all her cares upon him who first gave her being who has conducted her through one stage of it and will be always with her to guide and comfort her in her progress through eternity  the force and effect of custom there is not a common saying which has a better turn of sense to it than what we often hear in the mouths of the vulgar that custom is a second nature it is indeed able to form the man anew and to give him inclinations and capacities altogether different from those he was born with custom has a mechanical effect upon the body at the same time that it has a very extraordinary influence upon the mind  custom has a wonderful efficacy in making every thing pleasant to us our delight in any particular study art or science rises and improves in proportion to the application which we bestow upon it what was at first an exercise becomes at length an entertainment our employments are changed into our diversions the mind grows fond of those actions she is accustomed to and is drwn with reluctance from those paths in which she has been used to walk not only such actions as were at first indifferent to us but even such as were painful will by custom and practice become pleasant  the advantages that may be derived from this effect of custom if we consider attentively this property of human nature it may instruct us in very fine moralities in the first place i would have no man discouraged with that kind of life or series of action in which the choice of others or his own necessities may have engaged him it may perhaps be very disagreeable to him at first but use and application will certainly render it not only less painful but pleasing and satisfactory  in the second place i would recommend to every one that admirable precept which pythagoras is said to have given his disciples and which that philosopher must have drawn from the observation i have enlarged upon optimum vitae genus eligito nam consuetudo faciet jucundissimum pitch upon that course of life which is the most excellent and custom will render it the most delightful men whose circumstances will permit them to choose their own way of life are inexcusable if they do not pursue that which their judgment tells them is the most laudable the voice of reason is more to be regarded than the bent of any present inclination since by the rule abovementioned inclination will at length come over to reason though we can never force reason to comply with inclination  in the third place this observation may teach the most sensual and irreligious man to overlook those hardships and difficulties which are apt to discourage him from the prosecution of a virtuous life the gods said hesiod have placed labor before virtue the way to her is at first rough and difficult but grows more smooth and easy the farther you advance in it the man who proceeds in it with steadiness and resolution will find that her ways are ways of pleasantness and that all her paths are peace  to enforce this consideration we may farther observe that the practice of religion will not only be attended with that pleasure which naturally accompanies those actions to which we are habituated but with those supernumerary joys of heart that rise from the consciousness of such a pleasure from the satisfaction of acting up to the dictates of reason and from the prospect of an happy immortality  in the fourth place we may learn from this observation which we have made on the mind of man to take particular care when we are once settled in a regular course of life how we too frequently indulge our selves in any the most indecent diversions and entertainments since the mind may insensibly fall off from the relish of virtuous actions and by degrees exchange that pleasure which it takes in the performance of its duty for delights of a much more inferior and unprofitable nature  the last use which i shall make of this remarkable property in human nature of being delighted with those actions to which it is accustomed is to show how absolutely necessary it is for us to gain habits of virtue in this life if we would enjoy the pleasures of the next the state of bliss we call heaven will not be capable of affecting those minds which are not thus qualified for it we must in this world gain a relish of truth and virtue if we would be able to taste that knowledge and perfection which are to make us happy in the next the seeds of those spiritual joys and raptures which are to rise up and flourish in the soul to all eternity must be planted in her during this her present state of probation in short heaven is not to be looked upon only as the reward but as the natural effect of a religious life on the other hand those evil spirits who by long custom have contracted in the body habits of lust and sensuality malice and revenge an aversion to every thing that is good just or laudable are naturally seasoned and prepared for pain and misery their torments have already taken root in them they cannot be happy when divested of the body unless we may suppose that providence will in a manner create them anew and work a miracle in the rectification of their faculties they may indeed taste a kind of malignant pleasure in those actions to which they are accustomed whilst in this life but when they are removed from all those objects which are here apt to gratify them they will naturally become their own tormentors and cherish in themselves those painful habits of mind which are called in scripture phrase the worm that never dies  the infamy of libels the interest of a government to correct and suppress them there is nothing so scandalous to a government and detestable in the eyes of all good men as defamatory papers and pamphlets but at the same time there is nothing so difficult to tame as a satirical author an angry writer who cannot appear in print naturally vents his spleen in libels and lampoons our satyr is nothing but ribaldry and billingsgate scurrility passes for wit and he who can call names in the greatest variety of phrases is looked upon to have the shrewdest pen by this means the honor of families is ruined the highest posts and greatest titles are rendered cheap and vile in the sight of the people the noblest virtues and most exalted parts exposed to the contempt of the vicious and the ignorant would a government set an everlasting mark of their displeasure upon one of those infamous writers who makes his court to them by tearing to pieces the reputation of his competitor we should quickly see an end put to this race of vermin that are a scandal to government and a reproach to human nature such a proceeding would make a minister of state shine in history and would fill all mankind with a just abhorrence of persons who should treat him unworthily and employ against him those arms which he scorned to make use of against his enemies  as this cruel practice tends to the utter subversion of all truth and humanity among us it deserves the utmost detestation and discouragement of all who have either the love of their country or the honor of their religion at heart i would therefore humbly recommend it to the consideration of those who deal in these pernicious arts of writing and of those who take pleasure in the reading of them as for the first i have spoken of them before and have not stuck to rank them with the murderer and assassin every honest man sets as high a value upon a good name as upon life itself and i cannot but think that those who privily assault the one would destroy the other might they do it with the same secrecy and impunity  gratitude there is not a more pleasing exercise of the mind than gratitude it is accompanied with such an inward satisfaction that the duty is sufficiently rewarded by the performance it is not like the practice of many other virtues difficult and painful but attended with so much pleasure that were there no positive command which enjoined it nor any recompense laid up for it hereafter a generous mind would indulge itself in it for the natural gratification that accompanies it  if gratitude is due from man to man how much more from man to his maker the supreme being does not only confer upon us those bounties which proceed more immediately from his hand but even those benefits which are conveyed to us by others every blessing we enjoy by what means soever it may be derived upon us is the gift of him who is the great author of good and father of mercies  if gratitude toward one another naturally produces a very pleasing sensation in the mind of a grateful man it exalts the soul into rapture when it is employed on this great object of gratitude on this beneficent being who has given us every thing we already possess and from whom we expect every thing we yet hope for  modesty nothing is more amiable than true modesty and nothing is more contemptible than the false the one guards virtue the other betrays it true modesty is ashamed to do any thing that is repugnant to the rules of right reason false modesty is ashamed to do any thing that is opposite to the humor of the company true modesty avoids every thing that is criminal false modesty every thing that is unfashionable the latter is only a general undetermined instinct the former is that instinct limited and circumscribed by the rules of prudence and religion we may conclude that modesty to be false and vicious which engages a man to do any thing that is ill or indiscreet or which restrains him from doing any thing that is of a contrary nature  nor does this false modesty expose us only to such actions as are indiscreet but very often to such as are highly criminal when xenophanes was called timorous because he would not venture his money in a game at dice i confess said he that i am exceeding timorous for i dare not do an ill thing on the contrary a man of vicious modesty complies with every thing and is only fearful of doing what may look singular in the company where he is engaged he falls in with the torrent and lets himself go to every action or discourse however unjustifiable in its self so it be in vogue among the present party this though one of the most common is one of the most ridiculous dispositions in human nature that men should not be ashamed of speaking or acting in a dissolute or irrational manner but that one who is in their company should be ashamed of governing himself by the principles of reason and virtue  in the second place we are to consider false modesty as it restrains a man from doing what is good and laudable and here i shall only dwell upon one reflection which i cannot make without a secret concern we have in england a particular bashfulness in every thing that regards religion a wellbred man is obliged to conceal any serious sentiment of this nature and very often to appear a greater libertine than he is that he may keep himself in countenance among the men of mode our excess of modesty makes us shamefaced in all the exercises of piety and devotion this humor prevails upon us daily insomuch that at many wellbred tables the master of the house is so very modest a man that he has not the confidence to say grace at his own table a custom which is not only practiced by all the nations about us but was never omitted by the heathens themselves english gentlemen who travel into roman catholic countries are not a little surprised to meet with people of the best quality kneeling in their churches and engaged in their private devotions though it be not at the hours of public worship an officer of the army or a man of wit and pleasure in those countries would be afraid of passing not only for an irreligious but an illbred man should he be seen to go to bed or sit down at table without offering up his devotions on such occasions the same show of religion appears in all their foreign reformed churches and enters so much into their ordinary conversation that an englishman is apt to term them hypocritical and precise  hypocrisy preferable to open impiety hypocrisy cannot indeed be too much detested but at the same time is to be prefered to open impiety they are both equally destructive to the person who is possessed with them but in regard to others hypocrisy is not so pernicious as barefaced irreligion the due mean to be observed is to be sincerely virtuous and at the same time to let the world see we are so i do not know a more dreadful menace in the holy writings than that which is pronounced against those who have this perverted modesty to be ashamed before men in a particular of such unspeakable importance  the benefits of faith and morality considered religion may be considered under two general heads the first comprehends what we are to believe the other what we are to practice by those things which we are to believe i mean whatever is revealed to us in the holy writings and which we could not have obtained the knowledge of by the light of nature by the things which we are to practice i mean all those duties to which we are directed by reason or natural religion the first of these i shall distinguish by the name of faith the second by that of morality if we look into the more serious part of mankind we find many who lay so great a stress upon faith that they neglect morality and many who build so much upon morality that they do not pay a due regard to faith the perfect man should be defective in neither of these particulars as will be very evident to those who consider the benefits which arise from each of them and which i shall make my present subject  notwithstanding this general division of christian duty into morality and faith and that they have both their peculiar excellencies the first has the preeminence in several respects  first because the greatest part of morality as i have stated the notion of it is of a fixed eternal nature and will endure when faith shall fail and be lost in conviction  secondly because a person may be qualified to do greater good to mankind and become more beneficial to the world by morality without faith than by faith without morality  thirdly because morality gives a greater perfection to human nature by quieting the mind moderating the passions and advancing the happiness of every man in his private capacity  fourthly because the rule of morality is much more certain than that of faith all the civilized nations agreeing in the great points of morality as much as they differ in those of faith  fifthly because infidelity is not of so malignant a nature as immorality or to put the same reason in another light because it is generally owned there may be salvation for a virtuous infidel particularly in the case of invincible ignorance but none for a vicious believer  sixthly because infidelity seems to draw its principal if not all its excellency from the influence it has upon morality as we shall see more at large if we consider wherein consists the excellency of faith or the belief of revealed religion and this i think is  first in explaining and carrying to greater heights several points of morality  secondly in furnishing new and stronger motives to enforce the practice of morality  thirdly in giving us more amiable ideas of the supreme being more endearing notions of one another and a truer state of our selves both in regard to the grandeur and vileness of our natures  fourthly by showing us the blackness and deformity of vice which in the christian system is so very great that he who is possessed of all perfection and the sovereign judge of it is represented by several of our divines as hating sin to the same degree that he loves the sacred person who was made the propitiation of it  fifthly in being the ordinary and prescribed method of making morality effectual to salvation  this i am sure is so obvious that no one can miss it namely that a man cannot be perfect in his scheme of morality who does not strengthen and support it with that of the christian faith  besides this i shall lay down two or three other maxims which i think we may deduce from what has been said  first that we should be particularly cautious of making any thing an article of faith which does not contribute to the confirmation or improvement of morality  secondly that no article of faith can be true and authentic which weakens or subverts the practical part of religion or what i have hitherto called morality  thirdly that the greatest friend of morality or natural religion cannot possibly apprehend any danger from embracing christianity as it is preserved pure and incorrupt in the doctrines of our national church  there is likewise another maxim which i think may be drawn from the foregoing considerations which is this that we should in all dubious points consider any ill consequences that may arise from them supposing they should be erroneous before we give up our assent to them  the immorality of persecution for example in that disputable point of persecuting men for conscience sake besides the imbittering their minds with hatred indignation and all the vehemence of resentment and ensnaring them to profess what they do not believe we cut them off from the pleasures and advantages of society afflict their bodies distress their fortunes hurt their reputations ruin their families make their lives painful or put an end to them sure when we see such dreadful consequences rising from a principle we ought to be as fully convinced of the truth of it as of a mathematical demonstration before we venture to act upon it or make it a part of our religion  in this case the injury done our neighbor is plain and evident the principle that puts us upon doing it of a dubious and disputable nature morality seems highly violated by the one and whether or no a zeal for what a man thinks the true system of faith may justify it is very uncertain i cannot but think if our religion produces charity as well as zeal it will not be for showing itself by such cruel instances  the middle condition of life most desirable there is a beautiful saying in theognis vice is covered by wealth and virtue by poverty or to give it in the verbal translation among men there are some who have their vices concealed by wealth and others who have their virtues concealed by poverty  every mans observation will supply him with instances of rich men who have several faults and defects that are overlooked if not entirely hidden by means of their riches and i think we cannot find a more natural description of a poor man whose merits are lost in his poverty than that in the words of the wise man there was a little city and few men within it and there came a great king against it and besieged it and built great bulwarks against it now there was found in it a poor wise man and he by his wisdom delivered the city yet no man remembered that same poor man then said i wisdom is better than strength nevertheless the poor mans wisdom is despised and his words are not heard  the middle condition seems to be the most advantageously situated for the gaining of wisdom poverty turns our thoughts too much upon the supplying of our wants and riches upon enjoying our superfluities and as cowley has said in another case it is hard for a man to keep a steady eye upon truth who is always in a battle or a triumph  if we regard poverty and wealth as they are apt to produce virtues or vices in the mind of man one may observe that there is a set of each of these growing out of poverty quite different from that which rises out of wealth humility and patience industry and temperance are very often the good qualities of a poor man humanity and good nature magnanimity and a sense of honor are as often the qualifications of the rich on the contrary poverty is apt to betray a man into envy riches into arrogance poverty is too often attended with fraud vicious compliance repining murmurs and discontent riches expose a man to pride and luxury a foolish elation of heart and too great a fondness for the present world in short the middle condition is most eligible to the man who would improve himself in virtue as i have before shown it is the most advantageous for the gaining of knowledge  the means for confirming our faith having already endeavored to show the great excellency of faith i shall here consider what are the proper means of strengthening and confirming it in the mind of man those who delight in reading books of controversy which are written on both sides of the question in points of faith do very seldom arrive at a fixed and settled habit of it they are one day entirely convinced of its important truths and the next meet with something that shakes and disturbs them the doubt which was laid revives again and shows it self in new difficulties and that generally for this reason because the mind which is perpetually lost in controversies and disputes is apt to forget the reasons which had once set it at rest and to be disquieted with any former perplexity when it appears in a new shape or is started by a different hand as nothing is more laudable than an enquiry after truth so nothing is more irrational than to pass away our whole lives without determining our selves one way or other in those points which are of the last importance to us there are indeed many things from which we may withold our assent but in cases by which we are to regulate our lives it is the greatest absurdity to be wavering and unsettled without closing with that side which appears the most safe and the most probable  the first rule therefore which i shall lay down is this that when by reading or discourse we find ourselves thoroughly convinced of the truth of any article and of the reasonableness of our belief in it we should never after suffer our selves to call it into question we may perhaps forget the arguments which occasioned our conviction but we ought to remember the strength they had with us and therefore still to retain the conviction which they once produced this is no more than what we do in every common art or science nor is it possible to act otherwise considering the weakness and limitation of our intellectual faculties it is in this manner that the mathematician proceeds upon propositions which he has once demonstrated and though the demonstration may have slipped out of his memory he builds upon the truth because he knows it was demonstrated this rule is absolutely necessary for weaker minds and in some measure for men of the greatest abilities but to these last i would propose in the second place that they should lay up in their memories and always keep by them in a readiness those arguments which appear to them of the greatest strength and which cannot be got over by all the doubts and cavils of infidelity but in the third place there is nothing which strengthens faith more than morality faith and morality naturally produce each other a man is quickly convinced of the truth of religion who finds it is not against his interest that it should be true the pleasure he receives at present and the happiness which he promises himself to receive from it hereafter will both dispose him very powerfully to give credit to it according to the ordinary observation that we are easy to believe what we wish  it is very certain that a man of sound reason cannot forbear closing with religion upon an impartial examination of it but at the same time it is as certain that faith is kept alive in us and gathers strength from practice more than from speculation  there is still another method which is more persuasive than any of the former and that is an habitual adoration of the supreme being as well in constant acts of mental worship as in outward forms the devout man does not only believe but feels there is a deity he has actual sensations of him his experience concurs with his reason he sees him more and more in all his intercourses with him and even in this life almost loses his faith in conviction  the last method which i shall mention for the giving life to a mans faith is frequent retirement from the world accompanied with religious meditation when a man thinks of any thing in the darkness of the night whatever deep impressions it may make in his mind are apt to banish as soon as the day breaks about him the light and noise of the day which are perpetually soliciting his senses and calling off his attention wear out of his mind the thoughts that imprinted themselves in it with so much strength during the silence and darkness of the night a man finds the same difference as to himself in a crowd and a solitude the mind is stunned and dazzled amidst that variety of objects which presses upon her in a great city she cannot apply herself to the consideration of those things which are of the utmost concern to her the cares or pleasures of the world strike in with every thought and a multitude of vicious examples give a kind of justification to our folly in our retirements every thing disposes us to be serious in courts and cities we are entertained with the works of men in the country with those of god one is the province of art the other of nature faith and devotion naturally grow in the mind of every reasonable man who sees the impressions of divine power and wisdom in every object on which he casts his eye the supreme being has made the best arguments for his own existence in the formation of the heavens and the earth and these are arguments which a man of sense cannot forbear attending to who is out of the noise and hurry of human affairs aristotle says that should a man live under ground and there converse with works of art and mechanism and should afterward be brought up into the open day and see the several glories of the heaven and earth he would immediately pronounce them the works of such a being as we define god to be  places of trust best invested in men of generous principles i am persuaded there are few men of generous principles who would seek after great places were it not rather to have an opportunity in their hands of obliging their particular friends or those whom they look upon as men of worth than to procure wealth and honor for themselves to an honest mind the best perquisites of a place are the advantages it gives a man of doing good those who are under the great officers of state and are the instruments by which they act have more frequent opportunities for the exercise of compassion and benevolence than their superiors themselves these men know every little case that is to come before the great man and if they are possessed with honest minds will consider poverty as a recommendation in the person who applies himself to them and make the justice of his cause the most powerful solicitor in his behalf a man of this temper when he is in a post of business becomes a blessing to the public he patronizes the orphan and the widow assists the friendless and guides the ignorant he does not reject the persons pretensions who does not know how to explain them or refuse doing a good office for a man because he cannot pay the fee of it in short though he regulates himself in all his proceedings by justice and equity he finds a thousand occasions for all the goodnatured offices of generosity and compassion  a man is unfit for such a place of trust who is of a sower untractable nature or has any other passion that makes him uneasy to those who approach him roughness of temper is apt to discountenance the timorous or modest the proud man discourages those from approaching him who are of a mean condition and who most want his assistance the impudent man will not give himself time to be informed of the matter that lies before him an officer with one or more of these unbecoming qualities is sometimes looked upon as a proper person to keep off impertinence and solicitation from his superior but this is a kind of merit that can never atone for the injustice which may very often arise from it  there are two other vicious qualities which render a man very unfit for such a place of trust the first of these is a dilatory temper which commits innumerable cruelties without design the maxim which several have laid down for a mans conduct in ordinary life should be inviolable with a man in office never to think of doing that to morrow which may be done to day a man who defers doing what ought to done is guilty of injustice so long as he defers it the dispatch of a good office is very often as beneficial to the solicitor as the good office itself in short if a man compared the inconveniences which another suffers by his delays with the trifling motives and advantages which he himself may reap by such a delay he would never be guilty of a fault which very often does an irreparable prejudice to the person who depends upon him and which might be remedyed with little trouble to himself  but in the last place there is no man so improper to be employed in business as he who is in any degree capable of corruption and such a one is the man who upon any pretense whatsoever receives more than what is the stated and unquestioned fee of his office gratifications tokens of thankfulness dispatchmoney and the like specious terms are the pretenses under which corruption very frequently shelters it self an honest man will however look on all these methods as unjustifiable and will enjoy himself better in a moderate fortune that is gained with honor and reputation than in an overgrown estate that is cankered with the acquisitions of rapine and extortion were all our offices discharged with such an inflexible integrity we should not see men in all ages who grow up to exorbitant wealth with the abilities which are to be met with in an ordinary mechanic i can not but think that such a corruption proceeds chiefly from mens receiving the first that offer themselves or those who have the character of shrewd worldly men instead of searching out such as have had a liberal education and have been trained up in the studies of knowledge and virtue  why men of learning are best qualifyed for such offices it has been observed that men of learning who take to business discharge it generally with greater honesty than men of the world the chief reason for it i take to be as follows a man that has spent his youth in reading has been used to find virtue extolled and vice stigmatized a man that has past his time in the world has often seen vice triumphant and virtue discountenanced extortion rapine and injustice which are branded with infamy in books often give a man a figure in the world while several qualities which are celebrated in authors as generosity ingenuity and goodnature impoverish and ruin him this cannot but have a proportionable effect on men whose tempers and principles are equally good and vicious  there would be at least this advantage in employing men of learning and parts in business that their prosperity would set more gracefully on them and that we should not see many worthless persons shot up into the greatest figures of life  the passion of hope our actual enjoyments are so few and transient that man would be a very miserable being were he not endowed with this passion of hope which gives him a taste of those good things that may possibly come into his possession we should hope for every thing that is good says the old poet linus because there is nothing which may not be hoped for and nothing but what the gods are able to give us hope quickens all the still parts of life and keeps the mind awake in her most remiss and indolent hours it gives habitual serenity and good humor it is a kind of vital heat to the soul that chears and gladdens her when she does not attend to it it makes pain easy and labor pleasant  beside these several advantages which rise from hope there is another which is none of the least and that is its great efficacy in preserving us from setting too high a value on present enjoyments the saying of caesar is very well known when he had given away all his estate in gratuities among his friends one of them asked what he had left for himself to which that great man replied hope his natural magnanimity hindered him from prizing what he was certainly possessed of and turned all his thoughts upon something more valuable that he had in view  i shall make but two reflections upon what i have said first that no kind of life is so happy as that which is full of hope especially when the hope is wellgrounded and when the object of it is of an exalted kind and in its nature proper to make the person happy who enjoys it this proposition must be very evident to those who consider how few are the present enjoyments of the most happy man and how insufficient to give him an entire satisfaction and acquiescence in them  religious hope my next observation is this that a religious life is that which most abounds in a wellgrounded hope and such an one as is fixed on objects that are capable of making us entirely happy this hope in a religious man is much more sure and certain than the hope of any temporal blessing as it is strengthened not only by reason but by faith it has at the same time its eye fixed perpetually on that state which implies in the very notion of it the most full and the most complete happiness  i have before shown how the influence of hope in general sweetens life and makes our condition supportable if not pleasing but a religious hope has still greater advantages it does not only bear up the mind under her sufferings but makes her rejoice in them as they may be the instruments of procuring her the great and ultimate end of all her hope  religious hope has likewise this advantage above any other kind of hope that it is able to revive the dying man and to fill his mind not only with secret comfort and refreshment but sometimes with rapture and transport he triumphs in his agonies whilst the soul springs forward with delight to the great object which she has always had in view and leaves the body with an expectation of being reunited to her in a glorious and joyful resurrection  the effects of the spleen it is a celebrated thought of socrates that if all the misfortunes of mankind were cast into a public stock in order to be equally distributed among the whole species those who now think themselves the most unhappy would prefer the share they are already possessed of before that which would fall to them by such a division horace has carried this thought a great deal farther intimating that the hardships or misfortunes we lie under are more easy to us than those of any other person would be in case we could change conditions with him  as i was ruminating on these two remarks and seated in my elbowchair i insensibly fell asleep when on a sudden methought there was a proclamation made by jupiter that every mortal should bring in his griefs and calamities and throw them together in a heap there was a large plain appointed for this purpose i took my stand in the center of it and saw with a great deal of pleasure the whole human species marching one after another and throwing down their several loads which immediately grew up into a prodigious mountain that seemed to rise above the clouds  there was a certain lady of a thin airy shape who was very active in this solemnity she carried a magnifying glass in one of her hands and was clothed in a loose flowing robe embroidered with several figures of fiends and specter that discovered themselves in a thousand chimerical shapes as her garment hovered in the wind there was something wild and distracted in her looks her name was fancy she led up every mortal to the appointed place after having very officiously assisted him in making up his pack and laying it upon his shoulders my heart melted within me to see my fellow creatures groaning under their respective burdens and to consider that prodigious bulk of human calamities which lay before me  there were however several persons who gave me great diversion upon this occasion i observed one bringing in a fardel very carefully concealed under an old embroidered cloak which upon his throwing it into the heap i discovered to be poverty another after a great deal of puffing threw down his luggage which upon examining i found to be his wife  there were multitudes of lovers saddled with very whimsical burdens composed of darts and flames but what was very odd though they sighed as if their hearts would break under these bundles of calamities they could not persuade themselves to cast them into the heap when they came up to it but after a few faint efforts shook their heads and marched away as heavy laden as they came i saw multitudes of old women throw down their wrinkles and several young ones who stripped themselves of a tawny skin there were very great heaps of red noses large lips and rusty teeth the truth of it is i was surprised to see the greatest part of the mountain made up of bodily deformities observing one advancing toward the heap with a larger cargo than ordinary upon his back i found upon his near approach that it was only a natural hump which he disposed of with great joy of heart among this collection of human miseries there were likewise distempers of all sorts though i could not but observe that there were many more imaginary than real one little packet i could not but take notice of which was a complication of all the diseases incident to human nature and was in the hand of a great many fine people this was called the spleen but what most of all surprised me was a remark i made that there was not a single vice or folly thrown into the whole heap at which i was very much astonished having concluded within my self that every one would take this opportunity of getting rid of his passions prejudices and frailties  i took notice in particular of a very profligate fellow who i did not question came laden with his crimes but upon searching into his bundle i found that instead of throwing his guilt from him he had only laid down his memory he was followed by another worthless rogue who flung away his modesty instead of his ignorance  when the whole race of mankind had thus cast their burdens the phantome which had been so busy on this occasion seeing me an idle spectator of what passed approached toward me i grew uneasy at her presence when of a sudden she held her magnifying glass full before my eyes i no sooner saw my face in it but was startled at the shortness of it which now appeared to me in its utmost aggravation the immoderate breadth of the features made me very much out of humor with my own countenance upon which i threw it from me like a mask it happened very luckily that one who stood by me had just before thrown down his visage which it seems was too long for him it was indeed extended to a most shameful length i believe the very chin was modestly speaking as long as my whole face we had both of us an opportunity of mending our selves and all the contributions being now brought in every man was at liberty to exchange his misfortune for those of another person  i saw with unspeakable pleasure the whole species thus delivered from its sorrows though at the same time as we stood round the heap and surveyed the several materials of which it was composed there was scarce a mortal in this vast multitude who did not discover what he thought pleasures and blessings of life and wondered how the owners of them ever came to look upon them as burdens and grievances  as we were regarding very attentively this confusion of miseries this chaos of calamity jupiter issued out a second proclamation that every one was now at liberty to exchange his affliction and to return to his habitation with any such other bundle as should be delivered to him  upon this fancy began again to bestir herself and parcelling out the whole heap with incredible activity recommended to every one his particular packet the hurry and confusion at this time was not to be expressed some observations which i made upon the occasion i shall communicate to the public a venerable greyheaded man who had laid down the cholick and whom i found wanted an heir to his estate snatched up an undutiful son that had been thrown into the heap by his angry father the graceless youth in less than a quarter of an hour pulled the old gentleman by the beard and had like to have knocked his brains out so that meeting the true father who came toward him in a fit of the gripes he begged him to take his son again and give him back his cholick but they were incapable either of them to recede from the choice they had made a poor gallyslave who had thrown down his chains took up the gout in their stead but made such wry faces that one might easily perceive he was no great gainer by the bargain it was pleasant enough to see the several exchanges that were made for sickness against poverty hunger against want of appetite and care against pain  the female world were very busy among themselves in bartering for features one was trucking a lock of gray hairs for a carbuncle another was making over a short waste for a pair of round shoulders and a third cheapning a bad face for a lost reputation but on all these occasions there was not one of them who did not think the new blemish as soon as she had got it into her possession much more disagreeable than the old one i made the same observation on every other misfortune or calamity which every one in the assembly brought upon himself in lieu of what he had parted with whether it be that all the evils which befall us are in some measure suited and proportioned to our strength or that every evil becomes more supportable by our being accustomed to it i shall not determine  i could not for my heart forbear pitying the poor humpdback gentleman who went off a very wellshaped person with a stone in his bladder nor the fine gentleman who had struck up this bargain with him that limped through a whole assembly of ladies who used to admire him with a pair of shoulders peeping over his head  i must not omit my own particular adventure my friend with the long visage had no sooner taken upon him my short face but he made such a grotesque figure in it that as i looked upon him i could not forbear laughing at my self insomuch that i put my own face out of countenance the poor gentleman was so sensible of the ridicule that i found he was ashamed of what he had done on the other side i found that i my self had no great reason to triumph for as i went to touch my forehead i missed the place and clapped my finger upon my upper lip besides as my nose was exceeding prominent i gave it two or three unlucky knocks as i was playing my hand about my face and aiming at some other part of it i saw two other gentlemen by me who were in the same ridiculous circumstances these had made a foolish swop between a couple of thick bandy legs and two long trapsticks that had no calves to them one of these looked like a man walking upon stilts and was so lifted up into the air above his ordinary height that his head turned round with it while the other made such awkward circles as he attempted to walk that he scarce knew how to move forward upon his new supporters observing him to be a pleasant kind of a fellow i stuck my cane in the ground and told him i would lay him a bottle of wine that he did not march up to it on a line that i drew for him in a quarter of an hour  the heap was at last distributed among the two sexes who made a most piteous sight as they wandered up and down under the pressure of their several burdens the whole plain was filled with murmurs and complaints groans and lamentations jupiter at length taking compassion on the poor mortals ordered them a second time to lay down their loads with a design to give every one his own again they discharged themselves with a great deal of pleasure after which the phantome who had led them into such gross delusions was commanded to disappear there was sent in her stead a goddess of a quite different figure her motions were steady and composed and her aspect serious but cheerful she every now and then cast her eyes toward heaven and fixed them upon jupiter her name was patience she had no sooner placed her self by the mount of sorrows but what i thought very remarkable the whole heap sunk to such a degree that it did not appear a third part so big as it was before she afterward returned every man his own proper calamity and teaching him how to bear it in the most commodious manner he marched off with it contentedly being very well pleased that he had not been left to his own choice as to the kind of evils which fell to his lot  besides the several pieces of morality to be drawn out of this vision i learnt from it never to repine at my own misfortunes or to envy the happiness of another since it is impossible for any man to form a right judgment of his neighbors sufferings for which reason also i have determined never to think too lightly of anothers complaints but to regard the sorrows of my fellow creatures with sentiments of humanity and compassion  of oratory it was a common enquiry among the ancients why the number of excellent orators under all the encouragements the most flourishing states could give them fell so far short of the number of those who excelled in all other sciences herodotus says that the most useful animals are the most fruitful in their generation whereas the species of those beasts that are fierce and mischievous to mankind are but scarcely continued the historian instances in an hare which always either breeds or brings forth and a lioness which brings forth but once and then loses all power of conception but in these later ages we have greater causes of complaint than the ancients had our moderns have greater advantages toward true and solid eloquence than any which the celebrated speakers of antiquity enjoyed  the first great and substantial difference is that their common places in which almost the whole force of amplification consists were drawn from the profit or honesty of the action as they regarded only this present state of duration but christianity as it exalts morality to a greater perfection as it brings the consideration of another life into the question as it proposes rewards and punishments of a higher nature and a longer continuance is more adapted to affect the minds of the audience naturally inclined to pursue what it imagines its greatest interest and concern if pericles as historians report could shake the firmest resolutions of his hearers and set the passions of all greece in a ferment when the present welfare of his country or the fear of hostile invasions was the subject what may be expected from that orator who warns his audience against those evils which have no remedy when once undergone either from prudence or time as much greater as the evils in a future state are than these at present so much are the motives to persuasion under christianity greater than those which mere moral considerations could supply us with but what is now mentioned relates only to the power of moving the affections there is another part of eloquence which is indeed its masterpiece which is the mavelous and sublime in this the christian orator has the advantage beyond contradiction our ideas are so infinitely enlarged by revelation the eye of reason has so wide a prospect into eternity the notions of a deity are so worthy and refined and the accounts we have of a state of happiness or misery so clear and evident that the contemplation of such objects will give our discourse a noble vigor an invincible force beyond the power of any human consideration tully requires in his perfect orator some skill in the nature of heavenly bodies because says he his mind will become more extensive and unconfined and when he descends to treat of human affairs he will both think and write in a more exalted and magnificent manner for the same reason that excellent master would have recommended the study of those great and glorious mysteries which revelation has discovered to us to which the noblest parts of this system of the world are as much inferior as the creature is less excellent than its creator the wisest and most knowing among the heathens had very poor and imperfect notions of a future state they had indeed some uncertain hopes either received by tradition or gathered by reason that the existence of virtuous men would not be determined by the separation of soul and body but they either disbelieved a future state of punishment and misery or upon the same account that apelles painted antigonus with one side only to the spectator that the loss of his eye might not cast a blemish upon the whole piece so these represented the condition of man in its fairest view and endeavored to conceal what they thought was a deformity to human nature i have often observed that whenever the abovementioned orator in his philosophical discourses is led by his argument to the mention of immortality he seems like one awaked out of sleep rouzed and alarmed with the dignity of the subject he stretches his imagination to conceive something uncommon and with the greatness of his thoughts casts as it were a glory round the sentence uncertain and unsettled as he was he seems fired with the contemplation of it and nothing but such a glorious prospect could have forced so great a lover of truth as he was to declare his resolution never to part with his persuasion of immortality though it should be proved to be an erroneous one but had he lived to see all that christianity has brought to light how would he have lavished out all the force of eloquence in those noblest contemplations which human nature is capable of the resurrection and the judgment that follows it how had his breast glowed with pleasure when the whole compass of futurity lay open and exposed to his view how would his imagination have hurryed him on in the pursuit of the mysteries of the incarnation how would he have entered with the force of lightning into the affections of his hearers and fixed their attention in spite of all the opposition of corrupt nature upon those glorious themes which his eloquence has painted in such lively and lasting colors  this advantage christians have and it was with no small pleasure i lately met with a fragment of longinus which is preserved as a testimony of that criticks judgment at the beginning of a manuscript of the new testament in the vatican library after that author has numbered up the most celebrated orators among the grecians he says add to these paul of tarsus the patron of an opinion not yet fully proved as a heathen he condemns the christian religion and as an impartial critic he judges in favor of the promoter and preacher of it to me it seems that the latter part of his judgment adds great weight to his opinion of st pauls abilities since under all the prejudice of opinions directly opposite he is constrained to acknowledge the merit of that apostle and no doubt such as longinus describes st paul such he appeared to the inhabitants of those countries which he visited and blessed with those doctrines he was divinely commissioned to preach sacred story gives us in one circumstance a convincing proof of his eloquence when the men of lystra called him mercury because he was the chief speaker and would have paid divine worship to him as to the god who invented and prefided over eloquence this one account of our apostle sets his character considered as an orator only above all the celebrated relations of the skill and influence of demosthenes and his contemporaries their power in speaking was admired but still it was thought human their eloquence warmed and ravished the hearers but still it was thought the voice of man not the voice of god what advantage then had st paul above those of greece or rome i confess i can ascribe this excellence to nothing but the power of the doctrines he delivered which may have still the same influence on the hearers which have still the power when preached by a skilful orator to make us break out in the same expressions as the disciples who met our savior in their way to emmaus made use of did not our hearts burn within us when he talked to us by the way and while he opened to us the scriptures i may be thought bold in my judgment by some but i must affirm that no one orator has left us so visible marks and footsteps of his eloquence as our apostle it may perhaps be wondered at that in his reasonings upon idolatry at athens where eloquence was born and flourished he confines himself to strict argument only but my reader may remember what many authors of the best credit have assured us that all attempts upon the affections and strokes of oratory were expressly forbidden by the laws of that country in courts of judicature his want of eloquence therefore here was the effect of his exact conformity to the laws but his discourse on the resurrection to the corinthians his harangue before agrippa upon his own conversion and the necessity of that of others are truly great and may serve as full examples to those excellent rules for the sublime which the best of critics has left us the sum of all this discourse is that our clergy have no farther to look for an example of the perfection they may arrive at than to st pauls harangues that when he under the want of several advantages of nature as he himself tells us was heard admired and made a standard to succeeding ages by the best judge of a different persuasion in religion i say our clergy may learn that however instructive their sermons are they are capable of receiving a great addition which st paul has given them a noble example of and the christian religion has furnished them with certain means of attaining to  a contemplation of the omnipresence and omniscience of god about sunset walking in the open fields till the night insensibly fell upon me i at first amused myself with all the richness and variety of colors which appeared in the western parts of heaven in proportion as they faded away and went out several stars and planets appeared one after another till the whole firmament was in a glow the blueness of the ether was exceedingly heightened and enlivened by the season of the year and by the rays of all those luminaries that passed through it the galaxy appeared in its most beautiful white to complete the scene the full moon rose at length in that clouded majesty which milton takes notice of and opened to the eye a new picture of nature which was more finely shaded and disposed among softer lights than that which the sun had before discovered to us  as i was surveying the moon walking in her brightness and taking her progress among the constellations a thought rose in me which i believe very often perplexes and disturbs men of serious and contemplative natures david himself fell into it in that reflection when i consider the heavens the work of thy fingers the moon and the stars which thou have ordained what is man that thou art mindful of him and the son of man that thou regardest him in the same manner when i considered that infinite host of stars or to speak more philosophically of suns which were then shining upon me with those innumerable sets of planets or worlds which were moving round their respective suns when i still enlarged the idea and supposed another heaven of suns and worlds rising still above this which we discovered and these still enlightened by a superior firmament of luminaries which are planted at so great a distance that they may appear to the inhabitants of the former as the stars do to us in short whilst i pursued this thought i could not but reflect on that little insignificant figure which i my self bore amidst the immensity of gods works  were the sun which enlightens this part of the creation with all the host of planetary worlds that move about him utterly extinguished and annihilated they would not be missed more than a grain of sand upon the seashore the space they possess is so exceedingly little in comparison of the whole that it would scarce make a blank in the creation the chasm would be imperceptible to an eye that could take in the whole compass of nature and pass from one end of the creation to the other as it is possible there may be such a sense in our selves hereafter or in creatures which are at present more exalted than our selves we see many stars by the help of glasses which we do not discover with our naked eyes and the finer our telescopes are the more still are our discoveries huygenius carries this thought so far that he does not think it impossible there may be stars whose light is not yet traveled down to us since their first creation there is no question but the universe has certain bounds set to it but when we consider that it is the work of infinite power prompted by infinite goodness with an infinite space to exert itself in how can our imagination set any bounds to it  to return therefore to my first thought i could not but look upon my self with secret horror as a being that was not worth the smallest regard of one who had so great a work under his care and superintendency i was afraid of being overlooked amidst the immensity of nature and lost among that infinite variety of creatures which in all probability swarm through all these immeasurable regions of matter  in order to recover my self from this mortifying thought i considered that it took its rise from those narrow conceptions which we are apt to entertain of the divine nature we ourselves cannot attend to many different objects at the same time if we are careful to inspect some things we must of course neglect others this imperfection which we observe in our selves is an imperfection that cleaves in some degree to creatures of the highest capacities as they are creatures that is beings of finite and limited natures the presence of every being is confined to a certain measure of space and consequently his observation is stinted to a certain number of objects the sphere in which we move and act and understand is of a wider circumference to one creature than another according as we rise one above another in the scale of existence but the widest of these our spheres has its circumference when therefore we reflect on the divine nature we are so used and accustomed to this imperfection in ourselves that we cannot forbear in some measure ascribing it to him in whom there is no shadow of imperfection our reason indeed assures us that his attributes are infinite but the poorness of our conceptions is such that it cannot forbear setting bounds to every thing it contemplates till our reason comes again to our succor and throws down all those little prejudices which rises in us unawares and are natural to the mind of man  we shall therefore utterly extinguish this melancholy thought of our being overlooked by our maker in the multiplicity of his works and the infinity of those objects among which he seems to be incessantly employed if we consider in the first place that he is omnipresent and in the second that he is omniscient  if we consider him in his omnipresence his being passes through actuates and supports the whole frame of nature his creation and every part of it is full of him there is nothing he has made that is either so distant so little or so inconsiderable which he does not essentially inhabit his substance is within the substance of every being whether material or immaterial and as intimately present to it as that being is to it self it would be an imperfection in him were he able to remove out of one place into another or to withdraw himself from any thing he has created or from any part of that space which is diffused and spread abroad to infinity in short to speak of him in the language of the old philosopher he is a being whose center is every where and his circumference is no where  in the second place he is omnipresent as well as omniscient his omniscience indeed necessarily and naturally flows from his omnipresence he cannot but be conscious of every motion that arises in the whole material world which he thus essentially pervades and of every thought that is stirring in the intellectual world to every part of which he is thus intimately united several moralists have considered the creation as the temple of god which he has built with his own hands and which is filled with his presence others have considered infinite space as the receptacle or rather the habitation of the almighty but the noblest and most exalted way of considering this infinite space is that of sir isaac newtons who calls it the sensorium of the godhead brutes and men have their sensoriola or little sensoriums by which they apprehend the presence and perceive the actions of a few objects that lie contiguous to them their knowledge and observation turns within a very narrow circle but as god almighty cannot but perceive and know every thing in which he resides infinite space gives room to infinite knowledge and is as it were an organ to omniscience  were the soul separate from the body and with one glance of thought should start beyond the bounds of the creation should it for millions of years continue its progress through infinite space with the same activity it would still find itself within the embrace of its creator and encompassed round with the immensity of the godhead whilst we are in the body he is not less present with us because he is concealed from us o that i knew where i might find him says job behold i go forward but he is not there and backward but i cannot perceive him on the left hand where he does work but i cannot behold him he hides himself on the right hand that i cannot see him in short reason as well as revelation assures us that he cannot be absent from us notwithstanding he is undiscovered by us  in this consideration of god almightys omnipresence and omniscience every thought vanishes he cannot but regard every thing that has being especially such of his creatures who fear they are not regarded by him he is privy to all their thoughts and to that anxiety of heart in particular which is apt to trouble them on this occasion for as it is impossible he should overlook any of his creatures so we may be confident that he regards with an eye of mercy those who endeavor to recommend themselves to his notice and in an unfeigned humility of heart think themselves unworthy that he should be mindful of them  the happiness of souls in heaven i have always taken a particular pleasure in examining the opinions which men of different religions different ages and different countries have entertained concerning the immortality of the soul and the state of happiness which they promise themselves in another world for whatever prejudices and errors human nature lies under we find that either reason or tradition from our first parents has discovered to all people something in these great points which bears analogy to truth and to the doctrines opened to us by divine revelation i was lately discoursing on this subject with a learned person who has been very much conversant among the inhabitants of the more western parts of africa upon his conversing with several in that country he tells me that their notion of heaven or of a future state of happiness is this that every thing we there wish for will immediately present it self to us we find say they our souls are of such a nature that they require variety and are not capable of being always delighted with the same objects the supreme being therefore in compliance with this taste of happiness which he has planted in the soul of man will raise up from time to time they say every gratification which it is in the humor to be pleased with if we wish to be in groves or bowers among running streams or falls of water we shall immediately find our selves in the midst of such a scene as we desire if we would be entertained with music and the melody of sounds the consort rises upon our wish and the whole region about us is filled with harmony in short every desire will be followed by fruition and whatever a mans inclination directs him to will be present with him nor is it material whether the supreme power creates in conformity to our wishes or whether he only produces such a change in our imagination as makes us believe our selves conversant among those scenes which delight us our happiness will be the same whether it proceed from external objects or from the impressions of the deity upon our own private fancies this is the account which i have received from my learned friend notwithstanding this system of belief be in general very chimerical and visionary there is something sublime in its manner of considering the influence of a divine being on a human soul it has also like most other opinions of the heathen world upon these important points it has i say its foundation in truth as it supposes the souls of good men after this life to be in a state of perfect happiness that in this state there will be no barren hopes nor fruitless wishes and that we shall enjoy every thing we can desire but the particular circumstance which i am most pleased with in this scheme and which arises from a just reflection upon human nature is that variety of pleasures which it supposes the souls of good men will be possessed of in another world this i think highly probable from the dictates of both reason and revelation the soul consists of many faculties as the understanding and the will with all the senses both outward and inward or to speak more philosophically the soul can exert her self in many different ways of action she can understand will imagine see and hear love and discourse and apply her self to many other the like exercises of different kinds and natures but what is more to be considered the soul is capable of receiving a most exquisite pleasure and satisfaction from the exercise of any of these its powers when they are gratified with their proper objects she can be entirely happy by the satisfaction of the memory the sight the hearing or any other mode of perception every faculty is as a distinct taste in the mind and has objects accommodated to its proper relish dr tillotson somewhere says that he will not presume to determine in what consists the happiness of the blessed because god almighty is capable of making the soul happy by ten thousand different ways besides those several avenues to pleasure which the soul is endowed with in this life it is not impossible according to the opinions of many eminent divines but there may be new faculties in the souls of good men made perfect as well as new senses in their glorified bodies this we are sure of that there will be new objects offered to all those faculties which are essential to us  we are likewise to take notice that every particular faculty is capable of being employed on a very great variety of objects the understanding for example may be happy in the contemplation of moral natural mathematical and other kinds of truth the memory likewise may turn it self to an infinite multitude of objects especially when the soul shall have passed through the space of many millions of years and shall reflect with pleasure on the days of eternity every other faculty may be considered in the same extent  we cannot question but that the happiness of a soul will be adequate to its nature and that it is not endowed with any faculties which are to lie useless and unemployd the happiness is to be the happiness of the whole man and we may easily conceive to our selves the happiness of the soul whilst any one of its faculties is in the fruition of its chief good the happiness may be of a more exalted nature in proportion as the faculty employed is so but as the whole soul acts in the exertion of any of its particular powers the whole soul is happy in the pleasure which arises from any of its particular acts for notwithstanding as has been before hinted and as it has been taken notice of by one of the greatest modern philosophers we divide the soul into several powers and faculties there is no such division in the soul it self since it is the whole soul that remembers understands wills or imagines our manner of considering the memory understanding will imagination and the like faculties is for the better enabling us to express our selves in such abstracted subjects of speculation not that there is any such division in the soul it self  seeing then that the soul has many different faculties or in other words many different ways of acting that it can be intensely pleased or made happy by all these different faculties or ways of acting that it may be endowed with several latent faculties which it is not at present in a condition to exert that we cannot believe the soul is endowed with any faculty which is of no use to it that whenever any one of these faculties is transcendently pleased the soul is in a state of happiness and in the last place considering that the happiness of another world is to be the happiness of the whole man who can question but that there is an infinite variety in those pleasures we are speaking of and that this fullness of joy will be made up of all those pleasures which the nature of the soul is capable of receiving  we shall be the more confirmed in this doctrine if we observe the nature of variety with regard to the mind of man the soul does not care to be always in the same bent the faculties relieve one another by turns and receive an additional pleasure from the novelty of those objects about which they are conversant  revelation likewise very much confirms this notion under the different views which it gives us of our future happiness in the description of the throne of god it represents to us all those objects which are able to gratify the senses and imagination in very many places it intimates to us all the happiness which the understanding can possibly receive in that state where all things shall be revealed to us and we shall know even as we are known the raptures of devotion of divine love the pleasure of conversing with our blessed savior with an innumerable host of angels and with the spirits of just men made perfect are likewise revealed to us in several parts of the holy writings there are also mentioned those hierarchies or governments in which the blessed shall be ranged one above another and in which we may be sure a great part of our happiness will likewise consist for it will not be there as in this world where every one is aiming at power and superiority but on the contrary every one will find that station the most proper for him in which he is placed and will probably think that he could not have been so happy in any other station these and many other particulars are marked in divine revelation as the several ingredients of our happiness in heaven which all imply such a variety of joys and such a gratification of the soul in all its different faculties as i have been here mentioning  some of the rabbis tell us that the cherubims are a set of angels who know most and the seraphims a set of angels who love most whether this distinction be not altogether imaginary i shall not here examine but it is highly probable that among the spirits of good men there may be some who will be more pleased with the employment of one faculty than of another and this perhaps according to those innocent and virtuous habits or inclinations which have here taken the deepest root  i might here apply this consideration to the spirits of wicked men with relation to the pain they shall suffer in every one of their faculties and the respective miseries which shall be appropriated to each faculty in particular but leaving this to the reflection of my readers i shall conclude with observing how we ought to be thankful to our great creator and rejoice in the being which he has bestowed upon us for having made the soul susceptible of pleasure by so many different ways we see by what a variety of passages joy and gladness may enter into the thoughts of man how wonderfully a human spirit is framed to imbibe its proper satisfactions and taste the goodness of its creator we may therefore look into our selves with rapture and amazement and cannot sufficiently express our gratitude to him who has encompassed us with such a profusion of blessiegs and opened in us so many capacities of enjoying them  there cannot be a stronger argument that god has designed us for a state of future happiness and for that heaven which he has revealed to us than that he has thus naturally qualified the soul for it and made it a being capable of receiving so much bliss he would never have made such faculties in vain and have endowed us with powers that were not to be exerted on such objects as are suited to them it is very manifest by the inward frame and constitution of our minds that he has adapted them to an infinite variety of pleasures and gratifications which are not to be met with in this life we should therefore at all times take care that we do not disappoint this his gracious purpose and intention toward us and make those faculties which he formed as so many qualifications for happiness and rewards to be the instruments of pain and punishment  finis
