an address to young ministers  by john brown late of haddington  london printed for t chapman no     fleet street       price three pence  an address to young ministers my dear friends when i am gradually stepping into the eternal state to appear before the judgment seat of christ permit me to beseech you as you wish to promote his honor and the eternal salvation of your own and your hearers souls    see that ye be real christians yourselves i now more and more see that nothing less than real real christianity is fit to die with and make an appearance before god are ye then indeed born again born from above born of the spirit created in christ jesus unto good works  new creatures in christ jesus having all old things passed away and all things become new are ye indeed the circumcision which worship god in the spirit habitually reading meditating praying preaching conversing with your hearts under the influence of the holy ghost have you no confidence in the flesh no confidence in your selfrighteousness your learning your address your care and diligence your gifts and graces  but being emptied of self in every form are poor in spirit less than the least of all saints and the least of all gods mercies nay the very chief of sinners in your own fight has it pleased god to reveal his son in you and to instruct you with a strong hand to count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of jesus christ as your lord and to count them but dung that you may win him and be found in him not having your own righteousness but the righteousness which is of god by faith  and to know the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings  and to press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of god in christ jesus if you be or become graceless preachers or ministers of the gospel how terrible is your condition if you open your bible the sentence of your redoubled damnation flasheth into your conscience from every page if you compose your sermon you but draw up a tremendous indictment against yourselves if you argue against or reprove other mens sins you but aggravate your own if you publish the holy law of god you but add to your rebellion against it and make it an awful witness against your treacherous dissimulation if you announce its threatenings and mention hell with all its insupportable torments you but infeoff yourselves in it and serve yourselves heirs to it as the inheritance appointed you by the almighty if you speak of christ and his excellencies fullness love and labors it is but to trample him under your feet if you take his covenant and gospel into your mouth it is but to profane them and cast them forth to be trodden under foot of men if you talk of spiritual experiences you do but despite to the spirit of grace if you commend father son and holy ghost and invite sinners to new covenant fellowship with them you but treacherously stab them under the fifth rib and betray them with a kiss and from your heart cry this is the heir the god come let us kill him while you hold up the glass of gods law or gospel to others you turn its back to yourselves the gospel which ye preach to others is hid  is a savor of death unto death to you the vail remaining on your hearts and the god of this world having blinded your minds  without the saving the hearttransforming knowledge of christ and him crucified all your knowledge is but an accursed puffer up and murderer of your own souls and unless the grace of god make an uncommon stretch to save you how desperate is your condition perhaps no person under heaven bids more unlikely to be saved than a graceless minister  his conscience is so overcharged with guilt so seared as with an hot iron and his heart so hardened by the abuse of the gospel  alas my dear pupils must all my instructions all the strivings of the holy ghost all your reading all your meditations all your sermons all your evangelical principles all your profession all your prayers as traps and snares take and bind any of you hand and foot that you may be cast as unprofitable servants into utter darkness with all the contents of your bible and other books  all your gifts and apparentlike graces as it were inlaid in your conscienes that as fuel or oil they may for ever feed or enrage the flames of gods wrath upon your souls after being set for a time at the gate of heaven to point others into it  after prophesying in christs name and wasting yourselves to show others the way of salvation and to light up the friends of our redeemer to their heavenly rest  must your own lamp go out in everlasting darkness and ye be bidden depart from me i never knew you ye workers of iniquity  must i must all the churches behold you at last brought forth and condemned as archtraitors to our redeemer must you for ever in the most tremendous manner sink into the bottomless pit under the weight of the blood of the great god our savior  under the weight of murdered truths murdered convictions murdered gifts murdered ministrations of the gospel and murdered souls of men    ponder much as before god what proper furniture you have for the ministerial work and labor to increase it to him that has shall be given has jesus bestowed on you the holy ghost what distinct knowledge have you of the mysteries of the kingdom what aptness have you to teach bringing out of the good treasure of your own heart things new and old what ability to make the deep mysteries of the gospel plain to persons of weak capacities and to represent things delightful or terrible in a proper and affecting manner what proper quickness in conceiving of divine things and what rooted inclination to study them as persons devoted to matters of infinite importance what peculiar fitness have you for the pulpit qualifying you in a plain serious orderly and earnest manner to screw the truths of god into the consciences of your hearers with what stock of selfexperienced truths and texts of inspiration did or do you enter on the ministerial work of what truths relative to the law of god  or relative to sin satan or the desertions and terrors of god has your soul not only seen the evidence but felt the power what declarations promises offers and invitations of the glorious gospel have ye with joy and rejoicing of heart found and eaten and therein tasted and seen that god is good of what inspired truths and texts can you say even so we have believed and therefore we speak what we have seen and heard with the father and tasted and handled of the word of life that we declare unto you thrice happy preacher whose deeply experienced heart is next to his bible his principal notebook    take heed that your call from christ and his spirit to your ministerial work be not only real but evident without this you can neither be duly excited or encouraged to your work nor hope nor pray for divine success in it nor bear up aright under the difficulties you must encounter if you attempt to be faithful if you run unsent by jesus christ and his spirit notwithstanding the utmost external regularity in your license call and ordination you in the whole of your ministrations must act the part of a sacrilegious thief and robber a pretended and treacherous ambassador to christ and his father and a murderer of mens souls not profiting them at all what direction  what support  what assistance  what encouragement  what reward can you then expect ponder therefore as before god have you taken this honor to yourselves or were ye called of god as was aaron has jesus christ sent you to preach the gospel and laid upon you a delightful and awful necessity to preach it while he powerfully determined you to follow providence and avoid every selfish and irregular step toward entrance into the office as a mean of eating a piece of bread or enjoying carnal ease and honor did he breathe on you and cause you to receive the holy ghost  filling you with deep compassion to the perishing souls of men and a deep sense of your own unfitness for such arduous work and fervent desire that if the lord were willing to use you as instruments of winning souls he would sanctify you and make you meet for his work  perhaps providentially shut out from other callings to which you or your parents inclined did you in your education go up bound in the spirit by the love of christ burning in your hearts and constraining you cheerfully to surrender yourselves to poverty reproach and hatred of men for promoting his name and honor and the salvation of men in the world  what oracles of god powerfully impressed on your soul have directed and encouraged you to his work  know you in what form jesus christ gave you your commission whether to open the eyes of the gentiles and turn them from darkness to light and from the power of satan unto god  that they may receive forgiveness of sins and an inheritance among them who are sanctified by faith in him  or to go make the heart of this people fat their ears heavy and to shut their eyes    see that your end in entering into or executing your office be single and disinterested dare you appeal to him whose eyes are as a flame of fire and who searches the hearts and tries the reins to give to every man according to his works that you never inclined to be put into the priests office that you might eat a piece of bread and look every one for his gain from his quarter that ye seek not great things for yourselves that ye covet no mans silver gold or apparel that ye seek not mens property but themselves that you may win them to christ for their eternal welfare that ye seek not your own honor ease or temporal advantage but the things of christ and his people that ye seek not honor or glory of men but the honor of christ and his father in the eternal salvation of souls and have determined to prosecute this end through whatever distress or danger the lord may be pleased to lay in your way    see that your minds be deeply impressed with the nature extent and importance of your ministerial work  that therein it is required of you as ambassadors for christ  as stewards of the mysteries and manifold grace of god  to be faithful to serve the lord with your spirit and with much humility in the gospel of his son to testify repentance toward god and faith toward our lord jesus christ not keeping back or shunning to declare every part of the counsel of god  or any profitable instruction reproof or encouragement and not moved with any reproach persecution hunger or nakedness  to be ready not only to be bound but to die for the name of the lord jesus in order to finish your course with joy bearing with the infirmities of the weak and striving together in prayer that the word of the lord may have free course and be glorified and your messages provided by god and made acceptable to your hearers you must labor with much fear and trembling determined to know to glory in and make known nothing but jesus christ and him crucified  preaching the gospel not with enticing words of mans wisdom as menpleasers but with great plainness of speech in demonstration of the spirit and with power  speaking the things which are freely given you by god not in the words which mans wisdom teaches but in words which the holy ghost teaches comparing spiritual things with spiritual  as having the mind of christ always triumphing in him  and making manifest the savor of the knowledge of him in every place that you may be a sweet savor of christ in them who are saved and in them who perish  as of sincerity as of god in the sight of god speaking in christ and through the mercy of god not fainting but renouncing the hidden things of dishonesty  not walking in craftiness nor handling the word of god deceitfully or corrupting the truth but manifesting the truth to every mans conscience as in the sight of god  not preaching yourselves but christ jesus the lord and yourselves servants to the church for his sake always bearing about his dying that his life may be minifested in you  and knowing the terror of the lord and deeply impressed with the account which you and your hearers must give to him of your whole conduct in the day of judgment  awed by his infinite authority and constrained and enflamed by his love you must persuade men beseeching them to be reconciled unto god and making yourselves manifest to god and to their conscience  and as their edification requires changing your voice and turning yourselves every way and becoming all things to all men in order to gain them to christ  jealous over them with a godly jealousy in order to espouse them to him as chaste virgins  travailing in birth till he be formed in their hearts you must take heed to your ministry which you have received in the lord that you may fulfill it  stir up the gifts which were given you  give yourselves wholly to reading exhortations and doctrine  and take heed to yourselves and to the doctrine which you preach that you may save yourselves and them that hear you  watching for their souls as they who do and must give an account for them to god  rightly dividing the word of truth and giving every man his portion in due season faithfully warning every man with tears night and day teaching every man particularly young ones and laboring to present every man perfect in christ jesus  and warring not after the flesh nor with carnal weapons but with such as are mighty through god to the pulling down of strong holds and casting down imaginations and subduing every thought and affection to the obedience of christ having him for the end of your conversation and holding fast the form of sound words in faith in and love to him  not entangling yourselves with the affairs of this life nor ashamed of the lord or of his cause or prisoners but ready to endure hardships as good soldiers of jesus christ ye must go forth without the camp bearing his reproach and exposed as spectacles of sufferings to angels and men must not faint under your tribulations but feed the flock of god which he has purchased with his own blood and over which the holy ghost has made you overseers  preaching the word in season and out of season reproving rebuking and exhorting with all longsuffering and doctrine  taking the oversight of your people not by constraint but willingly not for filthy lucre of worldly gain or larger stipends but of a ready mind  neither as being lords over gods heritage but as examples to the flock  exercising yourselves to have a conscience void of offense toward god and toward man  having a good conscience willing in all things to live honestly  exercised to godliness  kindly affectioned disinterested holy just and unblameable  prudent examples of the believers in conversation in charity in faith and purity  fleeing youthful lusts and following after righteousness peace faith charity  not striving but being gentle unto all men  in meekness instructing them who oppose themselves  avoiding foolish and unlearned questions  and old wives fables  fleeing from perverse disputings and worldly mindedness as most dangerous snares and following after righteousness godliness faith love patience meekness  fighting the good fight of faith and laying hold on eternal life  keeping your trust of gospel truth and ministerial office and without partiality or precipitancy committing the same to faithful men who may be able to teach others  and in fine faithfully laboring in the lord to try and confute and censure false teachers publicly rebuke or excommunicate open transgressors restore such as have been overtaken in a fault in the spirit of meekness  and having compassion on them to pull them out of the fire hating even the garment spotted by the flesh and never conniving at or partaking with any in their sins who is sufficient for these things may your sufficincy be of god and as your days are so may your strength be    see that ye take heed to your spirits that ye deal not treacherously with the lord in approaching to or executing the ministerial office keep your hearts with all diligence for out of it are the issues of eternal life or death to yourselves and others building up yourselves on your most holy faith and praying in the holy ghost keep yourselves in the love of god looking for the mercy of our lord jesus christ unto the eternal life if you do not ardently love christ how can you faithfully and diligently feed his lambs  his sheep alas how many precious sermons exhortations and instructions are quite marred and poisoned by coming through the cold carnal and careless heart of the preacher and being attended with his imprudent untender and lukewarm life if you have not a deepfelt experience of the terrors of the lord  of the bitterness of sin vanity of this world and importance of eternity  and of the conscience quieting and heartcaptivating virtue of jesus bleeding love how can you be duly serious and hearty in preaching the gospel if all influenced by a predominate love to christ your heart be not fixed on everlasting things and powerfully animated to an eager following of peace and holiness how can you without the most abominable treachery declare to men their chief happiness and the true method of obtaining it if your graces be not kept lively your loins girt and your lamps burning all enkindled by the heartconstraining love of christ how cold carnal and blasted must be your sacred ministrations if your work as ambassadors of christ be to transact matters of everlasting importance between an infinite god and immortal but perishing souls of men if the honors and privileges of it be so invaluable what inexpressible need have you of habitual dependence on christ by a lively faith what selfdenial what ardent love to christ and his father what disinterested regard to his honor what compassion to souls what prudence what faithfulness and diligence what humility and holy zeal what spirituality of mind and conversation what order what plainness what fervor what just temperature of mildness and severity  is necessary in every part of it  if while you minister in holy things your lusts prevail and are indulged you have less of real or lively chistianity than the most weak and uncircumspect saints under your charge  if your evil heart of unblief fearfully carry you off from the living god and you can live unconcerned while the powerful and sanctifying presence of god is withheld from yourselves or your flocks  how sad is your and their case  if your indwelling pride be allowed to choose your company your dress your victuals  nay your text your subject your order your language  if it be allowed to indite your thoughts and to the reproach and blasting of the gospel of christ to deck your sermon with tawdry ornaments and fancies as if it were a stage play and to blunt and muffle up its sharp arrows with silken smoothness and swollen bombast  if it be allowed to kindle your fervor and form your looks your tone your action  or to render you enraptured or selfconceited because of subsequent applause  or sad and provoked because your labors are contemned how dreadful is your danger and that of your hearers how can ministerial labors originating in pride spurred on by the fame of learning diligence or holiness  hurt the interests of satan from whose influence they proceed  if pride be allowed to cause you to envy or wound the characters of such as differ from or outshine you or to make you reluctant to christian reproof from your inferiors how fearful is your guilt and danger pride indulged is no more consistent with a christian character than drunkenness and whoredom  if you take up or cleave to any principle or practice in religion in the way of factious contention how abominable to god is the sower of discord among brethren if you undervalue the peace and prosperity of the church of christ and are not afflicted with her in all her afflictons how cruel and unchristlike your conduct if in justly proving your opponent deceivers and blasphemers you by your angry manner plead the cause of the devil will god accept it as an offering at your hands if you are slothful in studying or declaring the truths of christ  if to save labor or expense you are inactive or averse to help such as have no fixed ministrations or to contrive or prosecute projects for advancing the kingdom of christ and promoting the salvation of men how great is your baseness and fearful your hazard   think as before god did jesus christ furnish you for and put you into the ministry that you might idle away or prostitute your devoted time tear his church conceal or mangle his truths betray his interests or starve and murder the souls of men are not your people the flock of god which he purchased with his own blood will you then dare to destroy his peculiar property and portion and attempt to frustrate the end of his death did jesus die for mens souls and will you grudge a small labor or expense to promote his honor in their eternal salvation if the son of god was crucified for men  crucified for you will you refuse through his spirit to crucify your selfishness your pride your sloth your worldly and covetous disposition in order to save yourselves and them that hear you  while your own salvation and the salvation of mulitudes are so deeply connected with your faithfulness and diligence  while the powers of hell and earth to set themselves in opposition to your work that in your falls they may triumph over christ your master and his church  while so many eyes of god angels and men are upon you why do you ever think or speak of eternal things of heaven and hell of jesuss person offices righteousness love and free salvation without the most serious and deep impression of their importance while perhaps you preach your last sermon and have before you and on every hand of you hundreds or scores of perishing souls suspended over hell by the frail thread of mortal life not knowing what a day or hour may bring forth  souls already in the hands of the devil and as it were just departing to be with him in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone  souls already slain by the gospel of our salvation blasted and cursed to them partly by your means why do not tears of deep concern mingle themselves with every point you study every sentence you publish in the name of christ  when multitudes of your hearers some of them never to hear you more and just leaping off into the depths of hell are in respect of their needs crying with an exceeding bitter cry minister help help we perish  we utterly perish  pluck the brand out of the burning fiery furnace  why spend your devoted time in idle visits unedifying converse useless reading or unnecessary sleep  what if while you are so employed some of your hearers drop into eternal flames and begin their everlasting cursing of you for not doing more to promote their salvation when jesus arises to require their blood at your hand how accursed will appear that knowledge which was not improven for his honor who bestowed it that ease which issued in the damnation of multitudes that conformity to the world which permitted or that unedifying converse which encouraged your hearers to sleep into hell in their sins  that pride or luxury which restrained your charity or disgracefully plunged you into debt  since my dear pupils all the truths of god all the ordinances and privileges of his church  the eternal salvation of multitudes and the infinitely precious honor of jesus christ and his father as connected with the present and future ages of time are entrusted to you how necessary that like jesus your master you should be faithful in all things to him who appointed you  if you do the work of our lord deceitfully  in what tremendous manner shall your parents who devoted and educated you for it  your teachers who prepared you for it the seminaries of learning in which you received your instruction  the years which you spent in your studies  all the gifts which were bestowed upon you  all the thoughts words and works of god in the redemption of men  all the oracles commands promises and threatenings of god which direct inculcate or enforce your duty  all the examples of jesus christ and all his apostles prophets and faithful ministers  all the leaves of your bible all the books of your closet  all the engagements you have come under  all the sermons which you preach  all the instructions which you tender to others  all the discipline which you exercise  all the maintenance which you receive  all the honors which you enjoy or expect  all the testimonies which you give against the negligence of your parents masters ministers or magistrates  all the vows and resolutions which you have made to reform  and all the prayers which you have presented to god for assistance or success  rise up against you as witnesses in the day of the lord    see that ye as workmen who need not be ashamed earnestly labor rightly to divide the word of truth according to the capacities needs and particular occasions of your hearers giving every one of them their portion in due season never make your own case your inclination or honor but the need of souls and the glory of christ the regulator of your choice of subjects labor chiefly on the principal points of religion to bring down the fundamental mysteries of the gospel to the capacities of your hearers and inculcate on their consciences the great points of union and fellowship with christ regeneration justification and sanctification will require all your grace learning and labor never aim at tickling the ears or pleasing the fancies of your hearers but at convincing their consciences enlightening their minds attracting their affections and renewing their wills that they may be persuaded and enabled to embrace and improve jesus christ as freely offered to them in the gospel for wisdom righteousness sanctification and redemption labor to preach the law as a broken covenant  the gospel of salvation  and the law as a rule of life  not only in their extensive matter but also in their proper order and connection it is only when they are properly connected that the precious truths of god appear in their true luster and glory it is at your infinite hazard and the infinite hazard of them that hear you if you even by negligence either blend or put asunder that law and gospel which jesus christ has so delightfully joined together no where is it more necessary to take heed than in preaching up the duties of holiness let all be founded in union to and communion with christ all enforced by the pattern love righteousness and benefits of christ    you have stated yourselves public witnesses for jesus christ who profess to adhere to and propagate his injured truths  and to commemorate with thankfulness the remarkable mercies which he has bestowed on our church and nation  and to testify against and mourn over our own and our fathers fearful backslidings from that covenanted work of reformation once attained in our land see that ye be judicious upright constant and faithful in your profession i now approach death heartily satisfied with our excellent westminster confession of faith catechisms and form of church government  and cordially adhering to these covenants by which our fathers solemnly bound themselves and their posterity to profess the doctrines and practice the duties therein contained i look upon the secession as indeed the cause of god but sadly mismanaged and dishonored by myself and others alas for that pride passion selfishness and unconcern for the glory of christ and spiritual edification of souls which has so often prevailed  alas for our want of due meekness gentleness holy zeal selfdenial hearty grief for sin compassion to souls in immediate connection with us or left in the established church which became distinguished witnesses for christ alas that we did not chiefly strive to pray better preach better and live better than our neighbors  study to see every thing with your own eyes but never indulge an itch after novelties most of those which are now esteemed such are nothing but old errors which were long ago justly refuted varnished over with some new expressions never by your peevishness contentions eagerness about worldly things or the like make others think lightly of the cause of god among your hands if i mistake not the churches are entering into a fearful cloud of apostasy and trouble but he that endures to the end shall be saved be ye faithful unto the death and christ shall give you a crown of life but if any man draw back gods soul shall have no pleasure in him    always improve and live on that blessed encouragement which is offered to you as christians and ministers in the gospel let all your wants be on christ my god shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by christ jesus cast all your cares on him for he cares for you cast all your burdens on him and he will sustain you if your holy services through your mismanagement occasion your uncommon guilt his blood cleanses from all sin you have an advocate with the father jesus christ the righteous who is the propitiation for your sins if you be often difficult how to act he has said the meek will he guide in judgment the meek will he teach his way  i will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shall go i will guide thee with mine eye set upon thee i will lead the blind in a way which they know not  if you be discouraged because of your rough way and your want of strength he has said when the poor and needy seek water and there is none and their tongue fails for thirst i the lord will hear them i the god of israel will not forsake them i will open rivers in high places fear not for i am with thee be not dismayed for i am thy god i will strengthen thee yea i will help thee i will uphold thee the right hand of my righteousness fear not worm jacob  i will help thee says the lord thy redeemer i will wake thee a new sharp threshing instrument  and thou shall thresh the mountains my grace shall be sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness as thy days are so shall thy strength be  if your troubles be many he has said when thou passest through the waters i will be with thee  the rivers shall not overflow thee when thou walk through the fire thou shall not be burnt nor shall the flame kindle upon thee  if your incomes be small and pinching ye know the grace of our lord jesus christ that though he was rich yet for our sakes he became poor that we through his poverty might be rich he shall see his seed the travail of his soul and be satisfied and he has promised i will abundantly bless her provision and satisfy her poor with bread i will satiate the soul of her priests with fatness a salary of remarkable fellowship with christ and of success in winning souls is the most delightful and enriching  if your labors appear to have little success be the more diligent and dependent on christ never mourn as they that have no hope let not the eunuch say i am a dry tree jesus has said i will pour water on him that is thirsty and floods on the dry ground i will pour my spirit on thy seed and my blessing on thine offspring a seed shall serve him the whole earth shall be filled with his glory the kingdoms of this world shall become the kingdoms of our lord and his christ believe it on the testimony of god himself believe it on the testimony of all his faithful servants and if mine were of any avail i should add it that there is no master so kind as christ no service so pleasant and profitable as that of christ and no reward so full satisfying and permanent as that of christ let us therefore begin all things from christ carry on all things with and through christ and let all things aim at and end in christ  finis
