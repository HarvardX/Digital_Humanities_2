disquisition on government and civil liberty it gave me much concern to find that you had not written it in verse such images and such sentiments such wit and such arguments were surely too good to be wasted on prose and you who have written verse so long and with so much facility are highly inexcusable for not having employed that talent on so important an occasion as the present when you had taken upon you to confute so many absurd principles concerning government and liberty which have of late been disseminated with unusual industryprinciples let me add which were still more industriously disseminated at the revolution by lock at the accession by hoadly and a hundred years before either by hooker principles which you say are as false as mischievous as inconsistent with common sense as with all human society and which require nothing more than to be fairly stated to be refuted  the pious poet herbert i think tells us that  a verse may catch him who a sermon flies why then should you discard verse when you intended to catch such careless readers as would be apt to fly a sermon why by dividing your discourse into five methodical heads should you make it appear as formal as the gravest pulpitlecture ever delivered by old bishop beveridge or young bishop bagot i protest mr jenyns i cannot account for this strange proceeding  however that such sort of readers may read you i have attempted to do that for your benefit and theirs which you would not do for them or for yourself and unequal as i am to the task have dressed up your two first and as i think principal topics in as easy and fashionable meter as i was capable of writing i know you would have done this much better but as my work is but a fragment i am not without my hopes that what i have done may be a spur to your indolence and that you may be tempted not only to correct but complete it  but when i say that i have versified you i take a pride in boasting that i am not your mere versifier i take a pleasure too in owning that you yourself led me to attempt a nobler species of composition i had read some years ago your very delectable eclogue of the squire and the parson written on occasion of that glorious peace the honor of making which is to be inscribed one day may it be a late one on the mausoleum of the earl of bute this sir led me to think of giving my present performance a dramatic cast so far as an eclogue can possess that title on this idea having resolved to make you my tityrus i had not far to seek for a melibaeus a brother writer who has of late endeavored to disseminate principles similar to some of yours with unusual though abortive industry immediately occurred to my imagination and as immediately i resolved to read his more elaborate treatise in order to enable me to execute my plan with greater exactitude and better preservation of sentiment and character  although i must own that this exercitation of my patience cost me many a yawn yet i found to my great satisfaction that this writer allowed for true what you hold to be false those two first principles of mr lock that men are equal and that men are free see tucker on government chapter  st  i concluded therefore that he was a very proper person to dispute those points with you accordingly without farther ceremonial i set you both down not indeed sub tegmine fagi but for the sake of the costume in a snug town coffeehouse and there entered you fairly into debate  if on your part sir i have ever done more than elucidated any of those assertions which you call arguments i humbly ask your pardon and on the deans if i have made him a little too lively and spiritual i as humbly ask his i know nothing does so much harm to an ecclesiastic in the road of perferment as the bare suspicion of being witty but as the divine in question has long been a dean and has sworn that he will never be a bishop i hope no great harm is done  that you may long remain on the illustrious list of pensioners even after the useful board from which you derive that right shall be no more that having changed from tory to whig in the ministry of the duke of newcastle from whig to tory under those or rather that of lords bute and north you may now again change from tory to whig under the new administration  and since we have it on very eloquent evidence that it is now the fashion for persons of the greatest consequence to be no longer in shackles that you may soon cease to be encumbered with your present slavish principles is the sincere and fervent wish of  sir your most obsequious servant malcolm macgreggor knightsbridge may  st      the dean and the squire in coffeehouse of good account not far from bondstreet called the mount soame jenyns met the dean of gloucester and as they sat in lounging posture each on his bench and face to face the dean began in tone of bass while jenyns in his treble key replied with much alacrity repeat my muse the alternate strains that flowed from these arcadian swains who both were equally alert or to deny or to assert  arcades ambo et cantare pares and respondere parati  virg  dean squire jenyns since with like intent we both have writ on government and both stand stubborn as a rock against the principles of lock let us like brother meeting brother compare our notes with one another it is true i have not had time to look though much i wished it in your book  squire doctor my book is quickly read  dean i would other crotchets in my head the dean had been employed in writing his cui bono to mons neckar which is said by persons who have read it to contain many curious crotchets cui bono  but you i guess have studied mine  squire no to my shame not even a line  dean that is something strange  yet fortunate for now on par we shall debate  squire true who to play at whist regards when he that deals has seen the cards  dean well put first then it is fit i deem you tell me how you treat your theme  squire i controvert those five positions which whigs pretend are the conditions of civil rule and liberty that men are equal born  and free  that kings derive their lawful sway all from the peoples yea and nay  that compact is the only ground on which a prince his rights can found  lastly i scout that idle notion that government is put in motion and stopped again like clock or chime just as we want them to keep time  dean sblood do you controvert them all  squire indeed i do sir great and small  dean youre a bold man my master jenyns and have good right to count your winnings if you succeed  but i who dare as much as most to go so far had not the courage i assure ye though i suborned a tory jury before the dean published his elaborate treatise he printed it first only for the perusal of certain friends who were either tories from principle or discreion it may therefore reasonably be supposed that in miltons phrase it numbered many choice intellects among our great churchmen the mitred author of the letter to the cocoatree written at the commencement of lord butes administration from which i have taken my motto was amongst these personages and it is not to be doubted but it would receive many improvements from his adroit and masterly hand   squire that men were equal born at first i hold of all whig lies the worst but yet if only this they mean that you and i good mr dean were equally produced it is true for i was born as much as you but now comparing size and strength our bodys bulk our noses length the periwigs that grace our pate my little wit your learning great we find we are unequal quite  dean my honest friend youre too polite your wit lord hardwicke deigns to own surpasses every wits in town and none ever doubted hardwickes taste who ever were bid to hardwickes feast but yet i fear at this arch quibble the lockians will do more than nibble they say and with them i agree that as to mens equality it rests on native rights they have not to become anothers slave or tamely bear a tyrants yoke the passage in mr lockes treatise which the dean here alludes to seems to be this though i said that all men are by nature equal i cannot be supposed to understand all sorts of equality age or virtue may give men a just precedence excellency of parts and merit may place others above the common level birth may subject some and alliance or benefits others to pay an observance to those to whom nature gratitude or other respects may have made it due and yet all this consists with the equality which all men are in in respect of jurisdiction or dominion one over another which was the equality i there chapter  d spoke of as proper to the business in hand being that equal right that every man has to his natural freedom without being subjected to the will or authority of any other man chapter   sec    to this the dean accedes in his first chapter first then i agree with mr lock and his disciples that there is a sense in which it may be said that no man is born the political subject of another  this truth you parry with a joke  squire jokes mr dean i would have you know have parried many a stouter blow a joke like this as i conceive is reasons representative who vested with his rights is sent to disputations parliament  dean yet scorns like some they patriots call to vote as he instructs at all  squire sometimes he may  but to proceed  all men at birth it is agreed have equal learning wit and power though at lucinas squalling hour the newborn babes in nurses lap have only power to suck her pap good heavens to talk of wit and learning in infants void of all discerning is just as if these whigs disputed as most fools do to be confuted whether their teeth in breadth and length had equal size and equal strength when bless each little slobbering mouth it had not cut a single tooth  dean your instance i confess is pretty i wish it were as apt as witty  squire but let us give them all they ask their equal birth a harder task i think remains behind to prove that men through life must equal move none ever assume a jot of power more than he had at natal hour strange doctrine this ye whigs shall none be long and lank as jenkinson none grow to full six feet or more because some only measure four or because hunter cannot treat us with different size of sameaged faetus thus mr dean the point i have proved and if your reverence is so moved you will find with like facility i prove they all are not born free  dean my sprightly squire if this be proving then billing is the whole of loving dame logic knows whenever i meet her with more substantial sport i treat her these whigs will answer your demand with saying all they understand by power is that alone is just which to a few the rest entrust and to assume without assent is force not legal government so lock government into whatsoever hands it is put being entrusted with this condition and for this end that men might have and secure their properties the prince or senate however it may have power to make laws for the regulating of property between the subjects one amongst another yet can never have a power to take to themselves the whole or any part of the subjects property without their own consent for this would be in effect to leave them no property at all chapter xi sec      as to your simile of size they will say your brains are in your eyes but now go on  squire their next assertion you will find affords me more diversion for how should men be ever born free when to be born is slavery an imposition in itself do parents ask the little elf ere they beget him his good leave or to beget or to conceive or does he approbation give by self or representative  dean yet when begot in my opinion he is then the heir to selfdominion has right both to be born and bred to suck the breast   squire and p  his bed  dean he has nay more i would have you know protection while in embrio is his ever you can justly date his quasicompact with the state children are entitled to protection whilst in embrio though they neither did nor could enter into any compact with the state for that purpose tucker on civil government p   i have taken the liberty to add the term quasi in my version of this passage to make it more analogous to the learned writers general sentiments who allows of no compact but what he is pleased to term quasi  once sir i knew a pious lady who just as she was getting ready for church one eastersunday morn with labourpains was sorely torn the church good soul she loved so dearly that with her spouse she chose to parley nor would she let the midwife lay her till she had been at morning prayer when lo in midst of all this fray before mama had time to pray her heir a freeborn british boy bolted to light and liberty  squire your story mr dean is pleasant and wrapped withal in terms right decent yet vainly sure such proof you bring one swallow does not make a spring i say in spite of your strange tale for full nine months he lies in jail and what a jail so little roomy so dank so sultry and so gloomy howard who every prison knows never ventured there to thrust his nose yet there he lies unlucky wight deprived of sunshine and of sight floating in brine like a young porpus till by obstetric habeas corpus the brat is plucked to liberty but tell me is such freedom free in swaddling clothes he now is bound like styx though fate had fast bound her with styx nine times round her popes ode on st caecilias day that gird him nine times round they squeeze his navel press his head feed him with water and with bread thus nine months more he lies in chains and when his freedom he regains he puts it to so bad a use it is found he must not yet go loose tyrannic nurse then claims her right to plague him both by day and night then grave as pope and gruff as turk prelatic schoolmaster like york thrashes the wretch with grammars flail to mend his head corrects his tail and this with most despotic fury heedless of mercy law and jury  dean sir you have a happy vein for satire and touch it with a main du maitre yet why sir treat mild mm thus his grace you know is one of us  squire i ask his pardon at the time he chanced to hitch into my rhyme  had not this unlucky bolt been shot by the squire it is probable the dean would not have been thrown off his scent but would have answered all that had been asserted in some such manner as mr lock does children i confess are not born in this full state of equality though they are born to it their parents have a sort of rule and jurisdiction over them when they come into the world and for some time after but it is but a temporary one the bonds of this subjection are like the swaddling cloths they are wrapped up in and supported by in the weakness of their infancy age and reason as they grow up loosen them till at length they drop quite off and leave a man at his own free disposal chapter   sec    this passage and the other two already quoted seem to be a sufficient answer to mr jenyns on his two first heads all his objections turn on the term born whereas lockes propositions are men are by nature equal and by nature free that is have equal natural rights in their persons and liberty  but to our point  thus far i have stated the boy is born and educated and now he walks the world at large yet has he got a free discharge no volens nolens as at school he still must yield to civil rule a subject born he is subject still not governed by his mere selfwill but if he breaks the laws in force or kills his man or steals a horse however he may dispute their right and coke with burgersdicius fight must make at tyburn his confession  dean i fear sir here you beg the question a subject born in any state may if he please depatriate and go for reasons weak or weighty to zealandnew or otaheite  squire yet there what freedom will he have when made queen obereas slave her majesty may lay a tax i fear would weaken stronger backs than even was yours my doughty dean when nervd with youth and stout eighteen  dean perhaps she might then let us suppose to some unpeopled isle he goes and takes a mistress in his sleeve to live as adam did with eve or say that he had luck to find a hundred more of the same mind to migrate with their mates by dozens and there to live like catercousins we will not call them sirs and madams but a cool hundred eves and adams i think they would or soon or late by quasicompact found a state here the dean turns aside to his own ingenious hypothesis which he makes the true basis of civil government and which the more to disseminate it i shall here briefly explain he supposes that a hundred adams and eves should all be produced full grown and in conjugal pairs and then concludes that they would naturally herd together and form a civil society from their instinctive love of living together as gregarious animals but as some might object that another instinctive appetite would speedily disturb the peace of this society and that horaces tetrrima belli causa might make it a state of war he sagely provides against this by noting that the appetite between the sexes can have no place in the question because it is not of that sort which renders mankind gregarious yet as he also owns that the most solitary animals at certain seasons converse in pairs it is necessary for the support of his hypothesis that all his adams and eves should be as chaste as turtles and therefore i have called them a cool hundred an epithet which the reader sees is here far from being an expletive but highly emphatical for if the deans hundred adams and eves were not more cool than an hundred pairs of people of fashion whom i could mention it is to be feared that many of the males in his civil society would not only be gregarious animals but absolutely horned cattle see tucker on government p      what think you squire of that scotch peer the late lord fairfax usually distinguished by the name of lord fairfax of virginia  who wenching held so very dear i dont aver his taste was right in liking black girls more than white not that i rashly would decide they know the best who both have tried that to indulge and take his fill he fenced an apalachian hill and holding there supreme command scattered his image over the land dryden  till soon he got so large a race of little tawny babes of grace and these so soon begot a second and those a third that quick he reckoned subjects enough of his own blood to reign their sovereign great and good if such a man was not born free i know not what is liberty  squire dear dean you interrupt my theme i want to preach but you to dream of negro girls and patriarch kings  pray clip your fancys wayward wings my two points proved i draw from hence this truly christian inference that all whom we the factious call who against court influence hourly bawl who from their seats would dash contractors and be themselves the nations factors are all of the old roundhead leaven and therefore never will get to heaven  dean right this would give my mind much ease if drawn from sounder premises lock and his crew i know right well have sent full many a fool to hell but not from what you have proved but i  hold muse nor give the squires reply you have run two heats to start a third would now i think be quite absurd it is much beyond an eclogues length come breath a while and gather strength you shall not tax should it be willing the town beyond a single shilling though the author chooses to be so very moderate in his mode of taxation i his bookseller in strict conformity to our rule of trade have ventured to lay on the other sixpence debrett  stop then in time your tinkling rill the readers ears have drank their fill claudite jam rivos pueri sat prata
