arms in paternoster row mdcclxiii  an epistle to william hogarth amongst the sons of men how few are known who dare be just to merit not their own superior virtue and superior sense to knaves and fools will always give offense nay men of real worth can scarcely bear so nice is jealousy a rival there be wicked as thou will do all that is base proclaim thyself the monster of thy race let vice and folly thy black soul divide be proud with meanness and be mean with pride deaf to the voice of faith and honor fall from side to side yet be of none at all spurn all those charities those sacred ties which nature in her bounty good as wise to work our safety and ensure her plan contrived to bind and rivet man to man lift against virtue powrs oppressive rod betray thy country and deny thy god and in one general comprehensive line to group which volumes scarcely could define whatever of sin and dullness can be said join to a f  s heart a d  s head yet may thou pass unnoticd in the throng and free from envy safely sneak along the rigid saint by whom no mercys shown to saints whose lives are better than his own shall spare thy crimes and wit who never once forgave a brother shall forgive a dunce but should thy soul formed in some luckless hour vile interest scorn nor madly grasp at power should love of fame in every noble mind a brave disease with love of virtue joined spur thee to deeds of pith where courage tried in reasons court is amply justified or fond of knowledge and averse to strife should thou prefer the calmer walk of life should thou by pale and sickly study led pursue coy science to the fountain head virtue thy guide and public good thy end should every thought to our improvement tend to curb the passions to enlarge the mind purge the sick weal and humanize mankind rage in her eye and malice in her breast redoubled horror grinning on her crest fiercer each snake and sharper every dart quick from her cell shall maddning envy start then shall thou find but find alas too late how vain is worth how short is glorys date then shall thou find whilst friends with foes conspire to give more proof than virtue would desire thy danger chiefly lies in acting well no crimes so great as daring to excel whilst satire thus disdaining mean control urged the free dictates of an honest soul candor who with the charity of paul still thinks the best whenever she thinks at all with the sweet milk of human kindness blessed the furious ardour of my zeal repressed canst thou with more than usual warmth she cried thy malice to indulge and feed thy pride can thou severe by nature as thou art with all that wondrous rancour in thy heart delight to torture truth ten thousand ways to spin detraction forth from themes of praise to make vice sit for purposes of strife and draw the hag much larger than the life to make the good seem bad the bad seem worse and represent our nature as our curse does not humanity condemn that zeal which tends to aggravate and not to heal does not discretion warn thee of disgrace and danger grinning stare thee in the face loud as the drum which spreading terror round from emptiness acquires the power of sound does not the voice of norton strike thy ear and the pale mansfield chill thy soul with fear do thou fond man believe thyself secure because you are honest and because you are poor do thou on law and liberty depend turn turn thy eyes and view thy injured friend art thou beyond the ruffian gripe of power when wilkes prejudged is sentenced to the tower do thou by privilege exemption claim when privilege is little more than name or to prerogative that glorious ground on which statescoundrels often have safety found do thou pretend and there a sanction find unpunished thus to libel human kind when poverty the poets constant crime compelled thee all unfit to trade in rhyme had not romantic notions turned thy head had thou not valued honor more than bread had interest pliant interest been thy guide and had not prudence been debauched by pride in flattrys stream thou would have dipped thy pen applied to great and not to honest men nor should conviction have seduced thy heart to take the weaker though the better part what but rank folly for thy curse decreed could into satires barren path mislead when open to thy view before thee lay soulsoothing panegyrics flowery way there might the muse have saunterd at her ease and pleasing others learned herself to please lords should have listened to the sugared treat and ladies simpring owned it vastly sweet rogues in thy prudent verse with virtue graced fools marked by thee as prodigies of taste must have forbid pouring preferments down such wit such truth as thine to quit the gown thy sacred brethren too for they no less than laymen bring their offerings to success had hailed thee good if great and paid the vow sincere as that they pay to god whilst thou in lawn had whispered to a sleeping crowd as dull as r  and half as proud peace candor  wisely had thou said and well could interest in this breast one moment dwell could she with prospect of success oppose the firm resolves which from conviction rose i cannot truckle to a fool of state nor take a favor from the man i hate free leave have others by such means to shine i scorn their practice they may laugh at mine but in this charge forgetful of thyself thou have assumed the maxims of that elf whom god in wrath for mans dishonor framed cunning in heaven amongst us prudence named that servile prudence which i leave to those who dare not be my friends cannot be my foes had i with cruel and oppressive rimes pursued and turned misfortunes into crimes had i when virtue gasping lay and low joined tyrant vice and added woe to woe had i made modesty in blushes speak and drawn the tear down beautys sacred cheek had i damned then in thought debased my lays to wound that sex which honor bids me praise had i from vengeance by base views betrayed in endless night sunk injured ayliffs shade had i which satirists of mighty name renowned in rhyme revered for moral fame have done before whom justice shall pursue in future verse brought forth to public view a noble friend and made his foibles known because his worth was greater than my own had i spared those so prudence had decreed whom god so help me at my greatest need i never will spare those vipers to their king who smooth their looks and flatter whilst they sting or had i not taught patriot zeal to boast of those who flatter least but love him most had i thus sinned my stubborn soul should bend at candours voice and take as from a friend the deep rebuke myself should be the first to hate myself and stamp my muse accursed but shall my arm  forbid it manly pride forbid it reason warring on my side  for vengeance lifted high the stroke forbear and hang suspended in the desert air or to my trembling side unnervd sink down palsied forsooth by candours halfmade frown when justice bids me on shall i delay because insipid candor bars my way when she of all alike the puling friend would disappoint my satires noblest end when she to villains would a sanction give and shelter those who are not fit to live when she would screen the guilty from a blush and bids me spare whom reason bids me crush all leagues with candor proudly i resign she cannot be for honors turn nor mine yet come cold monitor half foe half friend whom vice cannot fear whom virtue cannot commend come candor by thy dull indiffrence known thou equalblooded judge thou lukewarm drone who fashioned without feelings do expect we call that virtue which we know defect come and observe the nature of our crimes the gross and rank complexion of the times observe it well and then review my plan praise if you will or censure if you can whilst vice presumptuous lords it as in sport and piety is only known at court whilst wretched liberty expiring lies beneath the fatal burden of excise whilst nobles act without one touch of shame what men of humble rank would blush to name whilst honors placed in highest point of view worshipped by those who justice never knew whilst bubbles of distinction waste in play the hours of rest and blunder through the day with dice and cards opprobrious vigils keep then turn to ruin empires in their sleep whilst fathers by relentless passion led doom worthy injured sons to beg their bread merely with illgot illsavd wealth to grace an alien abject poor proud upstart race whilst martin flatters only to betray and webb gives up his dirty soul for pay whilst titles serve to hush a villains fears whilst peers are agents made and agents peers whilst base betrayers are themselves betrayed and makers ruined by the thing they made whilst c  false to god and man for gold like the old traitor who a savior sold to shame his master friend and father gives whilst bute remains in power whilst holland lives can satire want a subject where disdain by virtue fired may point her sharpest strain where clothed with thunder truth may roll along and candor justify the rage of song such things such men before thee such an age where rancour great as thine may glut her rage and sicken even to surfeit where the pride of satire pouring down in fullest tide may spread wide vengeance round yet all the while justice behold the ruin with a smile whilst i thy foe misdeemd cannot condemn nor disapprove that rage i wish to stem will thou degenerate and corrupted choose to soil the credit of thy haughty muse with fallacy most infamous to stain her truth and render all her anger vain when i beheld thee incorrect but bold a various comment on the stage unfold when playrs on playrs before thy satire fell and poor reviews conspired thy wrath to swell when states and statesmen next became thy care and only kings were safe if thou wast there thy every word i weighed in judgments scale and in thy every word found truth prevail why do thou now to falsehood meanly fly not even candor can forgive a lie bad as men are why should thy frantic rimes traffic in slander and invent new crimes crimes which existing only in thy mind weak spleen brings forth to blacken all mankind by pleasing hopes we lure the human heart to practice virtue and improve in art to thwart these ends which proud of honest fame a noble muse would cherish and inflame thy drudge contrives and in our full career sicklies our hopes with the pale hue of fear tells us that all our labors are in vain that what we seek we never can obtain that dead to virtue lost to natures plan envy possesses the whole race of man that worth is criminal and danger lies danger extreme in being good and wise it is a rank falsehood search the world around there cannot be so vile a monster found not one so vile on whom suspicions fall of that gross guilt which you impute to all approved by those who disobey her laws virtue from vice itself extorts applause her very foes bear witness to her state they will not love her but they cannot hate hate virtue for herself with spite pursue merit for merits sake might this be true i would renounce my nature with disdain and with the beasts that perish graze the plain might this be true had we so far filled up the measure of our crimes and from the cup of guilt so deeply drank as not to find thirsting for sin one drop one dreg behind quick ruin must involve this flaming ball and providence in justice crush us all none but the damned and amongst them the worst those who for double guilt are doubly cursed can be so lost nor can the worst of all at once into such deep damnation fall by painful slow degrees they reach this crime which even in hell must be a work of time cease then thy guilty rage thou wayward son with the foul gall of discontent over run list to my voice  be honest if you can nor slander nature in her favorite man but if thy spirit resolute in ill once having erred persists in error still go on at large no longer worth my care and freely vent those blasphemies in air which i would stamp as false though on the tongue of angels the injurious slander hung dupd by thy vanity that cunning elf who snares the coxcomb to deceive himself or blinded by thy rage did thou believe that we too coolly would ourselves deceive that we as sterling falsehood would admit because twas seasoned with some little wit when fiction rises pleasing to the eye men will believe because they love the lie but truth herself if clouded with a frown must have some solemn proof to pass her down have thou maintaining that which must disgrace and bring into contempt the human race have thou or can thou in truths sacred court to save thy credit and thy cause support produce one proof make out one real ground on which so great so gross a charge to found nay do thou know one man let that appear from wilful falsehood i will proclaim thee clear one man so lost to nature so untrue from whom this general charge thy rashness drew on this foundation shall thou stand or fall  prove that in one which you have charged on all reason determines and it must be done amongst men or past or present name me one hogarth  i take thee candor at thy word accept thy proffered terms and will be heard thee have i heard with virulence declaim nothing retained of candor but the name by thee have i been charged in angry strains with that mean falsehood which my soul disdains  hogarth stand forth  nay hang not thus aloof  now candor now thou shall receive such proof such damning proof that henceforth thou shall fear to tax my wrath and own my conduct clear  hogarth stand forth  i dare thee to be tried in that great court where conscience must preside at that most solemn bar hold up thy hand think before whom on what account you stand  speak but consider well  from first to last review thy life weigh every action past  nay you shall have no reason to complain  take longer time and view them over again  can thou remember from thy earliest youth and as thy god must judge thee speak the truth a single instance where self laid aside and justice taking place of fear and pride thou with an equal eye did genius view and give to merit what was merits due genius and merit are a sure offense and thy soul sickens at the name of sense is any one so foolish to succeed on envys altar he is doomed to bleed hogarth a guilty pleasure in his eyes the place of executioner supplies see how he glotes enjoys the sacred feast and proves himself by cruelty a priest whilst the weak artist to thy whims a slave would bury all those powers which nature gave would suffer blank concealment to obscure those rays thy jealousy could not endure to feed thy vanity would rust unknown and to secure thy credit blast his own in hogarth he was sure to find a friend he could not fear and therefore might commend but when his spirit roused by honest shame shook off that lethargy and soared to fame when with the pride of man resolved and strong he scorned those fears which did his honor wrong and on himself determined to rely brought forth his labors to the public eye no friend in thee could such a rebel know he had desert and hogarth was his foe souls of a timorous cast of petty name in envys court not yet quite dead to shame may some remorse some qualms of conscience feel and suffer honor to abate their zeal but the man truly and completely great allows no rule of action but his hate through every bar he bravely breaks his way passion his principle and parts his prey mediums in vice and virtue speak a mind within the pale of temperance confined the daring spirit scorns her narrow schemes and good or bad is always in extremes mans practice duly weighed through every age on the same plan has envy formed her rage against those whom fortune has our rivals made in way of science and in way of trade stung with mean jealousy she arms her spite first works then views their ruin with delight our hogarth here a grand improver shines and nobly on the general plan refines he like himself oerleaps the servile bound worth is his mark wherever worth is found should painters only his vast wrath suffice genius in every walk is lawful prize it is a gross insult to his oergrown state his love to merit is to feel his hate when wilkes our countryman our common friend arose his king his country to defend when tools of power he barred to public view and from their holes the sneaking cowards drew when rancour found it far beyond her reach to soil his honor and his truth impeach what could induce thee at a time and place where manly foes had blushed to show their face to make that effort which must damn thy name and sink thee deep deep in thy grave with shame did virtue move thee no twas pride rank pride and if thou had not done it thou had died malice who disappointed of her end whether to work the bane of foe or friend preys on herself and driven to the stake gives virtue that revenge she scorns to take had killed thee tottering on lifes utmost verge had wilkes and liberty escaped thy scourge when that great charter which our fathers bought with their best blood was into question brought when big with ruin over each english head vile slavery hung suspended by a thread when liberty all trembling and aghast feared for the future knowing what was past when every breast was chilled with deep despair till reason pointed out that pratt was there lurking most ruffianlike behind a screen so placed all things to see himself unseen virtue with due contempt saw hogarth stand the murderous pencil in his palsied hand what was the cause of liberty to him or what was honor let them sink or swim so he may gratify without control the mean resentments of his selfish soul let freedom perish if to freedom true in the same ruin wilkes may perish too with all the symptoms of assured decay with age and sickness pinched and worn away pale quivering lips lank cheeks and faltring tongue the spirits out of tune the nerves unstrung thy body shrivelled up thy dim eyes funk within their sockets deep thy weak hams shrunk the bodys weight unable to sustain the stream of life scarce trembling through the vein more than halfkilld by honest truths which fell through thy own fault from men who wished thee well can thou even thus thy thoughts to vengeance give and dead to all things else to malice live hence dotard to thy closet shut thee in by deep repentance wash away thy sin from haunts of men to shame and sorrow fly and on the verge of death learn how to die vain exhortation wash the ethiop white discharge the leopards spots turn day to night control the course of nature bid the deep hush at thy pygmy voice her waves to sleep perform things passing strange yet own thy art too weak to work a change in such a heart that envy which was woven in the frame at first will to the last remain the same reason may droop may die but envys rage improves by time and gathers strength from age some and not few vain triflers with the pen unread unpracticed in the ways of men tell us that envy who with giant stride stalks through the vale of life by virtues side retreats when she has drawn her latest breath and calmly hears her praises after death to such observers hogarth gives the lie worth may be hearsd but envy cannot die within the mansion of his gloomy breast a mansion suited well to such a guest immortal unimpaird she rears her head and damns alike the living and the dead often have i known thee hogarth weak and vain thyself the idol of thy awkward strain through the dull measure of a summers day in phrase most vile prate long long hours away whilst friends with friends all gaping sit and gaze to hear a hogarth babble hogarths praise but if athwart thee interruption came and mentioned with respect some ancients name some ancients name who in the days of yore the crown of art with greatest honor wore how have i seen thy coward cheek turn pale and blank confusion seize thy mangled tale how has thy jealousy to madness grown and deemed his praise injurious to thy own then without mercy did thy wrath make way and arts and artists all became thy prey then did thou trample on established rules and proudly levelled all the ancient schools condemned those works with praise through ages graced which you had never seen or could not taste but would mankind have true perfection shown  it must be found in labors of my own  i dare to challenge in one single piece  the united force of italy and greece thy eager hand the curtain then undrew and brought the boasted masterpiece to view spare thy remarks  say not a single word  the picture seen why is the painter heard call not up shame and anger in our cheeks without a comment sigismunda speaks poor sigismunda what a fate is thine dryden the great high priest of all the nine revived thy name gave what a muse could give and in his numbers bad thy memory live gave thee those soft sensations which might move and warm the coldest anchorite to love gave thee that virtue which could curb desire refine and consecrate loves headstrong fire gave thee those griefs which made the stoic feel and called compassion forth from hearts of steel gave thee that firmness which our sex may shame and made man bow to womans juster claim so that our tears which from compassion flow seem to debase thy dignity of woe but o how much unlike how fallen how changed how much from nature and herself estranged how totally deprived of all the powers to show her feelings and awaken ours does sigismunda now devoted stand the helpless victim of a daubers hand but why my hogarth such a progress made so rare a pattern for the signpost trade in the full force and whirlwind of thy pride why was heroic painting laid aside why is it not resumed thy friends at court men all in place and power crave thy support be grateful then for once and through thy field of politics thy epic pencil wield maintain the cause which they good lack avow and would maintain too but they know not how through every panel let thy virtue tell how bute prevailed how pit and temple fell how englands sons whom they conspired to bless against our will with insolent success approve their fall and with addresses run how got god knows to hail the scottish sun point out our fame in war when vengeance hurled from the strong arm of justice shook the world thine and thy countrys honor to increase point out the honors of succeeding peace our moderation christianlike display show what we got and what we gave away in colors dull and heavy as the tale let a statechaos through the whole prevail but of events regardless whilst the muse perhaps with too much heat her theme pursues while her quick spirits rouse at freedoms call and every drop of blood is turned to gall whilst a dear country and an injured friend urge my strong anger to the bittrest end whilst honest trophies to revenge are raised let not one real virtue pass unpraisd justice with equal course bids satire flow and loves the virtue of her greatest foe o that i here could that rare virtue mean which scorns the rule of envy pride and spleen which springs not from the labored works of art but has its rise from nature in the heart which in itself with happiness is crowned and spreads with joy the blessing all around but truth forbids and in these simple lays contented with a different kind of praise must hogarth stand that praise which genius gives in which to latest time the artist lives but not the man which rightly understood may make us great but cannot make us good that praise be hogarths freely let him wear that wreath which genius wove and planted there foe as i am should envy tear it down myself would labor to replace the crown in walks of humor in that cast of style which probing to the quick yet makes us smile in comedy thy natural road to fame nor let me call it by a meaner name where a beginning middle and an end are aptly joined where parts on parts depend each made for each as bodies for their soul so as to form one true and perfect whole where a plain story to the eye is told which we conceive the moment we behold hogarth unrivaled stands and shall engage unrivaled praise to the most distant age how could thou then to shame perversely run and tread that path which nature bad thee shun why did ambition overleap her rules and thy vast parts become the sport of fools by different methods different men excel but where is he who can do all things well humor thy province for some monstrous crime pride struck thee with the frenzy of sublime but when the work was finished could thy mind so partial be and to herself so blind what with contempt all viewed to view with awe nor see those faults which every blockhead saw blush thou vain man and if desire of fame founded on real art thy thoughts inflame to quick destruction sigismunda give and let her memory die that thine may live but should fond candor for her mercy sake with pity view and pardon this mistake or should oblivion to thy wish most kind wipe off that stain nor leave one trace behind of arts despised of artists by thy frown awed from just hopes of rising worth kept down of all thy meanness through this mortal race can thou the living memory erase or shall not vengeance follow to the grave and give back just that measure which you gave with so much merit and so much success with so much power to curse so much to bless would he have been mans friend instead of foe hogarth had been a little god below why then like savage giants famed of old of whom in scripture story we are told do thou in cruelty that strength employ which nature meant to save not to destroy why do thou all in horrid pomp arrayed sit grinning over the ruins thou have made most rank ill nature must applaud thy art but even candor must condemn thy heart for me who warm and zealous for my friend in spite of railing thousands will commend and no less warm and zealous against my foes spite of commending thousands will oppose i dare thy worst with scorn behold thy rage but with an eye of pity view thy age thy feeble age in which as in a glass we see how men to dissolution pass thou wretched being whom on reasons plan so changed so lost i cannot call a man what could persuade thee at this time of life to launch afresh into the sea of strife better for thee scarce crawling on the earth almost as much a child as at thy birth to have resigned in peace thy parting breath and sunk unnoticd in the arms of death why would thy gray gray hairs resentment brave thus to go down with sorrow to the grave now by my soul it makes me blush to know my spirits could descend to such a foe whatever cause the vengeance might provoke it seems rank cowardice to give the stroke sure it is a curse which angry fates impose to mortify mans arrogance that those who are fashioned of some better sort of clay much sooner than the common herd decay what bitter pangs must humbled genius feel in their last hours to view a swift and steel how must illboding horrors fill her breast when she beholds men marked above the rest for qualities most dear plunged from that height and sunk deep sunk in second childhoods night are men indeed such things and are the best more subject to this evil than the rest to drivel out whole years of idiot breath and sit the monuments of living death o galling circumstance to human pride abasing thought but not to be denied with curious art the brain too finely wrought preys on herself and is destroyed by thought constant attention wears the active mind blots out her powers and leaves a blank behind but let not youth to insolence allied in heat of blood in full career of pride possessed of genius with unhallowed rage mock the infirmities of reverend age the greatest genius to this fate may bow reynolds in time may be like hogarth now finis
