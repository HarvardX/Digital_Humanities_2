marred the grand design of my frolic  i had no chance among the pretty women where he was he had the knack of winning their hearts by his gaiety though so devilish pleasant in his quotations which on the moment he dashes in a parody whimsically opposite to every occasion as it happens i hope he will not find the purse i have hid in his pocket before we part i dread the moment  but it is come
