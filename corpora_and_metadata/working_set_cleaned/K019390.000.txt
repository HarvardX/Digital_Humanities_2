medical observations adapted to the medicine chests  fitted out by william randall chemist southampton  printed in the year mdccxcv by t baker  introduction health is so great a blessing that every attempt directed toward its preservation must tend to benefit society and deserves a share of public approbation to relieve the wants of the industrious poor is at all times an act of charity but when the vigor and strength so necessary for the pursuit of their labors are suspended by the fatal powers of disease and when perhaps the bread of a numerous family depends upon the speedy recovery of a poor and afflicted parent  at such a time to open the stores of medicine to dispense a remedy for the poor sufferer is an act of exalted humanity for this purpose i have selected the following observations for the assistance of the benevolent who feel a wish to relieve though fearful of prescribing  when medical assistance can be had it should be preferred but disorders attack suddenly and it frequently happens that neither advice or medicines can be procured in those seasons the following hints are recommended with a sincere wish that they may contribute to the general good of mankind

0 wounds cleansing and healing  0  0    medical observations etc no   calcined magnesia an absorbent it corrects acidities in the stomach relieves the heartburn and all symptoms that have an acid for their source as sickness giddiness headache vomiting pain in the stomach convulsions and complaints incident to children arising from the same cause  it is preferred to other absorbents on account of its aperient quality if mixed with rhubarb it prevents the rhubarb from leaving a costiveness behind  dose half a dram to one dram taken in a little plain or peppermint water to children it is given in doses of five grains to twenty grains and occasionally a few grains of rhubarb added  no   powder of turkey rhubarb a mild cathartic gently astringent and strengthens the intestines hence it is preferred in diarrhoeas dysenteries and all disorders proceeding from a debility and laxity of the fibers it is frequently indeed given with a view rather to this stomachic and corroborating virtue than to its producing any considerable evacuation in acute fevers where there is an apprehension of producing a diarrhoea by purging medicines rhubarb is safe in diarrhoeas and dysenteries rhubarb is doubly useful first by carrying off the peccant matter secondly by strengthening the bowels against a further afflux a peculiar excellence in rhubarb is its evacuating viscid bile when lodged in the bile ducts in this case next to aloes it is the best among purging medicines and it has this advantage over aloes viz that it may be given where inflammation is attendant bleeding being premised in gross habits rhubarb is an useful assistant to secure the efficacy of the bark if joined with it  dose from ten grains to forty grains as a cathartic from one grain to five grains as a corroborant  under this head i shall insert two prescriptions having found them by experience particularly useful the pill in bilious complaints and to remove costiveness  the powders in relaxed habits to strengthen the tone of the stomach  the antibilious pill take rhubarb in fine powder succotrine aloes in fine powder castile soap of each twenty grains emetic tartar one grain syrup of buckthorn sufficient quantity to mix into a mass which divide into twelve pills take two or three at night going to rest as occasion may require be careful first to mix the emetic tartar with the rhubarb by degrees then add the aloes which rub well together and afterward the soap  strengthening powders take chamomile flowers in powder    grains turkey rhubarb in powder ginger in powder of each   grains mix them well together and divide into four equal parts take one powder twice a day in a little water an hour or two before cating  no   powder of bark the febrisuge virtue for which alone this medicine was at first recommended is now established by long experience an emetic which in most cases is necessary being taken toward the approach of a paroxysm that its operation may be over before the fit comes on the bark is begun at the end of the paroxysm or even in the time of the hot fit and repeated in doses of half a dram or more every third or sourth hour during the intermission after the fever has been removed the medicine should be continued for a time but more sparingly to prevent a return during the use of the bark the pulse which between the fits is generally weak and slow becomes stronger and quicker the appetite mends the patient grows more cheerful and perspiration increases these may be looked upon as sure presages of its success at first it frequently occasions a looseness and this is also salutary but if the purging continues too long it is usually checked by the addition of a little opium if too great costiveness ensues recourse is had to gentle opening medicines or clysters in gross impure habits rhubarb is an useful assistant to secure the efficacy of the bark if joined with it in agues of the inflammatory kind or accompanied with great heat a little nitre is joined or interposed peruvian bark has likewise been found eminently serviceable in gangrenes and mortifications proceeding either from an internal or external cause it has been applied likewise and not without success to the cure of periodic headachs hysteric and hypochondriac fits and other disorders which have regular intermissions by its astringency and aromatic quality it strengthens the whole nervous system and proves useful in weaknesses of the stomach and sundry chronical disorders proceeding from too great a laxity of the fibers in all cases moderate exercise generally promotes the effect of the bark  dose from half a dram to two drams  no   huxhams tincture of bark as a corroborant and stomachic it is given in doses of three or four tea spoons full and particularly to convalescents after long fevers and sometimes in larger doses for the cure of agues in persons averse to taking the peruvian bark in substance  no   essence of rhubarb this medicine is intended for a stomachic and strengthener as well as for a purgative it is of infinite service in weakness of the stomach indigestion laxity of the intestines diarrhoeas bilious disorders cholic and other similar complaints  dose one table spoonful as a corroborant two table spoons full to four as a purgative  no   volatile aromatic spirit is a most excellent cephalic and cordial either to smell to or take inwardly it is very useful in lethargic and apoplectic cases headachs fainting fits and nervous complaints  dose from ten drops to sixty in a glass of water or any other vehicle  no   nervous drops this medicine has the reputation of being a cordial of very extraordinary virtues and has long been held in great esteem in all kinds of languors fainting fits weakness of the nerves lowness of spirits and decays of age  dose from ten to eighty or an hundred drops on a lump of sugar or in a glass of water  no   ether it has been given internally with benefit in hooping coughs hysterical cases in asthma and indeed in almost every spasmodic affection  dose from ten or twelve drops to a tea spoonful in a glass of water which should be swallowed quick as it exhales with great celerity  externally it has often been found to give ease in violent headachs by being applied to the part and to relieve the toothache by being laid on the afflicted jaw when it is applied externally procure a bit of linen rag of such a dimension as to be conveniently covered by the palm of the hand moisten the rag with the ether and instantly apply it to the part affected pressing it very close so as to prevent the escape of its fumes for two or three minutes in which time the rag will be found dry and may be taken away it is sometimes applied externally in paralytic cases gout rheumatism flatulent and other disorders of the stomach and bowels  no   opodeldoc it is chiefly employed for external purposes against rheumatic pains sprains bruises and such like complaints  rub the part

for warming and strengthening the stomach and intestines and is used often with advantage for colds and coughs  dose from twenty to forty or sixty drops on a lump of sugar or in any common drink  no    antimony wine the antimonial wine possesses the whole virtues of that mineral and may be so dosed and managed as to perform all that can be effected by any antimonial preparation with this advantage that as the active part of the antimony is here already dissolved and rendered miscible with the animal fluids its operation is more certain given from ten to fifty or sixty drops it is an attenuant alterative diaphoretic and diuretic a few more prove gently cathartic and two or three drams or tea spoons full for the most part violently emetic in general the ipecacuanha powder or wine is preferred as an emetic being less violent in its operation  no    tincture of guaiacum is given with great advantage in rheumatic and arthritic complaints in which cases and against palsies from lead dr dawson extols this tincture as almost a specific it is given in doses from a tea to a desert spoonful morning and evening in a cup of milk or water gruel  no    salt of wormwood the principal medical effect of salt of wormwood is to attenuate the blood and humors it destroys acidities in the primae viae converting them into a mild aperient salt and thus removes a cause of many chronical diseases it resolves viscid and glutinous humors by which and its gentle stimulus obstructions are removed and wherever it passes secretions are promoted  dose from five grains to half a dram and always plentifully diluted with barley water  it is also used for making saline julaps often beneficial in severs but as the symptoms of these disorders vary much medical assistance should be had as soon as it can be procured when the symptoms are mild abstinence in the patient free dilution bathing the seet in warm water and keeping in bed to encourage perspiration with the use of the saline julap will often give nature an opportunity of exerting her force to overcome the disease and by that means stop the progress but if there is a good deal of oppression and heat the pulse full and hard some sew ounces of blood must be taken away and of course medical attendance rendered absolutely necessary  a saline julap take two drams of salt of wormwood three ounces fresh lemon juice strained when the effervescence is over add four ounces of simple cinnamon water and simple syrup or sugar about half an ounce mix together and take three or four table spoons full every three or four hours  this removes sickness at the stomach relieves vomiting promotes perspiration and may be of service in fevers especially of the inflammatory kind  a vomiting julap dissolve four grains of emetic tartar in eight ounces of water and add to it half an ounce of syrup  in the beginning of severs where there is no topical inflammation this julap may be given in the dose of one table spoonful every quarter or half of an hour till it operates antimonial vomits serve not only to evacuate the contents of the stomach but likewise to promote the different excretions hence they are found in fevers to have nearly the same effects as dr jamess powders  no    asthmatic elixir for cold coughs and asthmatic complaints it allays the tickling which provokes frequent coughing and at the same time opens the breast and gives greater liberty of breathing  dose from twenty to sixty drops two or three times in a day in a glass of water or a cup of linseed or liquorice tea  no    elixir of vitriol this is a valuable medicine in weakness and relaxation of the stomach in continual retchings to vomit and decays of constitution particularly in those proceeding from irregularities which are accompanied with slow febrile symptoms or which follow the suppression of intermittents it is very usefully conjoined with a decoction of the bark  dose from ten to thirty or forty drops taken in a cup of cold

rose water one hundred drops of the extract of saturn then add four tea spoons full of brandy and shake them well together  this is his famous specific for external inflammations burns scalds chilblains etc when used for an eyewater it should be more diluted with rose water about half the vegetomineral water and half rose water  no    essence of peppermint for making peppermint water the virtues and the method of using it are given in directions round the bottle useful to remove cholic flatulency sickness loss of appetite etc  no    nitre powder this medicine generally promotes urine and often gives relief in strangury and heat of urine it is useful in pleurisies etc where the inflammation is owing to a glutinous state of the blood and often in fevers promotes a diaphoresis or sweat  dose from two or three grains to twenty taken in a cup of barley water or water gruel  no  0 powder of jalap a very excellent and safe purging medicine to purify and cleanse the blood and in
