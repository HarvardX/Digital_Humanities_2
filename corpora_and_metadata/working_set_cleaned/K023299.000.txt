genuine edition  the trial of thomas pain for a libel contained in the second part of rights of man before lord kenyon and a special jury at guildhall december     with the speeches of the attorney general and mr erskine at large  london printed for c and g kearsley fleet street        the trial of thomas pain guildhall tuesday dec    the king against thomas pain  before lord kenyon by the following special jury  john campbell merchant foreman john lightfoot christopher taddy robert oliphant cornelius donovan robert rolleston john lubbock riehard tugwell john porter thomas druce isaac railton henry evans merchants mr percival opened the pleadings on the part of the crown he said this was an information against thomas pain for that he being a person of a wicked malicious and seditious disposition and wishing to introduce disorder and confusion and to cause it to be believed that the crown of this kingdom was contrary to the rights of the inhabitants of this kingdom and to cause it to be believed also that the bill of rights was a bill of wrongs and insults all tending to bring the government of this country into contempt and endeavoring to cause it to be believed that the parliament of this country was openly corrupt in the face of day and in order to withdraw the affections of the people of this kingdom against the law and constitution of this country that the thomas pain wishing and intending this mischief did on the   th of february      wickedly falsely maliciously scandalously and seditiously publish a certain book called the second part of rights of man signed thomas pain containing many false wicked scandalous malicious and seditious assertions with which he would not trouble the jury as they would have them from the attorney general the defendant had pleaded not guilty upon which issue was joined  the attorney general said the jury would permit him to state in this stage of the proceeding that in his mind a cause which brought its own merit with it a cause more plain more clear more certain and indisputable never came before a court was it not that certain circumstances had happened and contributed to make the book in question an object of considerable magnitude and rendered it important he should at once propose reading the pages of the book as they were included in the information to the jury and then have left the case to be disposed by their good sense but the particular mischief that naturally flowed from this wicked publication had rendered it necessary for him to open the case in a fuller way than usual upon such occasions to speak of himself was what he had no delight in and what could not be entertaining to the jury but as circumstances made it necessary he hoped the jury would forgive it a rum our had been spread that this prosecution did not correspond with his private judgment to this he answered that if he did not think this a fit object for prosecution he should think such an opinion disqualified him from holding the office he now filled he would be degraded in the estimation of very professional man and he ought to be despised if he felt any unwillingness to bring this enormous case before a jury of this country  this was not the first of the kind which this defendant had thought fit to publish against government he was not perhaps warranted in not bringing the first before the gentlemen of the jury he passed it by however as it was ushered into the world in that shape that it was likely to fall only into the hands of tolerably informed persons who would have the sense to see the poison and consequently would be able to apply the antidote and refute it as they went along but when another appeared in a smaller size printed on white brown paper and thrust in the hands of all persons of all ages sexes and conditions they were even wrapped up with sweet meats for children such were the steps that had been taken to forward this publication and he did what his duty demanded of him he filed an information against the defendant the first day of the succeeding term putting the question upon record which they the jury had to try  what it was that was the intention of this man by these publications would not be matter of difficulty for the jury to discover it was manifested by every test that could apply to the explanation of a mans intention and the jury would have to say whether they were not satisfied that the whole of the book in question did not deserve the blame which had been imputed to it by the information it was written with a view to vilify degrade and to bring into abhorrence and contempt all the establishment of this country in all the departments of the state the whole of the book the jury would see was artfully written for the purpose for which it was intended namely to make the lower orders of society disaffected to government and it was the most gross artifice that ever imposed upon the credulous part of mankind it was all written in the dogmatical manner it consisted of so many readymade propositions without regard to truth and without the least application to circumstances and also without the least reasoning or deduction whatever addressed to men who were very properly anxious about their rights but who from too little knowledge of our constitution and from being too little habituated to reflection were easily imposed upon by shallow artifice and when these honest but deluded men came to be persuaded that they were deprived by the despotic temper of government of rights to which they were clearly entitled it was a matter of no wonder they should manifest an abhorrence of the whole fabric he defied any man to show a system capable of creating more mischief than this book it stated that the regular system of our legislation was inherently corrupt and that the whole formed a mass of abominable tyranny secondly that the legislature altogether was without a single exception grounded upon usurpation that this usurped authority framed what was called law but that in reality there was scarcely such a thing as law in the country thus ten or twelve millions of people were told they were governed by usurpation and that of course as there was no such thing as law each individual would be left to govern all his actions by his own partial notions of moral duty were we indeed to follow these doctrines  were we to fall into a lawless banditti were we to be reduced back again into a savage state of nature where man was the enemy of man where all his faculties were useless except strength and cunning  were we to return to this state  the jury knew what the answer was to these questions what was to be said to a man who would thus with a general sweep take away all law or the force of all law by asserting that all laws which had been hitherto made are null and void this sort of artifice was very gross it was true but it did not appear so to those who could not detect the artifice objections too were started in this book to monarchy in general terms without one word being said of its advantages the power of the aristocracy was objected to but not a word was said about the democratic part of our constitution it was well known that england had a powerful democracy but not a word of that because it would not make the lower classes of the people discontented this was the common artifice an artifice so very shallow that some people might wonder perhaps at the success of it but to whom were these things addressed to the ignorant the credulous and the desperate  the latter were naturally the enemies of all government order or regularity every restaint was irksome to them and nothing was so plausible or convincing to them even upon the point of propriety as to inform them we shall have no government at all the others were easily to be imposed upon and made the dupes of the crafty and designing who might choose to deceive them  the jury in order to judge accurately of the merits of this political performance would take into their consideration the phrases and manner in which the author was pleased to express his thoughts in this publication the manner was sneering and contemptuous and as to the matter he called it an utterdefiance to all law morality and religion the indecency with which monarchy was treated was quite shocking and the conclusions in that work upon that topic discovered that the author was destitute of knowledge as to the various provisions and wise ones too which the law made in that particular  here the learned gentleman entered into an historical detail of the various permanent council for minor kings regents hereditary and official advisers etc of the throne in various cases of necessity so that the provisions by law were such that no material inconvenience could be sustained by the public on account of the monarchical system  a system which mr pain had been pleased to say was such that a case might occur where there would be a complete chasm in that branch of our form of government the truth was that our constitution was the best upon earth and that for the plainest and clearest reason  it had had longer time for melioration than that of any other in the world seven hundred years ago freedom was its basis from the days of julius caesar it had from age to age been improved until it was completed at the revolution  he apprehended it to be no difficult operation of the human mind to distinguish reasoning from a deliberate design to withdraw mens minds from the constitution it was done by the operation of good sense and not difficult for a jury of the city of london they would observe whether the whole of the book was not calculated to convince the sober part of mankind or to produce disaffection to inflame passions instead of reasoning with the mind he knew of no circumstance that could leave a doubt in the mind of the jury as to what was passing in the heart of the defendant at the time he penned this publication  he had thought it more becoming as well as beneficial to the public to select out of this wicked work six or seven passages than to encumber the record with too many recitals he would now take them in their order  the first passage is to be found in page    large edition and is in these words  all hereditary government is in its nature tyranny an heritable crown or an heritable throne or by what other fanciful name such things may be called have no other significant explanation than that mankind are heritable property to inherit a government is to inherit the people as if they were flocks and herds  now what was the tendency of this to destroy all subordination and submission to the law it was neither more nor less than this to hold out to the people of this country that they were slaves this was one of these short readymade propositions which if a man believes he must say i can bear this no longer as to the kings inheriting the people that was a piece of sophistry he had no inheritance in the people his inheritance was his office and that was an office under the law  the next passage is in page     this convention met at philadelphia in may      of which general washington was elected president he was not at that time connected with any of the state governments or with congress he delivered up his commission when the war ended and since then had lived as a private citizen  the convention went deeply into all subjects and having after a variety of debate and investigation agreed among themselves upon the several parts of a federal constitution the next question was the manner of giving it authority and practice  for this purpose they did not like a cabal of courtiers send for a dutch stadtholder or a german elector but they referred the whole matter to the sense and interest of the country  what was this why the whole was written for the sake of introducing a sneer against a dutch stadtholder and german elector this discovered the temper of the man but it was another dogma or readymade proposition without the least deduction  another passage was to be found in page     the history of the edwards and the henrys and up to the commencement of the stuarts exhibits as many instances of tyranny as could be acted within the limits to which the nation had restricted it the stuarts endeavored to pass those limits and their fate is well known in all those instances we hear nothing of a constitution but only of restrictions on assumed power  after this another william descended from the same stock and claiming from the same origin gained possession and of the two evils james and william the nation preferred what it thought the least since from circumstances it must take one the act called the bill of rights comes here into view what is it but a bargain which the parts of the government made with each other to divide powers profits and privileges you shall have so much and i will have the rest and with respect to the nation it said for your share you shall have the right of petitioning this being the case the bill of rights is more properly a bill of wrongs and of insult as to what is called the convention parliament it was a thing that made itself and then made the authority by which it acted a few persons got together and called themselves by that name several of them had never been elected and none of them for the purpose  from the time of william a species of government arose issuing out of this coalition bill of rights and more so since the corruption introduced at the hanover succession by the agency of walpole that can be described by no other name than a despotic legislation though the parts may embarrass each other the whole has no bounds and the only right it acknowledges out of itself is the right of petitioning where then is the constitution either that gives or that restrained power  it is not because a part of the government is elective that makes it less a despotism if the persons so elected possess afterward as a parliament unlimited powers election in this case becomes separated from representation and the candidates are candidates for despotism  thus this author would have us believe that from the days of the edwards and the henrys up to the stuarts we had nothing but tyranny and the bill of rights it seemed was a bill of wrongs and insults who was so infatuated as to believe all this who among us was ignorant of the character of that great founder of our jurisprudence edward the third and as to the bill of rights strangely must that heart be constituted which had not a grateful reverence for the memory of those who procured it but as eulogium would be lost on that bill let it speak for itself  here he recited almost the whole of the bill of rights  such was the bill of wrongs and insults  he would not profane it by a comment  the next passage was in page     the attention of the government of england for i rather choose to call it by this name than the english government appears since its political connection with germany to have been so completely engrossed and absorbed by foreign affairs and the means of raising taxes that it seems to exist for no other purposes domestic concerns are neglected and with respect to regular law there is scarcely such a thing  here was a reflection of the most wicked sort on the government of this country and an invitation to the people to rebel by telling them there was scarcely such a thing as law in england  the next passage was a note in page     with respect to the two houses of which the english parliament is composed they appear to be effectually influenced into one and as a legislature to have no temper of its own the minister whoever he at any time may be touches it as with an opium wand and it sleeps obedience  but if we look at the distinct abilities of the two houses the difference will appear so great as to show the inconsistency of placing power where there can be no certainty of the judgment to use it wretched as the state of representation is in england it is manhood compared with what is called the house of lords and so little is this nicknamed house regarded that the people scarcely inquire at any time what it is doing it appears also to be most under influence and the farthest removed from the general interest of the nation  there was no occasion to defend the house it always had and has at this moment some of the most illustrious men in europe  the next passage was in pages  0  and  0   having thus glanced at some of the defects of the two houses of parliament i proceed to what is called the crown upon which i shall be very concise  it signifies a nominal office of a million sterling a year the business of which consists in receiving the money whether the person be wise or foolish sane or insane a native or a foreigner matters not every ministry acts upon the same idea that mr burke writes namely that the people must be hoodwinked and held in superstitious ignorance by some bugbear or other and what is called the crown answers this purpose and therefore it answers all the purposes to be expected from it this is more than can be said of the other two branches  the hazard to which this office is exposed in all countries is not from any thing that can happen to the man but from what may happen to the nation  the danger of its coming to its senses  so that if the people of this country come into their senses we shall have no crown  we had been out of for senses for centuries if this was the case and all he could wish was that we might remain lunatics for ever  the next passage was a note in page     and      i happened to be in england as the celebration of the centenary of the revolution of      the character of william and mary have always appeared to me detestable the one seeking to destroy his uncle and the other her father to get possession of power themselves but the nation was disposed to think something of that event i felt hurt at seeing it ascribe the whole reputation of it to a man who had undertaken it as a job and who besides what he otherwise got charged six hundred thousand pounds for the expense of the little fleet that brought him from holland george the first acted the fame closefisted part as william had done and bought the duchy of bremen with the money he got from england two hundred and fifty thousand pounds over and above his pay as king and having thus purchased it at the expense of england added it to his hanoverian dominions for his own private profit in fact every nation that does not govern itself is governed as a job england has been the prey of jobs ever since the revolution  the attorney general made a few observations upon these slanders on william and mary and the whole of the house of hanover  the last passage was in page      the fraud hypocrisy and imposition of governments are now beginning to be too well understood to promise them any long career the farce of monarchy and aristocracy in all countries is following that of chivalry and mr burke is dressing for the funeral let it then pass quietly to the tomb of all other follies and the mourners be comforted  the time is not very distant when england will laugh at itself for sending to holland hanover zell or brunswick for men at the expense of a million a year who understood neither her laws her language nor her interest and whose capacities would scarcely have fitted them for the office of a parish constable if government could be trusted to such hands it must be some easy and simple thing indeed and materials fit for all the purposes may be found in every town and village in england  mr attorney general after commenting able on the various passages adverted to made several observations on the great advantages derived from an hereditary when compared to an elective monarchy this was manifested in the constitution of poland which obliged a great a humane and a worthy prince to abdicate his throne he then called the attention of the jury to arguments that had been urged against mr paines rights of man by an american gentleman of the name of adams he read several extracts out of this book and said these arguments seemed to him to be complete answers to the rights of man  having finished his observations he thought it unnecessary to trouble the gentlemen of the jury further in this stage of the business according as they should or should not be of opinion that this book had a dangerous tendency would be their verdict he had done his duty by bringing an offender of this sort before the gentlemen of the jury and thereby putting the public under the shield of their protection  thomas haynes was the first witness called on the part of the prosecution who said he had bought the second part of the rights of man on the  0th of february last at the shop of mr jordan no     fleet street  thomas chapman said he was a printer and knew the defendant thomas pain he was introduced to mr pain by mr thomas charistie he was introduced as a printer to print some books in the year      he printed the first part of the rights of man he also printed part of the second part of the rights of man to wit to page     to signature h he had the manuscript in his possession to p     and had composed as far as   0 but when sheet i came into his hands upon examining it part of it appeared to have a dangerous tendency he then determined in his own mind not to proceed with the work he wrote a short note to mr pain for that purpose and it was with a degree of reluctance that he did it owing to the civilities he had received from mr pain an accident however occurred which made this business easy about the   th of january mr pain called on him and was rather intoxicated with liquor he had been dining at mr johnsons in st pauls churchyard mr pain introduced a subject upon which they had often differed  that of religion which was a favorite topic when he was intoxicated the subject of debate running very high mr pain at last came to personal abuse an observation was made by mrs chapman at which mr pain was greatly offended and said he had not been so much affronted in the whole course of his life he rose in a great passion declaring that as the witness was a dissenter he had a bad opinion of him as they were a set of hypocrites mr pain told the witness he wished to settle with him he called on the witness the next morning and made many apologies for what he had said that it was the effect of liquor and wished him to go on with the work but the witness would not as he thought a part of it had an evil tendency he made three separate proposals to mr pain during the publication of this work first he offered him  00 guineas for the copy secondly he offered him  00 l and thirdly he offered him  000 guineas he answered as he intended to publish a small edition of the work that he wished to reserve it in his own hands  the witness said he had seen pain write and thought he should know his hand writing he looked at several letters signed thomas pain and believed they were the handwriting of the defendant one of these letters empowered mr jordan of fleet street who was the publisher of this work to declare that if any person enquired who was the author of the work to say that he pain was the author others of these letters were orders to mr chapman to deliver copies of the rights of man to mr jordan  john perdue said he was formerly acquainted with mr pain when he was in the excise and before he went to america a letter was shown him which pain wrote to archibald mdonald esquire his majestys attorney general the witness said he believed it was the handwriting of mr pain this letter was dated paris nov   th first year of the republic  there were passages in this letter reflecting on the royal family of england  mr erskine objected to this letter being read in evidence as it was not relevant to the subject of the present trial my lord said he the attorney general states that it contains a libel of the most atrocious kind against his majesty and his illustrious progeny if so let him be prosecuted by another information  it cannot prove any thing contained in the second part of the rights of man nor will be evidence whether any thing therein contained be libellous or not the present information charges nothing respecting this letter and mr attorney general may as well read any other work of mr pain as this pretended letter  lord kenyon said he felt the force of mr erskines objection in the light which he put it and he should certainly reject the letter if the attorney general had attempted to introduce it either as matter of aggravation or inducement to the jury to find the defendant guilty on the present charge but the letter contained an avowal that mr pain was the author of the book which is the subject of this trial and as the attorney general offered it only to prove this fact he could not resist its being read  the attorney general then stated the substance of the letter which was that he wrote to the attorney general as a friend that he had nothing to do with the trial himself whatever was the event it could affect him in no other way than the increase of his reputation that it was not his trial but a trial of the english government with the people of england that getting a verdict against him which however would be difficult except by a packed jury was the same as a verdict against the man in the moon that had he time when he was in england he would have published the information with remarks upon it but that now he would wait until the trial was over and then he should have some observations it stated that it was possible for him to believe that mr guelph or any of his profligate sons had not capacity to govern a nation  in stating this part the attorney general felt great emotion he made several suitable comments on it  the letter then went on stating several other particulars together with a request that it might be read by the attorney general to the jury at the trial  several other letters were produced all of which were proved to be the handwriting of mr pain  in short there was no occasion for all these proofs as nothing was denied upon the facts on the part of mr pain by his council except the letter to the attorney general  the prosecution being thus closed mr erskine addressed the court as follows  gentlemen of the jury  in that part of the attorney generals address in which he commented on the subject of a letter stated to have been received from france he did not appear to me to play the actor when he exhibited signs of of emotion proceeding from feelings that did honor to his nature  from feelings which animated by his duty must make him eager to express his abhorrence of the direct and scandalous attack upon the honor of his royal master and upon the character of his family if his embarrassment was so great and if his feeling were so deeply wounded he will do me the justice that mine must be equally if not more deeply affected in the high office which he holds he must feel the strongest sense of duty in correcting every imputation that may be thrown on the august personage whom he serves but that high personage is too far removed too elevated above society for the learned gentleman to enter into those habits which beget the nicer sensibilities of the heart i stand in the same situation with the attorney general in respect of another august and illustrious person implicated in the most improper manner in the forged letter which he has read and in addition to my official situation he has had the condescension to admit me to the honor of his friendship and therefore i owe him i feel for him all the duty of a grateful servant to an indulgent master and all the affection which man can owe to man what then must be my embarrassment this day i must be without feelings and without affections if i did not experience at this moment the most afflicting emotions but great though they are they have not been able to detach me from the duty which i owe to my profession to justice to honor and to my country gentlemen it is the first and dearest benefit of an englishman that he is entitled to an impartial trial the author of the rights of man would have had ample ground of detraction if there appeared the smallest tincture of partiality in the proceedings of this court if the man whom he had chosen to defend him had been intimidated by threats  had been reduced by prejudice  had been prevailed upon in any way to abandon the cause he might have had occasion to complain it would indeed be a blur and a blot on our constitution if a man could say that the slightest impediment was thrown in the way of justice i lament therefore that the attorney general thought it necessary to read that forged letter if he knew it to be genuine and authentic it was his duty to make it the subject of a distinct prosecution it has nothing to do with the present trial i feel the impression it has made on my own but i stand here as the advocate of thomas pain for the book that is the subject of the information and knowing how essential it is to the character of british justice that the bar should be free i will still maintain what i conceive to be my professional duty as far as nature can struggle that forged letter was admitted only under the pretext of its serving to decypher the quo animo of the author in writing the book granting even that it be a genuine letter which i expressly deny it has not the smallest tendency to establish that fact it was written months after the publication nay after the author had withdrawn from his country after a time when from the treatment he received at dover he might consider himself as one expelled from his country granting therefore that the letter were genuine it is immaterial it is foreign to the present trial and the attorney general has utterly failed in that which i contend to be essential to a prosecution in pruducing evidence of the evil mind with which the author wrote his book no one fact previous to the publication has he stated nothing to delineate the malignity the wicked design the seditous spirit with which the author propagated his doctrines nothing has he brought forward but this forged letter written so many months after and in such circumstances  the attorney general has said that a rumor has gone abroad that the present prosecution has been carried on without his approbation and he has thought it necessary to do away this impresion by slating his direct concurrence no one can be more ready than myself to do liberal justice to the candor impartiality and fairness of the learned gentleman i have no doubt of the integrity with which he has brought even the present action but if he felt himself a little embarrassed by these rumors which at best must have been heard only in a narrow circle what must be my situation this day standing up as i do against prejudices that have been openly widely generally circulated  against imputations of the grossest and the most affecting kind  gentlemen you cannot be ignorant of the disgraceful means that have been taken not merely to inflame the public mind against the defendant but to stamp and brand every man with the mark and reproach of disaffection to the government and constitution who shall venture to hazard the slightest approbation of his doctrines can you go into any places of public resort either for pleasure or business without hearing the cry against this man  without hearing every description of persons who may be inclined to wish for the reform of certain abuses in the administration of government confounded into one band of desperate destroyers of the constitution can you go into any of these places without seeing the newspapers filled with the most direct attacks upon my character for having undertaken his defense as if it were not the bounden duty of a professional man to exercise his faculties in the cause of justice impartially without making myself a party to the cause of my client i hold myself bound to stand up in his defense and to take care that whatever be the offense alleged against him he shall have all the benefits to be derived from the law and from the pure administration of it i say gentlemen that the constitution would be gone indeed if the feelings the foibles the virtues the caprices of barristers were to be indulged in the causes in which they take a a part  what would be the consequence of giving them an election what would be the consequence if it were to be permitted to a man high in his profession to exercise his discretion in stating what causes he would appear in and in what not would it not be giving a previous judgment in the case would it not be arrogating to himself the province of the judge and giving a color and prejudice to the case i am sure the noble lord will tell you that it is inconsistent with the pure administration of justice that personal feelings should be permitted to weigh against public duty i do not affect to hold myself out as a person so high in the profession as that weight should be given to the authority of my example but yet from my station at this bar i may say without the imputation of vanity that it would be a flagrant breach of the integrity of the practice detrimental and injurious to the character of the bar if i could be induced by any considerations to forego the defense of a client i have therefore gentlement treated with the contempt that they merited all the sarcasms all the calumnies with which the conversation of companies and the columns of newspapers have been loaded regardless of all that folly and of all that malice can utter i shall maintain until i die the equal right of every man of this kingdom to a fair trial and on this ground i stand up to defend this book and this author as by the law of england he and it can be defended it is my duty gentlemen to state the question of this day the question is not whether the english constitution be preferable to that of america or that of france for the common sense of the most uninformed person must revolt at such an idea for how can a court constituted by english government and english law give a decision against that which creates its authority and constitutes its jurisdiction it is not therefore the question this day to try whether the doctrines of this author are congenial with the constitution of england nor whether they are doctrines opposite to and in hostility with the constitution of england but whether the book has been written and published agreeable to and in conformity with the law of the land  i will make myself clearly understood  suppose then that the doctrines of thomas pain were doctrines gentlemen of which every one of you approved and that i were now addressing myself to a jury of republicans i say that you would not be authorized to give a verdict for the defendant if it should be made manifest to you by the evidence that he wrote these doctrines and published them for the malignant purpose of promoting an insurrection in the country thereby offending against the laws of the land you have no jurisdiction and authority but from law you have no right to give a verdict in favor of a man offending against the law because you may happen to entertain opinions of the same kind which produced this breach of the law this the noble lord will tell you from the bench and it is material for you to reflect upon this clear description of your duty for it matters not how perfectly consistent with your opinions the doctrines might be if they are contrary to the spirit and letter of the law you must condemn were i therefore as i say addressing a body of men who lived upon this book of whom it was the soul who doated on it as on an angel from heaven i would say gentlemen you cannot acquit this man if he has committed an offense against the law it is not whether his opinion be yours you are not to try his opinions for the law has nothing to do with opinions the law binds only conduct it leaves opinion open you must see therefore what his conduct has been and suffer not the congeniality of your opinions to blind and influence your judgment this may be considered as a large concession by some as an artful maneuver by others but i assert that it is a clear distinct description of the office of the jury for on the other hand if you shall disapprove of the doctrines of thomas pain if you shall think that the government of england has not the infirmities he imputes to it nay that the passages of the book related by the attorney general tend to injure that constitution and to alienate the minds of the people of this country from the love of it i say that you cannot convict this man unless you shall be convinced that he has overstepped the freedom of the press for gentlemen you must look at the mind you must enquire whether he has written this book with an honest intention from the genuine sentiments of his heart and from a pure conviction that he was thereby promoting discussions for the benefit of his fellow citizens and this is to be collected from the matter on the record if a man is to be judged on extrinsic matter that matter must be brought into connection and put upon the record that the jury may be able to judge of it and that the defendant may have all the benefits of the law what crime then is charged upon this man  that he has written and published this book and that this book is hostile to the constitution of england  no the law of england knows no such crime it must be proved in order to constitute his guilt not whether the attorney general approves the book  not whether you approve the book  but whether pain did not sit down and write a book against a constitution which he admired and loved with the diabolical intention of provoking discord and sedition in the country if this were proved thomas pain could not be defended but if he thinks what i and you do not think that the constitution of england is not the best calculated to promote the happiness of the people of this country he is not guilty of any offense against the law though his opinions may be inconsistent with the principles of the constitution every man is protected in his opinions it is only his conduct that makes guilt  i hold it gentlemen to be the duty of an advocate if he should happen to have sentiments different from his client that he is bound to conceal them i hold him equally bound to disclose his opinions if they should happen to be favorable to him for he is bound to exert his whole saculties in support of his client i am sure that it will be of little weight what may be my opinions upon those doctrines but i am ready to give my client all the benefit that he can derive from the declaration of my sentiments i profess myself then to love the genuine principles of the british constitution and i solemnly believe that the constitution as administered by king lords and commons is the best calculated to secure the happiness of the people of this country of any frame of government ever conceived by man i think it necessary thus to preface my particular opinions that you gentlement may see that they come from no suspected quarter that we are in unison with each other and that in striving to ascertain the truth and to secure the happiness of this country we are animated by a common principle i proceed therefore to say and this proposition i pledge myself to maintain from the very nature of civil society and government as well as from the theory and practice of the english law that unless it can be proved which i contend it has not been that he has endeavored to excite individuals to rebellion against the national will from an evil mind you cannot convict him of a libel on the record though you and i may think differently that is no object there would be an end of the liberty of english men if they could not write and speculate freely upon the principles of government the freedom of the press of england gentlemen consists in this that a man must not address to individuals upon the spur of some occasion opinions that shall provoke them to sedition to insurrection and tumult but he may freely address to the universal reason of a whole nation principles of government congenial with or hostile to the form of government under which he lives he may canvas the forms of government in general or he may discuss those of his own in particular he may take them to pieces he may scrutinize them with the greatest rigor  he may state what he thinks to be wrong in the original conception he may trace the gradual progress of decay or of corruption he may point out the consequences he may dwell on their enormity he may warn the people of their fate and in all this he is not the subject of a criminal prosecution he is not criminal unless he did it not contemplating the hope of meliorating the condition of the people but seasting on the misery with the prospect of which he indulged a diabolical nature the liberty of the press consists in this that any individual may teach his fellowcitizens doctrines in opposition to those under which they live he may exercise his own faculties he may provoke them to the exercise of theirs he may persuade the whole people to agree with him in these doctrines and he is not guilty but if he shall teach it as a doctrine that any individual may oppose the law of the land may resist the legal authority and may by himself or in conjunction with others not merely disobey but thwart and impede the settled order of society he would be guilty of a libel upon the record show me an expression like these in the books of thomas pain show me from any part of the evidence which the attorney general has brought forward any thing to prove the evil mind of the author the attorney general has brought forward a set of passages but he knows that passages are not to be taken without the context you must discover the mind of thomas pain in his book and as you must take his book out of court with you it will be your duty to read it carefully what will you say gentlemen when you find in the very preface to his book the following sentiments every one knows that the very end of a preface is to announce to the reader the intention and substance of the following tract and here you will find gentlemen in the very outset of this dangerous and diabolical performance an antidote to the very poison which it is stated to disseminate  if a law be bad it is one thing to oppose the practice of it but it is quite a different thing to expose its errors to reason on its defects and to show cause why it should be repealed or why another ought to be substituted in its place i have always held it an opinion making it also my practice that it is better to obey a bad law making use at the same time of every argument to show its errors and procure its repeal than forcibly to violate it because the precedent of breaking a bad law might weaken the force and lead to discretionary violations of those which are good the case is the same with respect to principles and forms of government or to what are called constitutions and the parts of which they are composed   it is for the good of nations and not for the emolument or aggrandizement of particular individuals that government ought to be established and that mankind are at the expense of supporting it the defects of every government and constitution both as to principle and form must on a parity of reasoning be as open to discussion as the defects of a law and it is a duty which every man owes to society to point them out when these defects and the means of remedying them are generally seen by a nation that nation will reform its government or its constitution in the one case as the government repealed or reformed the law in the other the operations of government are restricted to the making and the administering of laws but it is to a nation that the right of forming or reforming generating or regenerating constitutions and governments belong and consequently those subjects as subjects of investigation are always before a country as a matter of right and cannot without invading the general right of that country be made subjects for prosecution  these gentlemen are the rights of man for no man can without rebellion withdraw his obedience nothing short of the will of the whole can alter the constitution of a country but every individual of that country may publish his opinions may give his advice and may endeavor to bring over other people to his sentiments if a man taught that his fellowcitizens might act at their discretion if he were to say that their natural rights freed them from all restraint and that they were to form to themselves the rule of their own conduct in direct opposition to the existing law he could not be acquitted by a tribunal of english justice but if a man teaches the wisdom of revision and reform the duty of meliorating our condition to the uttermost or even the advantages that would flow in his opinion from a complete alteration of the form of our government he acts upon the known acknowledged valuable privileges of an englishman thanks be to god and to the wisdom of our ancestors such has ever been our advantageous liberty with some slight and melancholy interruption which i shall bye and bye state to you if no man could have gone before the day in which he lived and pointed out from the force of superior intellect improvements in our social system how could government have passed on from stage to stage from state to state until at last it has acquired the beautiful shape and prosperous establishment which the attorney general thinks it would be profanation to touch and to such a state of perfection as to make it a vain hope to look for any further melioration  what is the fairest fruits of the english tree of liberty  the security of our rights and of the law and that no man shall be brought to trial where there is prejudice existing against him if any thing appears that can infect the minds of the jury the court upon motion will postpone the trial the noble lord will recollect that upon this principle the trial of the dean of st asaph was postponed for it was stated in the court that a number of extracts from ancient books asserting the rights of jurors had been circulated and the noble lord put off the trial if such was the case upon the more circulation of a set of extracts from a set of writers of high authority what must be the situation of my client  this book and this desendant have been the subjects of every sort of imputation pending the trial even a set of associators who know so little of the constitution of england as to interfere with the course of justice circulate an answer to this very pamphlet it is given away at turnpikes thrown down our areas thrust into every mans hand the coffeehouses the newspapers are full of it  nay that high tribunal which is the guardian and the representative of the popular branch of england has been insulted with anathemas against this man and against this book what is the result of all this  that the cause is prejudged  that the mind of no man within the sweep of this torrent can be free and that if i had made a motion in the court i am confident that the justice of the noble lord would have postponed the trial what is the consequence of all this you gentlemen must guard your minds against the approach of this frenzy that you must collect firmness with conscience and elevate yourselves above the feebleness of human weakness  you must discover his mind in his book not in the rage nor in the cant of the times you must throw away every thing but the book  the forged letter that has been read to you you must equally reject i heard of this same forged letter and i have reason to believe it to be a foul forgery brought forward at this moment not merely to embarrass me but to embarrass you but you must prove that you are not men whose understandings are to be tortured by such appeals you will prove by your verdict that you will deal by this man as you would wish to be dealt with in a similar situation  remember this doctrine of englishmen that opinion is free  if i were to move an amendment in any part of the existing laws of the land would it be right would it be reasonable that you should convict me of a libel because you differed from me in opinion it is the opinion of this author that it is the duty of citizens to obey a law while it exists when a nation says he changes its opinions and habits of thinking it is no longer to be governed as before but it would not only be wrong but bad policy to attempt by force what ought to be accomplished by reason rebellion consists in forcibly opposing the general will of a nation whether by a party or by individuals such is the doctrine of thomas pain and i assert this to be the true law of england and i say that i give the best proof of my attachment to the illustrious family upon the throne when i maintain these doctrines and when i assert that they are the safest for their desirable interests and for their honor the attorney general in his observation upon the infamous aspersion on the royal family speaks of the heirapparent of the crown from hope  i speak from knowledge without detaining you for one moment to animadvert on what i think the indecency of the tameness with which imputations on the royal progeny have been suffered of late of the apparent disinclinations to prosecute what tends to break the best hopes of englishmen and wound the fondest feelings of the royal bosom while there is an eagerness to prosecute the discussion of popular opinions i believe and i know that if ever there was a man more firmly attached than another to the pure principles of the british constitution to those rights of the people the exercise of which seated the present family upon the throne it is the heirapparent of the crown of these realms if there shall come a time that by the course of nature and god forbid that it should ever happen otherwise than by the course of nature he should succeed to the throne of his ancestors i have the firmest confidence that he will make the constitution the rule of his conduct i know that these sentiments are congenial to his breast i had the honor in my place in the house of commons when i believe that august person was present to pronounce my opinion on political doctrines and to put the title of the kings majesty upon the right which the people have to choose their chief magistrate  the only right upon which in my opinion the title can be truly safe  in endeavoring to find the true spirit with which this book was written you must go back to the train of circumstances which have formed the habits and opinions of the author you cannot have forgotten that calamitous era in our history to which no man can look back without horror  the era of the american war this man performed a considerable part on that memorable theater and of his conduct there mr burke that celebrated character of whom i cannot speak otherwise than with great respect however he may affect to treat me with contempt has spoken of the conduct of thomas pain with high respect here mr erskine read some quotations from his thoughts on he causes of the present discontent and other works in commendation of thomas pain and he said that these two persons used to be of the same mind though they now differ pain might be right but mr burke could not be right for mr pain had been consistent with himself but mr burke had contradicted every former opinion pain seeing the consequences of the conduct of britain with regard to america had attacked the english constitution for mr erskine said he does attack the english constitution  i do not affect to deny it he speaks against the original frame of our constitution what i think is only applicable to its decay and what for i will not mince the matter proceeds from corruptions which would bring on the ruin of us all if i did not know and believe that the constitution contains the seeds of its own reform is it libellous in him however to say what he has said against the constitutent branches of our constitution  the grandest authorities of england have done the same mr erskine quoted a passage of a letter from sir george savile to his constituents  vide annual register for    0 p  00  i return to you says sir george baffled and dispirited and i am sorry that truth obliges me to add with hardly a ray of hope of seeing any change in the miserable course of public calamities and of sir george savile mr erskine gave the admirable character as drawn by mr burke at this time mr pain and mr burke fought in the same field  mr burke spoke to parliament mr pain to the people mr pain has only been a plagiary from himself he has been drawn on in the same train of thinking and therefore i assert that his book is the product of his real sentiments the genuine efforts of a mind struggling for what he conceives to be the interests of humanity the cause is potent it produced the revolution in america it produced the revolution in france where a government incurable from its corruption and profligacy was totally overthrown but can the same doctrines affect the constitution of england no his doctrines had no effect nor could there have occurred a period when the public mind could have been excited by any such doctrines if it had not been previously provoked by the inflammatory the illjudged and the exasperating doctrines of mr burke he it was who led the van in all this war of sedition  let us go back for a moment to this origin when the people of this country saw this despicable government of france demolished  that government which had been the scourge of england  they rejoiced in the happiness of so many millions a reverend divine now no more made it the subject of exhortation from the pulpit a society of gentlemen met to celebrate it and mr burke was roused by this into the fever of opposition though he represented them as an insignificant body of obscure individuals he attacked the whole system of england with such bitterness of invective and attacked the most established doctrines with such vehemence of dissent that from that day till this the flame of contention has not ceased to rage  what was the principle of this work  that the people of england had no right no power to change a tittle of their constitution that it was an indissoluble compact which at no time on no ground for no reason could be broken so that neither reason nor revelation however they might point out to the people of england a better form of government wiser institutes of peace stronger bases of liberty they durst not strive to attain them if it be so for gods sake let policy and discretion strive to conceal the afflicting truth for it will surely lead to the convulsion which he affects to deprecate rather put pain into the hands of every man make the lowest ignorance acquainted with his doctrines and chase away if it be possible the impressions which mr burke has made how different is the doctrine of truth and of peace  how different is the doctrine of the revolution look at the constitution say the friends of liberty it is your own treasure will you keep it as it is or will you change it at the suggestion of every theorist your own happiness is at stake but remember the happiness that it has produced you will they not be likely to touch with awe a constitution which comes thus recommended to them by parental tenderness and will they not protect it with parental authority  look now at the address of mr burke here is your constitution which we have made for you and for your posterity for ever we buckle it on your backs for you are beasts of burden you must not dare to touch it  you have entered into a compact which is indissoluble are such doctrines the legitimate way of endearing the constitution to the people and i mention all this in order to show you what the book of mr pain is for paines book is an answer to those doctrines of mr burke  doctrines more injurious than any that could be asserted by republicans and levellers  mr erskine then cited several of our most eminent english writers whose sentiments are congenial with those of mr pain on the subject of government  he first quoted mr paley on the principles of moral and political philosophy p      v no usage law or authority whatever is so binding that it need or ought to be continued when it may be changed with advantage to the community the family of the prince the order of succession the prerogative of the crown the form and parts of the legislature together with the respective powers office duration and mutual dependency of the several parts are all only so many laws mutable like other laws whenever expediency requires either by the ordinary act of the legislature or if the occasion deserve it by the interposition of the people these points are wont to be approached with a kind of awe they are represented to the mind as principles of the constitution settled by our ancestors and being settled to be no more committed to innovation or debate as foundations never to be stirred as the terms and conditions of the social compact to which every citizen of the state has engaged his fidelity by virtue of a promise which he cannot now recall such reasons have no place in our system to us if there be any good reason for treating these with more deference and respect than other laws it is either the advantage of the present constitution of government which reason must be of different force in different countries or because in all countries it is of importance that the form and usage of governing be acknowledged and understood as well by the governors as the governed and because the seldomer it is changed the more it will be respected by both sides  mr erskine then introduced humes history of england vol ii p     it must be confessed that the former articles of the great charter contain such mitigations and explanations of the feodal law as are reasonable and equitable and that the latter involve all the chief outlines of a loyal government and provide for the equal distribution of justice and free enjoyment of property the great object for which political society was at first founded by men which the people have a perpetual and unalienable right to recall and which no time nor precedent nor statute nor positive institution ought to deter them from keeping ever uppermost in their thoughts and attention  the next writer was the immortal lock and he cited the following passages from his treatise on civil government p       0  0      all men say they are born under government and therefore they cannot be at liberty to begin a new one every one is born a subject to his father or his prince and is therefore under the perpetual tie of subjection and allegiance it is plain mankind never owned nor considered any such natural subjection that they were born in to one or to the other that tied them without their own consents to a subjection to them and their heirs  those who would persuade us that by being born under any government we are naturally subjects to it and have no more any title or pretense to the freedom of the state of nature have no other reason bating that of paternal power which we have already answered to produce for it but only because our fathers or progenitors passed away their natural liberty and thereby bound up themselves and their posterity to a perpetual subjection to the government which they themselves submitted to it is true that whatever engagements or promises any one has made for himself he is under the obligation of them but cannot by any compact whatsoever bind his children or posterity for his son when a man being altogether as free as the father any act of the father can no more give away the liberty of the son that it can of any body else  and therefore they have a very wrong notion of government who say that the people have incroached upon the prerogative when they have got any part of it to be defined by positive laws for in so doing they have not pulled from the prince any thing that of right belonged to him but only declared that that power which they indefinitely left in his or his ancestors hands to be exercised for their good was not a thing which they intended him when he used it otherwise for the end of government being the good of the community whatsoever alterations are made in it tending to that end cannot be an encroachment upon any body since nobody in government can have a right tending to any other end and those only are encroachments which prejudice or hinder the public good those who say otherwise speak as if the prince had a distinct and separate interest from the good of the community and was not made for it the root and source from which spring almost all those evils and disorders which happen in kingly governments and indeed if that be so the people under his government are not a society of rational creatures entered into a community for their mutual good they are not such as have set rulers over themselves to guard and promote that good but are to be looked on as an herd of inferior creatures under the dominion of a master who keeps them and works them for his own pleasure or profit if men were so void of reason and brutish as to enter into society upon such terms prerogative might indeed be what some men would have it an arbitrary power to do things hurtful to the people  and therefore though the people cannot be judge so as to have by the constitution of that society any superior power to determine and give effective sentence in the case yet they have by a law antecedent and paramount to all positive laws of men reserved that ultimate determination to themselves which belongs to all mankind god and nature never allowing a man so to abandon himself as to neglect his own preservation and since he cannot take away his own life neither can he give another power to take it nor let any one think this lays a perpetual foundation for disorder for this operates not till the inconveniency is so great that the majority feel it and are weary of it and find a necessity to have it amended but this the executive power or wise princes never need come in the danger of and it is the thing of all others they have most need to avoid as of all others the most perilous  whenever therefore the legislative shall transgress this fundamental will of society and either by ambition fear folly or corruption endeavor to grasp themselves or put into the hands of any other an absolute power over the lives liberties and estates of the people by this breach of truth they forfeit the power the people had put into their hands for quite contrary ends and it devolves to the people who have a right to resume their original liberty and by the establishment of a new legislative such as they shall think fit provide for their own safety and security which is the end for which they are in society what i have said here concerning the legislative such as they shall think fit provide for their own safety and security which is the end for which they are in society what i have said here concerning the legislative in general holds true concerning the supreme executor who having a double trust put in him both to have a part in the legislative and the supreme execution of the law acts against both when he goes about to set up his own arbitary will as the law of the society he acts also contrary to his trust when he either employs the force treasure and offices of the society to corrupt the representatives and gain them to his purposes or openly preengages the electors and prescribes to their choice such whom he has by solicitations threats promises or otherwise won to his designs and employs them to bring in such who have promised beforehand what to vote and what to enact thus to regulate candidates and electors and newmodel the ways of election what is it but to cut up the government by the roots and poison the very fountain of public security for the people having reserved to themselves the choice of their representatives as the fence to their properties could do it for no other end but that they may always be freely chosen and so chosen freely act and advise as the necessity of the commonwealth and the public good should upon examination and mature debate be judged to require this those who give their votes before they hear the debate and have weighed the reasons on all sides are not capable of doing to prepare such an assembly as this and endeavor to set up the declared abettors of his own will for the true representatives of the people and the lawmakers of the society is certainly as great a breach of trust and as perfect a declaration of a design to subvert the government as is possible to be met with to which if one shall add rewards and punishments visibly employed to the same end and all the arts of perverted law made use of to take off and destroy all that stand in the way of such a design and will not comply and consent to betray the liberties of their country it will be past doubt what is doing what power they ought to have in the society who thus employ it contrary to the trust which went along with it in its first institution is easy to determine and one cannot but see that he who has once attempted any such thing as this cannot any longer be trusted  but it will be said this hypothesis lays a ferment for frequent rebellion to which i answer  first no more than any other hypothesis for when the people are made miserable and find themselves exposed to the ill usuage of arbitrary power cry up their governors as much as you will for sons of jupiter let them be sacred and divine descended or authorized from heaven give them out for whom or what you please the same will happen the people generally illtreated and contrary to right will be ready upon any occasion to ease themselves of a burden that sits heavy upon them they will wish and seek for the opportunity which in the change weakness and accidents of human affairs seldom delays long to offer itself he must have lived but a little while in the world who has not seen examples of this in his time and he must have read very little who cannot produce examples of it in all sorts of government in the world  secondly i answer such revolutions happen not upon every little mismanagement in public affairs great mistakes in the ruling part many wrong and inconvenient laws and all the slips of human frailty will be borne by the people without mutiny or murmur if a long train of abuses prevarications and artifices all tending the same way make the design visible to the people and they cannot but feel what they lie under and see whither they are going it is not to be wondered at that they should then rouse themselves and endeavor to put the rule into such hands as may secure to them the ends for which government was at first erected and without which ancient names and specious forms are so far from being better that they are much worse than the state of nature or pure anarchy the inconveniences being all as great and as near but the remedy farther off and more difficult  thirdly i answer that this doctrine of a power in the people of providing for their safety anew by a new legislative when their legslators have acted contrary to their trust by invading their property is the best fence against rebellion and the probablest means to hinder it for rebellion being an opposition not to persons but authority which is founded only in the constitutions and laws of the government those whoever they be who by force break through and by force justify their violation of them are truly and properly rebels for when men by entering into society and civil government have excluded force and introdueed laws for the preservation of property peace and unity amongst themselves those who set up force again in opposition to the laws do rebellure that is bring back again the state of war and are properly rebels which they who are in power by the pretense they have to authority the temptation of force they have in they their hands and the flattery of those about them being likeliest to do the properest way to prevent the evil is to show them the danger and injustice of it who are under the greatest temptation to run into it  nor let any one say that mischief can arise from hence as often as it shall please a busy head or turbulent spirit to desire the alteration of the goyernment it is true such men may stir whenever they please but it will be only to their own just ruin and perdition for till the mischief be grown general and the ill designs of the rulers become visible or their attempts sensible to the greater part the people who are more disposed to suffer than right themselves by resistance are not apt to stir the examples of particular injustice or oppession of here and there an unfortunate man moves them not but if they universally have a persuasion grounded upon manifest evidence that designs are carrying on against their liberties and the general course and tendency of things cannot but give them strong suspicions of the evil intention of their governors who is to be blamed for it who can help it if they who might avoid it bring themselves into this suspicion are the people to be blamed if they have the sense of rational creatures and can think of things no otherwise than as they find and feel them  and is it not rather their fault who put things into such a posture that they would not have them thought to be as they are i grant that the pride ambition and turbulency of private men have sometimes caused great disorders in commonwealths and factions have been fatal to states and kingdoms but whether the mischief has oftener begun in the peoples wantonness and a desire to cast off the lawful authority of their rulers or in the rulers insolence and endeavors to get and exercise an arbitrary power over their people whether oppression or disobedience gave the first rife to the disorder i leave it to impartial history to determine  mr burkess letter to the sheriffs of bristol was then introduced and mr erskine read the following passages from p           if there be one fact in the world perfectly clear it is this that the disposition of the people of america is wholly averse to any other than a free government and this is indication enough to any honest statesman how he ought to adapt whatever power he finds in his hands to their case if any ask me what a free government is i answer that for any practical purpose it is what the people think so and that they and not i are the natural lawful and competent judges of this matter if they practically allow me a greater degree of authority over them than is consistent with any correct ideas of perfect freedom i ought to thank them for so great a trust and not to endeavor to prove from thence that they have reasoned amiss and that having gone so far by analogy they must hereafter have no enjoyment but my pleasure  civil freedom gentlemen is not as many have endeavored to persuade you a thing that lies hid in the depth of abstruse science but is a blessing and a benefit not an abstract speculation and all the just reasoning that can be upon it is of so coarse a texture as perfectly to suit the ordinary capacities of those who are to enjoy and to defend it  for liberty is a good to be improved and not an evil to be lessened it is not only a private blessing of the first order but the vital spring and energy of the state itself which has just so much life and vigor as there is liberty in it but whether liberty be advantageous or not for i know it is a fashion to decry the very principle none will dispute that peace is a blessing and peace must in the course of human affairs be frequently bought by some indulgence and toleration at least of liberty for as the sabbath though of divine institution was made for man not man for the sabbath government which can claim no higher origin or authority in its exercise at least ought to conform to the exigencies of the times and the temper and character of the people with whom it is concerned and not always to attempt violently to bend the people to their theories of subjection the bulk of mankind on their part are not excessively curious concerning any theories while they are really happy and one sure symptom of an illconducted state is the propensity of the people to resort to them  do not let us be rash gentlemen in deciding upon this great question before we condemn this author by bell book and candle let us reflect a little on the progress of the principles of freedom it is but one year ago that i could have an opportunity of addressing to you such an argument gentlemen your authority to judge of a libel is but a year old it is but seven or eight years ago when i stood upon a question like the present upon very different grounds when i had less to support me against the embarrassment with which i was sorrounded in the presence of an enlightened profession and holding a doctrine that was scouted the earl of mansfield who though he could not treat me with unkindness for it was not in his nature laughed at me as you laugh at the prattle of a child and i was desired to go to school with my newfangled doctrines to learn the law of the land here is an argument against rashness i have lived to see the parliament of england unanimously declare that i was in the right knowing then that it has been by slow and gradual degrees that the constitution of england has grown to what it is for gods sake let us be careful not to stifle the voice of reason by a rash and hasty decision if mr burkes doctrine be right no opinions upon government can be published for the people have no jurisdiction if the people have not the power to alter and amend advice is not merely impertinent it is dangerous a jurisdiction to be competent must have power and when therefore he asserts that the people of this country are utterly and for ever deprived of the power of changing their constitution he pronouces a prohibition upon all reasoning upon all opinion upon all discussion what has been the course of man that he has been led by awful authorities step by step from his savage state in the woods to our present blessed condition of light of knowledge and of enjoyments we should still be savages we should yet be in the woods if this prohibition had existed and to what must we return if every man is to be condemned who shall now promulgate the opinions that he entertains upon the nature of government  of all the seize of a people the liberty of the press has been uniformly the last  uniformly despotism has resisted the propagation of truth all other concessions power has been willing to make but against the truths of reason  against the light of knowledge it has maintained an eternal war let us recollect the course of the world the universal god of nature the savior of mankind the fountain of all light who came to save man from eternal darkness expired on a cross  the object of infidel scorn  of impious incredulity because they rashly opposed the meek and mild propagation of the truths that were to point to peace and happiness in the world his blessed followers felt victims to the same horrid spirit the savior might have come invested with eternal power and compelled the instantaneous acceptance of his doctrines but he came to confound the pride of worldly power he came clothed in meekness in benevolence in humility and he preached his consolations to the poor in this way did political power continue to exercise its tyranny until religion had arisen to such a standard as to make it formidable and then political power took ecclesiastical power into partnership when they exerted their combined efforts at once against the reason and the conscience of man thus upon the revival of letters was superstition made the instrument of political tyranny but at length the inquisitive spirit of englishmen burst the chains and the liberty of the press had its beginning it was free until in      the star chamber was erected mark the consequence the people suffered under restraint indeed but in eleven years charles i perished on a scaffold gentlemen the human mind cannot live under restraint let men communicate their thoughts with freedom and their indignation fly off like a fire spread on the surface like gunpowder scattered they kindle they communicate but the explosion is neither loud nor dangerous  keep them under restraint it is a subterraneous fire whose agitation is unseen until it bursts into earthquake or volcano such was the whole effect of the restraints in england cromwell suffered almost all his misfortunes from this cause and the vigor of his government could not save it against the consequences of his attack on the liberty of the press the restraint continued under charles ii and the emotions that it produced happily for england and for man ended in the revolution all the licenses were done away the press was made free and the constitution has already endured a century thus gentlemen our government has been safe in proportion to the freedom of writing here mr erskine produced some of the finest authorities of england  the glorious milton led the van his memorable passage that in former times the issue of the brain was no more stifled than the issue of the womb and his fine illustration of the consequences of suppressing truth in the fate of galileo were dexterously used by mr erskine  he perished in a prison because he ventured to think from observing the phases of venus that the sun was that center of our system and yet said he we know that the sun is in that center and by our knowledge we are enabled to push our navigation to the extreme limits of the world and by line and rule to make our way through regions the most unknown  he then cited the following passage from miltons areopagatica p     if it be desired to know the immediate cause of all this free writing and free speaking there cannot be assigned a truer than your own mild and free and humane government it is the liberty lords and commons which your own valourous and happy counsels have purchased us liberty which is the nurse of all great wits this is that which has rarefied and enlightened our spirits like the influence of heaven this is that which has enfranchised enlarged and lifted up our apprehensions degrees above themselves ye cannot make us now less capable less knowing less eagerly pursuing of the truth unless ye first make yourselves that made us so less the lovers less the founders of our true liberty we can grow ignorant again brutish formal and slavish as ye found us but you then must first become that which ye cannot be oppressive arbitrary and tyrannous as they were from whom ye have freed us that our hearts are now more capacious our thoughts now more erected to the search and expectation of the greatest and exactest things is the issue of your own virtue propagated in us ye cannot suppress that unless ye reinforce an abrogated and merciless law that fathers may dispatch at will their own children and who shall then stick closest to ye and excite others not he who takes up arms for coat and conduct and his four nobles of danegelt although i dispraise not the defense of just immunities yet love my peace better if that were all give me the liberty to know to utter and to argue freely according to conscience above all liberties  what would be best advised then if it be found so hurtful and so unequal to suppress opinions for the newness or unsuitableness to a customary acceptance will not be my task to say i shall only repeat what i have learnt from the lord brook  he exhorts us to hear with patience and humility those however they may be miscalled that desire to live purely in such a use of gods ordinances as the best guidance to their consciences gives them and to tolerate them though in some disconformity to ourselves  and now the time in special is by privilege to write and speak what may help to further the discussing of matters in agitation  the temple of janus with his two controversial faces might now not insignificantly be set open and although all the winds of doctrine were let loose to play upon the earth so truth be in the field we do injurious by licensing and prohibiting to misdoubt her strength  let her and falsehood grapple who ever knew truth put to the worse in a free and open encounter her confuting is the best and surest suppressing  when a man has been laboring the hardest labor in the deep mines of knowledge has furnished out his findings in all their equipage drawn forth his reason as it were a battle ranged scattered and defeated all objections in his way calls out his adversary into the plain offers him all the advantage of wind and sea if he please that he may try the matter by dint of argument  for his opponents then to sculk to lay ambushments to keep a narrow bridge of licensing where the challenger should pass though it be valor enough in soldiership is but weakness and cowardice in the wars of truth for who knows not that truth like the almighty is strong she needs no policies nor stratagems he might have added prosecutions to make her victorious  there is such a connection between licentiousness and liberty that it is not easy to correct the one without dangerously wounding the other it is extremely hard to distinguish the true limit between them like a changeable silk we can easily see there are two different colors but we cannot easily discover where the one ends or where the other begins  the attorney general had given no principles to draw the line by which we were to know where the liberty of the press ended and the licentiousness began he applied lord loughboroughs memorable observation of the application to your tents o israel as a pregnant instance of what would be seditious earl stanhope had with great shrewdness ridiculed this sort of liberty of the press which was to be all on one side  a liberty to praise ministers this is a sort of liberty that even the empress of russia would give you and it may be called the russian liberty of the press to make the work of the author appear seditious the doctrine of lord loughborough must be proved it must be shown that his doctrine was coupled with circumstances or with expressions tending clearly to provoke tumult such as we shall see how this will work  this will bring on a new revolution  we shall have french insurrections but said mr erskine no such thing if one such expression had been proved i would have thrown up my brief  as they are not i stand up to give him the benefits of a fair trial and i am not to be slandered with the charge of disaffection for exercising my faculties in his defense when my lord and i were engaged together as counsel for lord george gordon as well might we have been suspected of savouring tumult and disorder as that i now should be of sedition and disaffection  mr erskine then cited a passage from lord stanhopes rights of juries defended as follows page              the thing that is illegal is the exciting any one to sedition or to a breach f the peace the question therefore upon a libel is whether the paper published did thus excite and was so intended consequently mere speculative writings on the constitution are not libels however absurd they may be suppose for instance that a man were to write a speculative work to prove that a trial by a single judge would be far preferable to the trial by jury or that a parliament composed only of a king and house of peers would be beyond comparison better than a legislature of king lords and commons no man could possibly reprobrate such a work more than i should but if the work did not excite the people to sedition such a speculative publication could certainly never be deemed a libel for absurdity is no part of the definition of a libel  if our boasted liberty of the press were to consist only in the liberty to write in praise of the constitution that is a liberty enjoyed under many an arbitrary government i suppose it would not be deemed quite an unpardonable offense even by the empress of russia if any man were to take it into his head to write a panegyric upon the russian form of government such a liberty as that might therefore properly be termed the russian liberty of the press but the english liberty of the press is of a very different description for by he law of england it is not prohibited to publish speeulative works upon the constitution whether they contain praise or censure  the liberty of the press is of inestimable value for without it this nation might soon be as thoroughly enslaved as france was or as turkey is every man who detests the old government of france and the present government of turkey must be therefore earnest to secure that palladium of liberty and must also be anxious to preserve to the people inviolate the trial by jury that transcendant that incomparable and guardian right  mr erskine came now to examine the passages set forth in the information we have already gone at so much length into his general argument as to be unable to follow him in the ingenuity of his observations on his extract as to the first that all hereditary government was a tyranny he desired the jury to look at the context i deny says pain that hereditary monarchy is the constitution he does not inherit us like floks for the people may confer it they have conferred it this is his argument the second was an extraordinary selection  it would be no attack upon the revotion if it had been accomplished by demons do we love the reformation less for being accomplished by one of the most profligate of our kings no matter that the revolution was brought about by intrigue that it was the work of a coalition it is not by whom but what it is that the people will enquire he contended that the people had by the freedom of opinion obtained every thing from magna charta downwards the third quotation that we had hardly any law in england was no libel for he did not arraign the administration of law and many of our best writers had asserted that there was much confusion much difficulty much to be mended in our jurisprudence with regard to the passages on the two houses of parliament it was strange that mr burke should accuse him he who had so severely so outrageously impeached both houses in their turn and here he quoted some of the memorable passages of mr burke of the lords voting themselves useless and of an addressing house of commons when there was a petitioning people he quoted also the memorable proclamation of mr pit and the duke of richmond from the thatched house tavern on the celebrated passage of mr burke that kings were naturally fond of low company and that lords were only low buffoons he made a severe comment it was a scandalous aspersion on the king and on the nobility but these associators might write though they would suffer no one to write but themselves lawyers though so ignorant of the character and delicacy of the saw as to propagate every species of prejudice against this man and to create such a hue and cry against him that if he had been slained with blood instead of ink  if he had been degraded by the crimes that make humanity abhorrent ought not to have been raised against him in the moment of his trial  such a clamor that even he was almost beat down and abashed by the roar even in the house of parliament he was stigmatized by name but he had delivered his opinion with the spirit and independence that becaume a professional man determined not to shrink from his duty whatever might be the hazard these associators had with equal ignorance said that the great harrington was as great a thief and as obscure a ruffian even as pain  who was harrington  it might have satisfied them to have read his pedigree  he was descended from eight dukes three marquisses seventy earls twentyseven viscounts and thirtysix barons of which number sixteen were knights of the garter will not this do said mr erskine even for this time  in a court of germany it would be decisive but what was better than his descent was his conduct he was the faithful servant of his master charles he was a man of such undoubted honor that he avowed his republican principles yet retained the confidence and affection of his master i know not says toland which most to commend  the king for trusting an honest man though of republican principles or harrington for owning his principles while he served a king how did he serve him he staid in the isle of wight to watch the fortune of his royal master he came up by stealth concealed in the boot of a coach to take his last farewell of him he fell into his arms and fainted at his feet on the scaffold after charless death he wrote the famous oceana and in the work pays a tribute of truth to the virtues of his unfortunate sovereign and ascribes his misfortunes to the feeble nature of a monarchy mr erskine stated the interesting anecdote by which he recovered his oceana from the gripe of cromwell he applied to his favorite daughter and seeing her infant at her side he snatched it up in his arms and ran away alarmed for its fate the mother followed him  i have seized your child said harrington your father has seized mine  i restore to you your child  supplicate your father to restore my child the daughter supplicated and cromwell yielded if my government said cromwell be made to stand it will not be battered down by paper shot after various other quotations from montesquieu milton and other classics he made a warm and affecting conclusion do not think that englishmen are to be bent to your purpose by this froward course  be to their fauts a little blind  be to their virtues very kind  let all their thoughts be unconfined and clap your padlock on the mind engage them by their affections convince their reason and they will be loyal from the only principle that can make loyalty sincere vigorous or rational a conviction that it is their truest interest and that their form of government is for their common good constraint is the natural parent of resistance and this is no new doctrine in all times where one side has been tyrannical the other has been refractory you must all remember gentlemen lucians pleasant story  jupiter and a countryman were walking together conversing with great freedom and familiarity upon the subjects of heaven and earth the countryman listened with attention and acquiescence while jupiter strove only to convince him but happening to hint a doubt jupiter turned hastily round and threatened him with his thunder  ah ah said the countryman now jupiter i know that your are wrong youre always wrong when you appeal to your thunder  the attorney general rose to reply but mr campbell the foreman of the jury said he was instructed by his brother jurors to say that he might save himself the trouble of any observations unless he thought otherwise himself for that they were satisfied the attorney general sat down and the jury immediately gave a verdict of guilty  finis
