dyers news examined as to his sweddish memorial against the review had not the town been alarmed with my name in print and all my friends surprised with a prospect of something fatal attending it i had not for a long time appeared in print again in this part of britain  but i can not be so far wanting to the desires of those whom this has amused as to forbear giving the world some account of it  it is sent down it seems in dyers news from london that the sweddish ambassador monsieur liencroon has delivered in a memorial to this court complaining of the review as reflecting on the king of sweden and demands satisfaction  first gentlemen i assure you i know nothing of this my self neither from my friends in england nor from the government neither do i believe one word of it i have immediately on notice of this written to england and desired some of my friends to wait on the secretaries of state to acquaint them where i am and that if it be required i will on the first notice take post for london and put my self into their hands to answer any thing the law shall require  in the next place i have revised what i have writ of the king of sweden and i profess i can see nothing in it in the least that is or ought to be an affront to his swedish majesty  and lastly i thank god i live in a land where the liberty of the subject is such that should all this be true i can receive no hurt but by law  the king of sweden indeed has carried it with so high a hand in some parts of the world that their princes deliver up their subjects bound hand and foot for him to use his pleasure with them  but god be praised the queen of england is none of those the liberty of english men is in a better case and no man can be punished in england at the will of the prince much less at the will of a foreign prince  in england even the sovereign can not punish but by law the subject must have a fair trial and a jury of his equals must determine the fact if the king of sweden should demand the delivering up the meanest subject the queen has even a meaner if such can be than the author of the review her majesty would immediately reply that it is not in her power to deliver any of her subjects up or to punish them any farther than as the law directs and that the meanest and most despicable subject in england may even say to his sovereign that he will not be delivered up  nor do i believe the king of sweden can think he has an emperor of germany to deal with in the queen of great britain and that he can demand a count zobor of her majesty  i am content to be answerable to the law if i have offended him or any body else and it is no arrogance to say i am a subject of the laws of england and of no other mortal power in the world  this is to be a subject to god and the queen for an obedience to the law is all the subjection speaking of humane affairs that either god or the queen requires  but what is it you said of the king of sweden says the enquirers you must have said some ill thing of him or else he would not have complained of your paper by his ambassador  truly gentlemen i will tell you as near as i can what i said of him  and if i tell it again you will say it is a sign i have not much fear upon me of his resentment    i said that the swede lying in saxony all this summer with  0000 men about him and doing nothing while he suffered his new king of poland to be ruined and the country to be ravaged by the muscovite signified that he had some secret design in his head some project on foot which no body knew of but himself    i said if he had no design no meaning no prospect and yet lay still there while his subjects and his allies were ruined by his enemies he was the most impolitick nothingdoing prince in the world    i said that for a prince to neglect the defense of his own subjects and leave them exposed to the invasion of cruel and barbarous neighbors when he is at the same time pushing on the conquests and triumphs of victory against their neighbors is all one with a father who neglects to provide for his family of whom the text says he is worse than an infidel    i said that if the swede should fall on the emperor and thereby oblige him to quitt the confederacy and make a separate peace with france we should have but little cause to thank him for his care of the protestant religion    i said that if the swede should fall upon the emperor and oblige him to draw all his troops from hungaria naples provence and the rhine he would be beaten and not be able to stand before him  these and such as these is the utmost of the matter and if the swedish ambassador has made a complaint of this i shall always be ready to answer it  if i had really said any thing which was unbecoming me of the king of sweden or any body else i should be willing to acknowledge it and make satisfaction but as what i have said are both known and useful truths with a great deal of calmness and satisfaction i say i am ready to answer him or any man else as far as the liberty and laws of britain require and so much for the king of swedens ambassador  it is a happy thing gentlemen to live under the laws of england i hope you are advancing apace to the same liberty you may be assured no nation in europe enjoys the like privileges and i hope you will all partake of them and learn to value them  no resentment of foreign princes can affect us no threatenings terrify us an english man is born a free man no power can insult him no superior oppress him the law only is his governor no magistrate no counselor no authority no not the sovereign has the least illegal power over him he can have no sentence pronounced against him no punishment inflicted no fine levied no not by the queen her self but according to law  this is the confidence the peace and the glory of this island and no foreign power can interpose in it if the greatest king or emperor in the world demands of the queen of britain the delivering up any one of her subjects to them they may lawfully refuse to go  if the sovereign puts a man in prison by his royal authority  the man serves the judge with a writ of habeas corpus and he will let him out again even her majesty her self asking pardon for the expression cannot detain him  he that will abandon this liberty is not a fool only but a knave a knave to himself and to his family a knave to his posterity and a knave to the constitution of the nation for he gives up the right of a subject and leaves an example of wilful bondage to his countrymen  if there be any such i have only to say i am sure i am not the man britains gentlemen are none of the tribe of issachar whose coat of arms is an ass couchant what burden the law puts upon us we freely submit to and never complain either of the law or of the sovereign  but we always kick at oppression and resist tyrrany and it has hitherto god be praised been found in vain to enslave us  her majesty the best queen that ever governed us has made it her glory to reign over a free people the queen despises tyrrany as infinitely below her it is her pleasure to see the laws triumph it is her glory to see justice uninterrupted and it is her majestys peculiar blessing that there are none of her people complaining of oppression  attempts enough have been made to surprise the government into tyrrany but both the attempts and their authors have found their quietus in her majestys justice and in her native aversion to cruelty and arbitrary power  it is from hence with satisfaction any subject may say and i say it with a secret joy that i can not express the innocent man may fly with safety to the law if he has not offended he is sure he shall not be oppressed if he has he is sure to find justice always mingled with the princes compassion  let none of my friends be afraid for me if i have broke the law they ought to abandon me to the law and i ask no favor if i have not no king no power no threatening no not all the powers of europe can make her majesty break in upon her peoples liberties or deviat from justice in the satisfaction of which all her subjects are easy and safe and i among the rest  as to dyers letter he was always careful that it should not be seen in london whether for shame or fear is not material and from thence he often takes the liberty to forge stories that have not the least ground of truth in them and this is not the first time he has done so by me in particular which forgeries he spreads in the country and the letter not being to be had in the city he is not so easily contradicted  i must say however dyer the news writer ought to have been the last man in the world to have said this in his paper since monsieur liencroon never took notice what he wrote in his public paper viz that the duke of marlborrow obtained his desire of the king of sweden by bribing count piper  advertisement preparing for the press a brief scheme of the duty and office of a justice of peace and a constable conform to the constitution of scotland and england both separately and unitedly considered  also a review of the trade and improvement of britain this last is designed if time in scotland permits the author to be published weekly and to be so ordered that gentlemen who think them worth it may collect them and bind them up in volumes yearly they are designed to meddle neither with whig nor tory church nor dissenter williamite or jacobite but merely for the benefit of all parties endeavor to talk to you of the improvements of trade land navigation manufactures etc for the public advantage of scotland and without any gain to the author  finis
