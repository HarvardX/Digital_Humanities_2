an englishman throughout europe and even in some parts of asia to soften the sorrows of the prisoner excited in the mind of the author the subject of the following pages which formed into a dramatic story have produced from the theater a profit far exeeeding the usual pecuniary advantages arising from a successful comedy  the uncertainty in what part of the east the hero of the present piece was at the time it was written dispensing his benevolence caused the writer after many researches and objections to fix the scene on the island of sumatra where the english settlement the system of government and every description of the manners of the people reconcile the incidents of the play to the strictest degree of probability  prologue written by thomas vaughan esquire spoken by mr holman how say you critic gods galleries and you below pit  are you all friends  or here  and there  a foe come to protect your literary trade which mrs scribble dares again invade  but know you not  in all the fair ones do it is not to please themselves alone  but you then who so churlish or so cynic grown would wish to change a simper for a frown or who so jealous of their own dear quill would point the paragraph her fame to kill et such there are in this allscribbling town and men of letters too  of some renown who sicken at all merit but their own but sure twere more for wits  for honors sake to make the dramas race  the give and take looking round the house my hint i sees approved  so pray begin it and praise us  roundly for the good things in it nor let severity our faults expose when godlike homers self was known to doze but of the piece  methinks i hear you hint some dozen lines or more should give the tint  tell how sir john with lady bettys maid is caught intriguing at a masquerade which lady betty in a jealous fit resents by flirting with sir ben  the cit whose threefeet spouse to modish follies bent mistakes a sixfeet valet  for a gent whilst miss repugnant to her guardians plan elopes in breeches with her favorite man such are the hints we read in roscius days by way of prologue ushered in their plays but we like ministers and cautious spies in secret measures think  the merit lies yet shall the muse thus far unveil the plot  this play was tragicomically got those sympathetic sorrows to impart which harmonize the feelings of the heart and may at least this humble merit boast a structure founded on fair fancys coast with you it rests that judgment to proclaim which in the world must raise or sink it is fame yet ere her judges sign their last report it is

lady tremor i tell you sir you are mistaken   sir luke why did not you come over from england exactly sixteen years ago   lady not so long   sir luke have not we been married the tenth of next april sixteen years   lady not so long    sir luke did you not come over the year of the great eclipse answer me that   lady i dont remember it   sir luke but i do  and shall remember it as long as i live  the first time i saw you was in the garden of the dutch envoy you were looking through a glass at the sun  i immediately began to make love to you and the whole affair was settled while the eclipse lasted  just one hour eleven minutes and three seconds   lady but what is all this to my age   sir luke because i know you were at that time near seventeen  and without one qualification except your youth  and not being a mullatto   lady sir luke sir luke this is not to be borne    sir luke oh yes  i forgot  you had two letters of recommendation from two great families in england   lady letters of recommendation   sir luke yes your character  that you know is all the fortune we poor englishmen situated in india expect with a wife who crosses the sea at the hazard of her life to make us happy   lady and what but our characters would you have us bring do you suppose any lady ever came to india who brought along with her friends or fortune   sir luke no my dear  and what is worse  she seldom leaves them behind either   lady no matter sir luke  but if i delivered to you a good character    sir luke yes my dear you did  and if you were to ask me for it again i cannot say i could give it you   lady how uncivil how unlike are your manners to the manners of my lord flint   sir luke ay  you are never so happy as when you have an opportunity of expressing your admiration of him  a disagreeable nay a very dangerous man  one is never sure of ones self in his presence  he carries every thing he hears to the ministers of our suspicious sultan  and i feel my head shake whenever i am in his company   lady how different does his lordship appear to me  to me he is all politesse   sir luke politesse how should you underderstand what is real politesse you know your education was very much confined    lady and if it was confined   i beg sir luke you will one time or other cease these reflections  you know they are what i cannot bear walks about in a passion pray does not his lordship continually assure me i might be taken for a countess were it not for a certain little grovelling toss i have caught with my head  and a certain little confined hitch in my walk both which i learnt of you  learnt by looking so much at you    sir luke and now if you dont take care by looking so much at his lordship you may catch some of his defects   lady i know of very few he has   sir luke i know of many  besides those he assumes    lady assumes     sir luke yes do you suppose he is as forgetful as he pretends to be no no  but because he is a favorite with the sultan and all our great men at court he thinks it genteel or convenient to have no memory  and yet i will answer for it he has one of the best in the universe   lady i dont believe your charge   sir luke why though he forgets his appointments with his tradesmen did you ever hear of his forgetting to go to court when a place was to be disposed of did he ever make a blunder and send a bribe to a man out of power did he ever forget to kneel before the prince of this island  or to look in his highnesss presence like the statue of patientresignation in humble expectation    lady dear sir luke     sir luke sent from his own country in his very infancy and brought up in the different courts of petty arbitrary princes here in asia he is the slave of every great man and the tyrant of every poor one    lady petty princes  it is well his highness our sultan does not hear you   sir luke it is well he does not  dont you repeat what i say  but you know how all this fine country is harrassed and laid waste by a set of princes sultans as they style themselves and i know not what  who are for ever calling out to each other that is mine and that is mine  and you have no business here  and you have no business there  and  i have business every where strutting then give me this  and give me that and take this and take that   makes signs of fighting lady a very elegant description truly   sir luke why you know it is all matter of fact  and lord flint brought up from his youth amongst these people has not one trait of an englishman about him  he has imbibed all this countrys cruelty and i dare say would mind no more seeing me hung up by my thumbs  or made to dance upon a redhot gridiron     lady that is one of the tortures i never heard of  o i should like to see that of all things   sir luke yes  by keeping this mans company you will soon be as cruel as he is  he will teach you every vice  a consequential  grave  dull  and yet with that degree of levity that dares to pay his addresses to a woman even before her husbands face   lady did not you say this minute his lordship had not a trait of his own country about him    sir luke well well  as you say that last is a trait of his own country   enter servant and lord flint serve lord flint     exit servant lady my lord i am extremely glad to see you  we were just mentioning your name    lord were you indeed madam you do me great honor   sir luke

engaged out to dinner today for her ladyship and i dine out   lady yes my lord and we should be happy to find your lordship of the party   lord engaged out to dinner  egad very likely  very likely  but if i am  i have positively forgotten where   lady we are going to    lord no  i think now you put me in mind of it i think i have company to dine with me  i am either going out to dinner or have company to dine with me but i really cannot tell which  however my people know   but i cannot call to mind    sir luke perhaps your lordship has dined can you recollect that   lord no no  i have not dined   what is oclock   lady perhaps my lord you have not breakfasted   lord o yes i have breakfasted  i think so  but upon my word these things are very hard to remember   sir luke they are indeed my lord  and i wish all my family would entirely forget them   lord what did your ladyship say was oclock   lady exactly twelve my lord   lord bless me i ought to have been some where else then  an absolute engagement  i have broke my word  a positive appointment   lady shall i send a servant   lord no no no no  by no means  it cannot be helped now  and they know my unfortunate failing  besides i will beg their pardon and i trust that will be ample satistaction   lady you are very good my lord not to leave us   lord i could not think of leaving you so soon madam  the happiness i enjoy here is such    sir luke and very likely were your lordship to go away now you might never recollect to come again   enter servant serve a gentleman sir just come from on board an english vessel says he has letters to present to you   sir luke show him in   exit servant he has brought his character too i suppose  and left it behind too i suppose   enter mr twineall in a fashionable undress twi sir luke i have the honor of presenting to you gives letters one from my lord cleland  one from sir thomas shoestring  one from colonel fril   sir luke aside who in the name of wonder have my friends recommended   reads while lord flint and the lady talk apart no  as i live he is a gentleman and the son of a lord   going to lady tremor my dear that is a gentleman notwithstanding his appearance  dont laugh  but let me introduce you to him   lady a gentleman certainly  i did not look at him before  but now i can perceive it   sir luke mr twineall give me leave to introduce lady tremor to you and my lord flint  this my lord is the honorable mr twineall from england who will do me the favor to remain in my house till he is settled to his mind in some post here they bow i beg your pardon sir for the somewhat cool reception lady tremor and i gave you at first  but i dare say her ladyship was under the same mistake as myself  and i must own i took you at first fight for something very different from the person you prove to be  for really no english ships have arrived in this harbor for these five years past and the dress of us english gentlemen is so much altered fince that time    twi but i hope sir luke if it is the alteration meets with your approbation   lady o to be sure  it is extremely elegant and becoming   sir luke yes my dear i dont doubt but you think so for i remember you used to make your favorite monkey wear just such a jacket when he went out a visiting   twin was he your favorite madam  sir you are very obliging  bowing to sir luke sir luke my lord if it were possible for your lordship to call to your remembrance such a trifle    lady dear sir luke   pulling him lord egad i believe i do call to my remembrance  gravely considering  not i assure you sir that i perceive any great resemblance  or if it was so  i dare say it is merely in the dress   which i must own strikes me as most ridiculous  very ridiculous indeed     twi my lord   lord i beg pardon if i have said any thing that   lady tremor what did i say   make my apology if i have said any thing improper  you know my unhappy failing   goes up the stage lady to twineall sir his lordship has made a mistake in the word ridiculous which i am sure he did not mean to say  but he is apt to make use of one word for another  his lordship has been so long out of england that he may be said in some measure to have forgotten his native language   his lordship all this time appears consequentially absent twi and you have perfectly explained madam  indeed i ought to have been convinced without your explanation that if his lordship made use of the word ridiculous even intentionally that the word had now changed its former sense and was become a mode to express satisfaction  or his lordship would not have made use of it in the very forcible manner he did to a perfect stranger   sir luke what mr twineall have you new modes new fashions for words too in england as well as for dresses  and are you equally extravagant in their adoption   lady i never heard sir luke but that the fashion of words varied as well as the fashion of every thing else   twi but what is most extraordinary  we have now a fashion in england of speaking without any words at all   lady pray sir how is that   sir luke ay do mr twineall teach my wife and i shall be very much obliged to you  it will be a great accomplishment even you my lord ought to be attentive to this fashion   twi why madam for instance when a gentleman is asked a question which is either troublesome or improper to answer you dont say you will not answer it even though you speak to an inferior   but you say   really it appears to me eeeee  mutters and shrugs  that is  momomomomo  mutters  if you see the thing  for my part   tetetete   and that is all i can tell about it at persent   sir luke and you have told nothing   twi nothing upon earth   lady but may not one guess what you mean   twi o yes  perfectly at liberty to guess   sir luke well i will be shot if i could guess   twi and again  when an impertinent pedant asks you a question that you know nothing about and it may not be convenient to say so  you answer boldly why really sir my opinion is that the greek poet  hehehehe  mutters  wewewewe  you see  if his idea was  and if the latin translator  mismismismis  shrugs   that i should think  in my humble opinion  but the doctor may know better than i     sir luke the doctor must know very little else   twi or in case of a duel where one does not care to say who was right or who was wrong  you answer   this sir is the state of the matter  mr f  came first  tetetete  on that  bebebebe  if the other  in short  whispers  whiswhiswhiswhis    sir luke what   twi there now you have it  there it is  but dont say a word about it  or if you do  dont say it come from me    lady why you have not told a word of the story   twi but that your auditor must not say to you  that is not the fashion  he never tells you that   he may say  you have not made yourself perfectly clear  or he may say   he must have the matter more particularly pointed out somewhere else  but that is all the auditor can say with good breeding   lady a very pretty method indeed to satisfy ones curiosity   enter servant serve mr haswell   sir luke this is a countryman of ours mr twineall and a very good man i assure you   enter mr haswell sir luke mr haswell how do you do   warmly has sir luke i am glad to see you   lady tremor how do you do  he bows to the rest lady o mr haswell i am extremely glad you are come  here is a young adventurer just arrived from england who has been giving us such a strange account of all that is going on there   introducing twineall has sir you are welcome to india sir luke whispers haswell

twineall i have the honor of knowing his lordship your father extremely well  he holds his seat in parliament still i presume   twi he does sir   has and your uncle sir charles   twi both sir  both in parliament still   has pray sir has any act in behalf of the poor clergy taken place yet   twi in behalf of the poor clergy sir  i will tell you  lll tell you sir   as to that act  concerning  shrugs and mutters  emememem  the committee  emem  ways and means  heehee  i assure you sir  tetete  sir luke lady and lord flint laugh my father and my uncle both think so i assure you   has think how sir   sir luke nay that is not good breeding  you must ask no more questions   has why not   sir luke because  wewewewe  mimicks  he knows nothing about it   has what sir  not know   twi yes sir perfectly acquainted with every thing that passes in the house  but i assure you that when they come to be reported   but sir luke now permit me in my turn to make a few inquiries concerning the state of this country   sir luke starts and fixes his eyes suspiciously on lord flint sir luke why one does not like to speak much about the country one lives in  but mr haswell you have been visiting our encampments you may tell us what is going on there   lady pray mr haswell is it true that the sultan cut off the head of one of his wives the other day because she said i will not   sir luke do my dear be silent   lady i will not   sir luke o that the sultan had you instead of me   lady and with my head off i suppose   sir luke no my dear in that state i should have no objection to you myself   lady aside to sir luke now i will frighten you ten times more  but mr haswell i am told there are many persons suspected of disaffection to the present sultan who have been lately by his orders arrested and sold to slavery notwithstanding there was no proof against them produced   has proof   in a state such as this the charge is quite sufficient   sir luke in apparent agonies wishing to turn the discourse well my lord and how does your lordship find yourself this afternoon  this morning i mean  bless my soul why i begin to be as forgetful as your lordship   smiling and fawning lady how i pity the poor creatures   sir luke aside to lady take care what you say before that tool of state  look at him and tremble for your head   lady look at him and tremble for yours  and so mr haswell all this is true  and some people of consequence too i am told dragged from their homes and sent to slavery merely on suspicion   has yet less do i pity those than some whom prisons and dungeons crammed before are yet prepared to receive   lord mr haswell such is the sultans pleasure   sir luke will your lordship take a turn in the garden it looks from this door very pleasant  does not it   lady but pray mr haswell has not the sultan sent for you to attend at his palace this morning   has he has madam   lady there i heard he had but sir luke said not  i am told he thinks himself under the greatest obligations to you   has the report has flattered me  but if his highness should think himself under obligations i can readily point a way by which he may acquit himself of them   lady in the mean time i am sure you feel for those poor sufferers   has with stifled emotion sir luke good morning to you  i called upon some trifling business but i have outstaid my time and therefore fore i will call again in a couple of hours  lady tremor good morning  my lord  mr twineall   bows and exit twi sir luke your garden does look so divinely beautiful    sir luke come my lord will you take a turn in it come mr twineall  come my dear  taking ber hand i cannot think what business mr haswell has to speak to me upon  for my part i am quite a plain man  and busy myself about no ones affairs except my own  but i dare say your lordship has forgot all we have been talking about   lord if you permit me sir luke i will hand the lady   sir luke certainly my lord if you please  come mr twineall and i will conduct you   exeunt end of the first act act ii scene i an apartment at sir luke tremors enter twineall and meanright twi my dear friend after so long a separation how gland i am to meet you  but how devilish unlucky that you should on the very day of my arrival be going to set sail for another part of the world yet before you go i must beg a favor of you  you know sir luke and his family perfectly well i dare say   mean i think so  i have been in his house near six years   twi the very person on earth i wanted  sir luke has power here i suppose  a word from him might do a man some service perhaps  significantly mean why yes i dont know a man that has more influence at a certain place   twin and her ladyship seems a very clever gentlewoman   mean very   twi and i have a notion they think me very clever   mean i dare say they do   twi yes  but i mean very clever   mean no doubt   twi but my dear friend you must help me to make them think better of me still  and when my fortune is made i will make yours  for when i once become acquainted with peoples dispositions their little weaknesses foibles and faults i can wind twist twine and get into the corner of every ones heart and lie so snug they cannot know i am there till they want to pull me out and find it is impossible   mean excellent talent   twi is not it and now my dear friend do you inform me of the secret dispositions and propensities of every one in this family and of all their connections  what lady values herself upon one qualification and what lady upon another  what gentleman will like to be told of his accomplishments or his daughters  or of his horses or of his dogs  now my dear ned acquaint me with all this  and within a fortnight i will become the most necessary rascal   not a creature shall know how to exist without me   mean why such a man as you ought to have made your fortune in england   twi no  my father and my three uncles monopolized all the great men themselves and would never introduce me where i was likely to become their rival  this  this is the very spot for me to display my genius  but then i must penetrate the people first  and you will kindly save me that trouble  come give me all their characters  all short all i am to praise  and all i am to avoid praising  in order to endear myself to them takes out tablets come  begin with sir luke   mean sir luke  values himself more upon personal bravery than upon any thing else   twi thank you my dear friend  thank you writes was he ever in the army   mean oh yes  besieged a capital fortress a few years ago  and now the very name of a battle or a great general tickles his vanity and he takes all the praises you can lavish upon the subject as compliments to himself   twi thank you  thank you a thousand times  writes i will mention a battle very soon   mean not directly   twi o no  let me alone for time and place  go on my friend  go on  her ladyship    mean descended from the ancient kings of scotland   twi you dont say so   mean and though she is so nicely scrupulous as never to mention the word genealogy yet i have seen her agitation so great when the advantages of high birth have been extolled she could scarcely withhold her sentiments of triumph which in order to disguise she has assumed a disdain for all vain titles  empty sounds  and idle pomp   twi thank you  thank you  this is a most excellent trait of the ladys  writes pedigree of the kings of scotland o i have her at once   mean yet do it nicely  oblique touches rather than open explanations   twi let me alone for that   mean she has i know in her possession  but i dare say she would not show it you nay on the contrary would even affect to be highly offended if you were to mention it  and yet it certainly would flatter her to know you were acquainted with her having it   twi what  what  what is it   mean a large oldfashioned wig  which malcolm the third or fourth her great ancestor wore when he was crowned at scone in the year     twi i will mention it   mean take care   twi o let me alone for the manner   mean she will pretend to be angry   twi that i am prepared for  pray who is my lord flint   mean a deep man  and a great favorite at court   twi indeed  how am i to please him   mean by insinuations against the present sultan   twi how   mean with all his pretended attachment his heart     twi are you sure of it   mean sure  he blinds sir luke who by the bye is no great politician but i know his lordship  and if he thought he was sure of his ground  and he thinks he shall be sure of it soon  then    twi i will insinuate myself and join his party  but in the mean time preserve good terms with sir luke in case any thing should fall in my way there  who is mr haswell   mean he pretends to be a man of principle and sentiment  flatter him on that   twi the easieft thing in the world  no people like flattery better than such as he  they will bear even to hear their vices praised  i will myself undertake to praise the vices of a man of sentiment till he shall think them so many virtues  you have mentioned no ladies but the lady of the house yet   mean there is no other lady except a pretty girl who came over from england about two years ago for a husband and not succeeding in another part of the country is now recommended to this house  and has been here three or four months   twi let me alone to please her   twi let me alone to please her   mean yes  i believe you are skilled   twi for the art of flattery no one more   mean but damn it  it is not a liberal art   twi it is a great science notwithstanding  and studied at present by all the connoisseurs  zounds i have staid a long time  i cannot attend to any more characters at present  sir luke and his lady will think me inattentive if i dont join them  shall i see you again  if not  i wish you a pleasant voyage  i will make the most of what you have told me  you will hear i am a great man  god bless you  good bye  you will hear i am a great man   exit mean and if i am not mistaken i shall hear you are turned out of the house before tomorrow morning o twineall exactly the reverse of every character have you now before you  the greatest misfortune in the ife of sir luke has been flying from his army in the midst of an engagement and a most humiliating degradation in consequence which makes him so feelingly alive on the subject of a battle that nothing but his want of courage can secure my friend twinealls life for venturing to name the subject  then lord flint firmly attached to the interest of the sultan will be all on fire when he hears of open disaffection  but most of all her ladyship whose father was a grocer and uncle a noted advertising periwigmaker on a new construction she will run mad to hear of births titles and long pedigrees  poor twineall little do thou think what is prepared for thee  there is mr haswell too  but to him have i sent you to be reclaimed  to him  who free from faults or even foibles of his own has yet more potently the blessing given of tenderness for ours   exit scene ii the inside of a prison several prisoners dispersed in different situations enter keeper and haswell with lights keep this way sir  the prisons this way are more extensive still  you seem to feel for these unthinking men  but they are a set of unruly

to my lady tremor my friend wrote me word he had reason to suppose your affections were improperly fixed upon a young gentleman in that neighborhood and this was his reason for wishing you to leave that place to come hither  and this continual dejection convinces me my friend was not mistaken  answer me  can you say he was   aur why then sir luke heartily to confess    sir luke nay no tears  why in tears for a husband be comforted  well get you one ere long i warrant   aur dear sir luke how can you imagine i am in tears because i have not a husband while you see lady tremor every day in tears for the very opposite cause   sir luke no matter  women like a husband through pride  and i have known a woman marry from that very motive even a man she has been ashamed of   aur why then i dare say poor lady tremor married from pride   sir luke yes  and i will let her know pride is painful   aur but sir her ladyships philosophy    sir luke she has no philosophy   enter lady tremor and twineall sir luke where is his lordship what have you done with him   lady he is speaking a word to mr meanright about his passport to england  did you mean me sir luke that had no philosophy i protest i have a great deal   sir luke when where did you show it   lady why when the servant at my lady grisseis threw a whole urn of boiling water upon your legs did i give any proofs of female weakness did i faint scream or even shed a tear   sir luke no  no  very true  and while i lay sprawling on the carnet i could see you fanning and holding the smelling bottle to the lady of the house begging her not to make herself uneasy for that the accident was of no manner of consequence   aur dear sir dont be angry  i am sure her ladyship spoke as she thought   sir luke i suppose she did miss   aur i mean  she thought the accident might be easily got the better of  she thought you might be easily recovered   lady no indeed i did not  but i thought sir luke had frequently charged me with the want of patience and that moment the very thing in the world i could have wished happened  on purpose to give me an opportunity to prove his accusation false   sir luke very well madam  but did not the whole company cry shame on your behavior did not they say it was not the conduct of a wife   lady only our particular acquaintance could say so  for the rest of the company i am sure did not take me to be your wife  thank heaven our appearances never betray that secret  do you think we look like the same flesh and blood   sir luke that day in particular we did not  for i remember you had been no less than three hours at your toilet   aur and indeed sir luke if you were to use milk of roses and several other little things of that kind you cannot think how much more like a fine gentleman you would look  such things as those make almost all the difference there is between you and such a gentleman as mr twineall   twi no pardon me madam  a face like mine may use those things  but in sir lukes they would entirely destroy that fine martial appearance   sir luke looks confounded which women as well as men admire  for as valor is the first ornament of our sex    lady what are you saying mr twineall aside i will keep him on this subject if i can   twi i was going to observe madam  that the reputation of a general  which puts me in mind sir luke of an account i read of a battle    he crosses over to sir luke who turns up the stage in the utmost confusion and steals out of the room lady well sir  go on  go on  you were going to introduce    twi a battle madam  but sir luke is gone   lady never mind that sir  he generally runs away on these occasions   sir luke coming back what were you saying aurelia about a husband   lady she did not speak   sir luke to be sure ladies in india do get husbands very quick   twi not always  i am told sir luke  women of family  fixing his eyes steadfastly on lady tremor indeed may soon enter into the matrimonial state  but the rich men in india we are told in england are grown lately very particular with whom they marry and there is not a man of any repute that will now look upon a woman as a wife unless she is descended from a good family   looking at lady tremor who walks up the stage and steals off just as sir luke had done before sir luke i am very sorry  very sorry to say mr twineall that has not been always the case   twi then i am very sorry too sir luke for it is as much impossible that a woman who is not born of a good family can be     lady tremor returns sir luke that is just what i say  they cannot be    lady sir luke let me tell you    sir luke it does not signify telling my dear  you have proved it   lady  to twineall sir let me tell you    twi o o my dear madam it is all in vain  there is no such thing  it cannot be  there is no pleading against conviction  a person of low birth must in every particular be a terrible creature   sir luke going to her a terrible creature a terrible creature   lady here comes my lord flint  i will appeal to him   enter lord flint sir luke going to him my lord i was saying as proof that our great sultan who now fills this throne is no impostor as the rebel party would insinuate no low born man but of the royal stock his conduct palpably evinces  for had he not been nobly born we should have beheld the plebeian bursting forth upon all occasions  looking at lady tremor and then heaven help all those who had had any dealings with him   lady provoking  goes up the stage lord sir luke is there a doubt of the emperors birth and title he is the real sultan depend upon it  it surprises me to hear you talk with the smallest uncertainty   twi o sir luke i wonder at it too  aside to lord flint and yet damn me my lord if i have not my doubts   lord flint starts sir luke i my lord far be it from me i was only saying what other people said for my part i never harbored a doubt of the kind  aside my head begins to nod only for that word  pray heaven i may die with it on  i should not like to lose my head  nor should i like to die by a bullet  nor by a small sword  and a cannon ball would be as disagreeable as any thing i know  it is very odd  but i never yet could make up my mind in what manner i should like to go out of the world   during this speech twineall is paying court to lord flint they come forward and sir luke retires lord your temerity astonishes me   twi i must own my lord i feel somewhat awkward in saying it to your lordship  but my own heart  my own conscience  my own sentiments  they are my own  and they are dear to me  and so it is  the sultan does not appear to be with significance that great man some people think him   lord sir you astonish me  pray what is your name i have forgotten it   twi twineall my lord  the honorable henry twineall  your lordship does me great honor to ask  arrived this morning from england as your lordship may remember  in the ship mercury my lord  and all the officers on board speaking with the highest admiration and warmest terms of your lordships official character   lord why then mr twineall i am very sorry    twi and so am i my lord that your sentiments and mine should so far disagree as i know they do  i am not unacquainted with your firm adherence to the emperor  but i am unused to disguise my thoughts  i could not if i would  i have no little views  no sinister motives  no plots  no intrigues  no schemes of preferment  and i verily believe that if a large scymitar was now directed at my head  or a large pension directed to my pocket  in the first case at least i should speak my mind   lord aside a dangerous young man this and i may make something of the discovery   twi aside it tickles him to the soul i find  my lord now i begin to be warm on the subject i feel myself quite agitated  and from the intelligence which i have heard even when i was in england  there is every reason to suppose   exm  exm  exm    mutters lord what sir what   twi you understand me   lord no sir  explain   twi why then there is every reason to suppose  some people are not what they should be  pardon my thoughts if they are wrong   lord i do pardon your thoughts with all my heart  but your words young man must be answered for aside lady tremor good morning   twi aside he is going to ruminate on my sentiments i dare say   lady shall we have your lordships company toward the evening mr haswell will be here if your lordship has no objection   sir luke how do you know mr haswell will be here   lady because he has just called in his way to the palace and said so  and he has been telling us some very interesting stories too   sir luke of his moring visits i suppose  i heard meanright say he saw him very busy   lady sir luke and i dine out my lord but we shall return early in the evening   lord i will be here without fail  sir luke aword with you if you please  they come forward mr twineall has taken some very improper liberties with the sultans name and i must insist on making him answer for it   sir luke my lord you are extremely welcome trembling to do whatever your lordship pleases with any one belonging to me or to my house  but i hope your lordship will pay some regard to the master of it   lord o great regard to the master  and to the mistress also  but for that gentleman    sir luke do what your lordship pleases   lord i will  and i will make him    sir luke if your lordship does not forget it   lord i shall not forget it sir luke  i have a very good memory when i please   sir luke i dont in the least doubt it my lord  i never did doubt it   lord and i can be very severe too sir luke when i please   sir luke i dont in the least doubt it my lord  i never did doubt it   lord you may depend upon seeing me here in the evening  and then you shall find i have not threatened more than i mean to perform  good morning   sir luke good morning my lord  i dont in the least doubt it    exit lord flint lady coming forward with twineall for heavens sake mr twineall what has birth to do with    twi it has to do with every thing madam  even with beauty  and i wish i may suffer death if a woman with all the mental and personal accomplishments of the finest creature in europe would to me be of that value snapping his finger if lowly born   sir luke and i sincerely wish every man who visits me was of the same opinion   aur for shame mr twineall persons of mean birth ought not to be despised for what it was not in their power to prevent  and if it is a misfortune you should consider them only as objects of pity   twi and so i do pity them  and so i do  most sincerely  poor creatures   looking on lady tremor sir luke aye now he has mended it finely   lady mr twineall let me tell you    sir luke my dear  lady tremor  taking her aside let him alone  let him go on  there is something preparing for him he little expects  so let the poor man say and do what he pleases for the present  it will not last long  for he has offended my lord flint and i dare say his lordship will be able upon some account or another to get him imprisoned for life   lady imprisoned why not take off his head at once   sir luke well my dear  i am sure i have no objection  and i dare say my lord will have it done to oblige you  egad i must make friends with her to keep mine safe  aside lady do you mean to take him out to dinner with us   sir luke yes my dear if you approve of it  not else   lady you are grown extremely polite   sir luke yes my dear his lordship has taught me how to be polite  mr twineall lady tremor and i are going to prepare for our visit and i will send a servant to show you to your apartment in order to dress for you will favor us with your company i hope   twi certainly sir luke i shall do myself the honor   lady come this way aurelia i cannot bear to look at him   exit with aurelia sir luke nor i to think of him   exit twi if i have not settled my business in this family i am mistaken  they seem to have but one mind about me  devilish clever fellow egad  i am the man to send into the world  such a volatile goodlooking scoundrel too no one suspects me   to be sure i am under some few obligations to my friend for letting me into the different characters of the family  and yet i dont know whether i am obliged to him or not  for if he had not made me acquainted with them  i should soon have had the skill to find them out myshelf  no i will not think myshelf under any obligation to him  it is devilish inconvenient for a gentleman to be under an obligation   exit scene ii the place the sultan

that is not good breeding   has why do you blush aurelia   aur because hesitating this gentleman   came over in the same ship with mr twineall   sir luke and i cantt say i wonder at your biushing   twi why then positively sir i thought i had known every passenger  and surely    lady mr twineall your behavior puts me out of all patience  did you not hear the gentleman man say he came in the same vessel and is not that sufficient   twi perfectly madam  perfectly  but i thought there might be some mistake   elv and there is sir  you find you are mistaken   lady i thought so     hasto elvirus

prisoners you visited this morning   sir luke ave meanright told me he saw you coming from them with your long cloak and said he should not have known you if somebody had not said it was you   elvirus looks with surprise confusion and repentance lady but what success with the sultan   has he has granted me the pardon and freedom of any six i shall present as objects of his mercy   lady i sincerely rejoice  then the youth and his father whom you felt so much for i am sure will be in the number of those who share your clemency   haswell makes no reply and after a pause  elv with the most supplicatory tone and manner sir  mr haswell  o heavens   sir luke come mr haswell this young man seems sorry he has offended you  forgive him   lady aye do mr haswell  are you sorry sir   elv o

madam will you suffer me to speak a few words     aside to lady tremor sir luke aye leave her and her relation together and let us take a turn in the garden with mr twineall  i am afraid his lordship will be back before we have drawn him to say more on the subject for which he will be arrested   lady you are right   sir luke mr twineall will you walk this way  that young lady and gentleman wish to have a little conversation   twi o certainly sir luke by all means  exeunt sir luke and lady  to elvirus i am extremely sorry sir you kept your bed during the voyage i should else have been most prodigiously happy in such good company   exit aur why are you thus agitated it was wrong to be so impetuous  but such regret as this     elv hear the secret i refused before  my father is a prisoner for life   aur oh heavens then mr haswell was the only man     elv and he had promised me  promised me with benevolence his patronage  but the disguise he wore when i first saw him led me to mistake him now  made me expose my falsehood my infamy and treat his honored person with abuse   aur aye let his virtues make you thus repent but let them also make you hope forgiveness   elv nay he is just as well as compassionate  and for detected falsehood    aur you make me tremble   elv yet he shall hear my story  i will follow him and obtain his pity if not his pardon   aur nay supplicate for that too  and you need not blush or feel yourself degraded to kneel to him for he would scorn the pride that triumphs over the humbled   exeunt scene ii the garden enter sir luke twineall and lady tremor twi why really sir luke as my lord has given you charge to sound my prineiples i must own they are just such as i delivered to him   sir luke well mr twineall i only wish you to be a little more clear  we will suppose the present sultan no impostor  yet what pretensions do you think the other family    twi that i will make clear to you at once  or if my reasons are not very clear they are at least very positive and that you know is the same thing  this family  no  that family  the family that reigned before this  this came after that  they came before now every one agrees that this family was always  so and so  whispering  and that the other was always  so and so  whispering  in short every body knows that one of them had always a very suspicious  you know what     sir luke no i dont   twi pshaw  pshaw  every body conjectures what  and though it was never said in so many words yet it was always supposed  and though there never has been any proof yet there have been things much more strong  and for that very reason sir william  sir luke i mean  i beg your pardon  for that very reason  i cannot think what made me call you sir william  for that very reason  oh i was thinking of sir william tiffany  for that very reason say people what they will  that that must be their opinion  but then where is the man who will speak his thoughts freely as i have done   enter guards who had been listening at a distance during this speech sir luke starting bless my soul gentlemen you made my heart jump to my very lips   guard to twineall sir you are our prisoner and must go with us   twi gentlemen you are mistaken  i had all my clothes made in england and it is impossible the bill can have followed me already   guard your charge is something against the state   twi against the state  you are mistaken  it cannot be me   guard no  there is no mistake  pulling out a paper  you are here called henry twineall   twi but if they have left out honorable it cannot be me   i am the honorable henry twineall   sir luke aye that you are to prove before your judges   guard yes sir  and we are witnesses of the long speech you have just now been making   twi and pray gentlemen did you know what i meant by it   guard certainly   twi why then upon my soul it was more than i did  i wish i may be sacrificed     sir luke well well you are going to be sacrificed  dont be impatient   twi but gentlemen  sir luke   the guards seize him lady dear mr twineall i am afraid you will have occasion for the dignity of all my ancestors to support you under this trial   sir luke and have occasion for all my courage too   twi but sir  but gentlemen     sir luke oh i would not be in your coat fashionable as it is for all the sultans dominions    exit sir luke and lady  twineall and guards

pleased fancy formed so precious you durst not even trust its reality   pris no  while my pleased fancy only saw the prospect i own it was delightful but now reason beholds it within my reach the view is changed  and what in the gay dream of fond delirium seemed a blessing in my waking hours of sad reflection would prove the most severe of punishments   has explain  what is the cause that makes you think thus   pris a cause that has alone for fourteen years made me resigned to a fate like this  when you first mentioned my release from this drear place my wild ideas included with the light all that had ever made the light a blessing  twas not the sun i saw in my mad transport but a lost husband filled my roving fancy  twas his idea that gave the colors of the world their beauty and made me fondly hope to grasp its sweets   has a husband   pris but the world that i was wont to enjoy with him  to see again without him  every wellknown object would wound my mind with dear remembrances for ever lost and make my freedom torture   has but yet    pris oh on my knees a thousand times i have thanked heaven that he partook not of this dire abode  that he shared not with me my hard usage  a greater blessing i possessed from that than all his loved society could have given  but in a happy world where smiling nature pours her boundless gifts  oh there his loss would be unsufferable   has do you lament him dead   pris yes  or like me a prisoner  else he would have sought me out  have sought his arabella  haswell starts  why do you start   has are you a christian  an european   ara i am

free on his ascent to the throne for he gave pardon to all the enemies of the slain monarch but i was taken in a vessel where i was hurried in the heat of the battle with a party of the late emperors friends  and all the prisoners were by the officers of the present sultan sent to slavery or confined as i have been in hopes of ransom from their friends   has and did never intelligence or inquiry reach you from your husband   ara never   has never   ara i once was informed of a large reward for the discovery of a female christian and with boundless hopes asked an interview with the messenger but found on inquiry i could not answer his description as he secretly informed me it was the sultan who made the search for one he himself had known and dearly loved   has good heaven  aside  you then conclude your husband dead   ara i do  or like me by some mischance taken with the other party and having no friend to plead his cause before the emperor whom he served    has i will plead it  should i ever chance to find him  but ere we can hope for other kindness you must appear before the sultan  thank him for the favor which you now decline and tell the cause why you cannot accept it   ara alas almost worn out with sorrow  an object of affliction as i am  in pity excuse me  present my thanks  my humble gratitude  but pardon my attendance   has nay you must go  it is necessary  i will accompany you to him  retire a moment but when i send be ready   ara i shall obey  she bows obediently and exit  as haswell comes down elvirus places himself in his path  haswell stops looks at him with an austere earnestness which elvirus observing turns away his face elv nay reproach me  i can bear your anger but do not let me meet your eye  oh it is more awful now i know who you are than if you had kingdoms to disperse or could deal instant death  haswell looks on him with a manly firmness then walks on elvirus following him  i do not plead for my father now  since what has passed i only ask forgiveness   has do you forgive yourself   elv i never will   enter keeper keep one of our prisoners who in his cell makes the most pitious moans has sent to entreat that mr haswell will not

what has brought you here   twi typing to get a place   has a place   twi yes and you see i have got one  and a poor place it is  in short sir my crime is said to be an offense against the state and

yours  you think me an impertinent silly troublesome fellow and that my conduct in life will be neither of use to my country nor of benefit to society   has you mistake me sir  i think such glaring imperfections as yours are will not be of so much disadvantage to society as those of a lessfaulty man  in beholding your conduct thousands shall turn from the paths of folly to which fashion custom nature or call it what you will impels them  therefore mr twineall if not pity for your faults yet a concern for the good effect they may have upon the world should you be admitted there again will

flattered myself such a charitable good feeling humane heart as you possess    has hold hold  this mr twineall is the vice which has driven you to the fatal precipice whereon you are  and in death will you not relinquish it   twi what vice sir do you mean   has flattery  a vice that renders you not only despicable but odious   twi but how has flattery been the cause   has your english friend before he left the island told me what information you had asked from him and that he had given you the direct opposite of every persons character as a just punishment for your mean premeditation and designs   twi i never imagined that amiable friend had sense enough to impose upon any body   has yet i presume he could not suppose fate would have carried their resentment to a length like this

twineall has done nothing to merit death and the charge which his lordship sent in against him we begin to think too severe  but if there was any false statement    lord it was the fault of my not charging my memory  any error i have been guilty of must be laid to the fault of my total want of memory   has and what do you hope from this confesfion   sir luke to remit the prisoners punishment of death to something less if the sultan will please to annul the sentence   lord yes  and grant ten or twelve years imprisonment  or the galleys for fourteen years  or    sir luke ay ay something in that way   has for shame  for shame  gentlement  the extreme rigor you show in punishing a dissension from your opinion or a satire upon your folly proves to conviction what reward you had bestowed

very likely to happen again   lord if mr haswell has obtained your pardon sir it is all very well  but let me advise you to keep your sentiments on politics to yourself for the future  as you value

pity it too  with freedom to your father and youself the sultan restores his forfeited lands  and might i plead sir luke for your interest with aureilas friends this young mans filial love should be repaid by conjugal affection   sir luke as for that mr haswell you have so much interest at court that your taking the young man under you protection  besides as aurelia was sent hither merely to get
