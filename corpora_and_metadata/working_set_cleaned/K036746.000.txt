dcc lxviii  to the duchess of northumberland etc madam permit me to assure your grace of the deep sense i retain of your great goodness and condescension in the protection which you have been pleased to extend to my first effort in the drama  were i to listen to those suggestions that naturally arise in the mind of a writer on the first dawnings of success the favorable reception which this tragedy has met with from the public would lead me to hope that it might not be found wholly unworthy of your graces patronage but when i reflect how many circumstances contribute to please on the stage where every thought or expression is enforced with the graces of action and utterance i cannot but be anxious lest the reader should withhold that approbation in the closet which the spectator testified in the representation  it is with the utmost deference i submit the following scenes to your graces perusal and am  madam with the greatest respect your graces most obliged most obedient and most devoted servant john hoole clements inn    dec      prologue spoken by mr smith new to the stage before this dread array prepared to offer here his virgin play our timorous author diffident of praise grafts his first laurels on anothers bays takes from anothers breast the generous fire and fits to english strains a foreign lyre aspires to please by unsuspected means importing passion from italian scenes where heroes combat to soft musics note and tyrants warble through an eunuchs throat to symphony despairing lovers sigh and struggling traitors by the gamut die yet here a living bard whose fame outruns the foremost of the tunesul dramas sons can even in song his magic power dispense at once uniting harmony and sense from him our poet now essays to write and plans from him the story of tonight a wellknown tale  who has not heard the name of cyrus and the rising median fame each puling schoolboy can discuss the theme the suffering grandson and the monarchs dream o should his genius catch the inspiring thought and nobly copy what was nobly wrought or where the masters hand but sketchd the line with happy warmth fill up the bold design then every figure with full force impressed may wake the feelings of the impassioned breast while each bright eye amidst this circle pays the tribute of involuntary praise  dramatis personae astyages mr clarke cambyses mr smith cyrus mr powell harpagus mr hull mithranes mr bensley mirza mr davis mandane mrs yates aspasia mrs mattocks officer guards messenger etc scene on the borders of media  cyrus a tragedy act i scene a wood a stately pavilion erected for astyages view of a temple at a distance mandane aspasia mandane behold the limits of the median land and see the temple where astyages returns each year to shed the victims blood on great astartes altar  o aspasia this is the place the day named by my father to bless me with the tenderest interview here shall i meet again my long lost cyrus is he not found was he not snatched from death saved by some god to fill these eager arms and is not this the happy destined grove where once again i shall embrace my child  aspasia it is true  but what can all this passion mean   mandane what can it mean  where is my cyrus hid what does he  wherefore comes he not  aspasia alas time winged with swiftest pinions lags behind the ardent wishes of a mothers love thou know the hour of sacrifice is fixed for his reception that we must not pay our vows to nights pale queen till yonder sun declines to evening skies and now his beams but just begin to dawn over eastern hills  mandane alas aspasia  still i fear    aspasia and wherefore when now astyages no longer seeks his death but wishes to behold his cyrus to give him back a parents kind protection and show in him our medias future king  mandane yet if the visions of the night may claim belief  a dreadful dream   aspasia and shall mandane be moved with shadows sure you should detest such visionary fears from these you first may date your sorrows well you know your father on the vain credit of a dream condemned your cyrus to be slain nor this sufficed but that the nuptial bed no more might prove fruitful to thee in children and to him give endless cause of terror far from hence to banishment he sent your lord your husband your dear cambyses where in persias realm he lives an alien to his consorts arms  mandane and yet it is not a dream that twice ten years have seen the cheerful harvest crown our fields since at his birth my child was ravished from me on this blessed day i hope once more to see him and thinks aspasia now to find me calm  aspasia you lost your cyrus when your age had scarce beheld the round of thirteen annual suns and can you still so deeply feel the grief impressed in lifes first bloom  mandane alas aspasia thou know not what it is to be a mother  aspasia yet your aspasia too has known her sorrows if you lament a husband and a son i mourn a brothers loss who fell beneath the vengeful anger of astyages  mandane there there my bosom shared thy fathers sufferings and often i have wept in secret his misfortunes unhappy man a fatal recompense my father gavethee for his grandson saved what have thou suffered for thy love to cyrus thy loyal truth  but see the good man comes he comes perchance with tidings of my son  o haste my harpagus where is he  enter harpagus harpagus princess your son is now arrived  mandane arrived  ah  where   harpagus he must not till astyages appears presume to pass the borders of the kingdom it is so decreed  mandane then let us seek him out where now impatient with long exiled feet he comes to tread his native wished for soil and ease a mothers pains  going harpagus it must not be mandane stay  your father will be present a witness to your meeting  mandane wherefore then this long delay  o did astyages feel half mandane feels these arms had now embraced my dearest cyrus what detains my father thus  harpagus ere now he is on his way but the long pomp that waits on medias kings forbids his swift approach  mandane and must mandane attend the dull and tedious forms of state aspasia if thou love me instant go and seek the blooming youth  yet stay and hear me  observe his air his voice his every look mark if his features bear his mothers likeness or his loved fathers  but als i rave thou never knewst his hapless banished father relate my sufferings and enquire of his ask what kind hand supplied a mothers care how when mandane torn with heartfelt anguish deemed him a prey to savage rage the woods preserved him in their hospitable shades tell him  o heaven i know not what  but tell him more than a mothers fondness can express not what i speak but all i wish to utter o fly and with the rapid speed of thought return to my impatience   exit aspasia harpagus should this day that gives once more your son to your embrace restore cambyses to you   mandane would to heaven i might indulge that hope  all gracious powers what torture in his exile must he feel to hear his son yet lives to know this day restores my cyrus to his native land yet be denied to gaze with transport on him or clasp him in a fathers sheltering arms  harpagus hear and be silent  happier fortune now prepares to crown each wish your soul can form cambyses is at hand  mandane cambyses where o tell me harpagus  harpagus i dare not further explain it now  let this suffice  mandane alas i fear thou do deceive me  harpagus no mandane trust to my faith  this day you shall behold him  mandane ye powers what deluge of unhopdfor bliss now bursts upon me o my son my husband happy mandane  harpagus my friend teach me to bear this wild excess of joy  harpagus be calm compose your looks let not the king perceive this conflict of tumultuous passions  mandane yes i will go and meet astyages will strive to hide the strugglings of my soul check these emotions though my swelling bosom can scarce find room to hold the mighty transport transport which only such as i can feel and only those who love like me conceive  exit harpagus alone thus far it is well  this day i mean to show the hidden cyrus to the expecting world the realm is ripe for a revolt the nobles resolve to invest him with the regal sway  but my resentment still demands its victim yes dearest shade of my lamented son for ever present to thy fathers sight thou yet shall be appeased for this so long i have worn the mask of loyalty  but now vengeance is on the wing she towers alost and like an eagle kens her destined prey  exit scene changes to a grove outside of a sinall building of simple architecture representing the dwelling of mithranes enter cyrus and mithranes cyrus can it be possible o say my father for such thou still have been am i indeed the median cyrus sure i dream am i the offspring of cambyses and mandane that wretched offspring whom astyages sentenced to die when scarce the vital spirit breathed from his infant lips  mithranes believe me prince thou art that offspring  cyrus tell me then mithranes how many bear the name thou know already one cyrus on the borders of the land is now arrived and comes not here the king to welcome his approach  mithranes the kings deceived that cyrus is but feigned  thou art the true  cyrus whence is this mystery   mithranes astyages when thou were yet unborn beheld a vision that filled his soul with dread  cyrus of this mithranes thou needst not speak often have i heard it told how from his dream the magic had denounced that of mandane should a child be born that must one day deprive him of his throne and well i know at cyrus luckless birth the rigid charge was given to harpagus to end his life and ease a monarchs fears  mithranes from thence begins a tale thou never have heard the cruel sentence harpagus received his heart refused to obey to me he brought thee wrapped in a regal mantle  cyrus then twas thou that in the woods exposed   mithranes not so  be patient  my consort then mark well the providence that watched thy preservation had brought forth a lifeless child thy harmless innocence excited pity on thy tender cheek stood the big tear as if thy heart already were conscious of misfortune while thy hands were stretched as if to implore protection from us my barce wept and with a mothers fondness clasped in her arms she strained thee to her bosom lulled thee to rest and hushed thy little sorrows  cryus forgive me sir if gratitude awhile breaks in upon your tale and fills my eyes in dear remembrance of your barces virtues she whose indulgence watched my helpless years  mithranes tou were indeed the darling of her age as my own son i bred thee in these shades and called thy name alcaeus in thy stead exposing in the wood the lifeless infant  cyrus what of astyages   mithranes when he believed his dire command completed natures voice at length awakened in his breast remorse full fifteen years did harpagus remain without disclosing aught then seemed the tale ripe for discovery yet he first would prove the currents depth before he left the shore five years have now elapsed since through the realm the tidings spread that cyrus being found an infant in the forest was preserved and lived among the scythians such report perhaps the impostor raised or from the rumor perhaps he sprung but be it as it may some bold adventurer lured with hopes of greatness usurps thy name  cyrus is this the cyrus then who comes   mithranes the same  but mark me  harpagus procured the fiction credit with the king for thus he reasoned  should astyages with joy receive the news i safely may reveal the kingdoms heir or should his fears once more return and prompt some new design against the prince the baffled aim will light upon the impostors head  cyrus but since the king confesses now such tenderness for cyrus at length recalls him from a life of exile to clasp him to his bosom wakens all the soft endearments in a mothers soul and every tender passion in a son wherefore should unavailing caution still withhold the secret from him  mithranes harpagus relies not firmly on the royal goodness for when he owned that with compassion moved he had not slain the infant but exposed him amidst the woods astyages to punish his disobedience doomed to cruel death his only son and though the king now seems to mourn his grandsons fate and wears the semblance of deep remorse yet sure but ill agrees such love for thee with such resentment shown against thy kind preserver  cyrus tell me there why at this solemn pomp of sacrifice are all our countrys nobles here convened but to receive the lawful successor and shall not cyrus conscious of his birth strip from a bold impostor his salse titles and stand revealed to all oh sir by you even midst these rude uncultivated wilds my soul has long been trained to virtuous daring and shall i now ignobly lurk concealed what can the subject hope from such a prince that king will never guard his peoples rights who wants the courage to assert his own  mithranes o greatly urged  yet think not my loved prince mithranes less regards thy fame than safety suppress a few short hours this generous ardour soon as you sun shall reach the western waves thou shall be shown to all thou shall embrace thy parents yet unknown the assembled nobles shall own thy cause and even astyages receive in thee the kingdoms better hope  cyrus what say thou shall i then with filial transport embrace his honored knees whom fate denied to guard my youth with his paternal care hang on a mothers circling arms that never till this blessed moment clasped a banished son and never reared his infant years with fondness  mithranes thou shall my prince cambyses will ere long arrive already is mandane here  cyrus mandane  let me fly to ease her breast of every racking doubt and dry the tears of an afflicted parent  going mithranes hear me still  cambyses and mandane both suppose the impostor is their son and much it now imports they should be still deceived till time matures our enterprise for should mandane learn that in thee he lives   cyrus fear not mithranes this day the mighty secret shall remain locked in my breast i never will reveal it till thou permitst me  let me but behold her  farewell  do thou still doubt my faith  i call on every god to witness to my vows  going mithranes oh  no forbear  when will thou learn to curb these eager sallies of unbridled passion this is the awful day that teems with thine and medias fate thou know that every deed must first begin with heaven  go seek the temple devoutly there implore the gracious gods to smile propitious on our hopes and learn henceforth to moderate  what have i said cyrus forgive this license of my tongue so long accustomed to a fathers language i now must change my speech  i am no more the rigid parent that reproves his son i am a subject that with faithful counsels would aid his sovereign  cyrus thou art still my father my dearest father  i confess my warm ungoverned temper but i will suppress these starts of youth and learn to tread the path thy wisdom points too dearly should i buy the throne if i no more must call thee father  mithranes yes royal youth thou shall be still my son son of my fondest hopes  for thee i have watched the tedious round of twenty circling years each turn of fate in this sequestered dwelling far distant from the busy haunts of men where but on this returning annual pomp of sacrifice the print of human feet scarce marks the unworn turf  cyrus once more farewell yes i will seek yon hallowed roof to raise devotions voice and supplicate the gods to breathe a heros spirit in this breast that when the ripening hours shall bring to light the wished events of this auspicious day my soul enlarged to thoughts of conscious greatness may hail with virtuous pride its birth to glory  exit mithranes all gracious heaven with thy protecting arm defend my prince let me in one glad moment reap the full harvest of my pious toils and old mithranes then has lived enough  but see where harpagus appears  enter harpagus my friend where is astyages harpagus but now arrived i left him in his tent in gloomy silence as if revolving in his mind the end of this days sacrifice he sends me hither to learn if cyrus yet approach the borders and what the train he brings  mithranes believst thou then he means indeed to answer medias hopes and give the realm a successor in cyrus  harpagus trust me mithranes never  if sometimes he feigns a momentary joy or speaks with seeming fondness of the approach of cyrus methinks through all the dark disguise appears some cruel purpose brooding in his soul  mithranes thanks to the power that thus provides a victim to frustrate every ill that thence might threaten the safety of the prince this bold impostor who wears his name shall with his name inherit each evil that is designed him  harpagus nor does media owe less her thanks to heaven that gave mithranes to rear her prince to every future greatness in virtues safest school an humble station far from the splendid vices of a court where golden luxury and silken sloth enervate our unhappy sons  but say have thou to cyrus yet revealed his birth  mithranes i have   harpagus and how did he receive the tidings   mithranes amazed at first he heard the important truth but when convinced  o had you then beheld his generous ardour  scarce could i prevent his filial love from seeking out mandane and throwing at her feet a darling son  harpagus of that we must beware  the weighty secret of his concealment must not be entrusted to a fond mothers transports not cambyses knows yet this mystery of fate  mithranes it is strange cambyses comes not yet  harpagus doubt not mithranes cambyses will be present ere the hour fixed for the sacrifice perhaps even now he lurks disguised upon the neighboring confines he must be wary well thou know what danger awaits him should astyages discover his mandate disobeyed  but let us part we must not thus be found the king may soon be here wherever he goes pale visagd fear and black suspicion on his steps attend  exeunt severally end of the first act act ii scene continues enter mithranes cyrus not yet returned still still my breast owns all the fears and fondness of a father  but hark this way i hear the sound of feet  some stranger by his dress  o mighty gods what do i see  sure i should know that face enter cambyses disguised cambyses if in this land you venerate the powers of hospitality direct me friend to where the annual sacrifice is held i come a votary from distant climes to pay my offering at astartes shrine and view the sacred pomp  mithranes myself will thither conduct your steps  it must it must be he aside cambyses the gods protectors of your median race repay the courteous deed  but tell me farther how may a friendless stranger gain access to princely harpagus  mithranes the king now holds him on business of the state this day the people expect to find the kingdoms heir restored if happily thou have heard the name of cyrus  cambyses fame has through many a land divulged your story i knew cambyses both in persia born one city bred us i remember well a private warrior when he sought the court of medias king till by his merit raised he gained mandanes hand but dearly since he paid the price of love with years of exile  mithranes shall i yet speak aside  since thou indeed have known to cambyses unfortunate cambyses  but behold astyages is near  avoid his presence thy garb would breed suspicion in the king and danger to thyself  in that close covert a while remain concealed cambyses retires enter astyages astyages guards keep the pass and suffer none to enter here speaks to mirza entering mithranes aside what means astyages has he beheld this stranger or has some spy in evil hour for cyrus revealed the secret of his fate  astyages mithranes   mithranes my sovereign liege   astyages are we alone   mithranes we are   astyages come near mithranes tell me do thou still retain in mind remembrance of the good i did thee once  mithranes my mind retains it all when first received into your royal court i owed your bounty much and when i left the pomp of cities for the sylvan wild it was your hand that gave this wished retreat  astyages say if my happiness if all i sought depended on thy zeal might i not then expect to find thee grateful  answer me  mithranes what is there in my power that can avail the welfare of my sovereign  astyages yes my friend thou can do much can firmly fix the crown upon thy sovereigns brow  know all i seek is in thy hand  yes spite of our decree cyrus preserved   mithranes what will my fate do with me  aside cambyses did not my ears receive the name of cyrus  listening astyages thy color fades thou do perhaps divine what i would say  mithranes thus prostrate at your feet   kneels astyages no be not terrified but rise  the deed is easier than thy fears have formed it  cyrus believes our summons and already comes with some few scythians on the kingdoms borders to wait the expected meeting  well thou know for years accustomed to this rustic dwelling each outlet of the wood and may with ease in some close ambush so dispose of cyrus that he may never wake my terrors more  cambyses inhuman murderer  aside astyages what say thou speak   mithranes it shall be so  my king shall be obeyed  aside cambyses most impious traitor  aside astyages for the atttempt thyself alone will not suffice thou must with care select thy trusty partners of the deed  mithranes there needs no other but my son alcaeus twere dangerous to confide to other hands an enterprise of such import  alcaeus skilled in the winding mazes of the wood through which at early dawn he often is wont to urge the savage chase shall unsuspected reach with a distant shart his life   astyages enough  it is well conceived  go then my best mithranes instruct thy son tell him astyages expects from him the end of all his terrors the deed once done i plant him next my heart to grow to wealth and honors  mithranes heavenly powers aside defend me still and from suspicions eye preserve yon stranger  exit astyages now methinks my mind is eased of every fear  let cyrus die and with him die the many doubts that shake the bosom of astyages  enter cambyses cambyses revoke the dreadful mandate which thy lips pronounced on by the eternal gods the great avengers of guiltless blood   astyages ha traitor what art thou that lurking thus unfeen  death be thy portion draws cambyses nay then   draws astyages off peasant  dare thou lift thy hand a gainft the suns vicegerent   enter mirza and guards mirza seize the ruffian and instant drag him hence   cambyses is disarmed and at a signal from astyages the guards retire astyages audacious villain knowft thou what punishment awaits thy crime already torture shakes his scorpions over thee and anguish claims thee as her destined prey confess what motives urged thy desperate deed  cambyses whatever my motives know the soul that dares attempt a tyrants life has fortitude to brave whatever a tyrant can inflict  astyages presumptuous slave   cambyses look here astyages view well this face do not these features wake thy recollection twice ten years of suffrance have wrought some change yet sure here still remains the trace of what i have been  astyages ha whatever thou art rightly my better genius warned me that something baneful to my nature lurked beneath those abject vestments  cambyses tyrant yes it is not for naught thy conscience takes the alarm for he is that injured ever is the bane of him that injures let this meeting then rouse each awakning terror in thy soul to see the man thou most have wronged  cambyses throws open his disguise astyages thou wretch how have thou dared to enter media against our high decree and come thou too assassin like with sacrilegious rage to lift thy hand against a monarchs life but thou shall find a welcome  cambyses yes such welcome as thy paternal love prepares for cyrus thou hoary ruffian was it then for this the nobles of the realm were summoned here for this was cyrus called to fall a victim to thy deathdealing minion  cursed mithranes  astyages confusion am i then betrayed  aside cambyses for me i scorn thy feeble menaces i know my life awaits thy nod  but mark me well the time may come even now perhaps the black the fatal hour impends when thou shall feel the avenging hand of heaven  astyages what say thou ha does secret treason lurk amid the smiles of seeming loyalty give me to know what mischief threatens  cambyses seek to know no more let it suffice i have given thy terrors birth and be it thine to cherish them  astyages ho guards convey this traitor to yon citys walls and lay him in some loathsome dungeon there there shall thou learn to speak  cambyses thy rage is fruitless hope not from me to be informed of aught that may import thy safety  astyages lead him hence  i will hear no further  shall a wretch proscribed revile the awful majesty of kings and dare his anger whose allpowrful word can in a moment six his doom  away  cambyses come whither must i go conduct me where the cavernd earth unfolds her deepest prison where light never dawns yet steady virtue there shall dissipate the gloom there the firm soul shall smile in torture when amidst the blaze of courts the tyrants mind shall shrink in darkness and while security surrounds his throne trembles with fancied terror  exit guarded manent astyages and mirza astyages yes i feel his threats already here my laboring breast teems with new fears  mirza  mirza coming forward what would my sovereign   astyages whence did this daring rebel break upon us and how elude thy vigilance  mirza my lord no steps unnoticd could have passed the guard cambyses must have lurked in secret here beneath some neighboring shade nor knew we aught of danger near your person till the sound of tumult brought us to your timely rescue  astyages aside what should i think is then mithranes false mirza i thank thy zeal be ever thus and i will reward thee  sure some deep design is brooding now against me   enter mandane mandane hear me sir o by these tears   astyages what would my daughter rise    mandane o never never  here i will grow to earth till pity kindling in a fathers breast extend a gracious hand to save cambyses  astyages cambyses  name him not   mandane alas my father after a tedious twenty years of absence fate now returns him but returns in vain if by your anger he is denied to view his loved mandane to behold his son preserved but ah for him preserved in vain  astyages had thou mandane heard his rebel threats his daring insults breathed against the throne   mandane forgive the transport of a bosom torn with double pangs the father and the husband alas perhaps he knew not cyrus lived he knew not that astyages had fixed this day to meet and name him for his heir  astyages and pleads my daughter in defense of him whose impious hand assailed my life  mandane o heaven   astyages tell me when treason works the secret mine to sap my kingdom shall mandanes tongue extenuate his offense who plans my fall but thou perhaps art privy to their wiles perhaps confederate with thy fathers foes  mandane what do i hear and can you thoughts suggest my soul is chilled with horror that mandane would join in murders black conspiracy against the hand that gave me life  astyages i know not  whom should i fear methinks i see rebellion where dutys most professed and those my power can shake with terror give me equal dread but for cambyses would thou prove thy truth name him no more  thus much a fathergrants he shall not die  i to your tears remit his forfeit life which else had fallen the victim of tortures sharpest pangs  but as i prize my crown again he is banished from the land  exit mandane and is it thus my fate begins to smile is this the meeting harpagus foretold o my cambyses  enter cyrus what art thou that breakst thus importunely on my grief cyrus forgive this seeming rudeness beauteous excellence a son of freedom nurtured in these woods now shuns a fate that threats that liberty which bounteous nature gave  mandane what do thou mean   cyrus the royal guards pursue my steps and soon these limbs that till this hour have ranged at large over the steep hill or through the forest shade may seel the galling weight of servile chains  mandane declare thy crime   cyrus my crime was selfdefence the oppressors sword was raised against my life but heaven then nervd my strength and from this arm the wretch received that death he meant to give  mandane what means my throbbing bosom  gentle youth proceed  methinks i feel some secret impulse to listen to thy story  cyrus as but now alone i sought the temple from the woods i heard a cry of deep distress  i turned and saw two ruffians seize a beauteous maid fired at the brutal deed i cast my dart and one i slew the other struck with terror forsook the affrighted fair who trembling fled and ere i could pursue her stops a youth of fierce demeanor clad in rich attire with sword unsheathed impetuous crossed my way and menaced vengeance for his slain companion  but see the nymph herself whom favoring heaven sent me to save  enter aspasia mandane were thou the maid distressed and is it true that thou have scapd the arm of brutal violence  aspasia yes sell destruction was hovering over me when behold the friend that freed aspasia from impending ruin with peril of his own  but thanks to heaven my brave defender lives  say gallant youth how did thou scape the ruffians boisterous rage that threatened thee with death  mandane relate the sequel for since aspasia bears an interest in it my heart more freely listens to thy tale  cyrus but little now remains  the fierce invader still pressed upon me whilst a river flowed behind my steps preventing all retreat disarmed what could i do necessity supplied me with new arms sudden i snatched a craggy flint from the rough pebbled shore and launched against the foe a sanguine stream bathed all his face the sword forsook his hand and as he staggered round with dying grasp he seized a bough that overhung the tide which yielding to his weight at once he fell and in the waves was lost  mandane is this the crime that justice should pursue yes my aspasia midst all the anguish of a breaking heart i feel a dawn of joy for thy deliverance  aspasia what new distress afflicts mandane   cyrus gods aside was it mandane whom i thus unknown have held in converse  mandane oh i will tell thee all and rest my sorrows on thy faithful bosom  enter officer and guards officer secure yon traitor who has dared to raise his sacrilegious hand against his prince  mandane against his prince   officer it is to his arm we owe the death of cyrus  mandane say thou  death of cyrus   cyrus it

 was crus then the slain o impious villain  officer it is alas too true the prince is dead and by this youth  aspasia o heaven   cyrus aside i must reveal my self  but no i have sworn to keep my birth still secret  mandane o perfidious and came thou then to me  o all ye gods to tell a wellfeignd story of thy deeds and thus deride a wretched mothers grief  cyrus alas i knew not princess    mandane peace deceiver thou knewst too well  thy tale is falsehood all o my loved son  thy mothers better part and have i lost thee thus again  distraction o my torn heart  cyrus i cannot bear her grief

youth who fell beneath this hand  o torture  mandane guards drag the monster strait before the king    aspasia o princess calm the tempest of your rage if by resistless fate impelled the youth incurred this guilt indulgent heaven extends forgiveness to involuntary crimes then imitate the mercy of the gods  mandane no more aspasia  the relentless gods to me no mercy show  my son is murdered my husband doomed once more to banishment what is there else remains in angry fate to add to what i suffer every hour of my succeeding life is marked for horror and all my thoughts are now despair and

gallant youth who freed me from the ruffian grasp of power exposed to death yet feel not for his safety  cyrus my safety merits not aspasias care nor think the succor this weak arm could give to innocence distressed was more than heaven claims from a heart that though in forests bred glows at anothers sufferings  aspasia generous youth wherefore ah wherefore has relentless fate involved such

extends her iron reign we never can keep too strict a guard upon our speech a dream may rouse the slumbering fury fell suspicion on innocence will stamp the mark of guilt and tyranny assumes the mien of justice to punish crimes that never yet had being the genial feast the nuptial bed the temples are not secure from treachery  mandane at least confirm my doubting thoughts  mithranes what further proof can you require ask your own heart mandane your heart will testify a mothers feeling  mandane it is true it is true  o i remember all  when first i viewed alcaeus how my blood thrilled with some unknown passion why mithranes woudst thou so long conceal him from my love  mithranes i feared to trust maternal tenderness which wisdom ill can rule had not your sorrows awaked my pity had i not suspected the worst from your revenge against alcaeus to you your son had still remained unknown  mandane and yet mandanes wretched envious fortune spite of the sunshine that would gild the prospect spreads over my day afflictions sable clouds cyrus returned and living must excite a mothers dearest transports but cambyses returned and doomed again to banishment unseen unwelcomd swells this heart with anguish  mithranes alas my princess calm your grief let hope point you to future scenes of happiness heaven that preserved your cyrus will again restore cambyses to your longing arms and give him back to liberty and love  mandane fain would i listen to the flattering sounds of happiness and peace  but yet mithranes thou have not told the fortunes of my child relate whatever his tender youth has suffered by what strange means  declare each circumstance  mithranes some fitter time must tell thee  in the grove that leads to my retreat  meet me ere long and thou shall learn it all  but soft

stand indebted to thy zeal and yet my friend all is not here at ease i fear our secret is betrayed cambyses reproached me with the purposed deed mithranes tell me what says report does the loud tongue of popular invective point at me or does suspicion sleep  mithranes no rumor yet of this my lord has reached my watchful ear your guards conveyed cambyses prisoner hence nor aught from him has roused the public notice respecting what your thoughts suggest  astyages enough  retire my friend  mithranes permit me to remind my sovereign master that my son alcaeus   astyages i know what thou would say  thy sons in honds already have i in my thoughts resolved to set him free to heap rewards upon him but yet we must beware it might be dangerous at once to pardon him whom all the realm must mark for open vengeance such proceeding might give a sanction to whatever the breath of discontent might raise against their king trust to my care  i will watch the important crisis  farewell mithraues   exit mithranes astyages o astyages to what art thou reduced the kings become the slave of slaves  i now detest the wretch subservient to my fears but death shall soon seal up his lips  alcaeus too shall die the fate of cyrus yields a fair pretense  but hold  should these by public justice suffer it must not be  some private hand were best  but then cambyses  yes he too must fall or we are lost  what dire necessity plunges me deeper still in guilt one crime begets a thousand heavens how is my soul bewildered in extremes of rage and dread i am cruel from my fears and from my cruelty my fears increase while one eternal round of torture plays the tyrant in my breast  enter harpagus harpagus alas my lord   astyages what say thou harpagus why are those looks of terror  harpagus mighty king i fear for thee i fear for medias safety even majesty itself is not secure  astyages have thou discovered aught of treason then against our person  harpagus no  but cyrus slain alarms each loyal bosom while his blood calls out for vengeance on the murderers head  astyages my friend have thou then heard thy kings affliction yes cruel fate at one unlookdfor stroke has robbed my age of every promised comfort  harpagus o mockery of grief but with deceit deceit shall be repaid aside astyages to increase my sorrow justice forbids me to revenge the deed and punish on the wretch who murdered cyrus the involuntary crime  the care be thine to guard him safe till we decree his doom  enter aspasia aspasia o mighty king behold a prostrate maid imploring grace  astyages aspasia speak thy guilt   harpagus what means my daughter whither can this tend   aspasia a crime of deeper dye never stained a subject it is i am the wretched cause of cyrus death it is i am the wretched cause that media mourns it is i alone am guilty not alcaeus in my defense alas the illfated youth was urged unconscious to the doed  o give your royal mercy breath and spare his life  astyages aspasia rise and learn whatever the motive that urges thus thy pity for alcaeus though nature loudly plead within my breast for vengeance on the hand that murdered cyrus astyages unbiased by her voice will act as public justice shall determine  harpagus o royal hypocrite but this rass girl has waked a thought that till this hour escaped the cautious search of alldiscerning age aside my liege the prisoner by his guards conducted is this way bending  to astyages astyages let us thon behold him though nature at his sight recoil  harpagus he is here   enter cyrus guarded astyages say is this youth the offspring of mithranes   harpagus dead sir he is   astyages he bears a noble aspect those looks erect that open mien hespeak not a lowly birth  what say thou harpagus  harpagus appearance often deceives not always does the polished court display the fairest forms and in the simple rustics homely cell nature sometimes assumes a nameless grace which greatness cannot reach  astyages yet harpagus there is something in those looks that moves me strangely  harpagus my fears increase  aside retire my lord his presence but adds to your affliction  cyrus advancing mighty king ere you depart permit me thus to approach with reverend awe however this erring hand may call for public vengeance yet believe no conscious guilt draws down the stroke of justice here then before your sacred feet   harpagus forbear  intrude not rashly on thy sovereigns grief think who thou art and what has brought thee hither let it suffice thee in respectful silence to await the laws decree  cyrus i stand reproved and bow me to the justice of the king  harpagus still do you pause my lord what means this wonder why are your looks thus changed  astyages i know not why i feel emotions never known before and my heart melts with sudden tenderness i leave him to thy care  exit harpagus again my souls at ease  retire aspasia with the criminal i would be left alone  cyrus walks apart aspasia my dearest father if ever you loved aspasia if the hand of this alcaeus saved her from the rage of an inhuman spoiler do not sully her brave deliverer with the name of guilt  harpagus has he not shed the royal blood   aspasia alas he knew not that the youth he slew was cyrue to guard his life he but repulsed a force that first assild  harpagus no more but leave me   aspasia o if you defend him not you never loved your poor aspasia  think you now behold her all pale and trembling in the ruffians power hear her invoking earth and heaven to aid behold alcaeus hasting to her rescue and say my father then   harpacus take heed aspasia i fear me something more than gratitude is hid beneath this warmth  but mark me well unthinking maid and hear a fathers caution let not imagination raise such hopes as thou may find too late but ill befit thy glory and my own  exit aspasia let all depart and leave me with the prisoner guards retire thanks to heaven i can at length without constraint address my vows to cyrus from my princes hands loose these vile manacles  before him bend the humble knee of loyalty kneels cyrus o rise   harpagus permit me here to pay my earliest tribute be this embrace the first the sole reward my truth shall challenge  embraces cyrus s knees yet forgive me cyrus if down my check unbidden steals a tear when i bchold that young that blooming grace spite of my constancy ideas rise of tenderest recollection  i confess the father here  but hence ye softening thoughts be witness heaven above my pangs i prize this interview though purchased with a son  cyrus rise my deliverer  and while i thus enfold thee in my arms accept these tears the sole returns which gratitude can yield for all thy suftrings but above the rest for that unhappy son decreed to fall an early victim in the cause of cyrus  harpagus let not the sorrows of a subject claim the tears of royalty  cyrus does royalty exempt the breast from every social tie that links mankind shall kings my harpagus forget that one inspiring breath to life awaked the prince and peasant and shall he the public voice proclaims his peoples father not feel those sorrows which his children feel  harpagus exalted youth   cyrus yes i have beard it all mithranes has unrolld the secret page that chronicles thy deeds there i have perused all that i owe to thee  and yet my friend when i reflect that after years of exile cambyses now returned is doomed once more to ignominious bonds when i reflect these eyes have never yet beheld these arms embraced a father   harpagus but the hour approaches shall give thee every wish as yet the work is incomplete when yon declining sun shall gild with feeble rays the temples summit thy fortune shall assume a brighter aspect  cyrus but still mandane  ever honored name still shall she mourn a sons imagined fate shall i not see her harpagus and speak the voice of comfort to a mothers grief  harpagus alas your filial piety over leaps the bounds of cooler prudence  let us then be circumspect my prince nor in a moment destroy the great the labored work of years but i must hence astyages expects me mean while retired to good mithranes dwelling securely wait the great event which time prepares for speedy birth  exit enter cyrus and mandane cyrus o could mandane surmise that in alcaeus lives   mandane this way they led him to the king entering cyrus what tender sound no stranger to these ears  ha it is

why fly from my embraces  cyrus mighty gods what shall i answer   mandane scattero the winds each lingering doubt  i am i am thy mother  does not thy heart confess me  cyrus o no more there is a something here  forgive me princess i dare no longer stay   mandane do thou avoid me   gyrus has she not known it all and shall i still distract her bosom thus  o never never since fortune thus compels me  no my oath is registered above  the solemn tie mithranes only can release aside mandane go on think with an eager mothers fond attention i listen to thy words  he hears me not why do thou hold a converse with thyself what means that restless step  why is thy speech confused and broken have thou not been told that i am thy mother if thou have ah why would thou estrange thyself and if till now thou knewst it not why will thou thus receive a mothers love with coldness speak  cyrus my blood is all in tumult every throbbing pulse confesses natures power  mandane are these the transports i vainly hoped where are the starting tears of mutual fondness where the dear embrace and the enquiries of impatient love this is too much  either you are not my son or to complete mandanes misery nature in thee reverses all her laws  cyrus yes i will fly this instant to mithranes  going mandane will thou not speak to me   cyrus yet yet a while suspend your fond distress till my return going mandane but ere thou go with one poor word relieve these cruel doubts  art thou or not my cyrus  cyrus farewell  i can no more  necessity compels me now to silence but when next we meet this face shall undisguisd declare the emotions of my heart and unreservd these faithful lips pour all my soul before thee  exit mandane alone what may this mean are then my hopes deceived it cannot be  yet this mysterious meeting gives every fear the alarm  ye powers that guard if such there are a mothers peace remove these new sprung doubts and oh direct my steps loft and bewildered in this maze of fate  end of the third act act iv scene the wood etc mandane alone mandane suspense thou cruel state of human susserings lifes deadliest calm  still still my thoughts are fixed on that dear youth i dare not call my son did he not plight his faith when next we met to ease my soul  he did  and hark he comes and every doubt is over  enter cambyses mandane ha can it be what well known form   cambyses mandane o it is she my lifes best treasure embraces mandane is is possible cambyses do i once again enfold him art thou escaped from bonds what friendly hand   cambyses a messenger from harpagus ocrtook the guard that led me  but some other time shall give thee all  for o i have much to tell thee and love impatient grudges each delay each little pause of joy  mandane how have thou borne a life of absence how returned again how have thou  but i cannot speak  let this this dear embrace speak where all words must fail  have thou yet heard our son   cambyses o there mandane even at this meeting while i hold thee thus my heart weeps blood  his infancy preserved from threatened death bred up to ripening manhood then then to fall a sacrifice at last to a cursed ruffians rage   mandane what means my love o were true mandane might indeed bid every joy farewell  cambyses ha true mandane is there a dawn of hope that cyrus lives  mandane yes i have been taught to hope that he who fell was an impostor that assumed his name and that the youth who slew him was our son  cambyses confirm it pitying powers  but say mandane have thou yet seen this youth  mandane twas not long since he parted from me  cambyses as i crossed the wood where yon tall poplars shade the dimpled pool i late beheld a youth whose noble mien attracted my regard i turned to gaze while with light steps he bounded over the turf his auburn locks flowed graceful down his back quick was his piercing eye his manly shoulders a spotted tygers dreadful spoils adorned some gallant trophy of his sylvan wars  mandane it is he it is that dear form that holds me now in torture of suspense  cambyses but when thou saw him what said he  mandane little he replied to all my fond address and when he spoke the words half falterd on his tongues his thought confused seemed big with something which he feared to utter  ambyses thy presence might abash a simple swain brought up in woods unskilled in courtly phrase but who revealed to thee his birth  mandane mithranes   cambyses ha did i hear thee right   mandane if we may trust mithranes faith by him was cyrus bred as his own son and called by him alcaeus  cambyses o treachery forged in hell detested flaves too credulous mandane  mandane ah what means this frantic rage  cambyses alcaeus is the assassin that murdered wretched cyrus the dire blow was given by him and at the kings command  mandane what says camyses   cambyses yes i heard it all  when first arriyd chance led me to the dwelling of this accursed mithranes there concealed i heard the king propose the deed i heard mithranes promise that his son alcaeus should be deaths fatal agent  o mandane judge what were then my thoughts rage urged me soon to start from my concealment when with mirza the guards rushed in and i was made their prisoner  mandane where where are now the hopes i vainly fed all lost for ever lost  cambyses cyrus is slain and slain by this alcaeus  see thou not mithranes fearing thy revenge invents this tale to save his son from thy resentment does not the silence now of harpagus whose loyal truth is known too well confirm it  mandane o it is too plain  alcaeus is the assassin  hence his confusion in my sight  for this he flew from my embraces and though he came with purpose to deceive a mothers fondness his soul shrunk back all traitor as he was and shudderd at a thought of so much horror  cambyses could thou so soon believe    mandane had thou cambyses heard how mithranes spoke while every word seemed the pure dictates of his heart  to this a strange emotion that alcaeus raised gave sanction to the tale  and add to all that what we wish we easily believe  cambyses has then delusive hope but lured us on to plunge us deep in fathomless despair  mandane to lead a wretched mother to caress the murderer of her son  o my cambyses it is not grief i feel  it is rage it is madness   cambyses thou shall be satisfied  this arm mandane shall revenge  farvewell  mandane but whither would thou go   cambyses to seek alcaeus to pierce his murderous heart  not all the powers of earth opposed shall save him from my sword where wixt yon steepy hills the embowring wood forms a dark vale astartes fountain flows with lonely noise there will i wait that path leads to his home  my fury now is loose and when this hand greets thee again mandane it greets thee with revenge  exit mandane alone strike home cambyses and tell him it is a mother gives the blow what if the traitor should again return he comes  o heaven i shudder at his sight  enter cyrus cyrus entering bear bear me swistly to her  some kind spirit breath gently on her sense and bi her wake to all a parents rapture  turn mandane behold your son your how aoknowledgd cyrus  mandane o most abandoned slave  aside cyrus at length mithranes consents that in this wished embracc  advancing mandane forbear and dwells deceit in such a form aside cyrus ye gods how are those features changed what means that glance of keen resentment why am i repulsed or is it thus i am punished for my silence when last we met what would my mother speak  mandane the name of mother rives my bleeding heart    cyrus if i have offended here i will kneel and pray forgiveness for my fault  i swear by mithras whose chearing beam enlightens all whose eye surveys the souls recess that while my lips restrained by solemn ties durst not confess the feelings of a son warm and alive to natures strongest power my suffering heart bled for mandanes pangs  mandane be still my rage  aside there lives not one whose breast more warmly feels maternal tenderness  betwixt yon trees methought i heard some lurking spies  these woods are full of guilt and treason  smiling villain aside cyrus then let us seek some safer part to vent these struggling passions  lead me where thou will i wait thy bidding  or if yet thou fear to come with me might give suspicion birth where shall we meet  o say  mandane i cannot speak  aside cyrus say thou will follow and i will haste to where astartes fountain bathes the neighboring wood of thickest growth in that sequestered gloom no prying eyes shall witness to our meeting thy cyrus there  know thou the place  mandane i do  impatiently cyrus let me not long expect thee   mandane hence be gone   looking furicusly at him cyrus celestial powers  wherefore that dreadful look   mandane i would give way  but leave me    cyrus yes i will go and while i wait thy coming every breeze shall seem the murmuring of a mothers voice each little sound shall seem a mothers step stealing to clasp a muchloved son remember astartes sacred fount   exit mandane alone mandane o young deceiver he is gone  what means my heart departing hence he left methought a strange emotion here yes spite of all my fury i confess the feelings of my sex  his graceful mien his tender speech his blooming years excite involuntary pity  wretched mother what must she suffer when she sees her son all gashd and bleeding with a thousand wounds  but hence this vain remorse  will thou mandane compassionate the grief that others feel forgetful of thy own  no  let him die thou art a mother too   enter aspasia aspasia tell me mandane know thou what fortune yet awaits alcaeus say does he live is he absolved or sentenced  mandane for pitys sake name not alcaeus to me my ears detest the sound  yes cursed mithranes i come  inspire me now with direst rage give venom to my tongue that every word may plant a dagger in his heart  exit aspasia alone how shall i learn his fate  unhappy youth mandanes franticgrief  it is thence i dread some cruel mischief  but my father comes  enter harpagus harpagus aspasia where is the princess   aspasia but even now she went from hence in all the pangs of sorrow  harpagus what can this mean has she not seen her son i fear some mystery aside tell me aspasia aught said she of alcaeus  aspasia no my lord but when i asked her of his fate  with looks all pale and wild she started at the sound then charged me never more to name alcaeus and vanished from my sight  you seem disturbed forgive me sir if with a daughters love i press too boldly on your private thoughts indeed i am to blame  but yet i fear all is not well  harpagus the time is teeming now with great events and think not that thy father when hopes and fears divide each others breast can unconcerned survey the hour decreed perhaps to fix the freedom of his country  aspasia ere the glad hour of peace while dangers rise shall i not tremble for a fathers safety cyrus is slain and by his death deprives the people of their long expected joy to hail the kingdoms heir  who knows from hence what insurrections may be feared the king is by his nature cruel ever feeds suspicion in his soul that often incites him to break the tenderest ties  did not my brother your loved arsaces fall an early victim  harpagus o my poor boy here dwells thy fate and vengeance alone can blot it thence aside aspasia why gracious powers was i not steeled with manly fortitude why throbs this breast with more than female terrors o that a better sex had given me sanction to share in all your toils  harpagus no more my daughter the milder fame that waits on passive virtue is womans boast  but though thy gentle kind forbids to mix in the rough scenes of life yet thus far let me tell thee harpagus from this eventful day expects to gather a fruit long planted that alcaeus   aspasia sir  with emotion harpagus be not alarmed i see that name has warmed the roses in thy cheek fear not my child i will not chide thee no thou art my joy when first with methou sawft mithranes son scarce now three moons elapsed thou may remember thy fathers caution   aspasia and these faithful lips have never breathed his name  harpagus i know it well  o thou art goodness all  and it is with grief with tenderness i speak  but yet aspasia there is a cause  if thou regardst thy peace if thou regardst a parents will expunge a passion from thy soul which ere the sun descends may whelm thee in despair  enter mirza the king my lord requires your presence harpagus i attend him farewell aspasia and remember   exit aspasia alone o i see i see it all  remorseless love in every day of my succeeding life plants the sharp thorns of sorrow  still my father i will obey thee yes i will contend against this fatal passion yet forgive me if all is vain at least the smothered flame shall burn within and if i cannot cease to love i can resolve to be unhappy  exit scene the grove before the dwelling of mithranes mithranes mandane mandane there needs no more mithranes i confess thee a mirror of unsullied truth  proceed no further in thy tale  i know already what thou have done for cyrus and cambyses knows it not less  invention has been racked how to reward thy worth  persidious slave aside it is true the recompense that is given will ever fall short of thy desertyet what is done though it seem little in mandanes eyes mithranes when he hears may find too much  mithranes what means mandane wherefore speak thou thus of recompense and merits by yon heaven my soul abhors the mercenary sounds learn that my duty to my prince fulfilled comprizes all reward  this humble garb debases not the mind thou know in me these weeds are voluntary that i chose to lead this life of rustic solitude to keep what still i boast this breast unstained and never prove what thou would seem to think me  mandane gods can he thus dissemble  aside mithranes thou have started a thought that calls a blush to these old cheeks and wrongs my honest services  mandane forgive me i must confess the warmth of gratitude transported me too far i know full well that to exalted minds their deeds alone are their reward and he who can attain as thou have done the sovereign height of virtue finds all within himself tranquillity with endless pleasure that in part resembles the state of the immortals  speak mithranes have thou not proved such happiness  mithranes i have nor would i change it for a thousand worlds  mandane i can no longer hold  detested villain thou murderous traitor monster  mithranes say thou princess speak thou to me  mandane to thee  and could thou think thy frauds would be concealed and did thou hope thou wretch that for my own i should have clasped thy son in my embraces  no perfidious i am not yet so hateful to the gods i have lost my cyrus but i am not to learn by what cursed means  i know by whom he fell and can and will revenge it  mithranes what distraction what cruel error clouds your reason  mandane peace and mark me well  now tremble if thou can  know that this instant while i speak thy son gasps for his latest breath  mithranes what say thou ha   mandane

awaits him is  cambyses  mithranes ah mandane what have thou done o haste at least discover the fatal place  mandane indeed  so might thou come to intercept my vengeance  thou shall know it but not

then deceive you return and vent on me your keenest rage tear this old breast by piecemeal for each hour i have dragged this wretched life invent a pang till cruelty herself shall stand aghast  mandane o subtle hypocrite but naught avails thee i see thy purpose driven to this extreme at least thou would suspend the blow  thou know i have no friend to trust and thou may hope the king mean time may hear and bring thee aid  mithranes what shall i do instruct me gracious powers o my poor prince  unhappy fruitless cares have i then toiled my age for this  mandane i here again adjure each pitying god in witness to this truth  the feigned alcaeus is cyrus  is your son  run quickly save him yet yet believe me  if thou do mistrust this agony of grief thou will become an object hateful to the world and all thy future days shall be despair and horror  mandane rave on for i enjoy it   mithranes mighty gods do these white hairs deserve so little faith these furrows filled with tears
