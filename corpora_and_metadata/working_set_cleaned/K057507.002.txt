arrived at mrs lawsons sophia who little expected such a visit had wandered as usual in the wood accompanied with dolly mrs lawson immediately sent fanny in search of her and harriot expressing an impatience to see her sister went along with her  they found sophia sitting under an oak with mrs gibbons on one side of her and dolly on the other for the old gentlewoman was prevailed upon by sophia to endure the company of the innocent girl who had never offended her and dolly instructed by her lovely friend made good use of these opportunities to recover her favor  william leaned on a branch close by sophia to whom he addressed his discourse while his eyes often stole tender glances at his beloved dolly harriot when she approached cried out affectedly upon my word sister you have a brilliant assembly here i did not expect to find you in such good company  sophia surprised to see her sister ran hastily to meet her and embracing her kindly enquired with a sweet anxiety for her mother and whether she also had been so good as to visit her harriot scarce answered her question her attention was all fixed upon william so handsome a youth seemed worthy to feel the influence of her charms and all the artillery of her eyes was instantly levelled against him having returned his respectful bow with an affected courtesy and the fashionable toss of the head she deigned to take some little notice of mrs gibbons and honored dolly with a careless glance whose amiable figure however attracted a second look and after examining her with an inquisitive eye she turned away with a little expression of scorn in her countenance and again attacked william practicing a thousand airs to strike him all which he beheld with the utmost indifference  sophia being impatient to see her mother took leave of mrs gibbons but harriot who had a new conquest in view was unwilling to go so soon professing herself enchanted with the place and declaring she would turn shepherdess  sophia told her smiling that she was sure that sort of life would not please her  oh how can you think so cried harriot is not the dress excessively becoming then love in these woods is so tender and sincere i will engage there is not a nymph in this hamlet whose frown would not drive her lover to despair own the truth now said she turning with a lively air to william are you not violently in love  the youth bowed blushed and sighed and not daring to look at his mistress he suffered his eyes full as they were of tender expression to direct their glances toward sophia i am proud to own madam said he to harriot that i have a heart capable of the most ardent passion  and mighty constant too no doubt interrupted harriot with a malignant sneer for she had observed the sigh and the look and was ready to burst with vexation and disappointment to find her conquest obstructed already by her sister as she supposed and being now as impatient as she was before unwilling to be gone come sophy said she taking her under the arm my mamma will take it ill that you make no more haste to see her for we shall return to town immediately  sure you will stay one night said sophia  oh not for the world exclaimed harriot affectedly how can you imagine i would stay so long in an odious village to be rusticated into aukwardness pursued she with a spiteful laugh and ashamed to show my face in any assembly in town afterward saying this she courtesied disdainfully to mrs gibbons and her nephew and tripped away pulling her sister away with her  dolly joined the two ladies but walked by the side of sophia not aiming at any familiarity with the insolent and affected harriot and as they pursued their way home she had the mortification to hear her lover ridiculed and despised by the disappointed coquet who supposed she mortified her sister by the contempt she expressed for a man who had so little taste as to like her  sophia as well in compassion to poor dolly who suffered greatly upon this occasion as in justice to the amiable youth defended him warmly which drew some coarse raillery upon her from harriot  when they came near to mr lawsons house the sight of sir charless chariot threw her into a fit of trembling harriot perceived it and willing to undeceive her if she hoped to find the young baronet there i am charged with sir charless compliments to you said she he insisted upon our using his chariot for this little excursion my mamma and i would fain have persuaded him to accompany us but he pleaded an engagement and would not come  dolly now looked with great concern upon her fair friend who suppressing a sigh asked if sir charles was quite recovered  i do not know that he has been ill replied harriot indeed when he came from bath the fatigue he had endured with his sick uncle whom he had sat up with several nights before he died made him look a little pale and thin but he is now extremely well and more gay than ever and it is well he is so pursued she for we have so much of his company that if he was was not entertaining we should find him very troublesome  all this was daggers to the heart of poor sophia those pleasing ideas which she had indulged upon reading her mothers letter that represented sir charles as having suffered in his health from his endeavors to vanquish his passion for her now vanished and left in their room a sad conviction that she was become wholly indifferent to him  she might indeed knowing her sisters malice have attributed what she said to artifice but her manner of accounting for the alteration in sir charless looks which her fond fancy had dwelt upon so much was so natural and so full of probability that she could expect no artifice there  every thing harriot said was confirmed by facts which left no room for doubt his assiduity to harriot his neglect of her appeared but too plain did he not lend his chariot for a visit in which he would not share did he not send his compliments in a manner that showed his heart was so much at ease that he felt not even any resentment for her leaving him could there be stronger proofs of indifference than these  such were her thoughts and her heart was so oppressed by this sudden and unexpected shock that it was with difficulty she restrained her tears dolly who looked at her with tender anxiety and saw her color come and go and her charming eyes bent on the ground as if she feared to look up lest they should betray her anguish cast many an angry glance at her envious sister and wished her a thousand miles off  sophia having a little recovered herself hastened toward her mother who with a face of ignorant wonder was following mrs lawson about her little farm asking a thousand questions without heeding the answers she received sophia approaching paid her duty to her with her usual tenderness and respect which mrs darnley returned with slightly kissing her cheek telling her that she thought her complexion was greatly improved and appealed to harriot for the truth of her observation  harriot answered that indeed she could not flatter her sister so much as to say she thought so for if there was any alteration it was rather for the worse  sophia without attending to this difference of opinion with regard to her complexion was only sollicitous to know if her mother had been well and while she was making some tender enquiries concerning her health mrs darnley who never consulted either time or place suddenly interrupted her to draw her aside from the company and asked her abruptly whether she was not surprised at sir charless indifference  sophia still smarting with the pangs her sisters discourse had given her replied in a tone of resentment that nothing now could surprise her with regard to sir charles  why to say the truth sophia replied mrs darnley i believe he has quite forgot you but there was a time when you ight have been happy  oh girl girl pursued she kindling with anger as she spoke you were always obstinate and conceited what a foolish part have you played with all your wit but i am to blame to trouble myself about you  sophia now eased her loaded heart by a shower of tears it is to little purpose now said mrs darnley to repent of your imprudent behavior you were too wise to take a parents advice when it might have been useful when a man of rank and fortune makes his addresses to a woman who is inferior to him in both he expects a thousand little complacencies and attentions from her which without wounding her honor may convince him that it is not to his riches she sacrifices herself  ah madam cried sophia that is a snare which has been fatal to many young women in my circumstances who sees not the advantages this gives a man whose aim is to seduce i am persuaded these pernicious maxims are not yours but his for whose ungenerous purpose they are so well calculated  sophia guessed truly the young baronet had often had discourses of this sort with mrs darnley who nevertheless took it ill that her daughter should offer her such an affront as to suppose she did not understand maxims as well as sir charles  nothing is more certain than that we are never made so ridiculous by the qualities we have as by those we affect to have mrs darnley with all her ignorance aspired to be thought witty she therefore vindicated her claim to what sophia had called maxims no matter whether they were pernicious or not the word maxim sounded learnedly in her ears she told her daughter with great asperity that she was so conceited and vain of her own wit that she would allow no one else to have any sophia found it difficult enough to appease her but she succeeded at length and they joined the rest of the company  chap xix sophia is agreeably surprised mrs lawson easily prevailed upon her guests to stay that night and the following day which being sunday harriot could not resist the temptation of displaying her charms and her fine clothes in a country church which was so new a triumph that the thoughts of it kept her waking almost the whole night  the ridiculous airs she assumed to draw the admiration of the simple villagers who never saw any thing so fine and so gay before and who stared at her with stupid surprise made sophia often blush for her but her affected glances were chiefly directed to the beautiful youth whose insensibility had so greatly mortified her pride she saw his eyes constantly turned toward the pew where she sat but she saw plainly that it was not her charms that drew them thither she had no suspicion that dolly was the object of his affection and sensible to her great grief of her sisters power to charm she no longer doubted that this envied conquest was hers  thus disappointed she appeared so much out of humor and so impatient to return to town that mrs darnley over whom her power was absolute complied with her importunity and set out with her for london as soon as they returned from church notwithstanding all the endeavors of the good curate and his wife to detain them to dinner  sophia was now left alone to her own melancholy reflections this visit from her mother and sister had produced a sad reverse in her situation hitherto hope had not quite forsaken her the idea of being still beloved by sir charles lessened all her griefs and supported her amidst the doubt and anxiety which his mysterious conduct had involved her in his indifference so apparent in her sisters account of him gave her pangs unfelt before and never till now did she think herself unhappy for unperceived by herself she had encouraged a secret hope that the passion she had inspired him with would not be easily subdued and that perhaps all which she had thought exceptionable in his conduct proceeded not from a settled design to the prejudice of her honor but from that irresolution and slowness with which a man too sensible of his superiority in birth and fortune proceeds in an affair of marriage where he has no obstacles to fear and where every thing depends upon himself  she now perceived the necessity of banishing sir charles from her heart but at the same time she perceived all the difficulty of the task though ashamed of her tears she wept and passionately exclaimed against her own weakness which had kept her in a delusion so fatal to her peace she continued the whole day in her chamber wholly absorbed in melancholy thoughts  dolly who knew enough of her situation to guess the cause of this new affliction was grieved to find herself excluded as well as the rest of the family and although she ardently wished to console her yet she durst not intrude uncalled upon her retirement while she waited impatiently for her appearance a visitor arrived who she knew would be welcome to her charming friend as soon as she perceived him she flew with eager haste to inform sophia and tapping at her door told her in a joyful voice that mr herbert was just alighted  sophia surprised at the news instantly opened her chamber door and smiling tenderly upon the charming girl to whom she excused herself for her long absence hastened to receive the good old man who after some affectionate enquiries concerning her health rallied her upon the melancholy that appeared in her countenance  sophia blushed and fixed her eyes on the ground not a little surprised at his talking to her in that manner and when with a bashful air she looked up again and saw a more than usual cheerfulness in his eyes her confusion increased and for a few moments she could not help feeling some resentment against her benefactor for thus diverting himself with her uneasiness  mr herbert whose thoughts were wholly employed on the pleasing news he brought did not perceive how much his behavior embarrassed her to prevent his renewing a subject so disagreeable she talked of the visit her mother and sister made her  mr herbert asked her if they had mentioned sir charles and what she thought of him now  i think of him as i ought to do replied sophia with some warmth i despise him  be not too rash my dear child said mr herbert if your sister whose malice i well know has suggested any thing to sir charless disadvantage be assured she deceives you for i am convinced he not only loves you but loves you with honor  sophia who from the first words mr herbert uttered had been in great agitation as expecting something extraordinary was so overwhelmed with surprise at what she heard that her speech and color forsaking her she remained pale silent and motionless in her chair  mr herbert perceiving how powerfully this news operated on her spirits began to be apprehensive of the consequences and was rising hastily to give her some assistance when sophia roused to recollection by this motion of her venerable friend and ashamed of the extreme sensibility she had discovered apologized for it with a charming modesty that greatly affected the good old man who if he had known in what melancholy thoughts she had passed the day would have told her with more caution a circumstance that raised her at once from despair to hope and produced so great a change in her situation  as we are never so ready to fear a disappointment as when we are nearest the completion of our wishes sophia with a sweet apprehensiveness which yet she labored to conceal hinted her doubts of the baronets sincerity mr herbert answering explicitly to these half expressed doubts told her that he was fully persuaded sir charles would act like a man of honor i will give you an exact account said he to her of what has passed between us from which you may judge yourself of his conduct he then took a letter out of his pocket and desired her to read it  chap xx mr herbert acquaints sophia with the result of the interview between sir charles and him sophia trembling a little at the sight of sir charless handwriting took the billet and found it contained a message from him to mr herbert requesting in very earnest terms the favor of an interview and an offer to wait upon him at any hour he should appoint  you may be sure said mr herbert receiving back the billet which sophia gave him without speaking a word that i did not suffer sir charles to come to me hearing from the messenger that his master was at home waiting for my answer i attended him immediately i perceived a little embarrassment in his countenance upon my first entrance but that soon wore off he welcomed me with great politeness and after thanking me for the honor i did him in preventing his visit he entered immediately upon the affair which had occasioned his sending to me  you have sir said he shown so truly a paternal affection for the young lady to whom i have paid my addresses and are so much esteemed and reverenced by her that i think i may without any impropriety address myself to you upon this occasion   here he paused and seemed a little perplexed  to be sure added he i ought to have done this before my conduct must have appeared capricious both to her and you and indeed it was capricious  but   here he paused again and fixed his eyes on the ground his frankness pursued mr herbert pleased me greatly and disposed me to give him a favorable attention  i cannot blame miss sophia resumed he for acting as she has done my heart did homage to her virtue at the time that i suffered most from the contemptuous behavior it suggested to her fain would i hope added he sighing that the prejudices she has conceived against me have not entirely banished me from her remembrance the delicacy of my passion would be but ill satisfied by calling so deserving a woman my own unless i could likewise boast a preference in her heart that left me no room to doubt my fortune had any share in determining her in my favor  i know not pursued mr herbert whether sir charles expected any answer to this declaration it is certain he looked on me with a kind of anxious timidity and stopped a moment i continued silent and he proceeded in this manner  i know miss sophia has an understanding too solid and a mind too noble to suffer any considerations of rank and fortune to determine her solely in an affair upon which the happiness of her life depends she would not surely give her hand where her heart did not acknowledge a preference it is thus i answer all those doubts which my situation and perhaps an overstrained delicacy suggest i am impatient to convince her of the purity of my passion and considering you as her friend her guardian and one who is in the place of a father to her i will take no steps in this affair but such as have the sanction of your approbation i will not even presume to visit her without your permission be you my advocate with her tell her i lay myself and fortune at her feet and will receive her from your hand as the greatest blessing that heaven can bestow on me  now my child pursued mr herbert looking on sophia with a smile how would you have had me answer to this discourse was it necessary think you to play off a few female artifices here and keep sir charles in doubt and anxious suspense or did the apparent openness and candor of his procedure deserve an equal degree of frankness on my part  it is not to be doubted said sophia blushing but that on this occasion as on every other you acted with the utmost prudence  i find resumed mr herbert that you are resolved beforehand to approve of whatever i said well then i told sir charles that his present declaration entirely satisfied me that being fully convinced of his sincerity i looked upon his offer as highly honorable and advantageous to you and that i was very sure you would have all the sense you ought to have of so generous an affection  he then begged me to set out immediately for this place and prepare you to receive a visit from him this request i could not possibly comply with having business in town which would necessarily detain me for some hours but i promised him to go as soon as that was dispatched which probably might be in the afternoon  he modestly asked my leave to accompany me but this i declined as fearing his sudden appearance without your being previously acquainted with what had past might occasion some perplexity and uneasiness to you so it was agreed that he should come tomorrow  tomorrow replied sophia with an emotion she was not able to suppress  yes my child replied the good old man have you any objections to this  i know not replied sophia with downcast eyes and a faultering accent what i ought to do i have been so used to consider sir charless professions in an unfavourable point of view my heart has been so accustomed to suspect him  to guard itself against delusive hopes  perhaps i ought not to admit his visit so easily  perhaps i ought to resent his former behavior i own i am greatly perplexed but i will be determined wholly by your advice  mr herbert saw her delicate scruples and to favor her modesty answered with the authority of a guardian when sir charles visits you next miss sophia he comes to offer you his hand he has asked my consent as your guardian and your friend and i presuming on my influence over you in both these characters have given it freely and how indeed having your interest and happiness sincerely at heart could i do otherwise but if you think his former behavior in which however there were only suspicions against him deserves to be resented at a time when those suspicions are absolutely destroyed you must go through with your heroism and see him no more for as the poet says he comes too near who comes to be denied so he has offended too much who needs a pardon  sophia who felt all the force of this reasoning answered only by a blushing silence mr herbert then told her that sir charles had declared to him that he would make the same settlements on her as had been stipulated for his mother for he added with equal delicacy and tenderness miss sophia in virtue wit goodsense and every female excellence brings me an immense portion  sir charles pursued mr herbert smiling by a strange contradiction which is i suppose always found in lovers though he was impatient to have me with you yet could not help detaining me to have the pleasure of talking of you he painted to me very naturally the uneasiness he had suffered from your supposed contempt of him he told me that he was at one time determined to travel in order to efface you from his remembrance but said he rising and unlocking a cabinet from which he took out a paper and put into my hands you shall judge whether amidst all my resentment i did not still love miss sophia that is my will which i ordered to be drawn up previous to my intended journey  he then to spare me the trouble of reading it all through pointed to the place where you was mentioned and i found he had bequeathed you an estate of four hundred pounds a year for life and five thousand pounds to be disposed of as you pleased  this last circumstance touched sophia so much that tears filled her eyes she sighed and turned her head aside to conceal her emotion while mr herbert without seeming to observe it continued to repeat to her several expressions used by sir charles which showed the greatness of his affection and his veneration for her virtues  we parted at length pursued mr herbert extremely well satisfied with each other and tomorrow or next day at farthest you may expect to see sir charles here for he told me that if he received no ill news from me he would conclude i had prepared him a favorable reception and presuming on this hope he would immediately set his lawyer to work to prepare the writings that nothing might be left undone which could convince you of the sincerity of his affections therefore my dear child set your heart at rest and since providence has thought fit to reward your piety and virtue receive with humble gratitude that fortune to which you are raised and which puts it so largely in your power to do good i will now leave you said the good old man rising to your own reflections i have scarce spoke a word yet to our kind friends here for i was so impatient to see you that i left them very abruptly  chap xxi sophia is threatened with a new disappointment mr herbert had no sooner left the room than sophia in an ardent ejaculation thanked heaven for thus relieving her from her distress but it was long ere the tumult in her mind raised by such unhoped for happy news subsided and gave place to that calm recollection which supplied a thousand pleasing ideas and filled her with the softest emotions of gratitude tenderness and joy  she was now freed from those tormenting doubts which made her consider her tenderness for sir charles as a crime and occasioned so many painful struggles in her mind what joy to reflect that the man she loved was worthy of her affection how pleasing was the prospect that opened to her view to be blessed with the power of showing her gratitude to her friends her piety to her mother to repay her sisters unkindness with acts of generosity and indulge the benevolence of her heart in relieving every distress which fell within her power to relieve  these were the advantages which she promised herself in the change of her fortune and for these her grateful heart lifted itself up every moment in thanks and praise to that providence that bestowed them on her  while sophia was thus absorbed in thought dolly opened the door and running up to her eagerly cried tell me true my dear miss has not mr herbert brought you some good news i am sure he has i never saw him so joyful in my life and you look glad too pursued she peering in her face with a sweet earnestness may i not ask you miss darnley what this good news is  you may my dear said sophia smiling but not now you shall know all soon at present i would rather talk of your affairs  indeed i am greatly obliged to you miss said dolly for what you have done for me mrs gibbons seems almost as kind to me as ever she was and you have talked so sensibly to my mother that she repents of her behavior to mrs gibbons and she likes mr william so well that i am sure she would be glad to be reconciled to her  that is what i have been laboring at all this time resumed sophia if mrs lawson can be persuaded to make some concessions to the fantastic old gentlewoman all may go well yet it shall be my care to bring them together and if my endeavors to produce a reconciliation fail perhaps i may be able to engage a more powerful mediator in your interest  sophia had sir charles in her thoughts who she doubted not would readily undertake the cause of the distressed lovers and possibly add something to her dollys portion to lessen the inequality there was between them in that point she spoke with such a cheerful confidence that dolly full of hope and joy thanked her with artless transports of gratitude that moved her even to tears  the next day though in expectation of seeing sir charles her heart labored with a thousand emotions yet kindly attentive to the affairs of her friend she resolved to make mrs gibbons a visit to prepare the way for the hoped for interview between her and mrs lawson as soon as she had disengaged herself from mr herbert she set out alone for mrs gibbonss house but scarcely had she crossed the first field when she saw william who who was as usual sauntering about mr lawsons grounds in hopes of seeing his mistress  sophia beckoned to him and he eagerly flew to meet her for next to dolly he thought her the most charming woman in the world and he adored her for the goodness with which she interested herself in his and his dollys happiness  when he drew near sophia told him she was going to visit his aunt the youth respectfully expressed his concern that his aunt could not have that honor she was gone he said to visit a relation who lived a few miles up the country  sophia then told him the design upon which she was going and the favorable disposition mrs lawson was in i am persuaded said she all might be made up if we could but bring them together mrs lawson only wants opportunity to repair her fault but how shall we contrive to give her this opportunity what expedient can we find out to overcome your aunts obstinacy and prevail upon her to enter mrs lawsons door again  i know one madam said the youth which i think would do  sophia concluding from the timidity of his look that she was concerned in this expedient pressed him to speak freely assuring him she would assist to the utmost of her power  my aunt madam said he is as you know a great observer of forms she would not for the world fall under the censure of having failed in any part of ceremony or good breeding now madam if you would be pleased to make a point of her returning your visit and permit me to tell her that you are offended with her neglect and that you insist upon this proof of her politeness i am persuaded she will come  well said sophia smiling if you are of opinion this will do you have my consent to say whatever you think will affect her most make me as angry and as ceremonious as you please  nothing shall be wanting on my part to promote the success of this affair added she with a graver look and accent for i believe you have a sincere affection for my young friend and i shall not be at rest till i see you both happy  the youth in whose breast the sweet benevolence of her looks and words excited the strongest transports of gratitude not able to find words to express his sense of her goodness suddenly threw himself at her feet and kissed her hand with a mixture of tenderness and awe  sophia smiling at this sally stepped back a little upon which he rose up and with a graceful confusion paid her his thanks she again repeated her promise of serving him and took leave he bowed low following her for some time with his eyes and sent a thousand kind wishes after her  sophia at her return acquainted dolly with what had passed between her lover and her and filled her with pleasing hopes of the success of his scheme but now the day wore away she was in continual expectation of seeing sir charles her heart throbbed with anxiety every noise she heard sounded like the trampling of horses and then an universal trembling would seize her she dreaded yet wished for his arrival and at every disappointment she sighed and felt her heart sink with tender despondency  such were her agitations till the evening being far advanced she gave up all hope of his coming that night mr herbert had assigned a very pleasing reason for his visit being deferred till the next day and her mind growing more composed she went in search of the good old man who dolly told her was gone to walk in the meadows behind the house for she had kept herself out of his sight as much as possible unwilling that he should observe her emotions she saw him at a distance walking with a slow pace and she perceived he observed her but to her great surprise she saw him cross into another field and take a quite contrary way on purpose to avoid her  struck with this little accident she stood still and paused a few moments she felt herself strangely alarmed yet wondered why she should be so and took her way back again to the house with sad forebodings on her mind  chap xxii sophia suspects the cause of her lovers mysterious conduct when mr herbert returned from his walk and met the curate and his little family at supper sophia who heedfully observed him saw an alteration in his countenance which realized all her melancholy apprehensions and convinced her that some new misfortune awaited her his eyes which studiously avoided here is expressed nothing but grief and confusion but he retired so early to his chamber that sophia finding there was no hopes of explaining himself that night passed it in an anxiety of mind which suffered her not to taste the least repose early in the morning he knocked at her door and desired her to join him in the garden she was already dressed and instantly complied  as soon as she came up to him he took her hand and pressed it affectionately but spoke not a word  sophia who feared as much as she wished to know what had happened had not power to ask for an explanation so they both continued silent for some minutes  at length mr herbert told her he was going to london sophia in a faultering accent asked him what had happened to occasion this sudden resolution  alas my dear child said the good old man in great emotion i am ashamed and grieved to tell you that  sir charles has i fear deceived me  although sophia had reason to expect some sad reverse of fortune and had endeavored to prepare herself for it yet this fatal confirmation of her fears shocked her so much that mr herbert who saw a deathlike paleness overspread her face and felt her hand cold and trembling fearing she would faint made haste to lead her to a little bench of turf which was near them  sophia recovering saw so much concern in his looks that struggling to repress her own anguish she endeavored to comfort him and smiling through the tears that filled her charming eyes let not this instance of my weakness alarm you sir said she and doubt not but with the assistance of heaven i shall bear this strange insult with proper fortitude  how worthy are you my good child of better fortune said mr herbert then taking a letter out of his pocket my first design pursued he was to seek some explanation of this mysterious letter before i made you acquainted with it but i perceived that my too apparent uneasiness had alarmed you and i thought it would be less cruel to inform you of the whole matter than to leave you in doubt and uncertainty this letter was delivered to me yesterday in the evening by one of sir charless servants just as i was walking out toward the road in hopes of meeting his master my surprise at receiving a letter when i expected to see himself made me open it instantly without asking the servant any questions and while i was reading it he went away doubtless being directed to do so  mr herbert then gave the letter to sophia who unfolding it with trembling emotion found it was as follows sir since it is impossible my marriage with miss sophia can ever take place i could wish you would look upon all that passed between us upon that subject as a dream i dreamt indeed when i imagined there was a woman in the world capable of a sincere attachment and i ought to be ashamed to own that upon so delusive a hope i was ready to act in opposition to the general maxims of the world and be pointed at as a silly romantic fellow however i beg you will assure the young lady that as i have no right to blame her conduct so i have not the least resentment for it and am so perfectly at ease on this occasion that i can with great sincerity congratulate her on her approaching happiness  i am sir your humble servant charles stanley     although this letter gave sophia a sad certainty of her misfortune yet it relieved her from those worst pangs which a heart in love can feel the belief of being abandoned through indifference or inconstancy unperceived by ourselves pride mixes with our most tender affections and either aggravates or lessens the sense of every disappointment in proportion as we feel ourselves humbled by the circumstances that attend it  the illdisguised jealousy the personated calmness the struggling resentment that appeared in this letter convinced sophia that sir charles was far from being at ease and that to whatever cause his present unaccountable behavior was owing yet she was sure at least of not being indifferent to him  it was not difficult to perceive that he had been deceived by some malicious reports and her suspicions fell immediately upon harriot but rejecting this thought as too injurious to her sister she returned the letter to mr herbert without speaking a word but with a look much more serene and composed than before  mr herbert who saw nothing in this letter like what her penetration had discovered and who conceived it to be only a poor artifice to disengage himself from promises which he now repented of was surprised to find her so much less affected with it than expected and asked her what she thought of it  sophia told him that she was fully persuaded sir charles had been prejudiced against her  do you think so my dear said he after a little pause then it is your sister to whom you are obliged for this kind office  i hope not sir replied sophia sighing that circumstance would aggravate my concern  indeed i think it would be a crime in me to suspect her of being capable of such unkindness  well resumed mr herbert i will if possible discover this mystery before night you shall hear from me tomorrow in the mean time calm your mind and resign yourself entirely to that providence which while you continue thus good and virtuous will never forsake you  chap xvi sophia is visited by mrs gibbons and makes new discoveries mr herbert now left her to go and take leave of the curate and his family and sophia whose fortune had undergone so many revolutions in so short a time retired to her chamber where she passed great part of the day alone at once to indulge her melancholy and to conceal it from observation  in the afternoon dolly came up in a great hurry of spirits to acquaint her that mrs gibbons was come to wait upon her that she had been met at the door by her mother and that several courtesies had passed between them  the poor girl though transported with joy at this favorable beginning no sooner perceived by the pensive air in sophias countenance and the sighs that escaped her that her suspicions of some new disappointment having happened to her were true than instantly forgetting the prosperous situation of her own affairs her sweet face was overspread with tender grief and a tear stole from her eyes but sophia whom nothing could have awakened from that stupifying sorrow in which any great and sudden misfortune plunges the mind but the desire of being useful to her friends soon assumed a more cheerful look and hastened to receive her visitor  mrs gibbons was in full dress and had omitted no superfluous ornament that could serve to show sophia how well she understood every sort of punctilio as soon as the first compliments were over you see madam said she what affluence your commands have over me i once little thought that i should ever have entered this impolished house again my nephew attended me to the door but i would not suffer him to come in because i am not sure that you are willing to let these people know the honor you do him by receiving his adorations  sophia though a little startled at these words yet supposed she had no particular meaning in them and ascribed all to her fantastic manner of expressing herself but mrs gibbons being resolved to hasten the conclusion of an affair which she had very much at heart spoke so intelligibly at last that sophia could no longer be ignorant of her design all the ill consequences of which suddenly striking her imagination she exclaimed in a tone of surprise and terror sure i am the most unfortunate creature in the world is it possible mrs gibbons that you can be serious have you really given any cause for a report that i receive your nephews addresses if you have you have done me an irreparable injury  sophias spirits were so greatly agited that she did not perceive how much of her situation these words discovered so that mrs gibbons who saw the tears flow fast from her eyes immediately comprehended the whole truth  i see plainly said she in great concern that i have been deceived and others perhaps have been so too i shall never discapitulate myself for being the cause of any misfortune to you some more advantageous treatise has been on the tapestry and this unlucky affair has done mischief  give me leave to ask you madam interrupted sophia with some peevishness what foundation had you for believing that i considered your nephew as my lover you know his heart has been long since engaged  i acknowledge i have been to blame my dear miss resumed mrs gibbons i was too sanguinary in my hopes but i beg you will disclaim no more this will do no good only tell me if it is possible to repair the harm i have done by my foolish schemes  to this sophia made no answer but mrs gibbons who wanted neither tenderness nor candor and who was greatly concerned at the uneasiness she saw her under urged her so frequently and with so much earnestness to tell her if she could be of any use in clearing up a mistake that had possibly been disadvantageous to her that sophia still attentive amidst all her own distresses to the interest of her friend thought this a favorable opportunity to serve her and therefore told mrs gibbons that if she was really sincere in her offers there was one way  i understand you madam interrupted mrs gibbons and i believe i may venture to say that i thought of this expedition before you did i cannot indeed miss darnley i cannot consent to my nephews marriage with the young woman here you know i have been affronted  sophia now urged some arguments in favor of mrs lawson but chiefly rested her defense upon her ignorance of those forms of politeness and good breeding which mrs gibbons was so perfectly mistress of  this compliment put the old lady into so good a humor that she cried out well my dear miss darnley in regard to you i will take off the probition i laid on my nephew to visit here no more and this i hope added she smiling will set matters right in another place as for the rest i shall take no resolution till i see how they behave  sophia in her transport at having succeeded so well with the old lady felt all her own griefs suspended and indeed when she reflected upon what had happened with regard to herself she found she had less cause for reflection than mr herbert or her own fears had suggested  mrs gibbons acknowledged that she had flattered herself with the hope of her nephews being well received by her and that in consequence of it she had talked of their marriage as an event which was very likely to happen and which would give her great joy sophia being fully persuaded that these reports had reached sir charles though by what means she was not so well able to determine easily accounted for that jealousy and resentment which had produced so strange an inconsistency in his behavior and which mr herbert considered as a piece of artifice to palliate his lightness and inconstancy  the good old man animated by his affection for the poor afflicted sophia rode with the utmost speed to town and alighted at the house of the young baronet the servants informed him that their master was in the country which was all the intelligence they could give him for they neither knew where he was nor when he would return mr herbert perplexed and concerned at this new disappointment repaired immediately to mrs darnleys hoping to hear some news of him there  harriot in answer to his enquiries told him with an air of triumph that the same day they returned from visiting sophia sir charles had waited on her mamma and her and had as usual past great part of the afternoon with them  mr herbert who was struck with this incident endeavored to make some discoveries concerning their conversation and harriots malice made this no difficult matter for she could not forbear throwing out some sarcasms against her sister whose extreme sensibility she insinuated had already found out a new object  mr herbert by his artful questions drew her into a confession of all that had passed between her and the baronet upon this subject and was convinced that her malignant hints had poisoned his mind with suspicions unfavourable to sophia  he went away full of indignation at her treachery and still doubtful of sir charless sincerity who he could not suppose would have been so easily influenced by harriots suggestions whose envious disposition he well knew if his intentions had been absolutely right  the next morning he received a letter from sophia in which she acquainted him with the discoveries she had made and modestly hinted her belief that sir charles had been imposed upon by this report of her intended marriage which she found was spread through the village and which as it was very probable he had intelligence from thence had confirmed any idle raillery to that purpose which her sister might have indulged herself in  mr herbert reflecting upon all these unlucky circumstances began to suppose it possible that sir charles had been really deceived he went again to his house but had the mortification to hear from a servant whom he had not seen the day before that the baronet was at his seat in   thither the good old man resolved to go the inconveniences and expense of such a journey which in his years and narrow circumstances were not inconsiderable had not weight enough with him to make him balance a moment whether he should transact this affair by letter or in person the happiness of his dear and amiable charge depended upon his success he therefore delayed no longer than to make the necessary preparations for his journey and after writing to sophia to acquaint her with his design he set out for sir charless seat where he met with a new and more severe disappointment the first news he heard was that the baronet was not in that part of the country and upon a fuller enquiry of his servants he was informed that their master had the morning before set out for dover with an intention to go to paris  mr herbert dispirited with this news and fatigued with his fruitless journey retired to his inn where he passed the lonely hours in melancholy reflections upon the capricious behavior of sir charles and the undeserved distresses of the innocent sophia  chap xxiv displays certain singularities in the character of sophia and their effects on the heart of sir charles sir charles however notwithstanding appearances was at present more unhappy than guilty his resolution to marry sophia though suddenly formed was not the less sincere he had always loved her with the most ardent passion and had not the light character of her mother and sister concurred with those prejudices which his youth his fortune and his converse with the gay world led him into his heart which had never ceased to do homage to her virtue would have sooner suggested to him the only means of being truly happy  an overstrained delicacy likewise proved another source of disquietude to him the inequality of their circumstances gave rise to a thousand tormenting doubts he was afraid that dazzled with the splendour of his fortune she would sacrifice her inclinations to her interest and give him her hand without her heart and when doing justice to the greatness of her mind and the real delicacy of her sentiments he rejected this supposition as injurious to her his busy imagination conjured up new forms of distrust he trembled left mistaking gratitude for love she should be deceived by her own generosity and nice sense of obligation and imagine it was the lover she preferred when the benefactor only touched her heart  such was the perplexed state of his mind when mrs darnley and harriot proposed making her a visit with some difficulty he conquered his desire of accompanying them but his impatience to hear of her carried him again to mrs darnleys much earlier in the evening than it was likely they would return presuming on his intimacy in the family he scrupled not to go up stairs telling the servant he would wait till the ladies came home  he sat down in the dining room where he gazed on sophias picture a long time at last a sudden fancy seized him to visit her apartment which he knew was on the second floor he ascended the stairs without being perceived and with a tender emotion entered the room where his beloved sophia used to pass so many of her retired hours  it was still elegantly neat as when its lovely inmate was there for harriot who hated this room because it contained so many monuments of her sisters taste and industry never went into it and it remained in the same order that she had left it  the first thing that drew the young baronets attention was a firescreen of excellent workmanship it was a flowerpiece and executed with peculiar taste and propriety the wainscot was adorned with several drawings neatly framed and glassed in this art sophia took great delight having while her farther lived appropriated all her pocket money to the payment of a master to instruct her in it sir charles considered the subjects of these drawings with a peculiar pleasure the delicate pencil of sophia had here represented the virtues and the graces from those lively ideas which existed in her own charming mind  her little library next engaged his notice many of the books that composed it he had presented her but he was curious to see those which her own choice had directed her to and in this examination he met with many proofs of her piety as well as of the excellence of her taste  several compositions of her own now fell into his hands he read them with eagerness and charmed with this discovery of those treasures of wit which she with modest diffidence so carefully concealed he felt his admiration and tenderness for her increase every moment  while he was anxiously searching for more of her papers a little shagreen case fell from one of the shelves upon the ground he took it up and as every thing that belonged to her excited his curiosity he opened it immediately and with equal surprise and pleasure saw his own miniature in water colors which was evidently the performance of sophia herself  had it been possible for her to imagine the sudden and powerful effect the sight of this picture would have upon the heart of sir charles she would not have suffered so much uneasiness for the loss of it as she really had for forgetting where she had laid it she supposed it had dropped out of her pocket and was apprehensive of its having fallen into her sisters hands who she knew would not fail to turn this incident to her disadvantage  while sir charles gazed upon this artless testimony of sophias affection for him the softest gratitude the tenderest compassion filled his soul oh my sophia said he do you then truly love me and have i cruelly trifled with your tenderness  this thought melted him even to tears he felt in himself a detestation of those depraved principles which had suggested to him a design of debasing such purity he wondered at the hardness of his own heart that could so long resist the influence of her gentle virtues and suffer such sweet sensibility to waste itself in anxious doubts and disappointed hope  being now determined to do justice to her merit and make himself happy his first design was to go immediately to mr lawsons but reflecting that sophia had great reason to be dissatisfied with his conduct and that to remove her prejudices the utmost caution and delicacy was to be observed he conceived it would be more proper to make a direct application to mr herbert whom she loved and reverenced as a father than to present himself before her while her mind yet labored with those unfavourable suspicions for which he had given but too much cause and hence new fears and doubts arose to torment him he dreaded lest her just resentment for his injurious designs should have weakened those tender impressions she had once received and that in the pride of offended virtue every softer sentiment would be lost  impatient of this cruel state of suspense and inquietude he left sophias apartment and repairing to the dining room rang the bell for the servant of whom he enquired where mr herbert lodged having obtained a direction he went immediately to the house mr herbert was not at home and sir charles grieved at this disappointment and at mrs darnleys not returning that night from whom he hoped to have heard some news of sophia the agitation of his mind made him think it an age till the next day in which he determined to put an end to all his perplexities and to fix his fate  after his interview with mr herbert and the good old mans departure to prepare sophia for his intended visit the young baronet resigned his whole soul to tenderness and joy his impatience to see sophia increased with his hope of finding her sentiments for him unchanged and he regretted a thousand times his having suffered mr herbert to go away without him  chap xxv lets the reader into some circumstances that help to display sir charless conduct mean time a card came from mrs darnley and harriot acquainting him that they were returned and thanking him for the use of his servants and chariot sir charles eager to hear news of his sophia went immediately to wait on them and scarce were the first compliments over when he enquired for her with such apparent emotion that harriot mortified to the last degree resolved to be even with him and said every thing that she thought would torment him and prejudice her sister  she told him that sophia was the most contented creature in the world and that she was so charmed with her present way of life and her new companions that she seemed to have forgot all her old friends and even her relations she is grown a mere country girl said she is always wandering about in the fields and meadows followed by a young rustic who has fallen in love with her i rallied her a little upon her taste but i found she could not bear it and indeed he is extremely handsome and she says has had a genteel education  harriot was at once pleased and grieved at observing the effect these insinuations had on sir charles his color changed he trembled and fixing his eyes on the ground he remained pensive and silent while harriot notwithstanding her mothers insignificant frowns proceeded in a malicious detail of little circumstances partly invented and partly mistaken which fixed the sharpest stings of jealousy in his heart  if in dealing with cunning persons we were always to consider their ends in order to interpret their speeches much of their artifice would lose its effect but sir charles had so contemptible an opinion of harriots understanding that although he knew she was malicious he never suspected her of being capable of laying schemes to gratify her malice and did not suppose she was mistress of invention enough to form so plausible a tale as that she had told  impatient under those cruel doubts which now possessed him he resolved to go late as it was in the evening to mr lawsons house and taking an abrupt leave of mrs darnley and her daughter he went home and ordered his horses to be got ready he scarce knew his own design by taking this journey at so improper a time but in the extreme agitation of his mind the first idea of relief that naturally presented itself was to see sophia who alone could destroy or confirm his fears and this he eagerly pursued without any farther reflection  the servant to whom he had sent his orders made no haste to execute them as conceiving it to be a most extravagant whim in his master to set out upon a journey so late and in that manner while he with studied delays protracted the time hoping for some change in his resolutions sir charles racked with impatience counted moments for hours message after message was dispatched to the groom the horses at length were brought and sir charles with only one servant galloped away never stopping till he came to the place where sophia resided  it was now night and the indecorum of making a visit at such a time in a family where he was a stranger first striking his thoughts he resolved to alight at an inn which he saw at a small distance and there consider what it was best for him to do  a guest of his appearance soon engaged the attention of the host and his wife they quitted two men with whom they had been talking and with a great deal of officious civility attended upon sir charles who desired to be shown into a room as he was following the good woman who declared he should have the best in her house the two persons before mentioned bowed to him when he passed by them the salute of the younger having a certain grace in it that drew his attention he looked back on him and at the sight of a very handsome face and a person uncommonly genteel his heart by its throbbing emotions immediately suggested to him that this beautiful youth was the lover of his sophia  the jealousy which harriots insinuations had kindled in his heart now raged with redoubled force this rival whom she had called a rustic and whom he fondly hoped to find such possessed the most attractive graces of form and probably wanted neither wit nor politeness sophias youth her tenderness her sensibility wounded by his dissembled indifference and the cruel capriciousness of his conduct all disposed her to receive a new impression and who so proper to touch her heart as this lovely youth whose passion as innocent as it was ardent and sincere banished all doubt and suspicion and left her whole soul open to the soft pleadings of gratitude and love  while he was wholly absorbed in these tormenting reflections and incapable of taking any resolution the officious landlady entered his chamber to take his orders for supper  sir charles surprised to find it was so late resolved to stay there all night and after giving the good woman some directions his restless curiosity impelled him to ask her several questions concerning the old man and the youth whom he had seen talking to her  the hostess who was as communicative as he could desire told him that the old man was one farmer gibbons of whom she had been buying a load of hay that the young one was his son and a great scholard his aunt pursued she breeds him up to be a gentleman and she has a power of money and designs to leave it all to him much good may it do him for he is as handsome a young man as one would desire to see some time ago it was all over our town that he was going to be married to the parsons youngest daughter and she is a pretty creature and disarves him if he was more richer and handsomer than he is but whatever is the matter the old folks have changed their mind and his aunt they say wants to make up a match between him and a fine london lady that boards at the parsons but i will never believe it till i see it for she and the parsons daughter are great friends they say and it would not be a friendly part to rob the poor girl of her sweetheart to say the truth i believe there is some juggling among them but this i keep to myself for i would not make mischief therefore i never tell my thoughts to any body but i wish the young folks well  sir charles who had listened to her with great emotion dismissed her now that he might be at liberty to reflect on what he had heard which although it did not lead him to a full discovery of the truth yet it suggested thoughts which relieved him in some degree from those dreadful pangs of jealousy with which he had hitherto been tortured and balanced at least his fears and his hopes  chap xxvi the baronets jealousy accounted for he leaves england his impatience to free himself from this state of perplexity and suspense allowed him but little repose that night he rose as soon as the day appeared and it was with some difficulty that he prevailed upon himself to defer his visit till a seasonable hour and then being informed that mr lawsons house was scarce a mile distant he left his servant and horses at the inn and walked thither amidst a thousand anxious thoughts which made him dread as much as he wished for an iterview which was to decide his fate  as he drew near the house he perceived a young man sauntering about in an adjacent field whose air and mien had a great resemblance of the youth whom he had seen in the inn sir charles eager to satisfy his doubts followed him at a distance and the youth turning again his wishing eyes toward the house the baronet had a full view of his face  at the sight of his young rival his heart throbbed as if it would leave his breast he hastily retreated behind a hedge determined to watch his motions for he imagined and with reason that he came there to meet his mistress and who that mistress was whether sophia or the curates daughter was the distracting doubt which he now expected to have satisfied  he walked along by the side of the hedge still keeping william in sight who suddenly turning back rather flew than ran to meet a woman who beckoned to him sir charles saw at once his sophia and the fatal sign which planted a thousand daggers in his heart trembling and pale he leaned against a tree which concealed him from view and saw her advance toward his rival saw her in earnest discourse with him and to complete his distraction and despair saw the happy youth throw himself at her feet doubtless to thank her for the sacrifice she made to him of a richer lover  such was the inference he drew from this action and now rage and indignation succeeding to grief in these first transports he was upon the point of discovering himself and sacrificing the hated youth to his vengeance but a moments reflection showed him the dishonor of a contest with so despicable a rival and turned all his resentment against sophia who having quitted her supposed lover took her way back again to the house sir charles followed her with disordered haste resolved to load her with reproaches for her inconstancy then unwilling to gratify her pride by such an acknowledgment of his weakness he turned back cursing love women and his own ill fate in this temper he wandered about a long time at last he again returned to the inn where after having given orders to have his horses got ready he wrote that letter to mr herbert in which he so well disguised the anguish of his heart that the good old man believed his breaking off the affair was the effect of his lightness and inconstancy only though sophias quicker penetration easily discovered the latent jealousy that had dictated it  sir charles ordered his servant to deliver the letter into mr herberts hands then mounting his horse he bid him follow him as soon as he had executed his commission the young baronet who retired to his country seat to conceal his melancholy and fondly flattered himself that he should soon overcome that fatal passion which had been the source of so much disgust to him found his mind so cruelly tortured with the remembrance of sophia that he reassumed his first design of going abroad and unfortunately set out for dover the day before mr herberts arrival  the good old man being obliged to send sophia this bad news filled his letter with tender consolations and wise and prudent cousnels he exorted her to bear this stroke of fortune with that dignity of patience which distinguishes the good and wise  the virtue of prosperity said he is temperance the virtue of adversity fortitude it is this last which you are now called upon to exert and which the innocence of your life may well inspire you with for be assured my dear child that it is the greatest consolation under misfortunes to be conscious of having always meant well and to be convinced that nothing but guilt deserves to be considered as a severe evil  sophia in her answer displayed a mind struggling against its own tenderness offering up its disappointed hopes its griefs and desires in pious sacrifice to the will of providence and seeking in religion all its consolation and support  can a virtuous person said she however oppressed by poverty and in consequence neglected by the world be said to want friends and comforters who can look into his own mind with modest approbation and to whom recollection furnishes a source of joy every good action he has performed is a friend every instance of pious resignation is a comforter who cheer him with present peace and support him with hopes of future happiness can he be said to be alone and deprived of the pleasures of society who converses with saints and angels is he without distinction and reward whose life his almighty creator approves  chap xxvii sophia meets with a new subject of affliction the loss of sir charles having clouded all sophias views of happiness she earnestly entreated mr herberts permission to settle herself in that humble station to which providence seemed to call her and as she believed mrs gibbons might be very useful to her upon this occasion she resolved to apply to her as soon as she had his answer  notwithstanding all her endeavors to bear this shock of fate with patience a fixed melancholy took possession of her mind convinced that sir charles had loved her and that by an unfortunate concurrence of circumstances he had been prevented from giving her the utmost proof of his affection her tenderness no longer combatted by suspicions to his prejudice gained new force every day and all his actions now appeared to her in a favorable point of view so true it is that when a person is found less guilty than he is suspected he is concluded more innocent than he really is  mr herbert after a long silence at length acquainted her that he was ill and desired her not to leave mr lawsons till she heard further from him  the shortness of this billet the trembling hand with which it appeared to be written filled sophia with the most dreadful apprehensions sir charles was now forgot and all her thoughts were taken up with the danger of her worthy friend she determined to go to him and although mr lawson and his wife endeavored to dissuade her from taking such a journey and william urged by dolly and his own eagerness to serve her offered to go and bring her an exact account of the state of his health yet her purpose remained unalterable  my dear benefactor is ill said she and has none but strangers about him it is fit that i should go and attend him and if i must lose him pursued she bursting into tears it will be some comfort to me to reflect that i have done my duty  she set out early the next morning in the stagecoach dolly wept at parting and engaged her lover to attend sophia to her journeys end that if mr herbert should be worse than they apprehended he might be near to assist and comfort her  sophia when she saw him riding by the side of the coach attempted to persuade him to return but william charmed to have an opportunity of expressing his zeal for her service would not quit her and her spirits being too weak to contest this point with him she was obliged to suffer his attendance  they reached the place where mr herbert was in the evening of the third day he had taken lodgings at the house of a farmer where he was attended with great tenderness and care  sophia appeared with so deep a concern upon her countenance and enquired for him with such extreme emotion that the good woman of the house concluding she was his daughter thought it necessary before she answered her questions to preach patience and submission to her wisely observing that we are all mortal and that death spares nobody from the squire to the ploughman  she ran on in this manner till she perceived sophia grow pale and close her eyes she had just time to prevent her from falling and with williams assistance placed her in a chair where while she applied remedies to recover her from her swoon the youth with tears in his eyes asked her softly how long mr herbert had been dead  dead repeated the farmers wife who told you he was dead no no it is not so bad as that neither  william rejoiced to hear this and as soon as sophia showed some signs of returning life he greeted her with the welcome news she cast a look full of doubt and anguish upon the countrywoman who confirmed his report and offered to go with her to the gentlemans room sophia instantly found her strength return she followed her with trembling haste and lest her presence should surprise mr herbert she directed the good woman to tell him that a friend of his was come to see him  she heard him answer in a weak voice but with some emotion it is my dear child bring her to me  sophia immediately appeared and throwing herself upon her knees at his bedside burst into tears and was unable to speak  the good old man holding one of her hands pressed in his tenderly blamed her for the trouble she had given herself in coming so far to visit him but acknowledged at the same time that this instance of her affection was extremely dear to him and that her presence gave him inexpressible comfort  sophia entered immediately upon the office of a nurse to her benefactor and performed all the duties of the most affectionate child to the best of parents  mr herbert employed the little remaining strength he had in endeavors to comfort her and in pious exhortations weep not for me my dear child would he say but rather rejoice that the innocence of my life has divested death of his terrors and enabled me to meet him with calm resignation and with humble hope at this awful hour how little would it avail me that i had been rich that i had been great and powerful but what comforts do i not feel from an unreproving conscience these comforts every one has it in his power to procure live virtuous then my dear sophia that you may die in peace how small is the difference between the longest and the shortest life if its pleasures be few its miries are so likewise how little do they enjoy whom the world calls happy how little do they suffer whom it pronounces wretched one point of fleeting time past and death reduces all to an equality but the distinction between virtue and vice and future happiness and misery are eternal  chap xxviii the character of mrs howard sophia had need of all the consolation she derived from her reflections on the virtue and piety of her friend to enable her to bear the apprehensions of his approaching death with any degree of fortitude but when she least expected it his distemper took a favorable turn and in a few days the most dangerous symptons were removed  the bath waters being judged absolutely necessary for the entire reestablishment of his health he resolved to go thither as soon as he had recovered strength enough to bear the journey  sophia at his earnest desire consented to return to mr lawsons and remain there till he came from bath but she would not quit him till he was able to take this journey and by the sweetness of her conversation her tender assiduity and watchful care contributed so much toward his recovery that he was soon in a condition to travel with safety  he accompanied her the first days journey to mr lawsons and being met at the inn by this worthy friend and young william he consigned his beloved charge to their care and pursued his way to bath  sophia was received with great joy by mrs lawson and her daughters dolly hung a long time upon her neck in transports and as soon as they were alone informed her that mrs gibbons and her mother were perfectly reconciled that she had consented to her nephews marriage and even showed an impatience to conclude it but i prevailed said she to have the ceremony delayed till you my dear friend could be present for i could not think of being happy while you to whom i owe all was afflicted  sophia embraced her tenderly congratulated her upon her change of fortune and gave many praises to her lover to whom she acknowledged great obligations for his care and attention to her  dollys cheeks glowed with pleasure while she heard her william commended by one whom she so much loved and revered  the young lovers were married a few days afterward and sophia who had so earnestly endeavored to bring about this union and had suffered so much in her own interest by her solicitude concerning it was one of those to whom it gave the most satisfaction  mean time mr herbert continued indisposed at bath and sophia uneasy lest in this increase of his expenses her residence at mr lawsons should lay him under some difficulties resolved to ease him as soon as possible of the charge of her maintenance she explained her situation to mrs gibbons and requested her assistance in procuring her a place  mrs gibbons expressed great tenderness and concern for her upon this occasion and assured her she would employ all her interest in her service she accordingly mentioned her with great praise to a widow lady of a very affluent fortune who had established such a character for generosity and goodness that she hoped if she could be induced to take sophia under her protection her fortune would be made  mrs howard so was the lady called no sooner heard that a young woman of merit well born and genteely educated was reduced to go to service for subsistence than she exclaimed with great vehemence against the avarice and luxury of the rich and great who either hoarded for their unthankful heirs or lavished in expensive pleasures those superfluous sums which ought to be applied to the relief of the indigent oh that i had a fortune cried she as large as my heart there should not be one distressed person in the world i must see this young lady mrs gibbons and i must do something for her you have obliged me infinitely by putting it in my power to gratify the unbounded benevolence of my heart upon a deserving object  mrs gibbons when she related this conversation to sophia filled her with an extreme impatience to see the lady not from any mean considerations of advantage to herself but admiration of so excellent a character she accompanied mrs gibbons in a visit to her at her country seat which was but a few miles distant from the village where they lived and mrs howard was so pleased with her at this first interview that she gave her an invitation to spend the remainder of the summer with her and this in so obliging a manner that sophia immediately complied not thinking it necessary to wait till she had consulted mr herbert upon this offer as she was fully persuaded he could have no objections to her accepting it mrs mrs howard being so considerable by her family and fortune and so estimable by her character  this lady who had made an early discovery of sophias economical talents set her to work immediately after her arrival her task was to embroider a white satin negligee which she undertook with great readiness pleased at having an opportunity of obliging a woman of so generous a disposition and in some degree to requite her for her hospitality  mrs howard indeed always prevented those on whom she conferred favors from incurring the guilt of ingratitude for she took care to be fully repaid for any act of benevolence and having a wonderful art in extracting advantage to herself from the necessities of others she sometimes sought out the unfortunate with a solicitude that did great honor to her charity which was sure to be its own reward a few ostentatious benefactions had sufficiently established her character and while her name appeared among the subscribers to some fashionable charity who could suspect that her table was served with a parsimony which would have disgraced a much smaller fortune that her rents from her indigent tenants were exacted with the most unrelenting rigor and the naked and hungry sent sighing from her gate  it has been well observed that what is called liberality is often no more than the vanity of giving of which some persons are fonder than of what they give but the vanity of giving publicly is most prevailing and hence it happens that those who are most celebrated for their charity are in reality least sensible to the feelings of humanity and the same persons from whom the most affecting representation of private distress could not force the least relief have been among the first to send their contributions to any new foundation  sophia knew not how to reconcile many circumstances in mrs howards conduct with her general professions of benevolence and generosity but that lady had been so used to disguise herself to others that at last she did not know herself and the warmth and vehemence with which she delivered her sentiments imposed almost as much upon herself as her hearers  sophias amiable qualities however soon produced their usual effects and inspired mrs howard with as much friendship for her as so interested a temper was capable of she wished to see her fortune established and was very desirous of serving her as far as she could consistent with her prudent maxims which were to make other persons the source of those benefits the merit of which she arrogated to herself  chance soon furnished her with an opportunity of exerting her talents in favor of sophia and of engaging as she conceived her eternal gratitude a country lady of her acquaintance coming one day to visit her with her son a clownish ignorant youth mrs howard was encouraged by the frequent glances he gave sophia to form a scheme for marrying her to him and in this she foresaw so many possible advantages to herself from sophias grateful disposition that she pursued it with the most anxious solicitude  chap xxix mrs howard is taken in her own snare mr barton so was the young squire called having conceived a liking for sophia repeated his visits frequently emboldened by mrs howards civilities who took every occasion of praising sophia and insinuating that he would be extremely happy in such a wife  she sometimes left him alone with sophia in hopes that he would declare his passion to her but the rustic awed by the dignity of her person and manners durst not even raise his eyes to look on her so that mrs howard finding the affair did not advance so fast as she wished rallied sophia upon her illtimed reserve and hinted her views in her favor which she considering as an effect of her friendship listened with respect and even gratitude though her heart refused to concur in them  this conversation passed in the presence of mrs howards only son a youth about nineteen who had come from the university to pass a few days with his mother as soon as she quitted sophia he approached her and with a look of tenderness and concern told her he was sorry to find his mother so zealous an advocate for mr barton who could not possibly deserve her  nor can i possibly deserve him replied sophia with a smile he is too rich  love only and merit can deserve you resumed the young student sighing and if love were merit i know one who might  hope   he paused and hesitated and sophia to whom the language of love in any mouth but sir charless was odious suddenly quitted him to avoid the continuance of a discourse which she considered as mere unmeaning gallantry  mean time her rustic lover not having courage enough to declare his passion to her had recourse to the indulgence of his mother who till that time had never refused any of his desires  he told her that he never liked any young woman so well in his life as mrs sophia darnley and that he was sure she would make a good wife because mrs howard had told him so and encouraged him to break his mind to her but he was ashamed he declared he would marry no body else and begged his mother to get her for him  mrs barton full of rage against her neighbor for thus endeavoring to ensnare her son into a marriage as she conceived unworthy of him resolved to go to her and load her with reproaches while her chariot was getting ready she continued to question her son and heard a great many particulars from him which convinced her that his affections were more deeply engaged than she had imagined  after ordering the young squire to be locked up till her return she flew to mrs howard and with the most violent transports of rage upbraided her with the treacherous part she had acted by seducing her son into a liking for a poor creature who was a dependent upon her charity and whom she took this method to get rid of  mrs howard who held mrs barton in great contempt on account of her ignorance and valued herself extremely upon her philosophic command over her passions listened with an affected calmness to all mrs bartons invectives and when she found she had railed herself out of breath she began to declaim in a solemn accent against avarice and that vile sordid disposition of parents who in the marriage of their children preferred the dross of riches to the real treasures of wisdom and virtue she very charitably lamented mrs bartons want of discernment and littleness of mind and concluded that miss sophias merit rendered her deserving of a husband even more considerable than mr barton  then marry her to your own son replied mrs barton with a sneer no doubt but he will be more worthy of her  if my son should declare a passion for miss sophia resumed mrs howard it would soon be seen how far my sentiments are exalted above yours  i am glad to hear this returned mrs barton for i am very sure mr howard is in love with this wonderful creature whom you praise so much and since you are so willing to make her your daughterinlaw i shall be under no fear of my sons marrying her  mrs howard at this unexpected stroke turned as pale as death and with a faultering voice asked her what reason she had for supposing her son was in love with miss sophia  mrs barton who enjoyed her perplexity and confusion suffered her to repeat her questions several times and then maliciously referred her to the young gentleman himself who said she upon finding you so favorably disposed will i doubt not be ready enough to own his inclinations  mrs howard was now so far humbled that she condescended to to entreat mrs barton to tell her what she knew of this affair  all my information said mrs barton comes from my son to whom mr howard considering him as his rival declared his better right to the lady as having first acquainted her with his passion  at this intelligence mrs howards rage got so much the better of her prudence that she uttered a thousand invectives against the innocent sophia which drew some severe sarcasms from mrs barton who being now fully revenged rose up to be gone but mrs howard sensible that a quarrel upon this occasion might have consequences very unfavourable to her reputation seized her hand and led her half reluctant again to her chair where after she had soothed her into good humor by some flattering expressions which coming from one of her acknowledged understanding had great weight she told her with the most unblushing confidence that she was now convinced she had been deceived in the character of the young woman on whom she had with her usual generosity conferred so many benefits i find to my inexpressible concern pursued she that this modest sensible and virtuous young creature as i once believed her is in reality an artful hypocrite whose only aim is to make her fortune by ensnaring some unexperienced youth into a marriage let us join our endeavors then my dear mrs barton to preserve our sons from this danger this is a common cause all mothers are concerned in it we will show the young dissembler in her proper colors and prevent her imposing upon others as she has done upon us  mrs barton who never carried her reflections very far was so well pleased with mrs howards present behavior that she forgot all the past these two ladies became on a sudden the best friends in the world and this union was to be cemented with the ruin of sophias fame such beginnings have certain female friendships and such are the leagues in which the wicked join  mrs barton proposed to have her sent for into their presence and after reproaching her severely dismiss her with contempt but the more politic mrs howard whose views were at once to destroy sophias reputation and to secure her own disapproved of this harsh treatment as she called it and charitably resolved to ruin her with all possible gentleness  chap xxx sophia leaves mrs howard mrs howard accordingly wrote to mrs gibbons and acquainted her that having discovered an intrigue carrying on between sophia and her son she thought it necessary to dismiss her immediately out of her family but that the poor young creature might be exposed as little as possible to censure she begged she would come herself to fetch her away and deliver her to her friends with a caution to watch her conduct carefully  she recommended secrecy to her for sophias sake and assured her that if it had not been for this discovery of her bad conduct she had resolved to have provided for her handsomely  mrs gibbons whom this letter threw into the utmost astonishment immediately communicated the contents of it to dolly and william with whom she now lived  dolly burst into tears of grief and indignation and earnestly entreated her to go immediately and take miss sophia out of a house where her merit was so little understood but william who looked farther into the consequences of this affair than either his wife or his aunt believed it necessary for the justification of sophias honor that mr lawson should wait upon mrs howard and demand an explanation of those censures which she had cast upon a young lady confided to his care rightly judging that if malice was the source of her accusation she would not dare to pursue it with a man of his character and if it arose from the information of others he would be able to detect the falsehood of it  these reasons prevailed with mrs gibbons who had been very desirous to show her eloquence upon this occasion and was resolved she said not to have spared mrs howard for her immature conclusions  william went immediately to his fatherinlaw and acquainted him with what had happened mr lawson was grieved from the consideration of what sophias delicate sensibility would feel from such an attack upon her reputation and this was the worst that he apprehended could happen from calumnies which the purity of her manners and the innocence of her life would be always a sufficient refutation of a wise and virtuous person he knew was out of the reach of fortune though not free from the malice of it all attempts against such a one are as the poet says like the arrows of xerxes they may darken the day but cannot stiflle the sun  his impatience to take sophia out of the hands of a woman whom he conceived to be either very malicious or very imprudent made him defer his visit no longer than till the afternoon  when he sent in his name mrs howard who had no suspicion of the occasion of his coming ordered him to be shown into a parlour where she suffered him to wait near an hour before she admitted him to her presence a country curate being in her opinion a person too insignificant to lay claim to any degree of consideration and besides this sort of neglect being affected by many persons of quality to whom it certainly gives great importance and dignity their imitators never lose any opportunity of exercising it  mr lawson was at last summoned to the ladys dressing room where he expected to have found sophia but was glad to see mrs howard alone she asked him with a little superciliousness if he had any business with her to which he replied with a solemnity in his look and accent that surprised her that being a friend to miss sophia darnley and the person to whose care she was confided by her relations he thought it his duty to enquire what part of her conduct had given occasion for those unfavourable suspicions which were entertained of her  mrs gibbons madam pursued he has communicated to me a letter which she has received from you wherein there is a heavy charge against miss sophia a charge which none who know her can think it possible for her to deserve there must certainly be some mistake here madam you have been misinformed or appearances have deceived you and in justice to you as well as to one of the most virtuous and amiable young women in the world i am resolved to trace the source of these calumnies that her innocence may be fully cleared i beg of you then madam let me know what foundation you have for believing that miss sophia   mrs howard whom this speech had thrown into great confusion interrupted him here to prevent his repeating those expressions in her letter the meaning of which though obvious she durst not avow  i find said she that you and mrs gibbons have seen this affair in a worse light than i intended you should my son has been foolish enough to entertain a liking for this girl whom i took under my protection with a view to provide for her handsomely and she has been wise enough pursued she with an ironical smile to give him encouragement i suppose but with all her excellencies i am not disposed to make her my daughterinlaw  mrs howard threw in this last softening expression in hopes it would satisfy mr lawson and added that to prevent any thing happening which might be disagreeable to her she begged he would take sophia home with him  most willingly madam said he but since it seems to be your opinion that this young gentlewoman woman has encouraged the clandestine addresses of your son i think it will be proper to examine first into the truth of these suspicions that you may not part with worse thoughts of her than she deserves  mrs howard being thus pressed and unwilling to enter into an explanation that would expose all her artifices was forced to acknowledge that she had no other foundation for her fears than the passion her son had owned for her and having made this unwilling concession she left him with a countenance inflamed with stifled rage saying she would send sophia to him  accordingly she went into the room where she was at work and told her her friend the curate was waiting to carry her home observing her to look extremely surprised if you consider said she what returns you have made me for the benefits i have conferred upon you you will not think it strange that we should part in this manner  bless me cried sophia what have i done to deserve such reproaches  i cannot stay to talk to you now said mrs howard i have explained myself to mr lawson i am sorry to say that i now can only wish you well  she hurried out of the room when she had said this and sophia in the utmost perplexity and concern flew down stairs to mr lawson who was already at the gate waiting to help her into the chaise she gave him her hand asking him at the same time with great emotion what mrs howard accused her of  as soon as they drove away mr lawson related all that had past between that lady and him which filled sophia with new astonishment she could not comprehend mrs howards motives for acting in the manner she had done with regard to her all her conduct appeared to her highly extravagant and inconsistent she asked mr lawson a thousand questions full of that simplicity which ever accompanies real goodness of heart  he gave her some notion of the dangerous character of mrs howard and greatly blamed her for having so suddenly accepted her invitation without first consulting mr herbert it is a maxim pursued he of one of the wisest of the ancients that in forming new connections of every sort it is of great importance in what manner the first approaches are made and by whose hands the avenues of friendship are laid open  mr lawson by this hint gave sophia to understand that he did not think mrs gibbons a proper person to introduce her into the world she was now sensible that she had been too precipitate but her motives were so generous that mr herbert whom in a letter she acquainted with the whole affair easily justified her in his own opinion though he earnestly recommended it to her not to let her apprehensions of being burdensome to him draw her into new inconveniences  mr lawson having as he imagined prevented mrs howard from making any future attack upon sophias reputation by obliging her to acknowledge her innocence was surprised to hear wherever he went of the calumnies she invented against her  nothing is more common than for persons to hate with extreme inveteracy those whom they have injured and although mrs howard was convinced that sophia would not admit a visit from her son who now openly avowed his passion for her that she refused to receive his letters and shunned every place where she thought it possible to meet him yet pretending to be apprehensive that the youth would be drawn into a clandestine marriage she sent him away precipitately upon his travels and this gave a color to new invectives against sophia who trusting only to her innocence for her justification had the satisfaction to find that innocence fully acknowledged in the esteem and respect with which she was treated by all the persons of fashion in the neighborhood  chap xxxi sophia returns to town and hears news that reduces her to despair mr herbert who in every new trial to which sophia was exposed found greater cause for admiration of her character praised the gentleness and forgiving spirit which she discovered upon this occasion but mrs gibbons was not wholly satisfied with her conduct you ought to discriminate upon mrs howard said she and tell the world how desirous she was to have you married to her friends son though she makes such a clutter about her own indeed you want spirit miss sophia added the old lady with a little contempt  i am not of your opinion madam replied sophia for in taking revenge upon our enemies we are only even with them in passing over their malice we are superior  well well interrupted mrs gibbons i have no notion of such superiousness i always resent injuries and mrs howard shall feel my resentment for her malice to you i have not returned her last visit yet and perhaps i may not this month this is pretty severe i think  sophia composing her countenance as well as she could thanked mrs gibbons for this instance of her friendship to her but she had no opportunity to observe whether she kept her word for she was summoned to town by a letter from her mother which gave her a melancholy account of her affairs  mrs darnley acquainted her that the gentleman who paid her the annuity which sir charles had stipulated for her when he procured him her late husbands place was dead she desired her to come immediately to town to assist her under her misfortunes and added in a postscript as if reluctantly that harriot had left her and was not so dutiful as she could wsh  sophia read this letter with tears and impatient to comfort her afflicted mother she instantly prepared for her little journey  all mr lawsons family parted from her with great regret but dollys affliction was extreme and sophia amidst so many greater causes of sorrow felt a new pang when she took leave of her tender and innocent friend  to spare mr lawson the trouble of conducting her to town she accepted a place in the coach of a lady with whom she had lately become acquainted and who professed a particular esteem for her  on her arrival at her mothers house she found only a servant there who informed her that her mistress had taken lodgings at kensington for the air having been indisposed for some weeks past  sophia ordered her to get a hackney coach to the door and was hurrying away without daring to enquire for her sister when the maid told her miss darnley desired to see her before she went to kensington  where is my sister said sophia with a faultering accent  the answer she received was a stroke of fortune more cruel than any she had yet experienced her sister she found lived in the house which sir charles had once offered to her  trembling and pale she ordered the coachman to drive thither and drawing up the windows relieved her laboring heart with a shower of tears  chap xxxii which leaves sophia in her former perplexity the first thought that struck the amazed sophia was that sir charles either following the motions of his natural inconstancy or in revenge of her supposed contempt of him had married harriot certain that she had now lost for ever this lover who with all his real or imputed faults she had never been able to banish from her heart she resigned herself up to the sharpest agonies of despair and had already arrived at her sisters house before she was able to stop the course of her tears  a servant in the livery of her own family opened the door this circumstance surprised sophia who pulling her hat over her eyes to conceal her disorder asked him with some hesitation if his mistress was at home  the fellow replied he believed she was and opening the coachdoor showed her into a parlour telling her with a smart air that he would enquire of his ladys woman whether she was visible yet or no  sophia having summoned all her fortitude to enable her to go through this severe trial with dignity had time enough to recollect and compose herself before any one appeared and now several circumstances rushed upon her memory which in the first transports of her astonishment and grief had escaped her attention  mrs darnley in her letter had not mentioned harriots marriage but barely said she had left her the servant who delivered her message called her miss darnley and though she lived in a house that belonged to sir charles yet it was scarcely suitable to the quality of his wife  a few moments reflection upon these appearances made the generous sophia change the object of her concern the misfortune for which she had grieved so much seemed light compared with that she apprehended she wept no longer for the inconstancy of her lover she trembled for the honor of her sister and her greatest fear now was that sir charles was not married  while she was absorbed in these melancholy thoughts harriots maid entered the room who after glancing over sophia with a supercilious eye for she was very simply dressed asked her if she had any business with her lady  tell her replied sophia that her sister is here  the girl blushed courtesied and flew to acquaint her mistress and sophia was instantly desired to walk up stairs  she found harriot in her dressing room in an elegant dishabille having just finished her mornings work which appeared in a suit of ribbons made up with great taste  as soon as she saw sophia she rose from her chair and saluted her with affected dignity but at the same time with an air of embarrassment that increased every moment so that being unable to bear the sweet but penetrating looks of her sister she resumed her work altering and unripping without any apparent design yet affecting to be extremely busy and to show how perfectly she was at ease talked of the most trifling matters imaginable while sophia gazed on her in silent anguish anxious to know the truth of her situation yet dreading to have it explained at length she told her that she was going to kensington to her mother and desired to know if she had any message to send to her  harriot suddenly interrupting her as if she feared some further questions began to exclaim against her mothers unreasonable temper saying that she had offended her violently only because she had it not in her power to comply with some very extravagant expectations which she had formed  sister said sophia i am wholly ignorant of your affairs i know not what cause of discontent you have given my mother but i see there is a great alteration in your condition of life and i hope   what do you hope pray miss interrupted harriot reddening i suppose i am to have some of your satirical flings your temper is not altered i find  dear harriot resumed sophia with tears in her eyes this causeless anger confirming her suspicions why do you reproach me with being satirical is it a crime to be anxious for your happiness  i wish you would not trouble yourself about me replied harriot i know best what will make me happy you should not pretend to instruct your elders miss sophy i am older than you you know you have often upbraided me with that  sister said sophia calmly you desired to see me have you any thing to say to me  i know answered harriot that i shall meet with ungrateful returns for my kindness nevertheless i shall act like a sister toward you and it was to tell you so that i wished to see you i very much doubt whether if you were in prosperity you would do the same by me  have i behaved so ill in adversity then said sophia that you form this hard judgment of me harriot  pray dont upbraid me with your behavior miss said harriot other people may have behaved as well as you though they are not prudes  you say you are in prosperity sister said sophia but perhaps you and i have different notions of prosperity let me know the truth of your situation and if i find you happy according to my notions of happiness you will soon be convinced that i can take a sisters share in it  i am not obliged to give an account of my conduct to you replied harriot who had listened to this speech with great emotion and i must tell you sister sophia that if you go on taking this liberty of questioning and censuring me i shall not care how seldom i see you as to my mother i know that it is my duty to do every thing for her that is in my power and this i have offered to do already  saying this she rang the bell and her maid appearing she gave her some orders which necessarily required her attendance in the room so that sophia finding she could have no further discourse with her sister rose up and took leave of her with an aching heart her griefs all aggravated by the apprehension of her sisters dishonor and the hatred which she felt for sir charles as her seducer struggling with a tender remembrance her gentle bosom was torn with conflicting passions and she proved but too well the truth of that maxim that philosophy easily triumphs over past and future evils but the present triumph over her  chap xxxiii contains an interesting discovery mrs darnley received her daughter with unusual tenderness she felt how much she stood in need of her filial care and her behavior was dictated by that interested kindness which only gives in expectation of receiving back doublefold  sophia saw her pale and emaciated and was greatly affected with the sight she would not mention her sister for fear of discomposing her but mrs darnley soon introduced the subject that was most in her thoughts and exclaimed against harriots undutifulness and want of affection with the most violent transports of passion  i have been the best of mothers to her said she melting into tears i have always indulged her in all her wishes and impaired my fortune to support her extravagancies and how has she returned this kindness would you think it my dear sophy though she is in affluent circumstances and i by the loss of my annuity am plunged into all my former distresses she has refused to pay those debts which i contracted during the time she lived with me and thinks it sufficient to invite me to reside in her house where no doubt i should feel my dependence severely  sir charles said sophia sighing does not act with his usual generosity if he has married my sister why does he suffer you to be in distress  married your sister repeated mrs darnley in astonishment  ah madam resumed sophia is she not married then to sir charles  why is it possible that you can wish him to be married to harriot said mrs darnley  alas cried sophia ought i not to wish it when i see her in his house  oh resumed mrs darnley i perceive your mistake but that house is not sir charless now lord l  bought it of him with the furniture some time ago it might have been yours and without any offense to your virtue too yet you thought fit to refuse it but i will not pretend to reprove one so much wiser than myself   well madam interrupted sophia eagerly then it is not to sir charles that my sister is married to whom is she married  you have seen her have you not said mrs darnley looking a little confused  i have indeed seen her said sophia but she did not explain her situation to me  and do you imagine resumed mrs darnley peevishly that she would be less reserved with her mother and if she was afraid of telling you the truth is it likely she would own it to me  then i fear it is bad indeed with harriot cried sophia in a melancholy accent since she has so much to conceal from a mother and a sister  you were always censorious sophy said mrs darnley with some passion for my part i am resolved to think the best if lord l  is married privately to your sister her character will one day be cleared to the world and she thinks no prudent person can blame her for choosing to bear for a time a few undeserved censures rather than to struggle with poverty and contempt  sophia now convinced of harriots unhappy conduct burst into tears mrs darnley after looking at her in silence a moment said with some confusion then you do not believe your sister is married sophy  ah madam replied sophia you do not say that you know she is and whatever reasons there might be for concealing her marriage from the world certainly there are none for hiding it from you  in vain added she with still greater emotion would your parental tenderness seek to deceive yourself  reproach me no more with my tenderness for your sister interrupted mrs darnley angrily i am too much affected with her ingratitude already  i am sorry she is ungrateful said sophia but oh my dear mamma it is not fit you should accept of her assistance  i hope said mrs darnley casting down her eyes that i know what to do as well as my daughter  but sophy added she after a little pause i am sorry to tell you if you do not know it already that if you have still any thought of sir charles you deceive yourself i am very well informed that a match has been proposed to him and he has given so favorable an answer that it is expected the marriage will be concluded as soon as he comes from paris i heard it all from one of the young ladys relations  this was a severe stroke to poor sophia who had just begun to breathe again after the anguish she had suffered in the belief that sir charles had forsaken her for her sister and added perfidy and baseness to his inconstancy  mrs darnley who saw her grow pale and her eyes swimming in tears while she struggled to conceal her emotions could not help being affected with her distress and endeavored to console her  sophia more softened by this tenderness suffered her tears to flow a few moments unrestrained then suddenly wiping her charming eyes pardon this weakness madam said she this indeed is not a time to weep for myself your sorrows claim all my tears  aye i have sorrows enough heaven knows said mrs darnley my debts unpaid my annuity gone what have i to trust to  providence interrupted sophia your piety and my industry alas my dear mamma your greatest affliction is not the loss of your annuity or the debts with which you are encumbered it is my sisters unhappy fall from virtue that parent pursued she who sees a beloved child become a prey to licentious passions who sees her publicly incur shame and reproach expelled the society of the good and virtuous and lead a life of dishonor embittered with the contempt of the world and the secret upbraidings of her own conscience that parent can best judge of your anguish now i have only a sisters feelings for this misfortune but these feelings are strong enough to make me very unhappy  mrs darnley appeared so much moved with this discourse that sophia pursued it till she brought her mother to declare that she would rather suffer all the inconveniences of poverty than give a sanction to harriots guilt by partaking of its reward  sophia to relieve her anxiety laid down a plan for their future subsistence and proved to her that by her skill in several little useful arts it would be easy for her to supply her with all the necessaries of life we will first said she pay your debts  how is that to be done said mrs darnley hastily  the furniture of your house said sophia the plate and other pieces of finery which sir charles stanley presented to you will if converted into money not only pay your debts but provide a little fund for present expenses and a reserve for future exigencies mean while my industry and care will i hope keep want far from you i have friends who will find employment for my little talents and if i can but make your life easy and comfortable i shall think myself happy  mrs darnley with tears in her eyes embraced her daughter bid her dispose of every thing as she pleased and assured her she would endeavor to bear her new condition of life with patience and resignation  sophia immediately wrote to a gentleman of the law who had been an intimate friend of her fathers and he undertook to manage their little affairs in town a few days afterward he brought them a hundred pounds which was all that remained from the sale after every demand upon mrs darnley was paid  she read over the accounts with great emotion bitterly regretting every trinket she had parted with and told sophia that it was absolutely necessary they should settle in some village near town for she could not bear the thoughts of exposing her poverty to her acquaintance and of being seen in a worse condition than formerly  chap xxxiv sophia continues to act romanticly and harriot like a woman who knows the world sophia who thought her mothers declining health a better reason for not residing in london hired in an adjacent village at a very small rent a little house or rather cottage so neat and situated so happily that an imagination lively as hers was and a little romantic could not fail of being charmed with it to this place she removed her books and being provided by her friend dolly with an innocent country girl for a servant she conducted her mother to her rural abode and had the satisfaction to find her pleased with it novelty having always charms for her and here for a few days it supplied the place of those other gratifications to which she had been accustomed  in the midst of these cares sophia did not forget her unhappy sister she wrote several letters to her in which she employed all the power of virtuous eloquence to bring her to a sense of her errors but in vain  harriot did not deign to answer her but in a letter to her mother she complained of the injurious treatment she received from sophia and earnestly entreated her to leave her sister and reside with her  although mrs darnley refused this offer with seeming steadiness yet her discontent was but too apparent a life of retirement which often obliged her to seek in herself those resources against languor and melancholy which she used to find in the dissipations of the town could not be grateful to one who had never accustomed herself to reflection whose mind was filled with trifles and its whole stock of ideas derived from dress cards and every other fashionable folly  to be capable of enjoying a rural life there is something more necessary than a good understanding innocence and purity of manners must contribute to give a relish to pleasures which are founded in reason virtue and piety  hence it was that sophia in the bloom of youth found happiness in the solitude of a village while her mother in a declining age panted after the vanities of the town  in vain did mr herbert fill the letters he wrote to mrs darnley with maxims of morality and pious admonitions he experienced here the truth of that observation that it is a work of great difficulty to dispossess vice from a heart where long possession seems to plead prescription  sophia who knew her mothers taste for living at ease that she might be able to gratify it applied herself diligently to her work which was a piece of embroidery that had been bespoke by a benevolent lady in order to give her present employment and by exhibiting it as a proof of her ingenuity to procure her more she likewise exercised her invention in drawing little designs for fanmounts and always chose such subjects as conveyed some moral lesson to the mind while they pleased the imagination  some of these drawings were disposed of by the lady her friend so advantageously that sophia was encouraged to pursue her labor and mrs darnley flattered by the prospect of more easy circumstances began to enlarge her scheme of expense made little excursions about the country in a postchaise talked of hiring a better house and of passing two months at least in london during the winter  mean time harriot became more earnest in solicitations to her mother to come and live with her her situation began to be so generally suspected that she was in danger of being wholly neglected  she wrote to her in a strain of tenderness and duty that revived all the illjudging parents affection who invited her to make her a visit in her little retreat and promised her a favorable reception even from sophia herself  sophia was indeed far from opposing this visit she was rather desirous of drawing her sister thither frequently with a hope that her example and her arguments might one day influence her to change her conduct  harriot received this invitation with joy for such was the depravity of her mind that she exulted in having an opportunity of displaying the grandeur of her dress and equipage to her sister to her who had made virtuous poverty her choice and shown that she despised riches when they were to be purchased by guilt the pride of human nature says an eminent writer takes its rise from its corruption as worms are produced by putrefaction  the wretched fallen harriot was proud the diamonds that glittered in her hair the gilt chariot and the luxurious table these monuments of her disgrace contributed to keep up the insolence of a woman who by the loss of her honor was lower than the meanest of her servants who could boast of an uncorrupted virtue  chap xxxv harriot visits her mother in her cottage sophia was busily employed upon her embroidery when harriot from her gay chariot alighted at her door she entered that humble abode of innocence and industry in a kind of triumph and accosted her sister with a haughty expression of superiority in her looks and air as if she expected the splendour of her appearance should strike her with awe  sophia received her with the modest dignity of conscious virtue and harriot though incapable of much reflection yet soon perceived the miserable figure she made in the presence of such a character and stood silent and abashed while sophia contemplated her finery with an eye of pity and of anguish  harriot at length recovering herself asked for her mother who that moment entered the room the sight of her daughters equipage had thrown her into an agreeable flutter of spirits and she readily pardoned the fine lady all the faults of the ungrateful child  harriot emboldened by so kind a reception proposed to her to accompany her to town promising to make her abode with her agreeable by every instance of duty and affection  mrs darnley blushed and was silent sophia fixed her eyes upon her mother anxious and impatient for her answer she cast a timid glance at sophia she read in her speaking eyes her sentiments of this proposal and turning to harriot she told her faintly that not being satisfied with her conduct it would be very improper for her to countenance it by residing with her  harriot burst into tears and exclaimed against her sisters malice who she said acted like her most cruel enemy and sought to ruin her character by estranging herself from her company and preventing her mother from taking notice of her  sophia with great gentleness proved to her that the loss of her reputation was the necessary consequence of her living in a manner unsuitable to her circumstances that her mother and her by complying with her request could not preserve her from censure but would incur it themselves  you call me cruel harriot said she for estranging myself from your company but consider a little whether it is not you that are both cruel and unjust why would you deprive me of the only reward the world bestows on me for a life of voluntary poverty you have exchanged a good name for dress and equipage and i to preserve one subject myself to labor and indigence you enjoy your purchase but i should lose mine were i to have that complaisance for you which you require leave me my reputation then since it is the sole recompense of those hardships to which i willingly submit and if you wish to recover yours be contented to be poor like me  sophia finding her sister listened to her though it was sullenly and with downcast eyes expatiated in a tender manner upon the errors of her conduct and the fatal consequences that were likely to follow  harriot at length interrupted her with a pert air and said she would not be taught her duty by her younger sister then turning to her mother i hope madam said she my sister will not have so much power with you as to make you forbid my coming here  she put her handkerchief to her eyes as she said this to which mrs darnley replied with great vehemence that no person on earth should ever prevail upon her to cast off her child  sophia was silent and observing that her presence seemed to lay them under some restraint she rose up to retire to her work telling her sister as she passed by her that far from hindering her visits she would rather encourage her to repeat them often that she might be convinced it was possible to be happy in a cottage  harriot laughed and muttered the words romantic and affectation which sophia took no notice of but left her at liberty to converse freely with her mother  mrs darnley talked to her at first in a chiding strain and affected to assume the authority of a parent but a slave to her appetites she could not resist any opportunity of gratifying them and harriot found it no difficult matter to force a present upon her to supply those expenses which her extravagance and not her wants made necessary  harriot now came often to the village and gave it out that she was upon the best terms imaginable with her mother and sister not doubting but the world would cease to suspect her since sophia approved her conduct  the frequency and the length of her visits made sophia entertain hopes of her reformation since the time she spent with her mother was taken from that dangerous and immoral dissipation which forms the circle of what is called a gay life for it is with our manners as with our health the abatement of vice is a degree of virtue the abatement of disease is a degree of health  mr herbert being perfectly recovered filled sophia with extreme joy by the account he sent her of it and of his resolution to come and live near her  while she impatiently expected his arrival and sent many a longing look toward the road near which her little cottage was situated she one day saw a gentleman ride by full speed who in his person and air had a great resemblance to sir charles stanley her heart by its throbbing emotion seemed to acknowledge its conqueror for poor sophia was still in love she loved though she despaired of ever being happy and by thus persisting in a hopeless passion contradicted that maxim that love like fire cannot subsist without continual motion and ceases to be as soon as it ceases to hope or fear  sophia not able to remove her eyes from the place where she fancied she had seen sir charles continued to look fixedly toward the road and was beginning to believe she had been mistaken when a servant in sir charless livery rode by also and put it out of doubt that she had really seen the master  this unexpected incident awakened a thousand tender melancholy ideas in her mind and finding herself too much softened she had recourse again to her work to divert her imagination from an object she had vainly endeavored to forget  chap xxxvi sir charles appears again upon the scene sophia was not deceived when she imagined she had seen sir charles it was really he who had rode by her window and it was her little abode he was in search of though in his extreme eagerness he had overlooked it  he had left england with a hope that change of scene and a variety of new objects would efface the idea of sophia from his heart and restore him to his former tranquillity but amidst all the delights of paris he found himself oppressed with langour no amusements could entertain him no conversation engage his attention disgusted with every thing he saw and heard peevish discontented and weary of the world he avoided all company and had recourse to books for relief but sophia was too much in his thoughts to render study either instructive or amusing he past whole days in solitude feeding his melancholy with the reflection of a thousand past circumstances which served to soften his mind and make him feel his loss more sensibly  when he reflected on her exalted virtues her wit her elegance the attractive graces of her person and the irresistible sweetness of her manners he lamented his hard fate that had put such a treasure out of his reach but when his conscience told him that it had once been in his power to have become possessor of this treasure that he had trifled with that innocent affection till he had alienated it from himself to another object his anguish became insupportable and he sought to relieve it by rousing his indignation against her for her preference of so unworthy a rival  he called to mind her interview with this happy rival in the field and concluded he was far more favored by her than himself had ever been since her discourse to him had produced so tender and passionate an expression of acknowledgment as that the had beheld  these circumstances which his imagination dwelt upon in order to lessen his regret added to it all the stings of jealousy so that almost frantic with rage and grief he was a hundred times upon the point of committing some desperate action  a violent fever was the consequence of these transports which after confining him a long time to his bed left his body in a weak and languishing condition and his mind sunk in an habitual melancholy  his physicians recommended to him the air of montpelier and he was preparing to set out for that place when he happened to meet with a gentleman who made him alter his resolution  this person had been his governor and now attended mr howard in the same quality  sir charles who had a flight acquaintance with mrs howard was prevailed upon nowithstanding his aversion to company to receive a visit from her son he invited the young gentleman to dine with him and he having not yet forgot the lovely sophia drank her health after dinner by the name of miss darnley  sir charles who could not hear that name without a visible emotion told him he knew two young ladies so called and asked whether it was the eldest or the youngest sister that he meant  mr howard replied that he was ignorant till then that miss darnley had a sister  yes she has a sister said his governor who is much handsomer than herself and for whom a youthful passion would be thought perhaps more excusable  the young gentleman who knew his governor talked in that contemptuous manner of sophia in compliance with his mothers humor in revenge avowed his admiration of her in the most passionate terms and forgetting that sir charles had said he was acquainted with her described her excellencies with all the enthusiasm of a lover  sir charles listened in silence and when the other had done speaking told him with an air of forced gaity that it was easy to see he was very much in love  this indeed was his real opinion nevertheless he felt no emotions of jealousy or resentment against a rival whom he believed as unhappy as himself he asked him with a seeming carelessness if miss sophia was not to be married to the son of a rich farmer in the village where she lived and waited his answer with an agitation of mind which appeared so plainly in the frequent changes of his color that mr howard must have observed it had not the question given him almost as much concern  after a short pause he replied that he never heard she was going to be married but added he sighing i remember i have seen a very handsome young man at mr lawsons who perhaps   aye aye interrupted his governor smiling he was the favored lover no doubt you have nothing to do but to forget her as soon as you can  the youth sat pensive and silent for some time then suddenly rising took leave of sir charles and went away his governor prepared to follow him but the baronet anxious to hear more of sophia detained him to ask several questions concerning her acquaintance with mr howard  chap xxxvii gives the reader some necessary information sir charles found his old friend had lost no part of his former candor and sincerity though by the trust reposed in him he was obliged to discountenance as much as possible the passion of his pupil for a young woman so much his inferior in rank and fortune yet having seen and conversed with sophia he did justice to her extraordinary merit and acknowledged that mrs howard had treated her harshly  he related to sir charles in what manner mrs howard had invited her to her house and the suspicions she entertained of sophias encouraging her sons passion and design to ensnare him into a clandestine marriage suspicions added he which her subsequent behavior entirely destroyed for the youth was rash enough to avow his passion openly and solicited her by frequent letters and messages to grant him an interview which she absolutely refused and this conduct did her honor and procured her great esteem yet it is very likely that her affections are otherwise engaged and that she has some difficulties to encounter for she looks thoughtful and melancholy and affects retirement more than persons of her age generally do  sir charles was thrown into so profound a reverie by this account of sophia that he heard not a word of what his friend afterward said which had no relation to this interesting subject and scarce perceived when he went away  after reflecting a long time with mingled grief resentment and compassion upon her melancholy which he supposed was occasioned by some disappointment in the affair of her marriage with the young farmer and which probably her want of fortune was the cause of he suddenly formed the generous design of removing this obstacle to her union with the person whom she preferred to him and by making her happy entitle himself to her esteem since he had unfortunately lost her heart  the novelty of this resolution and its extraordinary generosity filled him with so many selfflattering ideas as suspended for a while his jealousy and his grief  instead of going to montpelier he set out immediately for england and during his journey was continually applauding himself for the uncommon disinterestedness of his conduct  nothing is more certain than that the motives even of our best actions will not always bear examination we deceive ourselves first and our vanity is too much interested in the deception to make us wish to detect it sir charles either did not or would not perceive the latent hope that lurked within his bosom and which perhaps suggested the designs he had formed  how must such an instance of generous passion thought he affect a mind so delicately sensible as sophias she who had once loved him and what was more than probable had not yet entirely forgot him  he never asked himself why his imagination dwelt upon these pleasing images why he prosecuted his journey with such eager haste as if the purport of it was to receive not to resign for ever the woman he so passionately loved  when he arrived at his own house scarce would he allow himself a few minutes rest after his fatiguing journey he hastened to mr herberts lodgings to prevail upon him to justify by his concurrence the designs he had formed in favor of sophia  mean time the secret and powerful impulse by which he was actuated kept his mind in a continual tumult he hoped he feared he wished he was all anxious expectation all trembling doubt he heard with grief that mr herbert was at bath for now he knew not how to get access to sophia who being ignorant of his intentions and offended by his behavior might possibly refuse to see him  he went to the house where mrs darnley lived when he left england he was surprised to see it shut up this incident perplexed him more and rendered him more impatient  he returned to his house passed a restless night and early in the morning ordering his horses to be saddled set out immediately for mr lawsons where he arrived before he had resolved how to introduce himself or who he should enquire for  however upon the appearance of a servant at the door he asked for mr herbert which mr lawson hearing came out himself and though he did not know sir charles politely requested him to alight telling him he had just received a letter from mr herbert which acquainted him that he was perfectly recovered and that he was in the way to london  chap xxxviii sir charles has an interview with mr lawson sir charles accepted mr lawsons invitation and alighting followed him into a parlour but in such perturbation of mind that he scarce knew what he did the good curate surprised at the pensiveness and silence of his guest knew not what to say to him or how to entertain him he gave him an account of mr herberts illness which seemed to engage his attention very little but happening to mention sophia in the course of his relation the young baronet started as from a dream and turned his eyes upon him with a look of eagerness and anxiety but said not a word  mr lawson paused as expecting he was going to ask him a question which sir charles perceiving said with some confusion i beg your pardon sir you mentioned miss sophia i have the honor to know her pray how does she do  i hope she is well sir replied mr lawson i have not seen her a long time  then she does not reside with you now said sir charles with a countenance as pale as death dreading to hear something still more fatal  as mr lawson was going to answer him william not knowing his fatherinlaw had company entered the room abruptly but seeing the baronet he bowed apologized for his intrusion and instantly retired  the various emotions with which this sudden and unexpected sight of his rival filled the breast of sir charles caused such a wildness in his looks that mr lawson in great astonishment and perplexity asked him if he was taken ill  sir charles endeavoring to compose himself replied that he was very well but in a faultering accent asked who the young gentleman was that had just left the room  mr lawson told him he was his soninlaw  your soninlaw cried sir charles eagerly what married to your daughter is it possible  mr lawson knew enough of sophias story to make him comprehend now who this young gentleman was who discovered so extraordinary a concern upon this occasion and charmed to have an opportunity of doing her service by removing those suspicions which he had been told had produced so fatal a reverse in her fortune he gave the baronet a circumstantial account of his daughters marriage sensible that he was too much interested in this detail to make him think it impertinent he introduced it no otherways than by declaring himself under the greatest obligation to miss sophia who having honored his daughter with her friendship had been the chief instrument of her present happiness  while the good curate related all the circumstances of an affair which had had such melancholy consequences the baronet listened to him with an attention still as the grave his eyes were fixed upon his with a look of the most eager anxiety and he scarce suffered himself to breathe for fear of losing any of his words  in proportion as his doubts were removed his countenance epressed more satisfaction and when upon his reflecting on all that he had heard it appeared plainly that the fatal meeting which had caused him so much anguish was the effect of sophias solicitude to serve her friend and that the passionate action of the youth was an acknowledgment of gratitude not an expression of love he was not able to conceal the excess of his joy but rising up in a sudden transport he took the curates hand and pressing it eagerly you know not said he mr lawson how happy you have made me but where is miss sophia is she gone to bath with her good friend mr herbert  no sir replied mr lawson she lives with her mother you know i suppose that mrs darnley has lost her annuity by the death of the gentleman upon whom it was charged  i never heard it till now said the baronet whose tenderness was alarmed for his sophia tell me i beg you what is her present situation  her eldest daughter has left her said mr lawson and she has retired with miss sophia to a village about five miles from hence in the road to london where that excellent young lady supports her mother and herself by the labor of her hands  angelick creature exclaimed sir charles with his eyes swimming in tears then after a little pause he desired a direction to the place where mrs darnley lived and took a kind leave of mr lawson telling him he hoped soon to visit him again  sir charles although he galloped as fast as it was possible found his horse went too slow for his impatience so eager was he to see sophia and gain her pardon for the unreasonable conduct which his jealousy and rage had made him guilty of  the account mr lawson had given him of the part she had taken in his daughters marriage with the youth whom he had considered as his rival not only removed the torturing pangs of jealousy which he had so long felt but made him view several circumstances in sophias behavior in a light favorable to his own ardent wishes  he fondly fancied that the melancholy in which he had heard she was plunged was occasioned by a tender remembrance of him and that the hope of still being his might have been the chief cause of her rejecting the addresses of mr howard  how different were these ideas from the gloomy ones which had hitherto perplexed his mind he seemed like a man waked from a frightful dream of despair and death to a certainty of life and joy  amidst these transporting reveries he had passed by sophias house without perceiving it to be the same he had been directed to and when he had reached the end of the village he looked about for it in vain and saw no one of whom he could enquire for it but an old woman who was sitting under a tree near the road making up a nosegay of some flowers such as the late season produced  he stopped his horse and asked her if she knew where mrs darnley lived at the mention of that name she rose as hastily as her feebleness would permit her and told him she knew the house very well and if he pleased would go and show it him i am making up this nosegay for the sweet young gentlewoman her daughter said the old woman i carry her flowers every day heaven bless her she is my only support there is a great many fine folks hereabouts from whom i could never get any relief but since she came hither i have wanted for nothing pray let me show you her house old and weak as i am i would walk ten miles to do her service  sir charles alighting from his horse ordered his servant to lead it to the nearest public house and wait for him there he told the old woman he would accept of her offer and walk along with her then taking two guineas out of his pocket he gave them to her in reward he said for the gratitude she expressed for her young benefactress  the good woman received his bounty with a transport of surprise and joy and pleasingly repaid him by talking of his beloved sophia of whom she related many instances of tenderness and charity toward the poor of the village and filled him with admiration of that true benevolence which even in the midst of indigence could administer to the greater wants of her fellow creatures  chap xxxix sophia receives an unexpected visit when they came within sight of sophias little cottage the old woman pointing to it told him mrs darnley and her daughter lived there upon which the baronet dismissing her walked up to it with disordered haste a row of wooden pales led to a small grassplat before the door  as he approached he saw sophia sitting at a window at work he stopped to gaze upon her she appeared to him more lovely more engaging than ever he wished yet dreaded her looking up lest her first thoughts upon seeing him being unfavourable she should resolve to refuse his visit he went forwards with a beating heart and cautiously opening the little gate reached the door of this humble habitation unheard and unseen by sophia the door flew open at his touch poverty has no need of bolts and bars and every good angel is the guard of innocence and virtue  the noise he made in entering and the sound of her name pronounced in a tender accent made sophia hastily raise her head at sight of sir charles she started from her chair her work fell from her trembling hands she looked at him in silent astonishment unable and perhaps unwilling to avoid him  the baronet whose heart labored with the strongest emotions of tenderness anxiety hope and fear had not power to utter a word and while her surprise kept her motionless threw himself at her feet and taking one of her hands pressed it respectfully to his lips tears at the same time falling from his eyes  sophia whose gentle mind was sensibly affected with this action and the paleness and langour which appeared in his countenance found it impossible to treat him with that severity which his capricious conduct seemed to demand of her nevertheless she drew away her hand which he yielded with reluctant submission  i hoped said she in an accent that expressed more softness and grief than anger or disdain that i should be spared any farther insults of this sort from you those i have already suffered have sufficiently punished me for my weak credulity  sir charles when she began to speak rose up but continued gazing on her with the most passionate tenderness while every word she uttered seemed to pierce his heart  i will not pursued sophia gathering firmness as she spoke ask you why you have intruded upon me thus unexpectedly or why you assume a behavior so little of apiece with your past actions i only beg you to believe that i am not again to be deceived and although i am persuaded my good opinion is of no consequence to you yet i will tell you that if it is possible to regain it it will be by never more importuning me with visits which my situation in life makes it very improper for me to admit of  sophia when she had said this went out of the room without casting a look back upon sir charles who followed her in great disorder conjuring her only to hear what he had to say  as she was passing to her own chamber she was met by her mother who seeing sir charles was filled with surprise and joy and perceiving that sophia was avoiding him cried to her with an angry accent where are you going what is the meaning of this rudeness  sophia without answering her retired to her own room not without great perturbation of mind for there was something in the baronets looks and words that seemed to merit a hearing at least but she dreaded the weakness of her own heart and was fully persuaded that any condescension on her side would give him too great an advantage over her  mrs darnley finding any endeavors to retain her were fruitless advanced toward sir charles with great obsequiousness congratulated him upon his return and thanked him for the honor he did her in visiting her in her poor little habitation  sir charles saluted her respectfully and took a seat there is a sad alteration sir said she in my poor affairs since i saw you last i never thought to have received you in such a hovel you have heard i suppose of my misfortune  sir charles who was in great confusion of thought and had scarce heard a word she said replied carelessly yes madam i am sorry for it  the coldness of this answer cast a damp upon those hopes which she had eagerly admitted upon seeing him again and impatient to be relieved from her tormenting anxiety on account of this unexpected visit she asked him abruptly whether she might wish him joy for she heard she said that he was going to be married  sir charles rouzed by this question replied hastily who could have told you any thing so unlikely married no madam there never was any foundation for such a report  indeed i believe so said mrs darnley almost breathless with joy to find him deny it so earnestly to be sure people are very envious and illnatured and those who told me no doubt designed to do you an ill office  and they have succeeded said sir charles sighing if they have been able to persuade miss sophia that after having aspired to the possession of her i could descend to love any other woman i came to implore her pardon madam pursued he for all the extravagancies of my past conduct and for that unreasonable jealousy which was the source of them could i have been so happy to have prevailed upon her to have heard me  what interrupted mrs darnley eagerly and was my daughter so rude as to leave you without hearing what you had to say i protest i am ashamed of her behavior but i hope you will be so good to excuse it sir i will insist upon her coming in again  no madam said sir charles holding her for she was hurrying away miss sophia must not be constrained i cannot bear that  mrs darnley unwillingly resumed her seat and inly fretting at her daughters obstinacy trembled for the event of this visit  sir charles after a silence of some minutes suddenly rose up and took his leave mrs darnley in great anxiety followed him to the door and said she hoped to see him again he answered only by a low bow and walked away full of doubt and perplexity  sophias steadiness in refusing to hear him banished all those flattering ideas of her tenderness for him which he had so eagerly admitted for he concluded that if her heart had not been steeled by indifference she would notwithstanding her just reasons for resentment have been rejoiced to give him an opportunity of justifying himself  he had reached the house where his servant was attending with the horses without having determined what to do to return to town without seeing sophia again and being assured of a reconciliation was misery which he could not support and he dreaded making a new attempt to see her lest he should receive more proofs of her insensibility and disdain  in this perplexity the sight of mr herbert alighting from a stagecoach was a relief as great as it was unexpected and in the sudden joy he felt at meeting with a man whose interposition could be so useful to him he forgot that his former behavior must necessarily have given rise to strong prejudices against him and ran up to embrace the good old man with extreme cordiality  chap xl in which the history begins to grow dull mr herbert was surprised at this meeting and repaid the civilities of the young baronet with some coldness upon which sir charles in some confusion desired to have a few moments conversation with him  they walked together down a meadow and sir charles having with a candor and sincerity becoming the rectitude of his intentions related all those circumstances which had concurred to excite his jealousy and with that powerful eloquence which passion inspires expatiated upon the motives of his conduct a conduct which he acknowledged laid him open to the most unfavourable suspicions mr herbert convinced of his sincerity and full of compassion for the uneasiness which his mistaken jealousy had caused him undertook to make his peace with sophia and assured him he would very shortly wait upon him in town  this would not satisfy the anxious lover he declared he would not leave the place till he was assured of his pardon and mr herbert who certainly was not displeased with his obstinacy could with difficulty persuade him to wait only till the next day for an account of his success  sir charles unwillingly took the road to london and mr herbert hastened to congratulate his beloved charge upon the agreeable prospect that was once more opening for her  mrs darnley had during this interval been employed in reproaching poor sophia for her behavior to sir charles in the vexation of her heart she exclaimed in the severest terms against her pride and obstinacy she told her she might be assured sir charles would never attempt to see her again that it was plain he was disgusted with her bad temper  she burst into a passion of tears while she enumerated the glorious advantages of that rank and fortune which she said sophia had thrown from her and among many motives which she urged ought to have determined her to act otherwise that of being able to outshine her sister was one  sophia answered only by sighs she herself was not absolutely satisfied with the unrelenting severity with which she had treated sir charles the more she reflected upon his behavior the more she condemned herself for not hearing what he had to offer in his own defense  she had once thought it probable that he had been deceived by the report that was spread through mrs gibbonss folly of her encouraging the addresses of her nephew and his extravagant conduct might be occasioned by jealousy a fault which a woman is always disposed to pardon in a lover while she revolved these thoughts in her mind mrs darnley perceived her uneasiness and added to it by new reproaches  mr herberts arrival put an end to this tormenting scene sophia first heard his voice and flew to receive him mrs darnley followed and seeing her bathed in tears while the good old man saluted her with the tenderness of a parent she told him with an air half serious half gay that her daughter loved him so well she had no affection for any one else she then entered abruptly upon the affair of sir charles though she hardly expected mr herbert would join with her in condemning sophia  he pleasingly surprised her by saying that sophia was to blame and that he came prepared to chide her for her petulance and obstinacy  mr herbert who saw a sweet impatience in sophias looks explained himself immediately and told her he had met sir charles who had fully removed all the suspicions his strange conduct had occasioned and convinced him that he deserved more pity than censure  no doubt pursued he looking on sophia with a smile you will be surprised to hear young lady that sir charles was witness to the interview you had in the meadow behind mr lawsons house with a certain handsome youth whom he had heard was his rival and a favored rival too what were his thoughts do you imagine when he saw this handsome youth throw himself at your feet and kiss your hand  mrs darnley now looked at her daughter in great astonishment and sophia who yet did not recollect the circumstance of her meeting william was so perplexed she knew not what to say  mr herbert enjoyed her innocent confusion for a few moments and then repeated all that sir charles had told him of his jealousy and rage his vain attempts to banish her from his remembrance the resolution he had formed after his conversation with mr howard concerning her and how happily he had been undeceived at mr lawsons where he found his supposed rival was the husband of her friend  well interrupted mrs darnley with great vehemence i hope you are satisfied now sophia i hope you will treat sir charles with more civility if he comes again  mr herbert i beg you will exert your power over her upon this occasion  i think there is no doubt of sir charless honorable intentions  thus she ran on while sophia who had listened to mr herberts relation with the softest emotions of pity tenderness and joy continued silent with her eyes fixed upon the ground  mr herbert willing to spare her delicacy told mrs darnley that relying upon sophias good sense and prudence he had ventured to assure sir charles of a more favorable reception when her prejudices were removed  he will come tomorrow my child pursued he to implore your pardon for all the errors of his past conduct and to offer you his hand i am persuaded you will act properly upon this occasion and in a marriage so far beyond your hopes and expectations acknowledge the hand of providence which thinks fit to reward you even in this world for your steady adherence to virtue  sophia bowed and blushed her mother in a rapture embraced and wished her joy  mr herbert now endeavored to change the conversation to subjects more indifferent but mrs darnley ever thoughtless and unseasonable could talk of nothing but sir charles and the grandeur which awaited her daughter  all night her fancy ran upon gilt equipages rich jewels magnificent houses and a train of servants and she was by much too happy to taste any repose  sophia enjoyed the change of her fortune with much more rational delight and among all the sentiments that arose in her mind upon this occasion that of gratitude to heaven was the most frequent and the most lively  chap xli the history concluded mr herbert who had accepted a lodging in sophias cottage went to sir charles the next day according to his promise he found him waiting for him full of anxious impatience and hearing from the good old man that sophia was disposed to receive him favorably he embraced him in a transport of joy and his chariot being already ordered they drove immediately to the village  mrs darnley welcomed the baronet with a profusion of civilities sophias behavior was full of dignity mingled with that softness peculiar to her character  sir charles after a long conversation with her obtained her leave to demand her of her mother to whom he showed the writings which were already all drawn and by which sophia had a jointure and pinmoney equal to the settlements that had been made upon lady stanley  he now ventured to entreat that a short day might be fixed for their marriage it was with great difficulty that sophia was prevailed upon to consent but her mothers impetuosity carried all before it and mr herbert himself supported the young baronets request  the ceremony was performed by mr lawson in his own parish church after which he and his amiable family accompanied the new wedded pair to their countryseat where they passed several days with them  mr herbert having previously acquainted sir charles with harriots situation the baronet though he detested her character and declared he never could pardon her for the miseries she had caused him yet was desirous to have her decently settled and promised to give a thousand pounds with her in marriage if a reputable match could be found for her he even put notes for that sum into mr herberts hands and earnestly recommended it to him to take the affair under his management  harriot during the time she lived with her mother had been courted by a young tradesman in tolerable circumstances and although she thought it great insolence for a person in business to pretend to her yet actuated by a true spirit of coquetry while she despised the lover she took pleasure in his addresses  this young man still retained some tenderness for her and allured by the prospect of a fortune was willing notwithstanding any faults in her conduct to make her his wife  mrs darnley proposed him to her and mr herbert enforced her advice with all the good sense he was master of but harriot received the proposal with the utmost disdain insisted that she was married as well as her sister that her rank in life was superior to hers and added by way of threat that her appearance should be so likewise  the extraordinary efforts she made to support this boast engaged lord l in expenses that entirely alienated his affections from her disgusted as he long had been with her insolence and folly  his relations concluded a match for him with a young lady of suitable rank and fortune and after making a small settlement on harriot he took leave of her for ever  the vexation she felt from this incident threw her into a distemper very fatal to beauty the yellow jaundice made such ravage in her face that scarce any of those charms on which she had valued herself so much remained all her anxious hours were now employed in repairing her complexion and in vain endeavors to restore luster to those eyes sunk in hollowness and tinctured with the hue of her distemper  although thus altered the report of the fortune she was likely to have made her be thought a prize worthy the ambition of a young officer who had quitted the business of a peruke maker in which he was bred for an ensigns commission which made him a gentleman at once  he offered himself to harriot with that assurance of success which the gaiety of his appearance and his title of captain gave him reason to expect with a lady of her turn of mind  harriot charmed with so important a conquest soon consented to give him her hand and sir charles stanley finding his character not exceptionable gave her the fortune he had promised to which sophia generously added a thousand pounds more the baronet procured her husband a better commission but designedly in one of the colonies whither he insisted upon his wifes accompanying him  harriot in despair at being obliged to quit the delights of london soon began to hate her husband heartily and he entering into her disposition and character lost all esteem and tenderness for her her behavior justified the rigid confinement he kept her in and while she suffered all the restraint of jealousy she was at the same time mortified with the knowledge that pride and not love was the source of it  mrs darnley lived not long after the departure of her favorite daughter for so harriot always continued to be  sophia attended her mother during her long illness with the most duteous care and had the satisfaction to be assured by mr lawson who assisted her in her preparations for death that her attachment to the world which the affluent circumstances to which she was raised but too much increased had at length given way to more pious sentiments and she died with the resignation of a christian  the ill conduct of her sister and the death of her mother proved at first some interruption to sophias happiness but these domestic storms blown over she began to taste the good fortune which heaven had bestowed on her her chief enjoyment of it was to share it with others and sir charles who adored her put it amply in her power to indulge the benevolence of her disposition  he took upon himself the care of rewarding her friends he presented mr lawson to a very considerable living he procured dollys husband a genteel and lucrative employment and married her sister to a relation of his own  mr herbert who was above receiving any other gratification from sir charles than the entire friendship which he ever preserved for him had the satisfaction to spend most part of his time with his beloved daughter as he used tenderly to call sophia and to behold her as happy as the condition of mortality admits of  sir charless tenderness for her seemed to increase every day and when mr herbert some years after this marriage took occasion to compliment him upon the delicacy the ardor and the constancy of his affection he replied you attribute to me a virtue which in this case i cannot be said to possess had my passion for my sophia been founded only on the charms of her person i might probably ere now have become a mere fashionable husband but her virtue and wit supply her with graces ever varied and ever new thus the steadiness of my affection for her pursued he smiling is but a constant inconstancy which attaches me successively to one or other of those shining qualities of which her charming mind is an inexhaustible source  finis
