an essay on the manners and genius of the literary character  by i disraeli  london printed for t cadell junr and w davies       entered at stationers hall  preface i present the reader with an imperfect attempt on an important topic the materials designed for this essay with others have been accidentally destroyed the following sketches are therefore not so numerous as i could wish and as the subject appears to promise they claim all the indulgence of the title  i have long considered what i imagine will be readily acknowledged that there is a similarity in the characters of men of genius perceivable to a contemplative mind and that reflections on their character may be exemplified by a sufficient number of facts to seize the dispositions of the literary character i looked therefore into literary history and my collections exceeded my hopes  when rousseau composed his dissertation on the equality of man this eloquent philosopher sought for facts on which to found his reasonings these he collected from an extensive perusal of voyages and accounts of remote nations i considered that to form just reflections on men of genius it was proper to collect facts from their biography and their concatenation produced all my reflections  the more i meditate the more i am persuaded that all speculations are illusory and unsatisfactory unless they are established on prominent facts which are to be first collected before we venture to indulge metaphysical disquisitions it is an observation of bolingbroke that abstract or general propositions though never so true appear obscure or doubtful to us very often till they are explained by examples  when examples are pointed out to us there is a kind of appeal with which we are flattered made to our senses as well as our understandings the instruction comes then from our authority we yield to fact when we resist speculation if we compare the labors of machiavel with those of montesquieu we may observe that the illustrious frenchman had all the delicacy the refinement and the sensibility of his nation and his general reflections are therefore brilliant but often fallacious because not built on the permanent base of experience the crafty florentine versant in the manners of princes with sagacity equal to his genius deduces all his reflections from those prominent facts which passed under his eye or which he collected from the records of instructive history lord bacon introduced that wise philosophy which is only founded on experiments the study of nature in her operations and i believe every judicious physician prefers the manner of sydenham who derives his medical fame from the vigilant observation and the continued experience of tracing the progress of actual cases in the operation of actual remedies to that of some modern medical writers who dazzled by speculative phantoms promulge paradoxes which unconfirmed by facts produce much more serious consequence than literary paradoxes the readers of a dissertation on anecdotes will please to accept these observations as a final supplement to that tract   the literary character has in the present day singularly degenerated in the public mind the finest compositions appear without exciting any alarm of admiration they are read approved and succeeded by others nor is the presence of the author considered as formerly as conferring honor on his companions we pass our evenings sometimes with poets and historians whom it is probable will be admired by posterity with hardly any other sensation than we feel from inferior associates  the youth who has more reading than experience and a finer imagination than a sound logic will often be surprised when he compares the splendid facts stored in his memory with the ordinary circumstances that pass under his eye in the history of all ages and of all nations he observes the highest honors paid to the literary character statues tombs festivals and coronations crowd in glittering confusion while when he condescends to look around him he perceives the brilliant enchantment dissolved and not a vestige remains of the festivals and the coronations  before i attempt to allege a reason for a singular revolution in the human mind i shall arrange a few striking facts of the numerous honors which have been paid to the literary character  i must not dwell on the distinctions bestowed on the learned by the greeks and the romans their temples their statues their games and fleets dispatched to invite the student these honors were more numerous and splendid than those of modern ages i must not detail the magnificent rewards and the high veneration paid by the persians the turks the arabians the chinese etc the persian ferdosi received sacks of gold for his verses the arabs have sent ambassadors to congratulate poets on the success of their works mahomet took off his mantle to present to an author and literature in china confers nobility but i pass this romantic celebrity to throw a rapid glance on our own europe  not to commence more remotely than at the thirteenth century when nobles and even kings aspired to literature authors of course were held in the highest estimation fauchet and pasquier inform us that the learned received magnificent dresses steeds richly caparisoned and arms resplendent with diamonds and gold the floral games at toulouse were established and three prizes of golden flowers were reserved for the happy poets it was in the fourteenth century that the italians raised triumphal arches tombs and coronations for distinguished authors ravenna erected a marble tomb to the memory of dante certaldo a statue to boccaccio and petrarch was at once invited by the city of rome and the court of france to receive the crown of laurel rome was preferred and there he was publicly crowned with such magnificence of pomp and ceremonies so splendid and numerous that his own imagination could not have surpassed the realities of this triumph i lament much that dr burney whose learning excels my praise and whose elegance is not inferior to his learning has treated this subject with great levity he says in his valuable history of music vol   p     that this was a censureable vanity  and that the blame can only be laid on his youth or rather on the practice of the times and he continues in a strain of ridicule to censure these testimonies of national sensibility but i observe that the learned doctor while he smiles at this popular display and vanity has prefixed to his performance his own portrait in what some may consider the affected posture of beating time painted by reynolds and engraved by bartolozzi the doctor makes an animated appearance but this public exhibition of burney has not less vanity than that of petrarch must not we apply to the doctor his own words and lay the blame on his youth or rather on the practice of the times  the error of dr burney in this instance proceeds from his not confessing that there was no vanity in the coronation of petrarch for the love of glory is something very superior to vanity   tasso died the evening of his coronation in the fifteenth century sannazarius received from the venetians for six verses six hundred pistoles and poets were kissed by princesses later times saw the phlegmatic hollander raise astatue to the excellent erasmus let us not omit that charles ix of france reserved apartments in his palace and even wrote a poetical epistle to ronsard and baif received a silver image of minerva from his native city charles v and francis i in the sixteenth century poured honors preferments and gifts on the learned of their age literary merit was the road to promotion and seignories and abbeys seats in the state council and ambassadorships were bestowed upon the literary character  since all this is truth yet at present appears much like fiction it may be enquired if our ancestors were wiser than we or we more wise than our ancestors  it is to be recollected that before the art of printing existed great authors were like their works very rare learning was then only obtained by the devotion of a life it was long after the art of multiplying works at pleasure was discovered that the people were capable of participating in the novel benefit what alexander feared when he reproached aristotle for rendering learning popular has happened to modern literature learning and talents have ceased to be learning and talents by an universal diffusion of books and a continued exercise of the mind authors became numerous but as the body of the people till within the present century was sufficiently unenlightened their numbers were not yet found inconvenient and as dictionaries were not yet formed every man was happy to seize on whatever particles of knowledge accident offered so late as the middle of this century translators were yet esteemed and compilers were yet respected  but since with incessant industry volumes have been multiplied and their prices rendered them accessible to the lowest artisans the literary character has gradually fallen into disrepute it may be urged that a superior mind long cultivated and long exercised adorned with polite and enriched with solid letters must still retain it is preeminence among the inferior ranks of men and therefore may still exact the same respect from his fellowcitizens and still continue the dignity of an author with the same just claims as in preceding ages  i believe however that he who would be reverenced as an author has only one resource and that is by paying to himself that reverence which will be refused by the multitude the respect which the higher classes show to the literary character proceeds from habitual politeness and not from any sensibility of admiration and that this is true appears from this circumstance that should the literary character in return refuse to accommodate himself to their regulations and have not the art of discovering what quality they expect to be remarked in themselves he will be soon forsaken and he may say what socrates did at the court of cyprus what i know is not proper for this place and what is proper for this place i know not men of the world are curious to have a glance at a celebrated author as they would be at some uncommon animal he is therefore sometimes exhibited and spectators are invited a crowd of frivolists gaze at a man of letters and catch the sounds of his ideas as children regard the reflections of a magic lanthorn the observation of the great erasmus on men of letters is not less just than admirable he said that they were like the great figures in the tapestries of flanders which lose their effect when not seen at a distance   nor will the literary character find a happier reception among others if he exacts an observance of his dignity authors are a multitude and it requires no inconsiderable leisure and intelligence to adjust the claims of such numerous candidates  de foe called the last age the age of projectors and johnson has called the present the age of authors but there is this difference between them the epidemical folly of projecting in time cures itself for men become weary with ruination but writing is an interminable pursuit and the raptures of publication have a great chance of becoming a permanent fashion when i reflect that every literary journal consists of  0 or  0 publications and that of these   or   at least are capital performances and the greater part not contemptible when i take the pen and attempt to calculate by these given sums the number of volumes which the next century must infallibly produce my feeble faculties wander in a perplexed series and as i lose myself among billions trillions and quartillions i am obliged to lay down my pen and stop at infinity  where all this will end god only knows is the reflection of a grave historian in concluding the memoirs of his age nature has no doubt provided some concealed remedy for this future universal deluge perhaps in the progress of science some new senses may be discovered in the human character and this superfluity of knowledge may be essential to the understanding we are considerably indebted doubtless to the patriotic endeavors of our grocers and trunkmakers whom i respect as the alchemists of literature they annihilate the gross bodies without injuring the finer spirits  we are however sincerely to lament that the dignity of great authors is at all impaired every kind of writers find a correspondent kind of readers and the illiterate have their admirers and are of some use but it is time that we should distinguish between authors and submit ourselves to respect those from whom we acquire instruction and to cherish those from whom we derive the most elegant of our amusements  contents chap i of literary men page   chap ii of authors page   chap iii of men of letters page    chap iv on some characteristics of a youth of genius page

student of taste p     the county of essex was distinguished by the romans by the name of tribonantes and it was in this province that seneca oppressed the inhabitants with the loan of immense sums at an immense interest p     i omitted to observe that the impiety of satan has actually been censured by clarke johnson even applauds the observation of our divine i transcribe that great biographers words for there are thoughts as he clarke justly remarks which no observation of character can justify because no good man would willingly permit them to pass however transiently through his own mind here we observe two of our most profound thinkers deciding on a subject of taste but their edict i presume is antipoetical their piety was too ponderous for the exertion of their fancy the divinity of clarke and the logic of johnson were alike fatal to certain delicious strokes in the arts of fancy the most subtle particles of poetical refinement escaped their unelastic organs and fell on the

essay etc chap i of literary men a numerous and an important body of men diffused over enlightened europe and classed under no particular profession are during the most arduous period of their life unassisted and unregarded and while often devoting them selves to national purposes are exposed not only to poverty the fate of the many to calumny the portion of the great but to an ugly family of peculiar misfortunes these are men of letters men whose particular genius often becomes that of a people the sovereigns of reason the legislators of morality the artificers of our most exquisite pleasures  every other body of ingenious men whether the corporation of useful mechanics or the society of great artists are allowed some common association some domestic seat devoted to the genius of their profession where they are mutually enlightened and consoled men of letters in our country resemble houseless wanderers scattered and solitary disunited and languid whose talents are frequently unknown to their companions and by the inertness of an unhappy situation often unperceived by themselves  it is remarkable that those men in the nation who are most familiar with each others conceptions and most capable of reciprocal esteem are those who are often most estranged  chap ii of authors it is necessary to distinguish between an author and a writer because the descriptions which i propose to sketch of the situations to which genius is frequently exposed will not happen to those whose productions are their occasional effusions and who seldom propose in the puerile age to become authors i shall consider that no writer has a just claim to the title of author whose chief employment is not that of study and composition richardson the novelist and gessner the poet were both printers and this will occasionally exclude them from the idea i at present attach to an author hume and bail johnson and voltaire are students who assumed the profession of authors the occasional productions of a man of genius are so many sportive offerings laid on the altar of the graces the more voluminous labors of great authors are so many trophies raised on a triumphal column  i totally exclude from these speculations two kinds of writers those who disgrace letters and humanity by an abject devotion to their private interests and who like atalanta for the sake of the apples of gold lose the glory of the race and those who intrude on the public notice without adequate talents whose vanity listens to a few encomiasts whose politeness is greater than their discernment or who applaud loudly and censure in whispers  if we enquire into the character of an author we find that every class of men entertains a different notion of his occupations we perceive also that the literary world are divided into parties and that they are mutually unjust few are capable of honoring this character individuals err from various motives the public only are enlightened and just  the importance of an author in society is yet so little known that it is rarely apparent even to authors themselves  the fashionable circle conceive an author must be an amusing companion they consider his presence like the other ornaments of their tables it implies that they are persons of taste  the busy part of mankind suppose an author to be a trader and are only astonished to observe men persevere in an occupation so unprofitable  the statesman only regards a philosophical writer as a man of dangerous speculations who if left in security is daring if attacked by persecution is intrepid one who makes him tremble in the darkness of his most secret councils  the man of science regards his productions with contempt and at the most favorable view only as so many amusing futilities he marks his superior success with a jealous eye and complains of a frivolous public a geometrician can draw no deductions and sees nothing proved by the finest verses of a poet an antiquary marvels that an elegant historian should be preferred to a chronologer and a metaphysician wonders at the delight communicated by faithful representations of human life written by one whom he thinks incapable of comprehending a page of lock  it will surprise the young and virtuous reader when i must also add that the character is sometimes considered as a kind of disgrace to excel in those accomplishments which enlighten or amuse a polished people has ceased to be a merit with some because of the numerous claimants for this honor but it is with authors as with those military fops who frequent the theaters and assume with their cockade the title of captain enquire and you find that the obstreperous gentleman has been only an ensign for a week and often that he has no claims at all to the borrowed cockade thus with authors if the pretenders are discerned and the ranks distinguished a man will reduce the number to a very inconsiderable portion of a numerous acquaintance every one who prints a book is not an author publication is the test of literature and there are an infinite number of works which are printed but which all the inventive industry of the author could never publish  many of that class of society whose entire nights are rotations of inanity and whose days are too short for necessary repose blush for a friend who is an author and as the daughter of addison was taught despise even a parent who had given to a fashionable and unworthy woman an illustrious name these are they who gaze in the silence of stupidity when an unusual topic glides into conversation and will pardon any species of rudeness sooner than that of good sense  others know themselves incapacitated to become authors and ficken at the recollection of their abortions literary seize are depreciated to console their deficiencies as bankrupts out of mere envy calumniate the successful merchant  there is however a race of ingenious men who derive their merit and their fortune from their studies and yet contemn literature and literary men this is a paradox of the heart of which the solution may appear difficult adrian vi obtained the pontificate as the reward of his learning and men of letters indulged the most golden hopes at his accession but on the contrary he contemned literature and persecuted students a living orator whose chief merit consists in his literary powers it has been said performs in the present day the part of adrian such men treat science as a barbarous son who spurns at that parent the milk of whose bosom nurtured him in infancy and whose hand supported him in youth a literary friend observes that the pope feared lest men of letters might shake the pontificate and the orator lest they might detect the errors of his politics an observation which shows the political influence of authors  those to whom nature has bestowed callous organs and who are really insensible to the charms of fancy or the force of reason we pardon imbecility must be accepted as an apology for errors since it often is for crimes  how hard is the fate of the author who when he once publishes becomes in the minds of all whatever they choose to make him  chap iii of men of letters we distinguish two kinds of men of letters both alike make their principal occupation to consist in study but the one are induced from many concurring circumstances not to publish their labors and the other devote their life to communicate their speculations to the world few men of letters reject the honors of an author out of modesty but some are inert through terror and some through ease the french rich in expressions relative to polite letters distinguish these learned and tranquil students by the happy title of litterateurs  the popular notion of a man of letters is as unsettled as unjust it is supposed that because a tailor makes a fashionable coat and a builder erects a house according to modern taste a man of letters must therefore produce a book adapted to the reigning mode it is not necessary that every man of letters should become an author though it is the indispensible duty of an author to be a man of letters some suppose that it is sufficient when they commence authors to study what they write it would be advantageous if we write also what we study for without learning few works are valuable and he who employs not a useful cement will see his brilliant edifice scattered by the winds in shining fragments  the man of letters is in general a more amiable character than the author his passions are more ferene his studies more regular his solitude more soothing he encounters no concealed or public enemy and his tranquillity is not a feather in the popular gale every discovery he makes is a happy conquest every charm of taste a silent enjoyment  nor are such characters as the multitude imagine unuseful in the republic of letters to the elegant leisure of these students we are indebted for many of the ornaments of literature and authors themselves have recourse to these sages as their conductors and sometimes as their patrons these men of letters like guides over the alps though no travelers themselves warn the adventurous explorer of impending danger and instruct him in his passage  no literary character is more frequently amiable than such a man of letters the occupations he has chosen are justly called the studies of humanity and they communicate to his manners his understanding and his heart that refined amenity that lively sensibility and that luminous acuteness which flow from a cultivated taste he is an enthusiast but an enthusiast for elegance he loves literature like virtue for the harmony it diffuses over the passions and perceives that like religion it has the singular art of communicating with an unknown and future state for the love of posterity is cherished by these men of letters and though they want the energy of genius to address the public often for that public they labor in silence it is they who form public libraries father neglected and nurture infant genius project and support benevolent institutions and pour out the philanthropy of their heart in that world which they appear to have forsaken  their mild dispositions first led them into the province of literature they found in books an occupation congenial to their sentiments labor without fatigue repose with activity an employment interrupted without inconvenience and exhaustless without satiety they remain ever attached to their studies for to give a new direction to life would require a vast effort and of exertion they are incapable their library and their chamber are contiguous and often in this contracted space does the opulent owner consume his delicious hours  his pursuits are ever changing and he enlivens the austere by the lighter studies it was said of a great hunter that he did not live but hunted and it may be said of the man of letters that he does not live but meditates he feels that pleasing anxiety which zests desire arising from irritative curiosity and he is that happy man who creates hourly wants and enjoys the voluptuousness of immediate gratification the world pity the man of letters inhumed among his books and their mistaken wit inscribes on his door here lies the body of our friend yet unthinking men are not without excuse his pleasures are silent and concealed whatever is not tranquil alarms whatever is serene attracts he therefore becomes a mecenas but never a virgil protects letters but never composes books a lover of art but never an artist  these men of letters form penetrating critics whose taste is habitual and whose touch is firm and unerring criticism is happily adapted to their powers of action because in criticism they partake of the pleasures of genius without the painful exertion of invention and as they are incapable of exerting invention and direct their studies to form and polish judgment this latter faculty is often more cultivated and more vigorous than even that of men of genius few writers attain to any perfection unassisted by such a connoisseur the vivacity and enthusiasm of genius are indulged often in violations of delicacy and truth and what the author wants is precisely what this critic can alone give it is not to be doubted that the familiar acquaintance which existed between racine boileau and moliere was most precious to them we know that they communicated their arts of composition and stood sentinels over each other with the severest and most vigilant eye hence that equable power and finished elegance which distinguish their productions  corneille who associated with neither and like a sultan would inspire awe by concealing himself in solitary grandeur lost these invaluable conferences and indulged genius careless of the rasures of taste hence his gross defects and irregularities in england where such an union has been rare we can trace the same effects pope swift and bolingbroke were of mutual advantage pope had not been a philosopher without the aid of bolingbroke and swift an inferior poet without the salutary counsels of pope milton severed from all literary friends has left in his sublime epics too many traces of this separation and it may be said that his greatest works contain his greatest blemishes in the finished pieces of his youth when he had a critical eye at every hour on every page we find no want of corrective touches churchill a great and irregular genius with such friends had not only left his fatires more terfe and more harmohious but had been incapable in his feeblest hours to have so frequently composed such a series of unconnected and prosaic rhimes  often by an excellent discernment these critics give a happy direction to the powers of a young writer such was the observation of walsh whose advice to pope that correctness in our poetry was the only means which remained to distinguish himself animated the poet to form that prominent and beautiful feature in his poetical character  to prove their great utility to men of genius the following instance may serve not always he whose abilities are capable of adorning the page of history is alike capable of discovering the hidden and perplexed tracks of learned research men of genius rarely read catalogues to whom is the philosophic writer of modern history to have recourse but to such a man of letters when robertson proposed writing his various histories he was ignorant of his subject and irresolute in his designs we had nearly lost his elegant compositions he confessed in letters which i have seen addressed to dr birch that he had never access to copious libraries nor an extensive knowledge of authors dr birch who was an admirable litterateur in his answer has given a copious and critical catalogue of proper authors accompanied by valuable information which is acknowledged by our elegant historian with warmth it was certainly that kind of necessary knowledge which only the learning of our scholar could supply and without which the project of robertsons histories must have perished in the conception these students are therefore useful members in the republic of letters and may be compared to those subterraneous streams which flow into spacious lakes and which though they flow invisibly enlarge the waters which attract the public eye  sometimes these men of letters distinguish themselves by their productions but though these may be excellent they always rank in the inferior departments of literature and they rarely occupy more than the first place in the second class their works are finished compositions of taste or eccentric researches of curiosity seldom the fervid labors of high invention they are ingenious men not men of genius if they pour forth their effusions in verse we may have some delicate opuscula elaborate beauties but not of an original kind such are many of our minor poets distinguished for the refinements but not the powers of their art they may excel in happy versions of a classic of which we have many admirable proofs their inquiries may be learned the fruits of incessant labor and long leisure and they sometimes choose for their dissertations sertations uncommon topics these they treat often with ingenuity but chiefly enchant by a seductive manner they have a certain glow like a gentle and regular fire but which never flashes and flames like a powerful inventive mind it is rather the fire raised in a forge than bursting from a natural volcano such writers are the authors of those little essays which are precious to men of taste on painting and on poetry on beauty and on deformity elegant minds that imbue with elegance light subjects their strokes are not continued and grand but occasional and brilliant and if they rarely excite admiration by new combinations of reflection or imagery often paint with a mellow warmth the beauty of sentiment in such attempts they succeed because they select their subject with the fondness of a lover and are familiar with its reserved graces when unfortunately they attempt higher topics which require elevated conceptions and fervid genius we perceive their feeble energies such writers like the lark must only rise on a playful wing and resound their favorite notes but a man of genius like a hawk elevates himself to discover the country and to dart on his prey  we shall elucidate these reflections by the character of m sacy he was modest ingenious and sensitive he cultivated his talents with ardour and soothed the labors of the bar with the studies of polite letters he gave a version of pliny which has not injured the delicacy of the original admitted to the circle of the marchioness de lambert he enjoyed the familiarity of men of genius and by the sensibility of his heart engaged the affections of the marchioness more forcibly than even the genius of superior minds animated by his social enjoyments he wrote with amenity an interesting essay on friendship in this he succeeded for no mind could be more susceptible to it is soft and domestic raptures he afterward composed an essay on glory but here he did not succeed a man of genius alone can write on such a topic it requires a mind that expands from the limits of a family to a nation from a nation to the world from the world to posterity vast and gigantic operation of the soul this is no tranquil sentiment of taste but an impetuous passion of genius a cicero not a sacy should have written on glory but cicero did not feel more exquisitely than the amiable sacy on the subject of friendship  chap iv on some characteristics of a youth of genius i propose to sketch some of the misfortunes which often attend a writer or an artist should my picture prove to be a faithful representation my feelings will dispose me to lament my talent  to what an unknown height might an adequate education elevate the human character if it were possible at his birth to detect the future genius the ostrich has the sagacity to discover in it is eggs those which are worthy of her genial warmth and separates them from the rest which would have proved sterile to the solicitous cares of a mother it is not thus with the human race if we could perceive the man of genius in the natal hour we might select him from the crowd and nourish the giant with the aliment a giant may be supposed to require at the age of twenty his maturity would appear and he would have performed at thirty whatever a horace or a livy have done while the vigor of life yet remained to show us something more exquisite in fancy and more complicate yet clear in reasoning than at present we can possibly conceive but alas it is only the romantic eye of the poet which can observe the graces wreathing his cradle with myrtles i quit my fantastic man of genius to descend to nature and to experience  it is rather singular that none but princes and monsters have the privilege or exciting public curiosity at their birth a man of genius is dropped among the people and has first to encounter the difficulties of ordinary men without that confined talent which is adapted to a mean destimation parents of honest dispositions are the victims of the determined propensity of a son to a virgil or an euclid and the first step into life of a man of genius is disobedience and grief  the frequent situation of such a man is described with great simplicity by the astrologer lilly whether he were a man of genius or not in the curious memoirs of his life he there tells us that having proposed to his father that he should try his fortune in london where he hoped his learning and his talents might prove serviceable to him he observes that his father who was incapable of discovering his latent genius in his studious dispositions very willingly consented to get rid of him for i could not work drive the plough or endure any country labor my father often would say i was good for nothing  the fathers of most of our men of genius have employed the same expressions as the father of lilly  an apparent indolence hangs about contemplative genius he loves the repose of the body and the activity of the mind it is known that most men of great abilities in their puerile days have retired from the sports of their mates and while they were folded up in their little wild abstractions have appeared dull to dunces we often hear from the early companions or intimates of a man of genius that at school he had been remarkably heavy and unpromising but in truth he was only remarkably pensive and often pertinaciously assiduous the great bossuet at school would never join with his young companions but preferred plodding over a book  they revenged themselves by a boyish jest of calling him bos suetus aratro an ox daily toiling in the plough it is curious to observe that the young painters to ridicule the constant labors of domenichino in his youth did him the honor to distinguish him also by the title of great ox chatterton offers still a better though a more melancholy instance it is in this manner that one man of genius generally resembles another  this inaction of body and activity of mind they retain throughout life a man of genius is rarely enamoured of common amusements and the boy who was unadroit at marbles and refused scaling the wall of an orchard when a man seldom excels as an agile hunter or an elegant dancer i am describing the enthusiasm of talent not it is uninteresting mediocrity a man of genius is the surest testimony on this point let us attend to the minstrel of dr beattie concourse and noise and toil he ever fled nor cared to mingle in the clamorous fray of squabbling imps but to the forest sped the exploit of strength dexterity or speed to him nor vanity nor joy could bring would edwin this majestic scene resign for aught the huntsmans puny craft supplies i repeat his mind alone has activity  the fire side in the winter and some favorite tree in the summer will be his seats his amusements become studies and his meditations are made in his walks as well as in his chair these are some of the marks which distinguish him from the man of the world  we have been able to discover this disposition in youthful genius the same characterises his age it was thus when mecenas accompanied by virgil and horace retired one day into the country the minister amused himself with a tennisball the two poets reposed on a vernal bank beneath a delicious shade pliny was pleased with the roman mode of hunting which admitted him to sit a whole day with his tablets and stylus that he says if i return with empty nets my tablets may at least be full  among the inauspicious circumstances which frequently attend the first exertions of juvenile genius is the want of sensibility and discernment in the literary man or artist whose regard and counsels he solicits remote from the world of taste he cultivates with ardour but not with art talents which tremble in the feebleness of infancy when the intellectual offspring is struggling with pain and fear into existence the hand that should aid it is delivery repels with an unnatural barbarity as churchill says they crush a bard just bursting from the shell in these wild hours of youth and fancy the juvenile writer roves like an insulated wanderer thrown on an enchanted isle his ear listens with an artless impatience for the celestial tones of an ariel it is his unhappy fate to encounter a brutal and malicious caliban such has been the situation of several men of genius when they first addressed themselves to an unworthy man of letters for their protector  another unfriendly influence over young genius is the want of discernment in those who have the direction of their talents pope was often heard to say that he could learn nothing from his masters for they wanted sagacity to discover the bent of his genius and the preceptors of thomson reprimanded the poet for being too poetical in some of his exercises the judicious quintilian observes that it is not sufficient that a master instructs his scholars in science but he should also cultivate those particular good qualities nature has bestowed on each to add to those which are deficient to correct some and to change others  it is a melancholy truth that the period at which men receive the color of their life is that which is generally least regarded when we most want judgment we have none and age is often passed only in lamentations over youth the eventful moment which determines our future years is mingled and lost among hours which cannot be recalled physicians tell us that there is a certain point in youth at which our constitution takes it is form and on which the sanity of life revolves the existence of genius experiences a similar dangerous moment taste erroneously directed or genius unsubdued feebleness not invigorated or vigor not softened are the accidents which render even a superior mind defective in it is best performances children by the negligence of their parents become ricketty and all their life retain some trace of the unhappy distortion of their limbs the predominant blemishes of an author if enquired into will be found generally to originate in their indulgence at a time when they wanted a quintilian to deter them by exercising some contrary quality to that of which they were vitiously enamoured the epigrammatic points and swelling thoughts of young the remote conceits of cowley and the turgidity of johnson might probably have been avoided by their authors had the bent of their mind at an early period been molded by a critic hand few literary vices are radical unless permitted to strike deeply in the soil oaks are but saplings till they are suffered to become oaks  the peculiarities of genius are often derived from local habits or accidental circumstances and this remark shows the unwearied vigilance necessary to be observed in the progress and formation of genius rembrandt is one instance his peculiarity of shade was derived from the circumstance of his fathers mill receiving light from an aperture at the top which habituated him afterward to that singular manner of broad shades the same analogy may be traced in the human intellect a man of genius is often determined to shape his mind into a particular form by the books of his youth dr franklin tells us that when young and wanting books he accidentally found de foes essay on projects from which work he thinks impressions were derived that afterward influenced some of the principal events of his life it was by a studious perusal of plutarchs illustrious men that rousseau received that grandeur of sentiment which distinguishes all his compositions and created him that romantic and sensitive being he ever remained  if we except some rare instances no writer can display his talents so indisputably that the world shall be conscious of his exalted genius at an early period du bos and helvetius have fixed that great hour in the short day of man about the age of thirty and i recollect an old spanish writer lays it down as an axiom that no author should publish a book under the age of thirtyfive it is certain that many of our first geniuses have not evinced their abilities till forty some indeed spring suddenly like a flower while others expand gradually like a tree some are like diamonds which receive their fine polish from an elaborate art while others resemble pearls which are born with their beautiful luster  is it enquired if during this long period a man of genius does not give some evident marks of his future powers i answer that sometimes he does sometimes he does not and sometimes they are dubious they are frequently dubious because the grossest pedant attends to his studies if not with the same affection at least with as much constancy as the finest genius who can distinguish between pertinacity and genius it is perhaps impossible to know if a young student will be a compiler or an historian  the first effusions of a man of genius may be so rude as were those of swift and dryden that no reasonable hope can be formed of his happy progress the juvenile productions of many great writers evince nothing of that perfection they afterward obtained and probably raphael when he first shadowed his rude man on his fathers earthenware had not one stroke of that ideal beauty which one day his head was to conceive and his hand to attempt  sometimes a superior mind gives no evidence of it is great powers genius may like aeneas be veiled by a cloud and remain unperceived even by it is associates as in the case of goldsmith whom even his literary companions regarded as a compiler not as a writer of taste hume was considered for his sobriety and assiduity as capable of becoming a good merchant of johnson it was said that he would never offend in conversation and of boileau that he had no great understanding but would speak ill of no one farquhar who afterward joined to great knowledge of the world the liveliest talents was at college a heavy companion and unreasonably dull these from numerous instances will be sufficient again when a superior mind evinces it is early genius it is not always done with all it is energy we have several who began versifiers and concluded poets  it happens however that sometimes genius unequivocally discovers itself in the puerile age some appear to have meditated on the art they love on the bosom of their nurse and they are painters and poets before they know the names of their colors and the fabric of their verse michael angelo as yet a child wherever he went employed himself in drawing which so much alarmed his noble parents who were fearful their family might be dishonored by a man of genius that they mingled castigations with their reprimands angelo relinquished the pencil but it was only to take the brush when he attempted statuary his father blushed to think his son was a stonecutter angelo persisted and became a great man in opposition to his noble progenitors velasquez a spanish painter when he performed his school tasks filled them with sketches and drawings and as some write their names on their books his were known by exhibiting specimens of his genius  an observation may be introduced here which is due to the parents of a man of genius  we never read the biography of a great character whether he excelled in letters or the fine arts without reprobating the domestic persecution of those who opposed his inclinations and endeavored to unfeather the tender pinion of juvenile genius no poet but is roused with indignation at the recollection of the port royal society thrice burning the poetical romance which racine at length got by heart no geometrician but bitterly criminates the father of pascal for not suffering him to read euclid which he at length understood without reading no painter but execrates the parents of angelo for snatching the pencil from his hand though at length he became superior to every artist all this is unjust  let us place ourselves in the situation of a parent of a man of genius and we shall find another association of ideas concerning him than those we have at present we see a great man they a disobedient child we see genius they obstinacy the career of genius is rarely that of fortune and very often that of contempt even in it is most flattering aspect what is it but plucking a few brilliant flowers from precipices while the reward terminates in the honor the anxious parent is more desirous of his sons cultivating the lowlands where industry may reap in silent peace no precarious harvest but i even confess that many parents are themselves not so insensible to glory but that they would prefer a splendid poverty to an obscure opulence but who is to be certain that a young man is obeying the solicitation of true genius or merely the fondness for an art in which he must never be an artist literary men themselves frequently are averse to encourage the literary dispositions of their children  it is certain that a love for any art in youth is no evidence of genius the casual perusal of spenser which might produce a cowley has no doubt given birth to a crowd of unknown poets we have a considerable number of minor artists of all kinds who never attain to any degree of eminence and yet in their youth felt a warm inclination for their art if the impulse of genius and the perseverance of desire if conception and imitation could ever be accurately distinguished in the philosophy of the mind it would be one of the most useful of metaphysical speculations but philosophers have not yet agreed of the nature of genius for while some conceive it to be a gift others think it an acquisition  we now proceed to some reflections on the friends of youthful genius  the friends of a young writer are generally prejudicial to find a sage quintilian in a private circle is as rare as to discover a silver mine in devonshire it is supposed there are several but it is difficult to know where nature has placed them it is a duty i owe as an individual not to pass over in silence the mention of devonshire which i have long considered as the classical county of england it has it is poets and it is antiquaries it is musicians and it is painters there is perhaps in consequence that diffusion of urbanity in the manners of many of it is chief inhabitants which graces enlightened opulence devonshire has produced more illustrious characters than i believe any other county a montesquien and a du bos would attribute this to the felicity of the climate where myrtles grow unsheltered in the open air and perhaps the air which cherishes myrtles in our northern clime may have no inconsiderable effect on men the speculation may not be merely fanciful here the earth displays a more luxuriant herbage on a softer mould the skies a brighter azure and the airs blow with what poets call the silkysoft favonian gale young a devonshire poet is the only english bard who has a right to transpose the epithets of virgil in his descriptions of spring it is a soil favorable to myrtles and artists     we may observe that the productions of taste are much more unfortunate than those of reasoning every man has a tolerable degree of judgment and with a slight exertion atchieves the comprehension of a piece of argument but taste is of such rarity that a long life may be passed by some without ever meeting with a person of that cultured and sure taste which can touch and feel the public opinion before the public forms it is opinion  when a young writers first essay is shown some through mere inability of censure see nothing but beauties others with equal imbecility can see none and others out of pure malice see nothing but faults few great writers have been born in that fortunate and rare circle where every man has taste and some have candor a young writer if he suffers his mind to float from uncertainty to uncertainty will only lose many years before he discovers the imbecility and defective taste of the narrow circle of his critics  a young artist must banish despondence even in the rudest efforts of art he must obey the fervid impulse at the cost of the pleasures of his age and the contempt of his associates it may also be no improper habit to preserve his juvenile compositions by contemplating them he may perceive some of his predominant errors reflect on the gradual corrections resume an old manner more happily invent a new one from the old he had neglected and often may find something so fine among his most irregular productions that it may serve to embellish his most finished compositions i cannot but apply to this subject a happy simile of dryden which a young writer in the progress of his studies should often recollect as those who unripe veins in mines explore on the rich bed again the warm turf lay till time digests the yet imperfect ore and knows it will be gold another day   let him therefore at once supply the marble and be himself the sculptor he must learn to hew out to form and to polish his genius he must appeal from a contracted circle to the public and throughout life must hold this as a maxim if he would preserve the necessary tranquillity to pursue his studies that the opinion of an individual must be accounted as nothing not even if this opinion should appear in print helvetius justly observes what does the opinion of any individual mean only that if favorable he entertains the same ideas as myself and if unfavourable that we differ  who but the public can arbitrate between an artist and his critic should even the censures of the critic be just and the artist notwithstanding please it is an additional evidence that he is among the greatest artists it is thus with shakespeare and churchill  if several of our first writers had attended to the sentiments of their friends we should have lost some of our most precious compositions the friends of thomson could discern nothing but faults in his early productions not excepting his sublime winter this poet of humanity has left a vindictive epigram against one of these friends and it is perhaps the only illnatured lines he ever wrote he came with impatience to london published and made his genius known voltaire when his brutus was unsuccessful was advised not to turn his attention to the stage he replied to his friends by writing zara alzire and mahomet the mirror when published in edinburgh was fastidiously received the authors appealed from edinburgh to london and they have produced the literary pleasures of thousands  it is dangerous for a young writer to resign himself to the opinions of his friends it is alike dangerous to pass them with inattention what an embarrassment if he has not an excellent judgment he will not know what to reject and what to receive of those varying opinions and if he has an excellent judgment he wants little of their aid  a young writer must long and diligently study his great models without venturing on the vanity of criticism he who begins to analyze before he is acquainted with the nature of his materials like an ignorant chemist may suppose he is making experiments when he is in the act of injuring his untutored and audacious hand he must read for many years his authors as some the gospels with the same faith and the same admiration for what he once wanted intellectual relish he will come to admire and what he admires he will imitate he cannot too often peruse those many critical performances which the philosophical taste of the age has produced it should be considered that by reading an excellent critic he receives the knowledge of many years in a few hours the discoveries of art are tardy and criticism supplies this deficiency the more extensive an artists knowledge of what has been done the more vast will be his powers in knowing what to do those who do not read criticism will not even merit to be criticized yet we have unreflecting students who inquire of the utility of criticism nothing may be of happier consequence than a habit of comparing his thoughts and his style with the compositions of his masters if in the comparison the silent voice of sentiment exclaims in his heart i also am a painter it is not improbable that the young artist may become a corregio this sentiment is nobly expressed by montesquieu in the close of his preface to his great work on laws there he says with a consciousness of mind  i do not think that i have been totally deficient in point of genius when i have seen what so many great men both in france and germany have writ before me i have been lost in admiration but i have not lost my courage i have said with corregio ed io anche son pittore   if in meditating on the confessions of rousseau he recollects that he has experienced the same sensations from the same circumstances and that he has encountered the same difficulties and vanquished them by the same means he may hope one day that the world will receive him as their benefactor if in a constant perusal of the finest writers he sees his sentiments sometimes anticipated and in the tumult of his mind as it comes in contact with theirs new ones arise let him prosecute his studies with ardour and intrepidity with the fair hope that one day he may acquire the talents of a fine writer let him then  wake the strong divinity of soul that conquers chance and fate  akenside  chap v of the domestic life of a man of genius if we contemplate the domestic life of a man of genius we rarely observe him placed in a situation congenial to his pursuits  the house of a man of letters should be the sanctuary of tranquillity and virtue the moral duties he inculcates the philosophic speculations he forms and the refinements of taste he discloses should be familiar to his domestic circle it is then he is great without effort and eloquent without art  the porch and the academy of the ancients must have communicated an enthusiasm the moderns can never experience in the golden age of greece a demosthenes saw himself encompassed by future orators and plato listened to the plaudits of future philosophers it was a moment of delicious rapture not felt in the solitary meditations of the modern philosopher in whose mind sensations arise cold and artificial compared to their burst of sentiment and their fervor of passion  yet a virtuous citizen amidst the dissolution of manners may give to his residence a roman austerity and display the sublime in life as well as in composition he may be seated at an attic supper and enjoy spare feast a radish and an egg cowper nor is such a purity of manners incompatible with refined passions and delicacy of sentiment a penetrating glance a tender pressure a silent smile may infuse into his heart those genuine emotions which are ever wanted and never found at tables more splendidly profuse and more elegantly crowded a venerable parent a congenial friend and a female susceptible of a kindred enthusiasm are perhaps the utmost number of happy companions which a fortunate man could ever assemble around him  is he deprived of these social consolations like johnson he calls those whose calamities have exiled them from society and his house is an assemblage of the blind the lame and the poor in the ardour of his emotions he discovers that a word is wanting in the vocabulary of humanity and like the abbe de saint pierre has the honor of fixing a new word in the language a word that serves to explain his own actions  bienfaisance  his look is serene for study not fortune forms his sole occupation and accident cannot injure the stability of his soul for virtue has long been a habit is it enquired why this man appears an anomalous being among his fellow citizens  because he is the contemporary of the greatest men he passes his mornings with cicero and demosthenes and gives his nights to socrates and plato  such an one is the living exemplar of that sublime morality which we learn with our latin at school and which when we come into the world we consider like our latin to be merely a dead language  he renders poverty illustrious and proves that every man may be independent but we would be independent only in commanding slaves he who lives like a spartan in voluptuous sybaris is however independent and this age has produced men who passed the fervours of youth in a philosophical severity and studied as some study a language to become great characters such were franklin and elliot chatham and hume  the actions and studies of such men are not the only utility they bestow on the world they leave something of a more diffusive energy they leave the eternal memory of their character they leave to remotest posterity their immortal vestiges while virtuous youth contemplates them with enthusiasm and follows them with confidence  we close any further reflections on the character of a philosophic writer and restrain ourselves to observations more obvious and to facts more usual  too often we see the sublimest minds and the tenderest hearts sublime and tender only in their productions they are not surrounded by persons of analogous ideas who are alone capable of drawing forth their virtues and affections as the powers of the magnet remain dormant unless applied to particles capable of attraction we hear of several great men that they were undutiful sons  because they displeased their fathers in becoming great men  that they were disagreeable companions  because dullness or impertinence wearied  that they were indifferent husbands  because they were united to women who did no honor to the sex these are ordinary accusations ever received while it is forgotten that an accusation is not always a crime  it were not difficult to describe the domestic life of most men of genius and to observe that their inmates have rendered their lares but rugged deities i would never draw conclusions from particular circumstances such as that addison describes his lady under the character of oceana and steel delineates his wife under that of miss prue the one was a stormy ocean and the other a stagnated stream but i remark that many of the conspicuous blemishes of some of our great compositions may reasonably be attributed to the domestic infelicities of their authors the desultory life of camoens probably occasioned the want of connection in his epic miltons distracted family those numerous passages which escaped erasure and cervantes may have been led through the haste of publication into those little slips of memory observable in his satirical romance the best years of mengs life were embittered by the harshness of his father and it is probable that this domestic persecution from which he was at length obliged to fly gave him those morose and saturnine habits which he ever afterward retained of alonso cano a celebrated spanish painter it is observed by mr cumberland that he would have carried his art much higher had not the unceasing persecution of the inquisitors deprived him of that tranquillity which is so necessary to the very existence of the fine arts our poetry had probably attained to it is acme before pope had the unfortunate circumstances of dryden not occasioned his inequalities his incorrectness and his copious page  it is therefore an interesting observation for a man of letters and an artist to liberate himself early from domestic anxieties let him like rousseau leave the rich financier though he might become one himself sell his watch and issue from the palace in independence and enthusiasm he must also if necessary like crebillon be satisfied with the respectable society of a considerable number of gray hounds crebillon passed much of his life in solitude and pleased himself with the company of a dozen fine large dogs in his room which rendered the approach to our poet as formidable to the timorous as to the delicate the most ardent passion for glory can alone stimulate to such a retirement and indeed it is only in solitude that the most eminent geniuses have been formed solitude is the nurse of enthusiasm and enthusiasm is the parent of genius literary solitude shall therefore form our next object for speculation  chap vi on literary solitude men of letters are reproached with an extreme passion for retirement and some of the warmest philanthropists are calumniated as haters of the human race  literary retirement can have no guilt even if merely passed in the uninterrupted examination of the treasures of literature when taste is formed and curiosity becomes habitual the mind will not forego gratifications at once sacile and exquisite if it is said why the same ingenuity of mind that loves to trace the cause and to arrange the effects is not turned to the objects of the times and thus render itself of more apparent utility i answer that in the contemplation of existing scenes the mind finds not the same gratification as in those of the past what is present is not yet terminated the folly of the age is not yet folly and judgment pauses over mysterious passions but in the history of the human mind to be calmly traced in the volumes of other times every illusion is dissipated and we receive the same pleasure as the spectator who beholds the catastrophe of the tragedy or the comedy which excited his curiosity the history of the past yields a conclusion and therefore a perfection which cannot accompany that of the present  the horizon of research is illimitable and the discoveries of truth are infinite new materials serve but as the foundations of others we do not remain satisfied with building a house a palace or a street but by impereeptible gradations we erect a city  this perhaps may serve as an apology for men of letters who consume their days with innocence and philosophy but who are frequently considered to withdraw from duties which those who live to bustle and those who bustle to live are very far themselves from practicing an active virtue which in the present day may be called heroism is frequently the amiable child of solitude but rarely the companion of the busy and the gay  i propose to show the necessity the pleasures and the inconveniences of solitude to those who enlighten the world from the obscurity of their retirement  solitude is indispensable for literary pursuits every poet repeats carmina secessum scribentis et otia quaerunt no considerable work has yet been composed but it is author like an ancient magician retired first to the grove or the closet to invocate his spirits every composition of genius is the production of enthusiasm and while enthusiasm agitates the mind the solitude of a man of letters resembles a scene of ancient greece a grove becomes sacred and in every retired spot a divinity appears  but it is enchantments are reserved alone for him when he sighs for the intellectual decencies and the grace of fancy and languishes in an irksome solitude among crowds that is the moment to fly into seclusion and meditation he alone experiences the delights of that day which is compressed into a few hours where can he indulge but in solitude the delicious romances of his soul and where but in solitude can he occupy himself in useful dreams by night and when the morning rises fly without interruption to his unfinished labors he finds many secret pleasures and some glowing anticipations there is a society in the deepest solitude to which a polished mind springs with ardour it embraces a thousand congenial sentiments and mingles with a thousand exquisite sensations the solitude of retirement to the frivolous presents a vast and dreary desert but to the man of genius it blooms like the enchanted garden of armida  such is the situation in which the poet of sentiment and nature amidst the works of his masters exclaims first of your kind society divine thomson in this stillness of soul nature seems more beautiful and more vast we observe men of genius in public situations sighing for this solitude it is there only they feel their superiority and live in a future age cicero was uneasy amidst applauding rome and he has distinguished his numerous works by the titles of his various villas where they were composed it will not be denied that voltaire had talents and a taste for society yet he not only withdrew by intervals but at one period of his life passed five years in the most secret seclusion and perseverance of study montesquieu quitted the brilliant circles of paris for his books his meditations and for his immortal work and for this he was ridiculed by the gay triflers he relinquished harrington to compose his oceana severed himself from the society of his friends and was so wrapped in abstraction that he was pitied as a lunatic  a heart thus disposed tears itself with reluctance from it is contemplations and comes into society without a possibility of receiving or producing it is pleasures it may be urged that several men of genius have found no difficulty to level themselves to ordinary understandings i have heard that hume found great delight in the society of two old maids at his evening whist fontenelle and la motte would patiently listen to the frivolous and the dull but fontenelle and la motte whose genius our historians greatly resembled were two ingenious frenchmen celebrated for their politeness and their wit not for their sensibility and enthusiasm  when a man of letters seeks the consolations of society he would rest a mind enfeebled with one continued pursuit or exercise it by suffering it to take those infinite directions which the diversities of conversation offer if it is wearied the simplest actions please it is a child that would sport with flowers and pebbles if it issues in all it is force it is an athlet that leaps in the arena and calls for an adversary it is montaigne sporting with his cat or johnson maintaining a thesis amidst his marvelling friends  in either case ordinary society offers no charms and can never be charmed a feeble mind knows not to unbend because it was never yet extended nor can it elevate itself because the soul according to the figure of plato has no wings  thus the mind of genius feels a continued irritation in the crowd let us attend to the expressions of genius which can best describe it is peculiar sensibilities petrarch frequently withdrew to his immortal valley alike disgusted with the grossness of the vulgar and the frivolity of the courtier he could not patiently suffer that being whom he calls un huom del vulgo cowley regarded the common people as he did beasts and was displeased as much with what he calls the great as the little vulgar among the perverted images of a living orator is that of the hoofs of the swinish multitude and a venerable ancient prefers the society of his dog to such men fools cries du clos reconcile men of genius to each other from the impossibility of living with fools and to close our testimonies with a fine expression from milton among unequals what society can sort what harmony or true delight   the interruption of visitors have been feelingly lamented by men of letters  the mind occupied in maturing it is speculations feels the approach of the visitor by profession as the sudden gales of an eastern blast passing over the blossoms of spring we are afraid said some of the visitors to baxter that we break in upon your time to be sure you do replied the disturbed and blunt scholar ursinus was laborious in his literary avocations and to hint as gently as he could to his friends that he was avaricious of time he placed an inscription over the door of his study desiring that if any one chused to remain they must join in his labors the amiable melancthon incapable of a harsh expression when he received these idle visits only noted down the time he had expended that he might reanimate his industry and not lose a day among the disturbers of domestic tranquillity may be classed those unhappy wanderers who besiege the houses of their neighbors and like the barbarian soldier enter the apartment of an archimedes and murder him in the midst of his studies  but i am how to sketch a different picture of literary solitude  zimmerman has composed an elaborate work on solitude in a general manner his sentiments are glowing and perhaps they are dangerous of solitude men of genius must always be sufficiently enamoured without having read that seducing description of it is sublime pleasures let us not however forget nature in enthusiasm a man of genius though he addresses posterity has sensibilities and desires which can only be gratified by his contemporaries when great minds cannot readily find that in the world they seek they hasten into seclusion the craving void remains unfilled and for him who sighs for popularity in solitude every hour sharpens desire and aggravates disappointment  the solitude which is sought by the young student is not borne without repining to tame the fervid wildness of youth to the strict regularities of study is a sacrifice which requires all the enthusiasm of the sincerest votary the academic bower is not without it is rainy days milton not apt to vent complaints appears to have felt this irksome period of life he employs these expressions in the preface to smectymnus it is but justice not to defraud of due esteem the wearisome labors and studious watchings wherein i have spent and tired out almost a whole youth  perhaps solitude in a later period of life or rather the neglect which attends that solitude is felt with more sensibility it was thus that cowley that enthusiast for rural seclusion in his retirement called himself the melancholy cowley and mr mason has judiciously transferred the same epither to gray can we read his letters and not feel it is justness we lament also the loss of cowleys correspondence through the mistaken notion of sprat a loss certainly as invaluable as irrecoverable these are the best memoirs of a mans heart the register of his feelings but shenstone has filled his pages with the cries of an amiable heart that bleeds in the oblivion of solitude in one of his letters are these melancholy expressions now i am come from a visit every little uneasiness is sufficient to introduce my whole train of melancholy considerations and to make me utterly dissatisfied with the life i now lead and the life i foresee i shall lead i am angry and envious and dejected and frantic and disregard all present things as becomes a madman to do i am infinitely pleased though it is a gloomy joy with the application of dr swifts complaint that he is forced to die in a rage like a poisoned rat in a hole without exciting similar passages in prose let the lover of solitude muse on it is picture throughout the year in the following stanza tedious again to curse the drizzling day again to trace the wintery tracks of snow or soothed by vernal airs again survey the selfsame hawthorns bud and cowslips blow   swifts letters paint a terrifying picture of solitude and at length his despair closed with idiotism the amiable gresset could not sport with the brilliant wings of his fancy without some querulous expressions of an irksome solitude in his epistle to his muse he thus exquisitely paints the situation of men of genius  je les vois victimes du genie au foible prix dun eclat passager vivre isoles sans jouir de la vie and afterward he adds vingt ans dennuis pour quelque jours de gloire  the following anecdote may amuse the reader when menage was attacked by some and abandoned by others in a splenetic humor he retreated into the country and gave up his famous mercuriales when the literati assembled at his house he expected to find that tranquillity in the country which he had frequently described in his verses but as he was only a poetical plagiarist it is not wonderful that he was greatly disappointed some malicious person having killed his pigeons it gave him more vexation than his critics he hastened his return to paris it is better he cried since we are born to suffer to feel only reasonable sorrows  it is reasonably to be suspected that he only prefers solitude who cannot accomplish his wishes in society i have not yet been able to discover a great genius who courted by an attentive world persisted in his retirement voltaire when his reputation was not yet established sees only happiness in seclusion all his letters abound with quotations from the poets of the raptures of solitude when his tragedies gave him celebrity then his letters sound a different strain and he hesitates not to declare to his friends how unhappy was his situation constrained to remain in solitude while his tragedies were acting every night at paris  to have stood insulated amidst society has been the hard fate of some whose presence would have embellished the most select this neglect of the world has inspired their compositions with a querulous sensibility a softening charm that whatever it may have cost their feelings renders their beautiful lamentations more interesting the tender shades of melancholy throw a grace amidst the brilliant lights of their fancy it is said that the nightingale with a thorn in her breast does not sing with a less enchanting melody is not the voice of the heart heard in these verses poor moralist and what art thou a solitary fly no hive have thou of hoarded sweets gray  on the whole it may be said that a great experience of the world united with a great love of virtue render solitude desirable when they exist separately it becomes irksome a great experience of the world without virtue will pine in solitude to exert it is talent on those who are simple and unexperienced a great love of virtue without experience of the world forms in the leisure of retirement those utopian projects which it pants to call into existence  chap vii on the meditations and conversations of men of genius a continuity of attention is one of the grand characteristics of genius and in proportion to the degree of the intenseness of abstraction are it is powers often obtained a work on abstraction or the art of meditation is a desideratum it would be a valuable present to all and might prove of immense advantage to him who never had more than one solitary idea  among the regulations of this art it might not be improper to recommend darkness several profound thinkers could never pursue the operations of their minds in the distraction of light when the least remission of thought produces a new object and an extraneous idea mallebranche and others closed their shutters when they wished to abstract themselves that darkness is a great aid to thinking would appear from what most men experience relative to their thoughts during the night the silence and obscurity of that time are most friendly to abstraction and often when sleep forsakes us and we muse our thoughts surprise by the vividness of fancy if at that moment in the words of one of our most elegant poems we do not snatch the faithless fugitives to light pleasures of memory if memory does not chain the children of imagination they are scattered and fly the beams of the morning our mind among a tumultuous crowd suddenly finds itself forsaken and solitary it is at that unregarded period of our existence that men of moderate capacities feel an extraordinary expansion and men of genius some of their most original combinations yet then how few like pope have an old woman at hand to bring pens and paper  men of genius must consider themselves as so many vigilant guardians of the infinity of nature so treacherous is recollection and so capriciously does memory supply her treasures to fancy that some of the happiest conceptions of genius are fortuitous they come we do not know from where and spring we do not know how but if not seized at the moment of perception they are like autumnal clouds whose romantic figures dissolve as we gaze  it is said that collections have been made small ones no doubt of bon mots by persons who never said but one good thing it would form no incurious miscellany if it were possible to select some of those thoughts of great thinkers which were never written we should find many admirable ones the painters have this advantage over writers their slightest sketches are immediately siesed and become as valuable to posterity as their more complete labors  the art of meditation is an art which we may incessantly exercise and need not remit for long intervals of repose as every other art and yet notwithstanding the facility of practice and we should suppose the hourly skill we might obtain every manual art is brought to perfection while of the art of the mind millions are yet ignorant of the first rudiments quintilian finely observes that men of genius command it at all times and in all places in their walks at table and at assemblies they turn their eye inwards and can form an artificial solitude the powers of abstraction which some men have exercised appear to puny thinkers to have something of the mavelous in the regions of the mind they look like so many gullivers among a million of lilliputians of socrates it is said that he would frequently remain an entire day and night in the same attitude absorbed in meditation and why shall we doubt this when we know that la fontaine and thomson descartes and newton experienced the same abstraction in ciceros treatise on old age cato praises caius sulpitius gallus who when he sat down to write in the morning was surprised by the evening and when he took up his pen in the evening was surprised by the appearance of the morning of the italian poet marini it is said that he was once so absorbed in the revision of his adonis that he suffered his leg to be burnt for some time without any sensibility  this enthusiasm renders every thing that surrounds us as distant as if an immense interval separated us from the scene it is related of a modern astronomer that one summer night when he was withdrawing to his chamber the brightness of the heavens showed a phenomenon he passed the whole night in observing it and when they came to him early in the morning and found him in the same attitude he said like one who had been recollecting his thoughts for a few moments it must be thus but i will go to bed before it is late he had gazed the entire night in meditation and did not know it  enthusiasm which is active genius presents an object more singular than genius in it is quiescent meditations the flowing stream is lost in an ocean rolling impetuously this phrenzy of abstraction and wonderful agitation of the soul is required not only in the fine arts but wherever a great exertion must be employed it was felt by gray in his loftiest excursions and is it not the same power which impels the villager when to astonish his rivals in a contest for leaping he retires back some steps ferments his mind to a fervent resolution and clears the eventful bound it was a maxim with one of our ancient and great admirals in the reign of elizabeth that a height of passion amounting to phrenzy was necessary to qualify a man for that place a variety of instances might be given of this fine enthusiasm which has ever accompanied the artist at the moment he produced excellencies  it has sometimes arisen into a delirium the soul of rousseau was bewildered in the delusions of fancy and the momentary dispositions of his mind colored exterior objects petrarch in that minute narrative of a vision in which laura appeared to him and tasso in the conversations with his invisible spirit expanded their sublime imaginations to a dangerous phrenzy this delicious inebriation of the heart occasions so intense a delight that to describe this character of the soul requires what one of these exquisite minds has called thoughts that breathe and words that burn the ancients saw nothing short of a divine inspiration in this agitation of the mind it affects men of genius physically fielding says i do not doubt but that the most pathetic and affecting scenes have been writ with tears he perhaps would have been pleased to have confirmed his observation by the following circumstance metastasio has written a beautiful sonnet on occasion of having shed tears in writing an opera this sonnet shall be given at the close of the volume when the first idea of the essay on the arts and sciences rushed on the contemplation of rousseau it occasioned such a fever of the mind and trembling of his frame that it approached to a delirium the tremors of dryden after having written an ode a circumstance accidentally handed to us by tradition were probably not unusual with him  chance has preserved but a few of similar instances this enthusiasm indeed can only be observed by men of genius themselves but when it most powerfully agitates them they can least perceive it at that moment of exquisite extravagance like a religious visionary they pierce into the heaven of heavens and when they return to their chair and their table the effect has ceased and the golden hour of sublime rapture must terminate like other hours in vulgar appetites that offend fancy and gratify nature  this irritability of mind has sometimes rendered society displeasing to several men of genius whenever rousseau passed a morning in company he says it was observed that in the evening he was dissatisfied and disturbed rousseau may be considered by some as a mind too peculiar to be taken as a guide in our examination into the character of men of genius if our young authors however would meditate on certain parts of his character their virtues might be more elevated and their style more exquisite than the model which any other literary character of this age presents to them  absorbed in his meditations the man of genius lives in one continued series of reflection always himself seldom another frequently the real artist loves nothing but his art and his very amusements and relaxations receive the impression of this enthusiasm not without an apparent haughtiness which often is but the natural and dignified expression of an elevated mind and he appears awkward or ignorant of those petty attentions which form the science of those who have no science a great princess was desirous of seeing one of the first literary characters of the age her disappointment was inconceivable he sat awkwardly and silently on his chair and made the most perplexed bow she had yet seen  we often view the man of real genius insulated in a brilliant circle while the intriguing and fashionable author whose heart is more corrupt than his head is admired because he has discovered the art of admiring the triflers consider him to be a man of genius he employs their own ideas both are therefore gratified  it is however certain that this abstraction and awkwardness which render a man of genius ridiculous and inconsiderable in the private circle are the cause of his success with the public often his private defects are the source of his public qualities his bluntness may be a lively perception of truth his coldness a rigid candor his tedious discussion may be an accuracy of reasoning and his disagreeable warmth the ardour which animates his works with the public it was the excessive vanity and selflove of cicero and voltaire that gave birth to all their vast designs to please the public and his circle is incompatible  to this the frivolous will not assent  when of their numerous body one accomplished trifler shall be acknowledged as a great genius this observation shall be deemed erroneous but to close a dispute of the most ancient date i shall quote the remark of a lord shaftesbury for nobility loses it is title and often it is rank in the republic of letters has said that it may happen that a person may be so much the worse author for being the finer gentleman  many reasons may be alleged why genius is defective in ordinary conversation one may be sufficient the want of analogous ideas the spirit of fashionable society and that of study are incompatible the language of the politest circle may be defined the art of speaking idly to an idler to speak idly is not an acquirement of facility a man of genius is rarely versant in the fashionable vocabulary and in a dialogue of elegant inanity which should be rapid and various he hesitates to find a remote idea and stops to correct an imperfect expression how often will it be fortunate for him if he escapes being understood it is rather singular that our polished society should bear so close a resemblance to the conversations of the hottentots  of the hottentots  yes for we are told that they consider thinking as the scourge of human nature  the refined sensibility of men of genius renders them uneasy companions they discover a character too early and too sagaciously for the interests of conversation dunces are excellent companions for dunces the same ideas and the same judgments the opacity of the intellect is no detriment for like the blind they can perform their stated rounds in the night without inconvenience  a man of genius can rarely be a favorite with such a party even if they should have some taste and some information his works they applaud because that is fashionable but they neglect the author who may happen to be very unfashionable  the frivolist author will be the evening favorite he sports not without grace on the brilliant surface of the soul but is irrecoverably lost when he passes over it is depths the swan that gracefully glides down rivers would perish on seas the man of genius sits like a melancholy eagle whose pinions are clipped and who is placed to roost among domestic fowls  a man of genius utters many things in conversation which appear extravagant or absurd when printed they are found admirable how often the public differs from the individual there may be a centurys opinion betwixt them this reflection reminds me of an athenian anecdote a statuary at athens made a figure of minerva those friends who were admitted into his shop an ancient custom the moderns preserve were surprised at it is rough strokes and colossal features before the artist they trembled for him behind him they calumniated the man of genius smiled at the one and forgave the other when the figure was fixed in a public place and inspected by the city and not merely by individuals the attic judges admired the softness of the traits and the majesty of the figure we must never forget that there is a certain distance at which opinions as well as statues are to be viewed and he who addresses an attic public knows that it is enlightened sentiments are rarely to be found in a private circle  it is not necessary to produce instances of the deficiencies of men of genius in conversation it is sufficient to observe that the sublime dante was taciturn or satirical addison and moliere were silent corneille and dryden were no amusing companions vaucanson was said to be as much a machine as any he made  to the intimates of these superior men who complained of their defects i would thus have replied  do their productions not delight and surprise you  you are silent i beg your pardon the public has informed you of a great name you would not otherwise have perceived the precious talent of your neighbor  you have examined his compositions and would you have him resemble yourselves you know nothing of your friend but his name  a man of genius may however be rendered the most agreeable companion few artists but are eloquent on the art in which they excel he is an exquisite instrument if the hand of the performer knows to call forth the rich confluence of his sounds if the flying fingers touch into a voice davenant  if you love the man of letters seek him in the privacies of his study or if he be a man of virtue take him to your bosom it is in the hour of confidence and tranquillity his genius may elicit a ray of intelligence more fervid than the labors of polished composition  chap viii men of genius limited in their art we have examined in the preceding chapter several reasons why men of genius are often incapable of pleasing in the versatile conversation of a mixed society another observation offers their powers of pleasing are even limited in the art in which they excel they are confined says du bos to particular branches in that art  this observation reiterated without effect has become trite while it would appear by most authors considering themselves universal geniuses that it was on the contrary a dangerous novelty literary history continually confirms it is verity and these failures of eminent men are so many instructions which nature dictates but her pupils receive her admonitions with contempt  nature is a jealous god and several of our great writers when they have risen in rebellion against her have only suffered by the violation fielding excellent in his novels when his aid was required for the theater could never write a tolerable drama congreve celebrated for his pointed wit when he took up the reigning topic wrote the feeblest verse row successful in the soft tones of tragedy is remarkable for a miserable failure in comedy la fontaine that exquisite fabulist found that his opera was hissed the absurdities of voltaire the most successful of universal writers are only forgiven for his inexhaustible wit and happy irony  the most original genius of our age with discernment equal to his wit confines himself to that species of poetry in which he can fear no rival songs more delicious than the odes of anacreon and satires more pungent than those of horace compositions more admirable than imitable these are the limits which like a great politician he draws round his empire he has no disposition to rival milton in an epic or shakespeare in a tragedy peter pindar will never therefore experience the fate of louis the great to make brilliant conquests in the prime of life and view his reputation die before himself by a vain attempt at universal monarchy  but some ingenious men are willing to oppose this precept and presume to think that nature is never ungrateful when she receives the proper attentions it is not difficult to find some ingenious artists who show abilities in various modes of composition but to evince abilities and to display genius are removed at a long interval from each other true genius has rarely this suppleness but what the french call le bell esprit has it often in a wonderful degree writers endowed with the bell esprit can compose history and romance and moral and poetical essays with the same ingenuity a man of genius will only write a history or a romance moral or poetical essays but his performances remain with the language while the reputation of a bell esprit like some artificial fires become suddenly extinct and it is curious to observe that the very ingenious du clos is denied by the french critics to be a man of genius because he wrote equally well on a variety of subjects  nor is it surprising that even a man of genius should fail in preserving an equal power over every province of his art the genius of man being necessarily limited compared to art itself and he who raises admiration by his skill in one department will never equal his faculty in another he who excels like a butler in wit and satire will find it impossible to excel like a milton in sentiment and imagination the minds of men are so many different soils and the great art consists in planting the trees adapted to the soil  i know no instance to show that a great poet excelled as a painter or that a great musician excelled as a statuary but it is not difficult to prove that the most eminent men of genius have found their talent confined to their art and even to departments of their art  the ancients therefore wisely addicted themselves only to one species of composition the poet was not an historian nor the historian a poet but the poet was a poet and the historian an historian  i have been induced to touch on this critical admonition because it is sometimes denied and i think the error arises from not distinguishing the grand compositions of genius from the pretty curiosities of the bell esprit which may be defined mimetic genius whenever this wellknown verse shall be controverted it will be fatal to the progress of genius one science only will one genius fit pope  he who writes on topics of different species cannot meditate much on any with him all is a beautiful distraction rather than an accomplished beauty he can only repeat what has been already given or give what will not merit to be repeated writers of mediocrity by a long and patient devotion to one kind of composition have often attained considerable merit but how much more forcibly must this resolute perseverance act on a mind of original powers we may compare those who write on different arts or multifarious topics to excursive merchants who make small fortunes in various places and spend them there writers who concentrate their powers on one object are like those who incessantly accumulate but exhaust their splendid opulence in the proper place at their native residence  it is the observation of one of our best critics and poets in his admirable preface to homer that no author or man ever excelled all the world in more than one faculty it is not however denied that a man of genius should be intimate with the principles of every art in many he may become an esteemed artist but in one only he can be a master on ne vit qua demi quand on na quun seul gout le veritable esprit sait se plier a tout voltaire  chap ix some observations respecting the infirmities and defects of men of genius the modes of life of a man of genius are often tinctured with eccentricity and enthusiasm these are in an eternal conflict with the usages of common life his occupations his amusements and his ardour are discordant to daily pursuits and prudential habits it is the characteristic of genius to display no talent to ordinary men and it is unjust to censure the latter when they consider him as born for no human purpose their pleasures and their sorrows are not his pleasures and his sorrows he often appears to slumber in dishonorable ease while his days are passed in labors more constant and more painful than those of the manufacturer the world are not always aware that to meditate to compose and even to converse with some are great labors and as hawkesworth observes that weariness may be contracted in an arm chair  such men are also censured for an irritability of disposition many reasons might apologize for these unhappy variations of humor the occupation of making a great name is perhaps more anxious and precarious than that of making a great fortune we sympathise with the merchant when he communicates melancholy to the social circle in consequence of a bankruptcy or when he feels the elation of prosperity at the success of a vast speculation the author is not less immersed in cares or agitated by success for literature has it is bankruptcies and it is speculations  the anxieties and disappointments of an author even of the most successful are incalculable if he is learned learning is the torment of unquenchable thirst and his elaborate work is exposed to the accidental recollection of an inferior mind as well as the fatal omissions of wearied vigilance if he excels in the magic of diction and the graces of fancy his path is strewed with roses but his feet bleed on invisible yet piercing thorns rousseau has given a glowing description of the ceaseless inquietudes by which he acquired skill in the arts of composition and has said that with whatever talent a man may be born the art of writing is not easily obtained the depressions and elevations of genius are described by pope who pants for glory finds but short repose a breath revives him or a breath oerthrows   the anxious uncertainty of an author for his compositions is like the state of the lover who writes to his mistress he repents and thinks he has written too much and he recollects that he had omitted things of the greatest moment when indeed his work is received with favor he resembles latona as described by ovid who contemplated with secret joy her daughter diana distinguished among the woodnymphs and whosc appearance was taller and more lovely than her companions  it is observed by m la harp an author by profession that as it has been proved there are some maladies peculiar to artists there are also sorrows which are peculiar to them and which the world can neither pity nor soften because it cannot have their conceptions we read not without a melancholy emotion the querulous expressions of men of genius we have a little catalogue de calamitate litteratorum we might add a volume by the addition of most of our own authors the materials are ready for publication but the hope of it is utility has past since a literary fund established in attic london found too many claimants and too few subscribers it has died away while the musical fund is patronised by the great which seems to prove that they have finer ears than understandings the too sensible smollet has left this testimonial to posterity of his feelings in one of his prefaces he says had some of those who were pleased to call themselves my friends been at any pains to deserve the character and told me ingenuously what i had to expect in the capacity of an author i should in all probability have spared myself the incredible labor and chagrin i have since undergone this is a text which requires no commentary hume has given the history of his writings and we find that it required to the full all his patient philosophy to support his ill reception the reasoning hume proposed changing his name and his country parties are formed against a man of genius as happened to corneille and milton and a pradon and a settle are preferred to a racine and a dryden what must have been the agonies of the neglected collins when he burnt his exquisite odes at the door of his publisher the great bacon bequeathed his name and his works to foreigners and to a future age nor must we forget the dignified complaints of the rambler with which he awefully closes his work in appealing to posterity  the votaries of the arts and sciencies are called by cicero heroes of peace their labors their dangers and their intrepidity make them heroes but peace is rarely the ornament of their feverish existence  it is a mortification experienced by several men of genius that they have never acquired that reputation they might have merited by not having been enabled to carry their genius to it is perfection a variety of circumstances may hinder such a writer from occupying the distinguished place his abilities promised some authors of the firstrate genius are neglected because deficient in that taste which is alone attained by long culture and an enlarged education piron was a writer of as great genius and original powers as any of the french poets but he has failed of securing himself a seat among the masters of the french parnassus he has himself in some sketches of his life assigned the reasons of this failure till the age of twentyfive he was confined to the narrow circle of unlettered friends he passed ten or twelve years afterward at paris in obscurity so that he was about forty when by the advice of crebillon he essayed his powers on his fastidious theater and though he has evinced high genius he has only satisfied his refined nation by one performance  some are now only agreeable who might have been great writers had their application to study and the modes of their life been different in mr greaves lively recollections of his friend shenstone are some judicious observations on this subject he has drawn a comparison between the elevated abilities of gray and the humble talents of shenstone and he has essayed to show that it was the accidental circumstances of grays place of birth education his admittance into some of the best circles and his assiduous application to science which gave him that superiority over the indolence the retirement and the inertion of a want of patronage which made shenstone as gray familiarly said hop round his walks like a bird in a string i must again remind the reader of another apparent paradox of helvetius who says that it is the different modes of education which influence men so wonderfully and that genius may be acquired whenever a proper study is accompanied by a fervent passion for any particular art or science this fervent passion may be only another name for what is called genius i believe however that shenstone who now occupies a subordinate seat in the temple of fame might have been placed among the higher classes perhaps most men are born with abilities nearly equal and mr greaves has more reason on his side than some may be aware when he says of two persons born to equal fortune if one improves his stock by industry and traffic and the other lives idly upon the principal the consequence is obvious  others by an ignorance of a fine manner or by a wrong direction long pursued waste their talents on the humbler departments of art when they have sufficient genius to excel in the highest this is the case among many of our provincial writers who with no inconsiderable talents are placed often in situations where they study authors whose taste is surpassed by the more modern we often see ingenious writers who are about half a century removed from the public taste among the painters albert durer may serve as an instance vasari quoted by sir joshua reynolds justly remarked that he would have probably been one of the first painters of his age had he been initiated into the great principles of the art so well understood by his italian contemporaries and sir joshua adds but unluckily having never seen or heard of any other manner he considered his own without doubt as perfect  men of genius are often reverenced only where they are known by their writings in the romance of life they are divinities in it is history they are men from errors of the mind and derelictions of the heart they may not be exempt these are perceived by their acquaintance who can often discern only these qualities the defects of great men are the consolation of the dunces  degrading vices and singular follies have dishonored men of the highest genius than others their passions are more effervescent and their relish for enjoyment more keen genius is a perilous gift of nature for it is acknowledged that the same materials she employs to form a cataline and a cromwell make a cicero and a bacon plato in his visionary sketches of a man of genius lays great stress on his having the most violent passions with reason to restrain them helvetius an accurate observer of men of genius also enforces the idea of their inflammable and physical passions glory and infamy is the same violent passion but the direction is different and voltaire has expressed this in one verse si je netois caesar jaurois ete brutus genius like a storm of wind in arabia either directs the myriads of locusts to the land or with a friendly influence disperses them away  for their foibles it appears more difficult to account than for their vices for a violent passion depends on it is direction to become either excellence or depravity but why their exalted mind should not preserve them from the imbecillities of fools appears a mere caprice of nature a curious list might be formed of fears of the brave and follies of the wise johnson in the note underneath i have thrown together a few facts which may be passed over by those who have no taste for literary anecdotes voiture was the son of a vintner and like our prior was so mortified whenever reminded of his original occupation that it was said of him that wine which cheared the heart of all men sickened that of voiture rousseau the poet was the son of a cobbler and when his honest parent waited at the door of the theater to embrace his son on the success of his first piece the inhuman poet repulsed the venerable father with insult and contempt akenside ever considered his lameness as an unsupportable misfortune since it continually reminded him of his origin being occasioned by the fall of a cleaver from one of his fathers blocks a respectable butcher milton delighted in contemplating his own person and the engraver not having reached our sublime bards ideal grace he has pointed his indignation in four iambics among the complaints of pope is that of the pictured shape even the strongminded johnson would not be painted blinking sam mr boswell tells us that goldsmith attempted to show his agility to be superior to the dancing of an ape whose praise had occasioned him a fit of jealousy but he failed in imitating his rival the inscription under boileaus portrait describing his character with lavish panegyric and a preference to juvenal and horace is unfortunately known to have been written by himself   but it is also necessary to acknowledge that men of genius are often unjustly reproached with foibles the sports of a vacant mind are misunderstood as follies the simplicity of truth may appear vanity and the consciousness of superiority envy nothing is more usual than our surprise at some great writer or artist contemning the labors of another whom the public cherish with equal approbation we place it to the account of his envy but perhaps this opinion is erroneous and claims a concise investigation  every superior writer has a manner of his own with which he has long been conversant and too often inclines to judge of the merit of a performance by the degree it attains of his favorite manner he errs because impartial men of taste are addicted to no manner but love whatever is exquisite we often see readers draw their degree of comparative merit from the manner of their favorite author an author does the same that is he draws it from himself such a partial standard of taste is erroneous but it is more excuseable in the author than in the reader  this observation will serve to explain several curious phenomena in literature the witty cowley despised the natural chaucer the classical boileau the rough sublimity of crebillon the forcible corneille the tender racine the affected marivaux the familiar moliere the artificial gray the simple shenstone each alike judged by that peculiar manner he had long formed in a free conversation they might have contemned each other and a dunce who had listened without taste or understanding if he had been a haberdasher in anecdotes would have hastened to reposit in his wareroom of literary falsities a long declamation on the vanity and envy of these great men  but the charge of vanity has been urged with great appearance of truth against authors for the complacence they experience in their works and the high admiration of themselves an author is pictured as a narcissus  it has long been acknowledged that every work of merit the more it is examined the greater the merit will appear the most masterly touches and the reserved graces which form the pride of the artist are not observable till after a familiar and constant meditation what is most refined is least obvious and to some must remain unperceived for ever churchill in the opening of his second book of gotham justly observes that to form the beauties of composition  few can do and scarcely one one critic in an age can find when done   but ascending from these elaborate strokes in composition to the views and designs of an author the more profound and extensive these are the more they elude the readers apprehension i refine not too much when i say that the author is conscious of beauties that are not in his composition the happiest writers are compelled to see some of their most magnificent ideas float along the immensity of mind beyond the feeble grasp of expression compare the state of the author with that of the reader how copious and overflowing is the mind of the one to the other how more sensibly alive to a variety of exquisite strokes which the other has not yet perceived the author is familiar with every part and the reader has but a vague notion of the whole how many noble conceptions of rousseau are not yet mastered how many profound reflections of montesquieu are not yet understood how many subtle lessons are yet in lock which no preceptor can teach  such among others are the reasons which may induce an author to express himself in language which may sound like vanity to be admired is the noble simplicity of the ancients imitated by a few elevated minds among the moderns in expressing with ardour the consciousness of genius we are not more displeased with dryden than with cicero when he acquaints us of the great things he has done and those he purposes to do modern modesty might perhaps to some be more engaging if it were modesty but our artificial blushes are like the ladies temporary rouge ever ready to color the face on any occasion some will not place their names to their books yet prefix it to their advertisements others pretend to be the editors of their own works some compliment themselves in the third person and many concealed under the shade of anonymous criticism form panegyrics as elaborate and long as plinys on trajan of their works and themselves yet in a conversation start at a compliment and quarrel at a quotation such modest authors resemble certain ladies who in public are equally celebrated for the coldest chastity  consciousness of merit characterises men of genius but it is to be lamented that the illusions of selflove are not distinguishable from the realities of consciousness the following are instances epicurus wrote to a minister of state if you desire glory nothing can bestow it so much as the letters i write to you seneca in quoting these words adds what epicurus promised to his friend that my lucilius i promise you these were great men but one la serre a french writer of epistles when he addressed them used to say i immortalise you sir and this merits at least your gratitude how many la serres might we quote   yet if we were to take from some their pride of exultation we annihilate the germ of their excellence the persuasion of a just posterity smoothed the sleepless pillow and spread a sunshine in the solitude of bacon montesquieu and newton of cervantes gray and milton men of genius anticipate their contemporaries and know they are such long before the tardy consent of the public  they have also been accused of the meanest adulations it is certain that many have had the weakness to praise unworthy men and some the courage to erase what they have written a young writer unknown yet languishing for encouragement when he first finds the notice of a person of some eminence has expressed himself in language which gratitude a finer reason than reason itself inspired strongly has milton expressed the sensations of this passion the debt immense of endless gratitude who ever pays an immense debt in small sums  even extravagant applauses may be excused every man of genius has left such honorable traces of his private affections from lock whose dedication of his immortal treatise is more adulative than could be supposed from a temperate philosopher to churchill whose eulogies on his friends form so beautiful a contrast with the acerbity of his satire as their susceptibility is more ardent and their penetration keener than other men it is not improbable that they often discover traits in the characters of those with whom they are familiar unperceived and unknown to the world the most illustrious of the ancients placed the name of some friend at the head of their works we too often prefix the name of some patron but the most graceful place is perhaps in the midst of a work when a man of genius shows that he is not less mindful of his social affection than his fame  chap x of literary friendships and enmities a delightful topic opens to our contemplation i enter the scene as eneas the green elysium where he viewed the once illustrious inhabitants of the earth reposing in social felicity among the multitude a pythias and damon are rare for friendship appears too serious for the frivolous and too romantic for the busy the mutable passions of the frivolous oblige them to forsake those bosoms in which they have reposited their extinct passions and the varying object of the varying hour requires a new set of associates the busy suffer no intimacies to intrude on their private views the mysterious magnet of friendship is attached only by invisible atoms of sympathy but falls without cohesion on the solidity of gold  it is honorable to literature that among the virtues it inspires is that of ardent friendship and it is history presents no unfrequent instances of it is finest enthusiasm the delirium of love is often too violent a passion for the student and it is caprices are still more incompatible with his pursuits than it is delirium but friendship is not only delightful but necessary to soothe a mind alternately elated and depressed when infirm it strengthens when dubious it enlightens when discouraged it animates  that however it should be rare in literature will excite no surprise the qualities necessary to constitute literary friendship compared with those of men of the world must render it is occasional appearance a singularity literary friendship has no convivial gaieties or factious assemblies two atoms must meet out of the vast mass of nature of so equal a form that when they once adhere they shall appear as one and resist the utmost force of separation their studies must be similar and yet so far from becoming rivals each must find reciprocal assistance when one of them is at length found to excel the other is to be the protector of his fame each must live for the other decide with one judgment and feel with one taste in this intercourse of minds the private passions are not to be gratified but often to be corrected and an energetic passion for study must alone be indulged in their familiar conversations learning is communicated without study and wit without art what is given by one is improved by the other fancy is enriched by memory and to such conversations the world is indebted for many of it is happiest productions the greatest inconvenience attending such a friendship is to survive the friend nor are there wanting instances in which this has not been suffered and the violence of grief has operated like a voluntary death  the friendships of men of the world are different both in their features and their complections there we find with facility men of analogous dispositions but such intimacies terminate in complaint and contempt a feeble mind acquires still more imbecility with the feeble a dissolute heart riots in guilt with the dissolute and while we despise our companion we in return have become despicable  among the most pleasing effusions of a man of genius are those little pieces which he consecrates to the cause of friendship and among his noblest actions are those fervid and spontaneous testimonies of affection of which literary history affords many examples i shall have no recourse to the abundant instances which the ancients have left the moderns may be instructed by the moderns to notice a few will be sufficient and not to notice them would be refusing the young reader no ordinary gratification such is the memorable friendship of beaumont and fletcher that as they have so closely united their labors that we know not the productions of either it is with equal difficulty biographers compose the memoirs of one without running into the life of the other they pourtrayed the same characters while they mingled sentiment with sentiment and their days were not more closely interwoven than their verses the poem of cowley on the death of his friend harvey is not indeed free from some of his remote conceits yet the following stanza presents a pleasing picture of the employments of two young students say for you saw us ye immortal lights how often unwearied have we spent the nights till the ledaean stars so famed for love wondred at us from above we spent them not in toys in lust or wine but search of deep philosophy wit eloquence and poetry arts which i loved for they my friend were thine   milton has not only given the exquisite lycidas to the memory of a young friend but in his epitaphium damonis to that of deodatus has poured forth some interesting sentiments it has been versified by langhorne now says the poet to whom shall i my hopes and fears impart or trust the cares and follies of my heart the elegy of tickel maliciously called by steel prose in rhyme is alike inspired by affection and fancy it has a melodious languor and a melancholy grace the sonnet of gray to the memory of west is a beautiful effusion and a model for english sonnets helvetius was the protector of men of genius whom he assisted not only with his criticism but his fortune at his death m surin read in the french academy an epistle to the manes of his friend saurin wrestling with obscurity and poverty was drawn into literary existence by the supporting hand of helvetius our poet thus addresses him in the warm tones of gratitude cest toi qui me cherchant au sein de linfortune relevas mon sort abattu et scus me render chere une vie importune    que importent ces pleurs  o douleur impuissante o regrets superflus je vis helas je vis et mon ami nest plus imitated thy friend in miserys haunts thy bounties sieze and give an urgent life some days of ease ah ye vain griefs superfluous tears i chide i live alas i live and thou have died the literary friendship of a father with his son is one of the most rare alliances in the republic of letters we have had a remarkable instance in the two richardsons and the father in his fine original and warm manner has employed the most glowing language to express his sentiments on this affection he says my time of learning was employed in business but after all i have the greek and latin tongues because a part of me possesses them to whom i can recur at pleasure just as i have a hand when i would write or paint feet to walk and eyes to see my son is my learning as i am that to him which he has not we make one man and such a compound man may probably produce what no single man can and further i always think it my peculiar happiness to be as it were enlarged expanded made another man by the acquisition of my son and he thinks in the same manner concerning my union with him all this is as curious as it is uncommon  but it must not be supposed that men of genius have remained satisfied with only giving a few verses to the duties of friendship the elevation of their minds has raised them into domestic heroes whose actions are often only recorded in the unpublished register of private life some for their friend have died penetrated with inconsolable grief some have sacrificed their character to his own some have shared their limited fortune and some have remained attached to their friend in the worst season of adversity in the note underneath i adduce my proofs of what is so honorable to literature jurieu denounced bail as an impious writer and drew his testimonies from the avis aux refugies this work is written against calvinists and therefore becomes impious in holland bail might have exculpated himself with facility by declaring the work was composed by la roque but he preferred to be persecuted rather than to ruin his friend he therefore was silent and condemned  when the minister fouquet was abandoned by all it was the men of letters he had patronised who never forsook his prison and many have dedicated their works to great men in their adversity whom they scorned to notice at the time when they were noticed by all  the learned goguet bequeathed his mss and library to his friend fugere with whom he had united his affections and his studies his work on the origin of the arts and sciences had been much indebted to his aid in vain was the legacy bequeathed goguet died of a slow and painful disorder fugere who knew him to be past recovery preserved a mute despair retired home and the victim of sensibility and friendship died a few weeks after his friend  the abbe de saint pierre gave an interesting proof of literary friendship when he was at college he formed a union with varignon the geometrician they were of congenial dispositions when he went to paris he invited varignon to accompany him but varignon had nothing and the abbe was far from rich a certain income was necessary for the tranquil pursuits of geometry our abbe had an income of   00 livres from this he deducted  00 which he gave to the geometrician but accompanied by a delicacy which none but a man of genius could conceive i do not give it you he said as a salary but an annuity that you may be independent and quit when you dislike me something nearly similar embellishes our own scanty literary history when akenside was in great danger of experiencing famine as well as fame mr dyson allowed him three hundred pounds a year of this gentleman perhaps nothing is known yet whatever his life may be it merits the tribute of the biographer this single action will cast a luster round the meanest objects the race of the dysons are no doubt long extinct it would be rash for another akenside to look round for another dyson to close with these honorable testimonies of literary friendship we must not omit that of churchill and lloyd it is known that when lloyd heard of the death of our poet he acted the port which fugere did to goguet i conclude by remarking that the page is crowded but my memory is by no means exhausted   i shall be concise on the subject of their enmities for what could even ingenuity urge to distinguish literary calumny from any other kind the reflection should humiliate men of genius that when they condescend to asperse with rage and malignity another artist they are only doing what the worst part of society can perform as well as themselves  but reason trembles when wit is united with malice and malice with wantonness churchill says when reasons for me god is for me too but how rarely are satirists conducted by reason our laws offer no protection from a bitter epigram and an artful satire irony is not denominated by an attorney a libel by an honest man it may be felt as something much worse fortune has been lost reputation destroyed and every charity of life been extinguished by witty malice to debase a man in the circle of his acquaintance if unfortunately his sensibility is exquisite has not infrequently been committing a less crime than murder the abbe cassagne felt so acutely the caustic verse of boileau that in the prime of life he became melancholy and died insane a modern painter fell the victim of the criticism and the wit of a satirist who shall be nameless on this occasion dr johnson related of cummyns a celebrated quaker that he confessed he died of an anonymous letter in a public paper which said he fastened on my heart and threw me into this slow fever some like racine have died of a simple rebuke and some by an epigram as well as a satire  chap xi the characters of writers not discoverable in their writings it has long been a cherished notion among men of taste that the dispositions of an artist appear in his works and the sublime angelo and the graceful raphael are produced as splendid instances it has also been a very ancient opinion that the character of an author is discoverable in his writings the echo from biographers has been constant and often they pourtray the man by the mirror of his works ruffhead in his dull book on pope says p   to an accurate observer the temper and morals of a writer breathe throughout his works what has been the consequence of this false and popular opinion he has written a great deal about pope and poetry and as johnson said he knew as little of one as the other   the anecdote which dr johnson has given of thomson has served at least to suspect it is fallibility the subject however demands investigation and perhaps may be finally terminated by the facts i now adduce  we enquire whether he is a moral man who composes moral essays incontinent who writes lascivious poems malignant who publishes bitter satires and savage whose imagination delights in terror and in blood  it is one characteristic of genius to say things for their ingenuity and to display the felicity of fancy than from any utility which may be drawn from them of many obscene poets the greater part have led chaste lives and this topic has engaged the acute examination of bail la mothe le vaier wrote two works of a free nature yet his life was the unblemished life of a retired sage of many of the ancient poets it appears that the licentiousness of their verse was by no means communicated to their manners their page was lascivious and their life pure for the fancy may be debauched and the heart austere  the licentious tales of la fontaine are well known but not a single amor has been recorded of the bon homme bail is a remarkable instance no writer is more ample in his detail of impurity but he resisted the pollution of the senses as much as newton he painted his scenes of lewdness merely as a faithful historian and an exact compiler smollets character is immaculate yet what a description has he given of one of his heroes with lord straddle i cannot but observe on such scenes that their delineation answers no good purpose modesty cannot read and is morality interested he assumed the character of petronius arbiter we applaud and we censure this mere playfulness of fancy it is certain however by these instances that licentious writers may be very chaste men  we now turn to those works which by their cast promise that the authors were pious and moral men two celebrated ancients must not be passed over in this enumeration seneca and sallust the first is an admirable stoic elaborate in his delineation of the moral duties but his essays on the advantages of poverty were written on a table of gold and his admonitions of supporting pain on voluptuous sophas and in fragrant baths this moral declaimer ruined my county essex by the most exorbitant usuries and inculcated the comforts of poverty with a fortune of seven millions sallust elegantly declaims against the licentious manners of his age but we happen to know that he was repeatedly accused in the senate for public and habitual debaucheries he inveighs against the spoilers of countries yet when he attained to a remote government he became a verres lucian in his early productions declaims against the friendships of the great as another name for servitude when his talents made him known he accepted a place under the emperor he has attempted to apologize for his conduct by comparing himself to those quacks who indisposed with a severe cough sell infallible remedies for it is cure at the moment the poet rousseau was giving versions of the psalms he was occupied on the most infamous epigrams a living painter whose pictures only represent acts of benevolence and charity is as little generous as he is chaste  we have been told that the sensibility of stern was more that of the author than the man perhaps those who gave the information were incompetent judges but i do not find this any more difficult to credit than a circumstance which happened to klopstock this votary of zions muse astonished and warmed the sage bodmer who supposing him a poet of an advanced age and an enthusiast for retirement invited him to his residence but when the epic poet arrived he was found no proper associate for the grave professor he had all the levity and volatility of youth so very erroneous is the conception often of the form and manners of a distant author  johnson would not believe that horace was a happy man because his verses were cheerful no more than he could think pope was so because he is continually informing us of it he observed that dr young who pined for preferment contemns it in his writings it is singular that the sombrous author of the night thoughts was the first to propose a subscription for the balls at wellwyn this anecdote is from mr pyes commentary on the poetic of aristotle this work has great claims on the attention of the critical reader it is not as it is title would seem to import an arid pedantic and metaphysical discussion but elegant amusing and useful criticism young was as cheerful in conversation as he was gloomy in his compositions and when a lady expressed her surprise at his social converse he replied there is much difference between writing and talking are we to credit the good fortune with which some poets so often felicitate themselves any more than their despondence and menaces thomson paints the scenes of domestic love with all the splendid decorations of fancy but knew nothing of it is reality but a casual and gross indulgence  inconstant men will write on constancy and licentious minds will elevate themselves into poetry and religion moral men will venture to write what they would not act while others of inferior honesty will act what they will not venture to write  to prove that the writings of an author give no indication of his personal character we have instances so multifarious that to bring them forward might weary the most patient curiosity i consult my interest by repressing the desire of displaying my detections  it is necessary however to adduce a few that the reader may not flatter himself that he has discovered the dispositions of an author either by his style his mode of thinking or any other literary appearance he may assume balzac and voiture are so well known that i prefer them to show the illusions of style the letters of the first are pompous and inflated but his conversation was light and agreeable voiture who affected gaiety and gracefulness in his compositions was in his domestic language harsh and stiff for having frequented the nobility he ever assumed the seigneur the comedies of m de st foix are light agreeable and delicate his own character was remarkable for moroseness rudeness and insociability moliere so gay and spirited in his comedy was grave and pensive in society writers of great genius have felt themselves in awkward situations when the extraordinary sentiments they make their dramatis personae utter are maliciously applied to their own character an enemy of shakespeare might have reproached him with his forcible delineation of the villain iago crebillon indeed complains in the preface to one of his tragedies of something similar he says they charge me with all the iniquities of atreus and they regard me in some places as a wretch with whom it is unfit to associate as if all which the mind invents must be derived from the heart our poet is indeed a striking instance of the little alliance between the literary and personal dispositions of an author in his atreus the father drinks the blood of his son in rhadamistus the son expires by the hand of the father and in his electra the son assassinates his mother yet was crebillon the gentlest and most amiable of men and who exulted on his entrance into the french academy that he had never tinged his pen with the gall of satire the impiety of satan might equally be attributed to the poet and dr moore might be supposed the worst of men by his forcible delineation of zeluco a poet is a painter of the soul if he seizes it is deformities he is a great artist but not therefore a bad man  i spare the reader a number of instances that crowd on the memory and shall give only a few reflections which offer themselves one may display with artful elegance the moral brilliancy of the mind and with strokes of sentiment interest the heart by an animated eloquence but this may proceed from a felicity of manner and a flexible versatile and happy genius the writers heart may be as little penetrated by the charms and virtues he describes as the tragic poet would be incapable of committing the assassinations and massacres he commands in a verse or details in a scene  montagne appears to have been sensible of this fact in the literary character of authors he says that he likes to read their little anecdotes and private passions and adds car jai une singuliere curiosite de connoitre lame et les naifs jugemens de mes auteurs il faut bien juger leur suffisance mais non pas leurs moeurs ni eux par cette montre de leurs ecrits quils etalent au theater du monde for i have a singular curiosity to know the soul and simple opinions of my authors we must judge of their ability but not of their manners nor themselves by that show of their writings which they display on the theater of the world   this is very just and i am not yet persuaded that the simplicity of this old and admirable favorite of europe might not have been a theatrical gesture as much as the sensibility of stern  i conclude by observing that if we consider that he who paints vice with energy is therefore vicious we may injure an honest man and if we imagine that he who celebrates virtue is therefore virtuous we may happen to deceive ourselves in reposing on a polluted heart  chap xii of some private advantages which induce men of letters to become authors some private interest enters into his view who assumes the profession of an author such a motive fortunately exists for no reasoning man would voluntarily place himself in a situation fraught with burning anxieties and with sickening disgusts with hope mingling with despondence with felicity so variable that the utmost happiness of an author is as transient and rare as those fine italian skies we sometimes see in our unsettled climate  many are the motives which induce to become authors their motives like their misfortunes are peculiar to themselves but the utility they produce appertains to the public  some enter the perilous and brilliant career of letters as the only means of distinguishing their abilities and meriting public esteem to any other pursuit their situation or their dispositions may be incompatible the restless activity of genius torments their repose and they feel like a young columbus confined to a petty port these are men to whom glory becomes a kind of aliment deprived of which their passions like a concealed fire would secretly consume the frail machine of humanity for such it is as impossible to remain silent as it is for some to be eloquent they give a voice to their feelings in their works  others become authors as the only relief they find from the taedium of life helvetius has maintained the singular paradox that ennui produced many of our superior writers several authors have invented their works as so many schemes to escape from the pressure of life it was an assertion drawn perhaps from his own feelings a financier luxuriating in splendid opulence courted by each seductive form of voluptuousness already acknowledged as an elegant writer and a liberal mecenas could only have been induced by this motive to encounter the close meditation the laborious arrangement and the elaborate elegance of a work which he resolved should be posthumous it is to ennui we owe that numerous race of opulent scribblers who after reiterated ill success still pour their plenteous volumes on a wearied and incurious public marolles persisted to the last in his uninterrupted amusement of printing books and his readers having long ceased he was compelled to present them to his friends who however were not his readers there are many writers who pass their days in amazing labors and are veterans without being known as volunteers of some a private press is the literary horizon composition preserves their mind from what a french writer pleasantly calls the horrors of digestion it is well if they would only take their physic in private these are the shakespeares whose plays have been refused and the addisons whose spectators have never been read  others follow the avocations of an author as a means of subsisting on the produce of virtuous talents their moderate and precarious existence is more honorable than a ducal revenue and more precious than a contractors loan when we know that such a writer has never violated the dignity of human nature but has rigidly reverenced virtue and an elevation of soul has taught him to repel the insulting familiarity of the great his works receive a new and accidental value we pursue our meditations with confidence and we dwell on those fervid strokes which are the natural expressions of a great genius wrestling with a heavy and oppressive fortune  literature is indeed the only refuge for genius placed in obscure situations it is an avenue to glory open for those ingenious men who deprived of honors or of wealth may by their meditations sometimes obtain both or if they do not obtain either may be rendered superior to them to many young writers the idea may be consolatory and animating that the greater part of our first authors have ennobled themselves and owed nothing to their parents the great grecian orator was the son of a sinith the prince of latin poets of a potter the finest satirist and ode writer of antiquity of a franchised man the brilliant flechier of a tallow chandler the eloquent massillon of a tanner and the philosophers rousseau and diderot of a watchmaker and a cutler in england the most nervous of moral essayists was the son of one who kept a book stall the author of the pleasures of imagination was the son of a butcher and the greater author of the american revolution of a tallow chandler  genius has the prerogative of raising the inferior ranks of men to the higher classes of society this once obtained the age is just and the higher classes become inferior  we must not pass over in silence advantages better known attending the occupations of literary men those derived from studious habits would be sufficient to attach the elegant mind to literature if reason had much power over the passions the attraction is irresistible when reason itself becomes a passion  the pleasures of literature have long been a favorite amplification of eloquence and i quote not the admirable reflections or of cicero or of pliny familiar to every man of taste he who consecrates himself to letters escapes from the restless desires of the multitude the mephitic air of vulgar passions cannot reach him as we are informed of the pernicious vapor of the lake of the dogs in italy that if a person does not bend downwards it cannot affect him is he opulent he has sufficient firmness to remain enamoured of literary labor is he poor he has sufficient intrepidity to become illustrious the first effect of a love of letters communicates virtue and independence for he has silenced many private passions and inhabits the interior not the superficies of his soul  it is a curious observation of one martinelli an italian who to prove that study softens the manners says that rarely men of letters are assassins in italy duellists in france or suicides in england it is true we want not the opinion of martinelli because it has been elegantly said by horace repeated by the thinking hume and is to be found in every book of rhetoric in the first chapter  literature is the only consolation in those terrible afflictions when we are reduced by the privation of a sense to take our last refuge under the domestic roof blindness itself is no impediment to genius fatal to all it is an advantage to an active imagination it is powers collect more forcibly and burn more intensely it is possible to form a catalogue of men of learning who have projected and finished considerable works in this situation often too has the gate of the prison been the porch of fame and a slight indisposition conferred immortality a man of letters can never be said to be exiled or imprisoned  it is even to be supposed against the popular opinion that study is friendly to the constitution a life of letters is calm and uniform and cherishes the mild affections an author if he feels not too sensibly an occasional disappointment and can forgive the malice of an enemy finds his studies produce a happy influence over his health hourly acquisitions bring new delights and thought from thought is pursued with tranquillity and delight and tranquillity are medicines to the soul and promoters of health every production of taste respires a softening balm which sweetens that continuity of attention only experienced by men of study if an anatomist could describe accurately the sensations of a man of taste and explain this placable and harmonious play of the nerves no state of existence might perhaps be found more friendly to the human frame every one in the habits of study has perceived the influence of the mind over the body and addison has noticed the pleasures of the imagination as conducive to health on this subject the following anecdote is curious alphonso of arragon was a prince passionately enamoured of literature when he lay much indisposed and could find no relief from his physicians his courtiers brought whatever presents they imagined might amuse him panormita judged proper to present him with books among which was a quintus curtius which appears to have had a wonderful effect over the studious alphonso he heard with such delight the history of alexander the great that after the first day he felt himself relieved and before the conclusion of the work astonished his physicians by a perfect recovery he ever afterward contemned the doctors and their hippocrates and avicenna and said he required no other medicine while he possessed quintus curtius valiant hippocrates avicena et medici caeteri vivat curtius sospitator meus   the greater number of eminent writers have attained to an advanced age in an essay by dr rushworth a number of ages of great students are collected and his opinion is confirmed by sufficient testimonies bail still proceeds further by saying that study is not hurtful to the constitution even in early youth shenstone has however echoed in one of his elegies the vulgar opinion but soon the paths of health and and fame divide if by the path of fame our amiable writer meant study his ill health was never occasioned by profound learning  some perhaps will not deem as one of the inferior advantages of an author that of his admission among the higher circles if in the present age no writer can reasonably hope that his studies will open the golden gate of preferment or of fortune he may at least when he attains to eminence be certain of receiving the tribute which opulent vanity pays to his talents but an author is little indebted to such notice the attentions of a brilliant circle are illtimed it is perhaps twenty years too late it is also to be observed that few men of taste can accustom themselves to the refinements of opulent grandeur without creating artificial wants which they can never gratify and their future life may feel the irritation of pleasures not to be purchased and elegance not to be found to such may often be applied the exclamation of miltons adam when obliged to exile himself from paradise   how shall i breathe in other air less pure accustomed to immortal fruits the society of the great is little flattering for it requires a painful vigilance to preserve dignity with such associates dalembert has written an admired essay on the connection between literary men and these men a man of letters who had the misfortune of living with a lord finely said of him he would familiarise himself with me but i repel him respectfully an anecdote related of piron is not less interesting this man of genius had formed the most elevated notion of the dignity of a man of letters nor would suffer the literary character to be lowered in his presence entering the apartment of a nobleman who was conducting another peer to the stairs the noble stopped to make way for piron pass on my lord said the noble master pass he is only a poet  piron replied since our qualities are declared i shall take my rank and he placed himself before the lord  if the voice of an individual can weigh with an author it is when it speaks in a foreign accent the enquiry of an intelligent foreigner sounds like the distant plaudit of posterity fontenelle was never more gratified than when a swede arriving at the gates of paris enquired of the officers of the customs where fontenelle resided and expressed his indignation that none of them should have ever heard of his name  there are some hours in the life of a man of genius which it may be supposed communicate an exquisite sensation to his feelings it is when he perceives the world spontaneously pay their tribute of respect to his abilities it is said of corneille that he had his particular seat in the theater and that when he entered the audience rose to salute him we know what excess of honors was paid the expression will be pardoned by men of taste to the matchless voltaire spinosa while he gained a humble livelihood by grinding glasses at an obscure village in holland was visited by the first general in europe who for this conference suspended the march of his army and traversed a distant province rousseau attracted a crowd as he passed the streets and the people followed him with tears of affection as the apostles of genius and humanity lavater receives daily the tribute of posterity in the personal admiration of every traveller of sensibility and taste such are the voluntary honors of the human heart honors which no monarch can receive unless he is that singular monarch  a man of letters on the throne  i observe that this chapter on the advantages of men of genius is short and that it was with much trouble i could even give it this amplification  chap xiii of the utility of authors to individuals we have reason to believe that wherever authors are virtuous and free their nation partakes most of virtue and of freedom as on the contrary where they are dissolute and enslaved their nation have as little morals as liberty we want a dissertation on the influence of manners on taste and of taste on manners sir joshua reynolds in one of his discourses observes that in the ornaments of the arts we find the characteristical mark of a national taste as by throwing up a feather we know which way the wind blows better than by a more heavy matter  the morals of a nation are oftener directed by authors than by those modern apostles who possess vast incomes and stolen sermons authors are the preachers of morality and the arbiters of manners they perform the office of the censor morum and if they do not always live like the catos of their age their works may effect the same beneficial influence for like the language of cato they are so many reprimands for folly and remonstrances for vice  an author sometimes appears who gives a new direction to the national character in mechanics no impulsion from a single hand can communicate to a body the force of eternal movement in morals it is different for there an individual power can for ever endow with action the truth it impels these are the few authors who form revolutions not perhaps in the sublime sciences which are reserved for the contemplation of a few but in that happier knowledge which is of daily use and addressed to those who most want instruction these authors are not a newton and a lock but an addison and a fontenelle these two eminent writers shall illustrate this reflection the spectators introduced literature and morals in the nation the young the gay and the fair who flew from the terrific form of a folio were attracted by the light graces of a fugitive page since that happy moment the diffusion of taste and the curiosity of knowledge have produced readers who are now enabled to discern the shades of elegance to appreciate compositions of genius and to adjust the merits of ingenious competitors by the scale of philosophical taste we have become a reading and of course a critical nation a refined writer is now certain of finding readers who can comprehend him of all our great men whatever department they have illustrated who has left to the nation a more valuable inheritance than addison thousands hear the name of marlborough but the battle of blenheim leaves no impression the name of addison excites affection and his spectators remind the modest reader where he first gained instruction and the great writer where he first felt the influence of taste and where he still learns the art of composition  fontenelle operated the same kind of revolution in france before his brilliant wit and exact science were united learning was the solitary enjoyment of the learned astronomy and erudition were reserved for the astronomer and the erudit each spoke his own language fontenelle was their interpreter he explained vast totalities by gradual deductions and sublime conceptions by familiar ideas the lady at her toilette described the motions of a heavenly body while she was regulating her own and the beau monde had a finer penetration into the nature of oracles than the pedant van dale who had written so copiously and whom no one could read  these are the valued authors who delight and soothe their fellowcitizens the benefactors of every man a mind happily disposed imbibes their felicity of character we read among the persian fables of sadi of a swimmer who having found a piece of common earth was astonished at it is fragrance and enquired if it were musk or amber no replied the perfumed mould i am nothing but common earth but roses were planted on my soil and their odorous virtues have deliciously penetrated through all my pores i have retained the infusion of sweetness i had otherwise been but common earth  sadi ingeniously applies this poetical incident to the effect his mistress produces over him we may also apply it to an essay of addison or a dialogue of fontenelle which like the roses on the common earth impregnate with intellectual sweetness an uncultivated mind  those who feel with enthusiasm the eloquence of a fine writer insensibly receive some particles from it a virtuous writer communicates virtue a refined writer a subtle delicacy a sublime writer an elevation of sentiment all these characters of the mind in a few years are diffused throughout the nation among us what acute reasoners has the refined penetration of hume formed what amenity of manners has not addison introduced to how many virtuous youths have not the moral essays of johnson imparted fortitude and illumined with reflection  it is presumed that while they thus powerfully operate on the minds of their readers their own minds in the practice of their studies are influenced in a similar manner one of the most pleasing passages in the platonic shaftesbury is to this purpose and though we have already proved it not exactly conformable to facts it is not entirely a brilliant reverie our noble author comparing the writer with the sculptor and the painter says that there is this essential difference between the artists of each kind that they who design merely after bodies and form the graces of this sort can never with all their accuracy or correctness of design be able to reform themselves or grow a jot more shapely in their persons but for those artists who copy from another life who study the graces and perfections of minds and are real masters of those rules which constitute this latter science it is impossible they should fail of being themselves improved and amended in their better part that delightful enthusiast richardson the father in one of his fine dreams insists as others indeed have done that great virtue is necessary even for painters and that genius has been less or greater as virtue and vice prevailed in the mind of the artist when we read an amiable composition and observe the character of the author to be the reverse there appears an indecent opposition which revolts our sensibility and makes us contemn the writer as a miserable impostor  this science of the mind noticed by shaftesbury is not metaphysics but what has been happily called the proper study of mankind man acting in society the philosophic genius excels in the study of the world he derives this advantage from the obscurity of his situation the versatility of his mind and the habit of meditation those whose chief occupation is not reflection limit the knowledge of human nature to the particular society they are accustomed a courtier a lawyer and a merchant contemplate the human heart in different lights but nature is ill understood by those whose capacities are habituated to detect one principle among many she has no character but many characters she is not to be systematized but to be pursued the man of genius acts upon more general principles and makes the human heart his amusement and his occupation the theater conducted by such writers would become a national school but we must then have fewer pantomimes and such operas and comedies as we have now still fewer than pantomimes  the philosophical traveller enters no town but he feels the regards of a citizen and views no spot of earth on which the same sun does not shine and the same affections kindle as he gazes from the alps on the regions beneath his eye suffused with tears of pleasure and humanity he exclaims creations heir the world the world is mine goldsmith  chap xiv of the political influence of authors opinion says sophocles is stronger than truth opinion is the sovereign of man and authors who are the propagators of her decrees are some of the most important persons in society and may be called the ministers of state to opinion  an author has the singular prerogative of uniting in himself the powers that are portioned among the higher orders of society this reflection may appear fanciful to those who are destitute of fancy and extravagant to those who consider paper and pens as the composition of the manufacturer and who see nothing in them but rags and feathers  an eloquent author who writes in the immutable language of truth will one day be superior to every power in the state his influence is active though hidden every truth is an acorn which is laid in the earth and which often the longer it takes to rise the more vigorous and magnificent will be it is maturity what has been long meditated in the silence of the study will one day refound in the aweful voice of public opinion the chief magistrate can command the senator can persuade the judge can decide the soldier can conquer a great author obtains these various purposes at once by his solitary labors his truths command his eloquence persuades his reason decides and his works inspire a rival nation with a more enduring respect than even a victorious army  an island once inconsiderable in europe now ranks among the first powers arbitrates among other nations and the very title of it is inhabitants ensures respect is this owing alone to her commercial prosperity and military force one nation has the most flourishing mart of trade and another is one of the most martial people yet neither inspire mankind with veneration or affection to themselves is confined their rude language studied perhaps by merchants and corrupted as it is studied it is more by an interchange of opinions than of spices and specie that a nation is esteemed  not thus with england for she derives her splendor from her writers as well as her soldiers and her navigators an empire merely founded on force is surrounded by enemies and often it is sincerest enemies are to be found in it is own unparental bosom an empire distinguished by it is literature conceals it is martial iron under the sweetest flowers extends her conquests and diffuses her pleasures and among hostile foreigners acquires new friends  this truth we ourselves have experienced france preceded us in the studies of humanity and her polite literature more forcibly operated on the world than even her armies and her fleet her civility and refinement vanquished when these were defeated at that period in society when the intellectual tastes of men become so many wants these gave an universal diffusion to her language the nation that supplies a harvest for this appetency of the mind extends it is dominions in the hearts of the subjects of other powers thus pope with equal sagacity and taste writes we conquered france but felt our captives charms her arts victorious triumphed over our arms   let us now contemplate the reverse of the medal and the reverse is more beautiful than the face in the middle of the last century our manners were as unknown as our language and neither were yet formed and polished we were nearly regarded as valorous barbarians partaking of the glooms of our clime and whom nature had benevolently separated from neighbors more polished and airs more serene we now hold to europe models of solid sense and profound reasoning our late admired writers have made a neglected language the study of reflecting foreigners they calmed the national hatred of france and compelled even our rivals incessantly to celebrate our merits when unlike themselves we condescended not to exult but to perform our labors with a modest silence before our present unhappy dissentions it was our nation they sighed to emulate and the first writers of france passed into england to learn to think and write or thought and wrote like englishmen in france undismayed by the terrors of a corrupted government from our hands they received the germs of reflection and the flower of liberty this singular revolution in the human mind was produced not by our merchants or our admirals but by our locks our popes and our addisons they have subjugated the minds of millions by the energy of an intellectual sovereignty the works of english authors are now printed at foreign presses and this at least as much as the commerce and the force of england proves the ascendancy of her genius  the utility of men of letters to national purposes is not attended to by every statesman for few statesmen like other men in office are either worthy of or competent to their employments the author is considered by the great as a subordinate character in society as if the art of instructing men the art of a socrates was much inferior to that of governing them the art often of a nero or a sardanapalus and according to machiavel of a caesar borgia  political theorists however appear to consider the worst actions of men as of far less consequence than the propagation of their opinions a dangerous man may infect his neighbors but the dangerous writer spreads a contagion throughout a nation books and sometimes their authors have been burnt but even this mode of criticism was found ineffectual the flame which destroyed an individual ever enlightened a people and the burning of books has not yet been considered as their refutation  if those who administer the public duties of government were more closely allied with men of letters the union would be happy for the people and useful to both it is unfortunate that those who govern are not always the most enlightened the attic harris of salisbury in his philosophical arrangements has touched on this topic and adduced several splendid facts to enforce his judicious reflections he has shown that some of the most illustrious actors upon the great theater of the world have been engaged in philosophical speculations but what is more to our purpose we may observe that some of the greatest statesmen have attached themselves to a philosopher pericles had his anaxagoras scipio his polybius caesar and pompey their aristo and cratippus zenobia her longinus and plutarch said of alexander that he marched against the persians with better supplies from his preceptor aristotle than from his father philip  it is also very certain that the philosophical is not incompatible with the political character sir walter raleigh the de wits thuanus grotius sir william temple bolingbroke etc are sufficient to name literary men may become ministers of state but it is more difficult for ministers of state to become literary men     authors stand between the governors and the governed and they who practice the art of arranging their thoughts and of agitating the passions who at once penetrate by their reason and inflame by their eloquence are among the nations of modern europe what the celebrated orators of ancient rome and athens were among the assembled citizens they awaken they terrify they excite they conduct the people  ministers are constrained to watch till vigilance is exhausted and solicitude sleeps amidst the fluctuations of the public mind and this public mind is the creation of the philosophical writer is it to be doubted that since the immortal labor of montesquieu the old systems of government have been often changed it is certain the minds of the people have cromwell the penetrating cromwell was justly alarmed when he saw the oceana of harrington and seems to have dreaded the terrible effects of a little volume much more than the plots of the royalists the single thought of a man of genius has sometimes changed the dispositions of a people and even of an age the great frederick in his examen of the prince of machiavel observing that the minds of men are very different from the ferocious age of that italian politician says for which we are obliged to the writings of those learned men who of late have contributed so much to polish and civilize europe   with every creative genius that arises a new day rises with him it was montesquieu that introduced in his nation a taste for the solid and profound as well as the gayer and lighter studies  wherever the liberty of the press is established authors form as powerful a class in society as the highest for the great nothing remains but to annihilate the press or to respect the authors in rome a persius may have been compelled to disguise the name of a nero but in england the name of a tyrant will be hitched in rhyme authors are most to be dreaded in that country where the liberty and licentiousness of the press become a mere matter of sentiment and not of discussion and this sentiment is left to the people we who enjoy the freedom of the press in it is extreme degree have no reason to complain of any privileges of the great  the people consider authors as their property and not unjustly since the great suffer them to depend on the people the public are never slow to unite with authors who for the sake of preserving equality must continually humble the great the public as patrons are the most munificent as abettors the most formidable their favor is equitably obtained they expect an author to be the bold interpreter of their secret sentiments and the protector of their liberties as well as the artist of their pleasures if this author is persecuted he is never forsaken his cause becomes the cause of the people but if he should prove a wretched adventurer who artfully seized on an occasion to serve his private views the author is justly neglected and the cause alone pursued we live in an age in which an honest man begins to know his value and obscurity and poverty if adorned with integrity and philosophy are not injurious to the opinions of a great mind we consider that personal merit is superior to personal honor because it now includes personal honor the contrary will not hold nor has this always been so  the public are not displeased when the great become the patrons of their eminent authors it is a kind of homage paid to the sentiments of the people but the author may be a considerable loser if he values fame more than he does a pension  it is curious to observe the solitary man of letters in the concealment of his obscure study separated from the crowd unknown to his contemporaries collecting the materials of instruction from every age and every country combining with the present the example of the past and the prediction of the future pouring forth the valuable secrets of his meditations to posterity striking with the concussion of new light the public mind and forming the manners the opinions the refinement and the morals of his fellowcitizens  it is curious i say to observe such a man by some contemned by others hated by some degraded to an idler or an outcast and by others raised to a fancied monster a briareus extending a hundred arms and in every arm a brand of sedition an argus opening a hundred eyes and tracing the vermin of corruption creeping to their most hidden recesses in a word as aweful a figure as that of the vast mountain to which the caprice of a tyrant attempted to give a colossal form by commanding the people to hew it to his immoderate fancy  but the philosopher is not as of late too often represented this colossal iniquity legal authority is most secure when the people are most enlightened a simple truth which i leave to profound politicians to explain i shall only cite the sentiment of an old poet  de la majeste des loix appuyant les pouvoirs supremes fait demeurer les diademes fermes sur la tete des rois malherbe  it is a dreadful moment when the people and the great alike refuse the instructions of the philosopher whenever he appears terrible some great corruption pervades the state for he is only armed with truth the occupations of the philosophical student as connected with political speculations are therefore duties of an exalted nature some must give their hands some their blood and some their hours to the various duties their country exacts but there is a small portion of men who appear marked out by nature for the purpose of cultivating their thoughts in peace and to give activity to their sentiments by disclosing them to the people the physiognomy of their minds wears all that shining luster which distinguished the prophet after his immediate conference with the divinity for in their compositions good sense is embellished by eloquence and before they persuade they convince none but those who devote a life to meditation can effect these great purposes for they who govern a people cannot at the same time enlighten them  legislators of extensive views have ever protected and honored men of letters we have seen in this age two great powers in europe testify their public utility and who have been as solicitous to assemble philosophers as to form their armies prussia and russia under the government of two great sovereigns have shown how far by their aid an obscure principality and hordes of barbarians may be elevated in the scale of humanity the great frederick invited to his court the persecuted and unhappy literati and to this holy shrine of philosophy resorted many a literary pilgrim the imperial catharine has not only largely pensioned several illustrious writers but honors and animates by her gifts the attempt of every philosopher who produces a public utility if these sovereigns have displayed more art than humanity in forging chains for the freedom of men it shows that an antoninus and an alfred are more rare than a frederick and a catharine as the love of philosophy is less difficult than practical philosophy the only philosophy that merits the name  it is the philosophical writer who alone reflects on what is not done and on what may be done he goads the sluggish veins of government when a cold indolence spreads a torpor on it is unhealthful inactivity he teaches philanthropy to direct it is bounties in proper channels and this is no inconsiderable good for the humanity which distinguishes our age is often only retarded by an ignorance of it is necessities to perceive and pathetically to describe these necessities is reserved for the sensitive philosopher it is the characteristic of a man of genius in such appeals to our bosoms that his glowing mind pours forth those servid expressions that agitation of ideas those pictures of truth which communicate his own sensations and animate with his exquisite soul the souls of others the people are a vast body and men of genius are the eyes and hands  the thousand public utilities i speak not of the elegancies derived from the multifarious divisions of science and of art can alone be perfected by the philosophical genius truth is a certain point in knowledge ages succeed ages and that point is passed or not attained a philosophical genius arises seises and fixes it in the vast expanse of nature secured by it is own weight from the mobility of time a newton and a lock accomplish that in which an aristotle and a descartes failed but these truths which form so many epochs in the human understanding are covered in the sublime obscurity of nature how is the veil to be lifted from isis a painful meditation alone elaborates them into existence in the arts important discoveries are obtained by accident but the precious idea which depends on a long train of reasoning can never be formed by chance philosophers must meditate and too often their meditations are pursued at the cost of their felicity  yet let us not confound true philosophers with dreaming theorists they are not more engaged in cultivating the mind than the earth the annals of agriculture are as valuable as the annals of history and while they instruct some to think they teach others to labor philosophy extends it is thoughts on whatever the eye has seen or the hand has touched it herbalises in fields it sounds mines it is on the waters and in the forests it is in the library and the laboratory it arranges the calculations of finance it invents the police of a city it erects it is fortifications it gives velocity to our fleets in a word it is alike in the solitude of deserts as in the populousness of manufactories the genius of philosophy pierces every where and on whatever it rests like the sun it discovers what lay concealed or matures what it found imperfect  chap xv on an academy of polite literature pensions and prizes to deliver any novel observations on an academy for the belles lettres is difficult but it is more difficult to pass such an object in silent regret  the munificent hand of majesty has raised an institution to the mimetic art of painting and this is a legitimate claim which a prince the commencement of whose reign was adorned by an honorable love of the arts has to the estimation of posterity but why polite literature which forms the delight and the solace of a greater portion of the nation than this art should have received no such distinguished approbation from the brunswicks is not to the philosopher perhaps so much an object of surprise as of sorrow it must not be forgotten that several authors have received pensions dr henry dr johnson and at present mr cowper the poet have been honored by his majestys attentions but such solitary rewards are like fountains in the burning deserts of arabia one of his majestys most illustrious actions is his conversation with dr johnson in which an amiable and reflecting mind adds to the dignity of the monarch george ii remonstrated with lord hervey for writing verses which be observed might be proper in mr pope or those who lived by the business but very unbecoming a lord   i begin these observations with a literal transcription of the opening of sir joshua reynoldss first discourse the president says it is indeed difficult to give any other reason why an empire like that of britain should so long have wanted an ornament so suitable to it is greatness than that slow progression of things which naturally makes elegance and refinement the last effect of opulence and power  of opulence and power have the higher classes of our nation a deficient measure i doubt indeed if they really possess as a body or elegance or refinement the philosopher is not dazzled by elegance and refinement in manners he does not confound the brilliancy of equipages with the energies of the mind to his contemplative eye it is possible that an opulent and splendid nation may be barbarous and gross as we observe in the individual who adorned by the insignia of honor and loaded with incalculable wealth may at the same time have all the barbarity of mind which marks and degrades the lowest of the populace should the greater part of the nobility of any country be more partial to pugilists and jockies than to artists and philosophers the historian would be justified in recording that the genius of it is nobility was barbarous and gross it is almost peculiar to literature that whenever it is professors feel themselves contemned or neglected to vindicate their cause they have only to record this contempt and this neglect  i would ask why the art of writing is not deserving of the same regard as the art of painting and then i would enquire what painting can urge in it is own cause which will entitle it to a superiority over the art of composition  but it may be urged that an institution of this kind while it has been recommended by some has been opposed by others perhaps in our country it has never been examined with the attention such an object claims often it is defects have been rendered prominent and it is benefits omitted it is inabilities have been displayed and it is powers have been concealed it has often been regarded as a common place for ridicule not as a discussion for reason  johnson in his life of swift has given some plausible arguments against the academy which swift proposed the arguments of this great man more specious than just relate not to our present subject for the academy swift was desirous of establishing was merely an imitation of the french academy for the polishing refining and embellishing the language the english language now wants no academy for it is improvements it has few acquisitions to make but much to preserve  a literary institution might be formed in which the errors of former academies might be obviated and the advanced genius of our times might add it is own valuable inventions to improve the past is not difficult but whether such an academy would be a national utility is an important question not perhaps difficult to resolve  there is one kind of men to whom no student would address himself on subjects of science and taste at the siege of athens the barbarous sylla commanded the shady walks of the academy that resort of the muses which has left it is name to all future literary societies to be torn up and the hallowed trees to be converted into martial machines i address myself not to the living syllas who are as inimical to a modern as their ferocious model was to the first academy the omars of literature the expression be pardoned we know are the enemies of the homers  on the first glance we take of the subject the french academy properly so distinguished presents itself it is labors have not been great because it is object was limited to the cultivation of the language but it obtained it is object with all it is possible accomplishment i trace the history of french style in the harangues of this academy the first are cold dry and full of those common turns of expression which were doubtless considered as the curiosa felicitas but which by their reiterated appearance show the barrenness of their diction and the paucity of happy expressions the language was not yet formed and the academy had commenced with nearly an empty treasury about the middle volumes eloquence occasionally appears an accession of new turns enrich the harangues and if the style is not yet splendid it is not devoid of grace the concluding volumes wear a brilliant appearance a warmth of coloring a boldness of expression and all the seduction of animated eloquence if these volumes owe something to happier topics it is necessary to observe that some subjects not less interesting in the early volumes have all the deficiencies of style  some will urge that an author can himself perform better than a society and the dictionaries of furetiere and johnson may be quoted as having been performed without the aid of an academy  i would not deny that one superior genius is capable of obtaining what forty inferior ones can never accomplish and i even add that one great author can perform better than forty great authors no celebrated work has yet been composed by the united talents of several but many great men have conjoined their abilities in vain in various works  the mechanical operation of compiling a dictionary however i believe may be better effected by a society than by an individual the dictionary of johnson though perhaps it could not be more finely executed might have been considerably augmented by a society does not this great man himself hostile as he appears to academies inconsciously acknowledge their utility by complaining that his labor was not formed under the shelter of academic bowers  it appears to me that the happiest effect is obtained when an academy and an individual unite their powers i explain myself by the following circumstance  dalembert in his eloge of the abbe desmarais observes that the long articles of the french dictionary were written by him and that the public considered them as more finished and more satisfactory than the short ones dalembert gives the reason he observes that the brevity of articles of little extent allowed of their being the work of the whole society and that a society collected in a body disturbed in it is decisions by twenty different opinions which cross and destroy one another must with difficulty attain to satisfy itself and it is readers but on the contrary the great articles indispensably given to the care of an individual acquire in passing through his hands all the perfection which the selflove of the writer can give animated also by the academical fervor  this judicious reflection of one of the most judicious writers of france may serve to prove that a work is best performed by an individual but that an individual while he labors under the eye of a society feels a stimulative in that society which otherwise had been wanting  and this is the great end and utility of such an institution it is various advantages are perhaps sufficiently obvious but the vast influence it has over writers has not perhaps been sufficiently remarked it animates not only the individuals of the society but every individual who aspires to become a member of the society and to wear as voltaire said the blue ribband of literature by a distribution of prizes it diffuses an emulation to the remotest parts of the kingdom and introduces to the public those ingenuous youths whom their situation conceals from the world by it is own memoirs written by the members it forms the most valuable literary repositories in a nation to reflect on these advantages may not be useless  some of the inferior benefits attending such an institution are indisputable in these literary conferences the taste of every associate would become more brilliant because it would continually receive the attrition and contact it is to be supposed of the finest understandings in the nation the following observations on academies cited by goujet in his bibliotheque francoise vol   p     are from one of the numerous political works of the abbe de saint pierre they are too ingenious to be passed in silence he says what supplies among men the method of universities is the method of academies or conferences which are held on matters of their profession or their taste they do not hear a professor or a regent but they hear one another they hear with greater attention those who have acquired greater reputation in the company they improve by a reciprocation of observations they contradict their equals and they are contradicted and the authority of some the contradiction of others the dread of contempt or ridicule the desire of applause and of surpassing their equals the wish of being useful to our country animate all in their labor and augment their application and attention from which arises the growth and extension of mind   in cases of emergency recourse would be had to the academy and a robertson would not stand in such need as we have seen of the advice of an inferior mind the paradoxes in poetry of a johnson would have been opposed before their publication or at least the work must have issued into the world without the sanction of the academy which would have been a tacit censure the society should be provided with associates in the various classes of literature it should have it is grammarians it is historians and it is metaphysicians as well as it is poets it is orators and it is philosophers in this hive of literary bees no indolent member should remain a member all must be animation all must be labor and that no excuse may be framed of neglect to the cause of literature pensions should be given to those who may stand in want of them for pensions to all will not be wanted since some will labor for glory though some may also want bread  but even literary pensions have been ridiculed and it is not unnecessary to offer some reflections on them  there are two opinions relative to the state of men of genius one party imagine that no protection from the great or a court is necessary for the encouragement of artists and the other are persuaded that when honors and pensions are judiciously distributed it excites emulation in the young and gives that leisure to those on whom they are bestowed so necessary to some to cultivate their talents they think with boileau that un auguste aisement peut fair des virgiles  lord orford honorably known under the name of horace walpole a name that presents to the mind taste fancy and learning has said in his preface to his anecdotes of painting want of protection is the apology for want of genius milton and fontaine did not write in the bask of court favor a poet or a painter may want an equipage or a villa by wanting protection they can always afford to buy ink and paper colors and pencil mr hogarth has received no honors but universal admiration  i reply to his lordship that it is true the favor of a court knighted blackmore and pensioned quarles and both were miserable poets but if a court cannot convert dull men into men of genius it may preserve men of genius from becoming dull men it might have afforded dryden that studious leisure which he ever wanted and which has given us imperfect tragedies and incorrect poems in lieu of finished compositions and the regular flights of a noble genius it might have animated a gainsborough to form an english school in landscape which it is said was his favorite but neglected pursuit as for the equipage and villa of the poet or the painter these they leave to the idle connoisseur and the vain actor nor must we consent to the insulting observation that they may always buy ink and paper colors and pencils is it sufficient for a delicate and sensitive mind to have such implements to awaken the brilliancy of imagination is the picture uncommon to see a great genius with his pens or his pencils on the table leaning over them in that secret agony of spirit which murders fancy and spreads a torpor on the soul had chatterton been protected not with an equipage or a villa but with a pension the youth had not perished but this unhappy poet instructs us that pens and paper are not the only requisites to cherish genius  on the other side so different are the opinions of even men of letters on this subject the french writers and the greatest of them received their pensions without any injury to their genius continually point to england as a model of literary protection they tell us that addison was secretary of state newton and lock commissioners swift almost prime minister and prior an ambassador  if it is urged that the public are the best patrons and that several popular authors have left fervid expressions as memorials of their gratitude i reply that the public are more munificent patrons than princes provided that the genius of an author happens to take a popular turn but of authors few can be popular for most of the departments in literature require the study of many years and cannot be perfected till a late period such are all the exact sciences and every species of erudition the historian and the novelist may gratify the public taste but what is to become of the antiquary and the mathematician  it is one certain evil consequent to the want of patronage that a writer of great genius when he discovers that he has nothing but his talents and that the public attention must be roused by some extravagant novelty will consult the worst dispositions of the public because these are the most universal and instead of composing a beautiful poem he will write a dreadful satire instead of a history a libel and instead of a moral romance some scandalous memoirs  men of genius pensioned by a court will be enabled to indulge their own manner though it might not immediately be popular he who writes in the proper repose of mind and with regularity of application will give his own natural physiognomy and not that artificial countenance which those who court the mob are obliged to assume  if i am told that to accept pensions is not congenial to the free spirit of a briton i reply that literary pensions unlike others are honorable to the donor and the pensioner there is surely less servility in receiving a gratuitous gift from an enlightened monarch than the wages of an inhuman bookseller  there is i think a reward for literature of still greater utility than even pensions  the distribution of prizes appears of greater utility than pensions a pension preserves one man of letters but a prize may give birth to many he who must satisfy a judge and surpass a rival will not satisfy himself till he has surpassed himself he will not try merely to give a good work but the best and the vigilance of ambition will sometimes supply the deficiencies of genius if he is not yet crowned with the splendid reward he may merit the animation of an honorable notice if he cannot obtain a triumph an ovation may be reserved for him an ovation among the romans was a lesser triumph at an ovation the general entered the city on foot or on horsebock but in a triumph he rode in a chariot useful topics which might not have been attempted by an individual are dispersed about the nation we have seen lately a prize in the irish academy produce a valuable essay on the best means of providing for the poor subjects of national importance are not attempted because a vender of literature may not choose to undertake them a prize would bestow honor and assistance on the ingenious speculator it is by her prizes as well as by her academies that france has always preceded us and that her ingenuity is made to surpass our genius when the imperfect sailing of our marine was discussed january   in this year admiral gardner alleged the following reason for the superiority of the french in this particular he said to his knowledge the french ships sailed better than the english owing to their different construction whenever a ship was to be built in france premiums were offered for the best plan the several plans were then referred to an academy of sciences and the most perfect always adopted he entertained no doubt but if premiums were held out here for good models our ships would be much better  here we observe that an admiral on the subject of marine acknowledges the utility of prizes and academies and we presume that not one enlightened artist but would employ the same language respecting his own art by witholding these encouragements many ingenious artists have perished with grief and many have renounced their country and enriched foreigners with those improvements their ungrateful nation denied even their notice     while this academy for polite literature would be thus effecting a great national utility their own memoirs would be invaluable the academy of the belles lettres in france has formed a collection of historical critical literary and miscellaneous information unequalled in any nation our most accomplished historians cite them as their authorities the learning of a learned age is rendered instructive and what becomes dull and insipid in a salmasius and a scaliger delight with those who do not think knowledge consists in the heavy and unprofitable science of dates unconnected facts and titles of books but in reflection and in taste knowledge is only knowledge when it is rendered accessible to the nation it must be shown to and handled by the multitude and not preserved like an useless piece of antiquity in the collections of the curious  france had literary societies of every kind her provincial academies were numerous and i cannot but attribute her superiority in a fine and brilliant eloquence a language of criticism that analyzes and paints our sensations and their seductive art of composition to these lettered confraternities her religion was friendly to retirement and the retirement of studious men is rarely a barren leisure and a proud indolence it is a justice we owe to letters and to an extinct order of men to acknowledge the invaluable labors of many monastic societies of modern times to the port royal the european youth were long indebted for the initiatory books of learning and for versions of the ancients not yet neglected to the learned benedictines we owe their extensive literary history of france which though carried to    volumes in  to reaches only to the   th century many not less interesting nor vast might be mentioned labors like these can never be satisfactorily performed by any individual one may be permitted to devote himself to the composition of the work but many hands and many eyes must collect the materials and must watch over the execution we have no such literary history of england and i may venture to predict we never can if an academy of polite literature is not instituted  there remains one observation to be made on the beneficial effect of literary societies dispersed in the kingdom wherever such exist there will never appear in the vicinage a youth of genius but the members will perceive his abilities and will receive him or as a parent or as a friend a considerable number of the illustrious literati of france were first induced to devote themselves to study by the penetration of their superiors or having found an asylum in some monastery indulged their prevailing disposition  the institution of literary societies is so much desired and the want is so urgent that the discernment of individuals has of late attempted to supply this dishonorable deficiency by associations in the metropolis as well as in some of our provincial towns the manchester society has merited the approbation of the public i have the pleasure of announcing a volume of miscellanies in the press by a literary society established at exeter it is their first fruits   but we cannot reasonably expect that a private society will ever answer the ideas of the public and become of national utility de foe in his essay on projects who projected millions for the nation but was generally confined for his own debts gives some observations respecting the institution of an academy for polite literature but he chiefly regards it in the view of refining and adjusting the language he says p     that he was once a member of a society who attempted this noble design but it is failure he attributes to the greatness of the work and the modesty of the gentlemen and concludes by saying that we want a richelieu to commence such a work i believe it was not the modesty of the members nor the greatness of the work which occasioned it is failure but many other reasons which will always operate against private literary societies  a society of friends find no great difficulty to be pleased with the compositions of each other many will be admitted to such a society more out of affection than for their ability it is the great requisite of an academy that all the members should be professed students whose sole occupation is literature and whose life is devoted to acadedemical functions if pensions and prizes are added to the establishment we have then as perfect an academy perhaps as possibly can exist  this grand and desirable object can alone be obtained as such hitherto have been obtained by the sanction of the sovereign and the applause of the people such an institution would not alone be a national ornament for to hold out rewards to genius and to diffuse among the people the humanising and peaceful pursuits of literature has never yet been considered by politicians as a vain and an unimportant purpose  such is the wonderful influence of a love of letters in a nation that it has often disguised the deformity of despotism and rendered even a nation of slaves a polished a refined and a happy people  at the present melancholy moment when europe appears hostile to reason and to humanity let us indulge the hope that this institution may become the ornament of peace  of a peace that by it is duration may resemble the vision of an admirable philanthropist and a poor politician the vision of the abbe de saint pierre  an universal peace when the principle of government is virtue the action of that government will be peace governments are however always in war  sonnet from metastasio scrivendo lautore in vienna lanno      la sua olimpiade si senti commosso fino all lagrime nell esprimere la divisione di due
