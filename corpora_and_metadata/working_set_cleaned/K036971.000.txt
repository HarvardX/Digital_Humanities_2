the drama a poem  london printed for j williams no    fleet street mdcclxxv  dedication to arthur murphy esquire sir though i cannot boast the honor of a personal acquaintance with you yet it would be passing the severest censure on myself to declare i had not that intellectual one which the world in general claim with men of distinguished abilities i will not trespass on your delicacy by giving vent to the fullness of my admiration or by repeating what is already universally known and acknowledged i only solicit your patronage for the feeble offspring of a friendless muse conscious i cannot lay it before a better judge than you sir whose writings have been so long the prop and ornament of the drama and that if any thing can give it shelter it must be the protecting influence of your name  i have the honor to remain sir your most humble and obedient servant the author  the drama severe his task in these degenerate days who rashly dares to grasp one sprig of bays the frown of censure and pale envys blight long damp his ardour and retard his flight in form of critic lo where linked they stand with pride and dullness fixed on either hand pointing with rugged thorns the painful steep they never ascend though round it doomed to creep not so when greece and rome aspired to fame then critic and sound judgment were the same the poet sought the generous critics aid and the same laurel gave them both a shade with all the terrors beating at my heart a novice feels in first essays of art with greatest homage for superior powrs trembling i seek the muses sacred bowers sentenced in fancy ere my fate be known as churchills theme i have rashly made my own mistaken zeal with folly at her side often has the drama and its sons decrid gave the profession faults which nature knew and judged the many from an erring few strictures like these for laughter only call from their own weakness they must quickly fall let railing bigots and let pedant fools of morals prate and precepts taught in schools such clouds dissolve at merits dazzling ray as mists are melted by the eye of day shall he whose quickening animated frame electric like collects the poets flame whose glowing breast feels every passion roll and yields a body to great shakespeares soul gives him each ornament of art and grace and holds his mirror up to natures face not gain the meed of wellearnd honest fame garrick step forward and assert your claim here charmed attention could for ever wait fixed on thy beauties unconfined as great and wrapped in visions of thy magic skill indulge the transports which my bosom fill but what though language were to feeling true expressing strongly all in thought i view what could it add o garrick to thy name already foremost on the lists of fame warmed i may tell as different masks he wears we shake with laughter or dissolve in tears dwell on his spirit judgment taste and grace and the keen lightenings flashing from his face but once behold the wonders of his art you will find those drawn by nature on your heart to point his excellence or speak his praise but stamps fresh value on the poets lays next on the line yet distant barry stands and takes precedence of the tragic bands nor does presumption only prop his claim once genius warmed him with her finest flame in loves soft transports or its wasting care i feel each rapture every pang i share if in the moor by wildest passions pressed who does not find the storm assail his breast now worn with years and almost quenched his beam he faintly glimmers like the embers gleam yet in the sparks of his expiring light proves that the blaze which fired him once was bright thus the grand column or majestic dome reared in the splendour of old greece or rome though broke with tempests and by time decayed retain a greatness even in ruins laid though weak the million and to judge unfit still custom dubs them arbiters of wit their breath alone it is swells the trump of fame and sounds the poets or the sages name severe decree and most the actors bane whose art is tried by follys giddy train this macklin felt though merits sterling seal long passed him current in theatric scale grant him unequal to his daring aim did former service no indulgence claim too high ambition might have soared for praise but yet twas mingled with a wish to please thus far humanity and justice plead now let us speak as taste and candor lead dark was his colring but conception strong if hard his manner still it never was wrong warmed with the poet to the part he rose his anger fired us and his terror froze and more where quaintness shut out meanings day macklin threw light with fine discernments ray if these are truths which envys self must breathe applause should crown him with her greenest wreath where on her native quarry next to light shall the muse bend her melancholy flight now half her sons are swept by deaths fell power and scarce a gleam of hope remains of more o sacred fire which once with active heat in powells and in mossops bosoms beat where art thou fled or do thou only rest in garricks and in barrys feeling breast no replies genius i have found a part a favorite mansion in a female heart where steady judgment and fine taste prepare their richest offerings to detain me there behold where beauty in the shape of grace with sweetness beams from barry form and face there i reside enamored of the seat heedless of envy or ambitions cheat and never will quit her till my rival time shall ravish life as well as youth and prime a handsome figure with an easy mien are all smiths requisites to fill the scene flat without compass drawling on the ear in one dull tone thunvaried voice we hear no flame of passion ever yet he knew or changing character appeared once new person alone first gave him to the stage and habit guards him in this easy age reddish wants power themotion strong to raise but his attention gains and merits praise though voice and feeling small assistance lend he often has pleased and seldom does offend unless when folly fain would have him great and rant and stare usurp expressions seat o how it moves me to the taunting jibe to hear some groundling of thitinrant tribe york bath or norwich rank with drurys scene now frodshams gone and inchbald has been seen what though their lee boasts some faint strokes of art does he ever touch with sympathy the heart where is that grace that station which commands applauses tribute with her hundred hands his persons vulgar his deportments bad and tame correctness all he ever had hibernia whence the stage recruits her force has just sent lewis to the thespian course blessed with those happy requisites to please a person spirit elegance and ease how cold shone belcour before lewis came twas he restored him to the poets flame passions like his such genuine active fire may claim indeed the god of day for sire bensley has little save what art supplies for stepdame nature almost all denies gloom shades his aspect discords in his tone his joys as grating as his tragic moan yet such a charm can industry impart aided by worth and merit of the heart that he stands higher on dramatic line than he whose talents more than virtues shine of all her suitors in the thespian art thalia holds king nearest to her heart fixed in his eye the smiling goddess sits and thence deals laughter with its loudest fits ease and indulgence often at merits throne preferred their plea and claimed him as their own their wish obtained thalia then appeared struck with a danger which she long had feared her sisters sables and her tears she wore to woo the truant to her arms once more subdued the lovers fondness stood confessed and clasped his weeping mistress to his breast vowed to be constant to the suppliant maid till death dissolved the union nature made that part an actor in the bloom of life plays with success he takes to him for wife simpers and ogles with a withered face and trips the beau with antiquated grace though woodward once might boast of sprightly ease and every frolic wantonness to please why must he gambol after youth is fled and winter scatters hoar upon his head still there is a cast his talents to employ razor or bobadil can never cloy when partial nature gifts a favorite son with more than toiling art had ever won should not the muse if sloth the bounty mar censure the culprit who neglects her care shuter though blessed with humours richest vein and skill to reach the highest comic strain forgets his patroness and slights her boon and when he wants his part becomes buffoon as follys offspring sport in fashions glare fluttering in silks with wellbred shrug and stare the insect tribe dodd paints with nicest art and gives a double edge to satires dart nature has dealt to clinch with liberal hand talents which cultured might applause command but vain the grant and slow must rise his fame unless the manager will fan the flame brereton has person is not void of grace but wants the energy of voice and face in gay description or in polished ease his taste and judgment never fail to please and when by time he is ripened on the bow he will merit that success he wishes now let those whom pride attract not sense and choice expire in raptures at an eunuchs voice and feigning transports which they never felt at unintelligible nonsense melt for me a plain rough honest briton bred who often have erred but by my heart was led who though a monarch should his favors heap dare spurn at folly and at opra sleep i call on vernon if a sound must feast to stamp it with the currency of taste few can like bannister with humor strong do equal justice both to wit and song and could the muse award the mimic praise foot would not stand much higher in her lays faint as a shadow cautherley glides by and melts without impression on the eye when dibdins boast was a composers name he stood the rival of the authors fame till seized with madness not poetic fire he rashly dared himself to touch the lyre when phoebus shocked at discord not his own gave him to censure with her hiss and groan a greater bard on moodys brow has placed a wreath with which it ever must be graced conscious i cannot give increase of bays i will add at least my humble meed of praise quick wants not parts but shuter is the sun round which he moves and borrows all his fun in the harsh parent or the rustic boor dunstall and parsons show strong comic power palmer gives spirit to the sprightly scene by gay deportment and a pleasing mien but when he woos the tuneful queen of tears his accents wound the muses finer ears shocked at the sound we scarcely can believe that the same man could ever pleasure give without an effort weston gains applause nature has made him what the poet draws others with trick and stage maneuver aim to strike the groundlings and their clap obtain show johnsons drugger skilled in broughton art and scrub instead of fool a downright smart but he superior to such paltry aid never makes a jest but what his author made true humor free from taint of low grimace or wild distortion sits upon his face though laughter shake unconscious he receives the echoing plaudit public favor gives jews in marlow makes his audience feel that he has head and heart as well as heel the needy emigrant from gallias shore the butt of ridicule since time of yore who struts in frippery and tinselld stuff and jabbers nonsense as he scoops up snuff baddly with humours pencil strongly draws and meets as he deserves with warm applause cold and unmeaning aickin fills a part and never gains the head or moves the heart with jointed sound proceed his jarring tones like currents harsh and broke with beds of stones his actings vappid it wants feelings soul to warm and quicken into life the whole hulls always perfect and displays an aim to catch the poets spirit and his flame at times he soars beyond chill mediums line and shows some sparks of excellence that shine what numbers censure but how few judge right on subjects which demand the souls keen sight each puny witling from stark folly vain dares johnsons talents or a swifts arraign merit by malice not with taste they scan and damn the art because they hate the man it is certain melmoth has not gained that height on which perfection seated drops her flight his person too wants weight but then his heart springs in his words and animates each part apollo pleads his cause and dare the muse to hear her prince and patrons voice refuse wroughton has person and conception just but wants strong feeling to be ranked as first a happy aspect and a wish to please deserve at least if not extort our praise when surly winter with his felon train flies to some cavern on the howling main and blooming summer leads the sprightly hours then foot collects his vagrant sactterd powers poet and manager at once he stands and starts upon the town his motley bands it is rash to censure where the public praise gives to the actor and the author bays but sure applause should never be his meed who sports with faults which weyward fate decreed who breaks that tie which binds each noble breast and stabs his friend before he will lose his jest success is giddy as the veering blast and when it is not just can never last though now the senseless rabble may esteem the homefelt colring of his timewrought scene ages to come where poets should appeal will never laugh at what they cannot feel person and elegance are yatess claim they are her chief passports to the court of fame her actions molded into grace and ease and plaudits from the nicest judgment raise kindling she glows with all the pos fires and strongly feeling every heart inspires still with a sigh too clearly we behold the greatest spirit must with years wax cold youngs speakings just her action too is right yet seem like nymphs in boddice laced too tight what need so often the close joined hands to raise or bow like bramin in his idols praise and then that stalk which zanga well befits but never with grace on female softness sits yet spite of all her faults her merits shine and prove her yatess rival on the line how shall i treat thee hartley to preserve that homage candor and the fair deserve for sure if venus chose a mortal mould the radiance of her charms divine tenfold hartly had been the sacred envied seat to which a goddess may indeed retreat beauty like charity a charm spreads wide veiling a multitude of faults beside spirit and grace barsanti i allow and hope to see her what a pope is now macklin has judgment solid taste refined with every bright embellishment of mind no charm or spells within her dimples lie or fluttering cupids ambush in her eye sheer merit only and the force of skill first gained her trophies and maintain them still no touch of harmony can strike the heart with half that magic catleys strains impart but folly as if envious of her fame with gesture vulgar and uncouth proclaim that acting in a female should have grace or modesty at least to fill it is place of sterling humor green has ample store perhaps even clive was never blessed with more mark where in heidleberg the extremes of life like groom and peer are constantly at strife or else when termagant with luckless hit stumbles on nonsense in her search for wit and if a stanhopes precept have no weight you will own by laughter that her merits great no woman without beauty or great skill can or could ever on the stage excel that prop alone supports a melmoths name while the sad want prevents a mattocks fame if musics voice the throbbing breast can move or melting softness wake the soul to love if mild expression beaming from a face where sweetness revels with resistless grace can cold attention into rapture warm behold in baddly every power to charm what clive was once pope is as churchill told ere ripening time her talents could unfold late may the stage lament her absent aid and never till with equal genius paid how few can ever reach that happy line where sense and spirit by their union shine and softened into ease with nicest art assail at once the judgment and the heart that rarest talent abington alone possesses in perfection all her own what woman else with such a grace displays the courtly manners and true polished ease her skill gives sanction to vain fashions stare and makes the critic even folly bear fresh crowds press forward on the muses sight but pass like shadows at the approach of night so when the trojan future time texplore sought the dusk limits of the stygian shore the ghosts in throngs beset the hero round with feeble clamours and a shrieking sound but when he stretched the fading forms to chase their bodies melt he grasps the vacant space yet still these nothings insolent and vain expect proud reasons sentence to obtain then mark my tale and weigh the moral well if right conceived twill follys rudeness quell the vain florella once at prides command sat for her portrait to a famous hand the painter tried the utmost of his skill but found it baffled by the object still no trace of character or glow of heart flushed on her face to strike the glance of art in fruitless toil he saw his work must end when mind and soul no inspiration lend then bade the fool some other artist try sick of the task and laid his pencil by finis
