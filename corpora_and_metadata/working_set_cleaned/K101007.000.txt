fire and water a comic opera in two acts performed at the theater royal in the haymarket  by miles peter andrews  dublin printed by james and richard byrn no    sycamorealley for the company of booksellers mdcclxxx  advertisement this piece however singular it may appear was actually written and delivered to the manager long before any of the late disturbances  the flattering reception which this little opera so trifling and so temporary has met with from the public must chiefly be attributed to the friendly care and attention of mr coleman and the exerted abilities of all the performers  dramatis personae men launch a storekeeper at the dockyard mr bannister tremor mayor of the town mr wilson frederick his son a midshipman mr dubellamy sulphur mr gardner san benito a spanish jesuit mr

etc etc etc scene portsmouth  fire and water etc act i scene i a view of portsmouth dock the flat scene representing ships on the stocks artificers at work in their various employments  nancy discovered at her fathers door on one side near the front making lace launch is seen walking about among the men chorus cheer my lads and work away joyous jolly brisk and gay freely toiling through the day cheer my lads and work away launch advancing from his house hark the hammers welcome sound every stroke british oak makes the british heart rebound exit nancy at work with what joy my thread i would seize with what joy my fingers wear could i thus with so much ease weave a net to hold my dear winds and waves now bear him far far from nancy doomed to rove where amidst the din of war he perhaps forgets his love launch reentering hark the hammer strikes again every blow britains foe hears reechod over the main chorus repeated cheer my lads etc etc etc  launch to some of the workmen who advance that is right my boys always sing while you work a song in my mind makes labor easy in spite of mine and his majestys enemies     st workman so it had need master launch for we have enough of it these cursed french monsieurs find us constant employment   launch true but the harder you are drove now the faster we shall drive them byandby  bell rings come come get to your dinners i fancy your stomachs have struck twelve you must recollect too my lads that you are hereby insuring the defense of your country against mine and his majestys enemies     d workman damn your and his majestys enemies  for my part i dont care a chip for em and i dare say we shall give them such a welcome if they do come as will make them wish they had staid in their own country  thof i am told it is a bitter bad one   launch why that is the reason they are so desirous to visit ours but lose no time my lads i expect our chief lord down every instant and as he is a great friend to harmony i beg we may have no discord     st work how can we help it master launch when our wives are always complaining  it is unpossible to keep them in tune for we havnt time to wind them up   launch but consider i am a man of consequence principal storekeeper to his majestys yard here at portsmouth and know all the kings secrets and let me tell you if the french should come they will take your wives away from you think of that     st work why if that is all they will take away there is no such great matter because why we know the worst of it and i am told as how the french are civil enough to every bodys wives but their own   exit   st workman   d workman yes yes if that is the worst there is no harm done but damn em i was afraid for my religion i was afraid they would have taken away our religion and left us their own and be damned to them  exit launch to his daughter come here nancy you look gloomy child i hope you are not afraid of the french taking you away   nancy advancing no papa i have no such fears i assure you but can you wonder at my being pensive when one i hold so dear is now encountring the dangers of the sea or the attacks of the enemy   launch i will tell you what child i am a man of consequence and i could wish you to think no more of that midshipman that frederick so mark my words i am a man of consequence   nancy but my dear papa what objection can you possibly have is not he son to his worship the mayor and of equal consequence with ourselves   launch why there now is one part of my objection  quaking tottering neighbor tremor equal to a man of my consequence who am the kings officer for life and respected by all his majestys workmen whereas the mayor as you call him is only worshipped by vagrants and loses his honor in a twelvemonth   nancy but sir    launch besides is not he a republican tallowchandler who sells candles to the mob and forces us to light up for liberty and am not i on the other side the question and dont wish to have any hand in such stuff   nancy stuff papa   launch yes child kitchenstuff fit only for such fellows to deal in   nancy but sure sir my frederick is not to answer for his fathers folly he is himself a slave to no party and is he not bravely venturing his life in the service of his king   launch but what would you think if he should return from that service with only half an eye and a couple of wooden legs peeping through his pocketholes   nancy why love him the better for preferring his countrys welfare to his own safety  what would the world say if the daughters of england withheld their tenderness from those who most deserved it  song sure twould make a dismal story if when honor leads him on love should slight the cause of glory or disdain its wounded son if his countrys rights defending he should some disaster prove pity with affection blending will but more increase my love  launch well child i like your spirit but you know i have somebody else in my eye who agrees to every thing i say and thinks just as i do about mine and his majestys enemies  my friend ambuscade i mean a man after my own heart   nancy he may be after your heart papa but he is very opposite to mine  a capering strutting impudent fencing master always teizing one to death with scraps of old songs  i neither like his looks nor his manners  in short sir i wish you dont find him impose upon you very materially   launch impose upon me child  a man of my consequence yes i should like that amazingly  upon me indeed who have the care of his majestys royal dock and know all the state secrets   nancy yes sir and that i take it is the reason of his seeming attachment that he may get some knowledge of you   launch get knowledge out of me no damn me i defy him to get knowledge out of me  nobody would ever imagine that i knew any thing   nancy but let me beg of you to listen to my frederick consider sir good men are scarce   launch then learn to be content girl  you have got one good man already for your father havnt you would you have a couple to your own share you unconscionable baggage   nancy dear sir you are entirely out of the question but is not it very natural for a young girl to wish to be settled and    launch to be sure it is and so you shall but the men have something else to think of now the countrys up in arms at present therefore let me entreat you to keep yours quiet for a time  song when we sound and we thump it the drum and the trumpet when britain for vengeance and victory tries do you think that our youth to indulge a colts tooth will abandon their truth and their country forsooth to mine and his majestys enemies when our statesmen and heroes like caesars and neros have carried our arms and our fame to the skies then my girl if your mind is for wedlock inclined you may say something kind to all that you find but mine and his majestys enemies exeunt scene the street enter tremor looking cautiously about him all is safe i think  yes  icod this french invasion puts one into such a panic that one hardly dare to peep ones head out  ones functions are all in a quake  scarce eat and drink as we used to do  not a feast in the town hall these two months  dripping will be very scarce what noise is that starts oh nobody  then as i am his right worshipful the mayor the french would be very glad to catch me no doubt well what a dangerous thing it is to be in power i should certainly be thrown into the bastile they would take no ransom for such a precious captive  no  zounds what noise is that  enter frederick lord who have we here retiring to the side of the stage   fred hah my father what can be the matter with him   trem oh dear sir i beg pardon for being a little surpised  but pray good kind sir what news from  what is it you you dog how came you from sea   fred in an open boat sir and just landed this instant   trem why you havnt deserted from the ships crew have you i hope you were not afraid for i hate fear as much as i do the french dont disgrace your family frederick i hope you will shine as much as your father has done   fred never doubt it sir i like the rest of my countrymen only wish the french would lay aside their running fights and try a few broadsides with us and well convince them an englishmans heart like his climate though often overcast will soon clear again and show the world a glorious day   trem give me your hand  well son you are a fine longsix i am glad to see you burn so fierce  i knew you were cast in a good mould but i hate fear   fred and so do i too  though i bring rather alarming news  the combined fleet is actually in the channel  i was ordered on shore on purpose to give you information   trem zounds you dont say so o lud what shall i do  what shall i do   fred and they are bearing down as fast as they can   trem dear me dear me and i shall be laid hold of first for being in power and who knows but my very friends may turn against me  attacked in my own mansion house i may be knocked down by my own macebearer or run through the body with myown sword of state   fred dont be so alarmed sir you should think of putting the place in a state of defense   trem so i will  o gracious what a situation well i will put the town in a state of defense  zounds i will embody the whole corporation  and to encourage them order them two gallons of porter with an allowance of bread and cheese and a pint of wine for the officers  dont you think they will make a good stand   fred doubtless sir if you dont go to fislycuffs yourselves  you should never smite one another because it gives the public an opportunity of having so many strokes at you   trem ha ha ha a good hit in faith  but mum  you know we must not touch up the great whatever we think however if some folks above had done some things below why some things would not have been so middling   fred dont deceive yourself my dear father believe me every nerve of britain is exerted nor need we fear while our veteran commanders feel all the fire of youth and our infant prince the intrepidity of manhood  song the hardy sons of britains isle undaunted yield their breath and cheer their country with a smile in danger and in death when peace with softened brow invites and every hours serene they seek fair virtues calm delights and court the tranquil scene when hostile troops invade their shores they move in dread array resentment all its fury pours and terror marks their way  trem well i am alive again  there is nothing like a good heart and now for the french  shout without lord what is that noise   fred it is only the shout of the sailors in the harbor   trem is that all i was afraid the enemy was already landed but i am glad they are not come yet because  it gives one time for preparation to show that  one is not afraid of them  song if ever they venture to land on our coast myself i will march to attack em and soon they shall learn to know who rules the roast odzooks how well cut em and hack em drum beats lord bless me they are coming good heaven preserve us this piping and drumming has made me so nervous come son let us retire and fall into the rear  how i long to be at em you know i hate fear drum beats oh dear i hate fear oh dear etc exeunt scene iii a chamber belonging to sulphur various implements dark lanthorns electrical apparatus etc etc etc sulphur sitting at a table in a

element a perfect salamander before he was transported he had burnt down two methodist meeting houses to prevent bigotry three prisons to promote the liberty of the subject and half a dozen of his own apartments to save trouble of moving furniture in another year he would have broke all the fireoffices in town   enter san benito muffled in a cloak which he throws aside and discovers the dress of a catholic priest san ben well my dear sulphur is every thing prepared for execution   sulph all is ready thank heaven my good father san banito   san ben that is right that is right  for from certain intelligence i hear the french are to land this afternoon and i hope ere tomorrow to see the dockyard in a blaze   sulph that will be a bright prospect indeed but have you secured the families in our interest whose consciences you manage   san benito why not entirely the catholics are grown more squeamish  and will do nothing now to hurt their country for conscience sake   sulph how i hate such unconscientious dogs   san ben i have indeed prevailed over a married lady of some distinction to favor our plot by giving her absolution for past and indulgence for future intrigues but the husband though a good catholic cannot be persuaded that he shall live better under any other government   sulph why the mans no fool  damn his sense   san benito one thing however i have obtained he has promised me not to drive his cattle up till he cannot help it   sulph why that is something to be sure for the french will bring very voracious appetites from sea but have you been able to do any good at the camps   san ben not much there  they are so cursed loyal to their country that i believe they wish for nothing better than an opportunity of dying in its defense   sulph pray heaven they may but have you brought nobody over to your cause   san ben yes a few  i have secured twenty jacobite drummers five disaffected suttlers fifty raw recruits and all the contractors to a man   sulph how did you manage that   san ben by promising them the popes contract for salt fish every lent season   sulph well done father that was securing their interest by encouraging their principle but could you not have prevailed upon them to poison the bread that would have done the business at once   san ben so it would but i thought it of no great consequence   sulph how so   san ben because they say it is half poison already   sulph psha this doing things by alves master jesuit is doing nothing   san ben  taking fire nothing do you call it havnt i made my sanctity the means of introducing me into families in order to betray their confidence  have not i    sulph nonsense what signifies your sanctity it is not the fashion here  the appearance of it indeed was necessary among the saints at boston  but    san ben but  but what sir  have not i exposed my person for your sake havnt i written seditious paragraphs in the news papers for these three months past in order to divide the people  the only way the english ever can fall   sulph trifles   san ben havnt i kept in pay all the foreign servants in town in order to betray their masters secrets sblood did not my hairdresser bring over the heads of a plot in papillotes   sulph well my good father to serve your own purposes   san ben yours mr sulphur to carry on your infernal schemes for a set of fellows who have neither gratitude nor recollection   sulph false by the congress   san ben congress senators in woollen nightcaps and flannel petticoats  and generals from shopboards greenstalls and night cellars   sulph oh heavens what

throats instead of other peoples fie for shame  let the tempest of war singing ha ha  lunging   sulph why he should not abuse the congress he knows it is a sore part can i help it if the members have not learned to dance   san ben and he should not undervalue my services are we not all embarked in the same cause   ambus so you are disputing about your gentility are you a very pretty employment for a mongrel american and a discarded jesuit  the priest calls the lawyer a cheat cannot you be content to impose upon mankind and laugh at em too as i do  for why should we quarrel for riches ah  ah fencing   sulph well but mr ambuscade how stand your affairs with old launch  have you played upon the weakness of his girl my little merry one   ambus what kiss and tell my buck of brimstone hit me in the flanconade if i do  we frenchmen for you know i was born in paris though i dont choose to own it we frenchmen i say are formed for intrigue  for we have nothing more to do but to swear we will be true and then we may kiss but mum mum mum ha hah  sa sa  lunging   san ben psha pox take love have you got us admission into the dock yard and storehouses can our plan be put in execution   ambus all will be ready at the time appointed the consequential old fool launch and i are hand and glove as thick as mustard   sulph then be sure to bite him hard   san ben certainly always strike when the

gilderoy was a bonny boy  he was hanged too   sulph a great man heaven knows john was a pretty fellow if he had not been so indiscreet as to commit a few burglaries he would have merited canonization   san ben if you are so nice master sulphur i am afraid few of your countrymen will obtain that honor   sulph no more of your sarcasms good father  if i live i will hang that jesuit  aside   ambus come come we must join against the common foe or we shall ruin the cause you are just like the english always quarrelling with their enemies or each other   kiss curse you curse kiss you and fight  sings ha ha  lunging cannot you follow my example are we not going to fire the whole town and do not i appear as happy as if i was going to make all the world so   san ben true but quarrelling you know is your profession   ambus yes but there is nothing i dislike so much for all that  song though i practice the science of arms yet trust me i think it an evil and fighting for me has such charms that i would rather shake hands with the devil shakes hands with both i aim the blow at friend and foe but still i look pleased all the while i hit my mark secure in the dark retire and advance sing caper

wellmeant toil cheered my return with glistning eyes and paid me with a smile  nancy  rising after the song ah my dear frederick you see your power over me but i am so overjoyed to behold you returned safe from the enemy that i cannot help expressing my tenderness   fred and believe me my charming nancy when in pursuit of that enemy your idea would intrude itself and sometimes steal away my attention from duty but to remove every future apprehension give me your hand without delay   nancy so i would instantly my dear frederick if we could only obtain my fathers concurrence to place us a little above want for i cannot persuade myself in return for your affection to bring a beggar to your arms  ballad for thee all the hardships of life i could bear and brave the attacks of misfortune and care but care and misfortune my mind would subdue if the friend of my heart would partake of them too had fate from its bounty propitiously lent enough but to furnish the cot of content the dictates of love in that cot i would pursue for the friend of my heart would partake of it too but nancy with naught but her truth to endear with nothing to lend to distress but a tear can never look for comfort with ruin in view and the friend of her heart to partake of it too  fred the more i admire the generosity of your temper the more i regret your resolution but how are you certain my dear girl your father will not consent to our union   nancy i am convinced he will not not only from his inveteracy to yours but from his unaccountable attachment to ambuscade who cajoles him just as he pleases   fred well then let him keep his consent and his fortune to himself while my country wants a seaman or i have an arm to lift in her defense we can never want a support   nancy but let us not be rash my frederick if we could but convince him that this ambuscade was some designing fellow which i shrewdly suspect he is much might be done   fred you are right   nancy they say he is a frenchman i have seen two strange persons frequently in his company and i cannot but think he has some bad intentions which he endeavors to conceal under the appearance of gaiety   fred true i will watch his motions and probably    nancy hush hush here he comes step behind there quick and you will probably hear more  frederick hides himself behind one of the great guns   enter ambuscade ha ha
