two letters addressed to a member of the present parliament on the proposals for peace with the regicide directory of france by the right hon edmund burke  london printed for f and c rivington st pauls churchyard    0  letter i on the overtures of peace my dear sir our last conversation though not in the tone of absolute despondency was far from cheerful we could not easily account for some unpleasant appearances they were represented to us as indicating the state of the popular mind and they were not at all what we should have expected from our old ideas even of the faults and vices of the english character the disastrous events which have followed one upon another in a long unbroken funereal train moving in a procession that seemed to have no end these were not the principal causes of our dejection we feared more from what threatened to fail within than what menaced to oppress us from abroad to a people who have once been proud and great and great because they were proud a change in the national spirit is the most terrible of all revolutions   shall not live to behold the unravelling of the intricate plot which saddens and perplexes the awful drama of providence now acting on the moral theater of the world whether for thought or for action i am at the end of my career you are in the middle of yours in what part of it is orbit the nation with which we are carried along moves at this instant it is not easy to conjecture it may perhaps be far advanced in its aphelion  but when to return  not to lose ourselves in the infinite void of the conjectural world our business is with what is likely to be affected for the better or the worse by the wisdom or weakness of our plans in all speculations upon men and human affairs it is of no small moment to distinguish things of accident from permanent causes and from effects that cannot be altered it is not every irregularity in our movement that is a total deviation from our course i am not quite of the mind of those speculators who seem assured th necessarily and by the constitution of things  states have the same periods of infancy manhoo and decrepitude that are found in the individuals who compose them parallels of this sort rather furnish similitudes to illustrate or to adorn than to supply analogies from whence to reason the objects which are attempted o be forced into an analogy are not found in the same classes of existence individuals are physical beings subject to laws universal and invariable the immediate cause acting in these laws may be obscure the general results are subjects of certain calculation but commonwealths are not physical but moral essences they are artificial combinations and in their proximate efficient cause the arbitrary productions of the human mind we are not yet acquainted with the laws which necessarily influence the stability of that kind of work made by that kind of agent there is not in the physical order with which they do not appear to hold any assignable connection a distinct cause by which any of those fabrics must necessarily grow flourish or decay nor in my opinion does the moral world produce any thing more determinate on that subject than what may serve as an amusement liberal indeed and ingenious but still only an amusement for speculative men i doubt whether the history of mankind is yet complete enough if ever it can be so to furnish grounds for a sure theory on the internal causes which necessarily affect the fortune of a state i am far from denying the operation of such causes but they are infinitely uncertain and much more obscure and much more difficult to trace than the foreign causes that tend to raise to depress and sometimes to overwhelm a community  it is often impossible in these political enquiries to find any proportion between the apparent force of any moral causes we may assign and their known operation we are therefore obliged to deliver up that operation to mere chance or more piously perhaps more rationally to the occasional interposition and irresistible hand of the great disposer we have seen states of considerable duration which for ages have remained nearly as they have begun and could hardly be said to ebb or flow some appear to have spent their vigor at their commencement some have blazed out in their glory a little before their extinction the meridian of some has been the most splendid others and they the greatest number have fluctuated and experienced at different periods of their existence a great variety of fortune at the very moment when some of them seemed plunged in unfathomable abysses of disgrace and disaster they have suddenly emerged they have begun a new course and opened a new reckoning and even in the depths of their calamity and on the very ruins of their country have laid the foundations of a towering and durable greatness all this has happened without any apparent previous change in the general circumstances which had brought on their distress the death of a man at a critical juncture his disgust his retreat his disgrace have brought innumerable calamities on a whole nation a common soldier a child a girl at the door of an inn have changed the face of fortune and almost of nature  such and often influenced by such causes has commonly been the fate of monarchies of long duration they have their ebbs and their flows this has been eminently the fate of the monarchy of france there have been times in which no power has ever been brought so low few have ever flourished in greater glory by turns elevated and depressed that power had been on the whole rather on the increase and it continued not only powerful but formidable to the hour of the total ruin of the monarchy this fall of the monarchy was far from being preceded by any exterior symptoms of decline the interior were not visible to every eye and a thousand accidents might have prevented the operation of what the most clearsighted were not able to discern nor the most provident to divine a very little time before its dreadful catastrophe there was a kind of exterior splendor in the situation of the crown which usually adds to government strength and authority at home the crown seemed then to have obtained some of the most splendid objects of state ambition none of the continental powers of europe were the enemies of france they were all either tacitly disposed to her or publicly connected with her and in those who kept the most aloof there was little appearance of jealousy of animosity there was no appearance at all the british nation her great preponderating rival she had humbled to all appearance she had weakened certainly had endangered by cutting off a very large and by far the most growing part of her empire in that it is acme of human prosperity and greatness in the high and palmy state of the monarchy of france it fell to the ground without a struggle it fell without any of those vices in the monarch which have sometimes been the causes of the fall of kingdoms but which existed without any visible effect on the state in the highest degree in many other princes and far from destroying their power had only left some slight stains on their character the financial difficulties were only pretexts and instruments of those who accomplished the ruin of that monarchy they were not the causes of it  deprived of the old government deprived in a manner of all government france fallen as a monarchy to common speculators might have appeared more likely to be an object of pity or insult according to the disposition of the circumjacent powers than to be the scourge and terror of them all but out of the tomb of the murdered monarchy in france has arisen a vast tremendous unformed spectre in a far more terrific guise than any which ever yet have overpowered the imagination and subdued the fortitude of man going straight forward to it is end unappalled by peril unchecked by remorse despising all common maxims and all common means that hideous phantom overpowerd those who could not believe it was possible she could at all exist except on the principles which habit rather than nature had persuaded them were necessary to their own particular welfare and to their own ordinary modes of action but the constitution of any political being as well as that of any physical being ought to be known before one can venture to say what is fit for it is conservation or what is the proper means of it is power the poison of other states is the food of the new republic that bankruptcy the very apprehension of which is one of the causes assigned for the fall of the monarchy was the capital on which she opened her traffic with the world  the republic of regicide with an annihilated revenue with defaced manufactures with a ruined commerce with an uncultivated and half depopulated country with a discontented distressed enslaved and famished people passing with a rapid eccentrick incalculable course from the wildest anarchy to the sternest despotism has actually conquered the finest parts of europe has distressed disunited deranged and broke to pieces all the rest and so subdued the minds of the rulers in every nation that hardly any resource presents itself to them except that of entitling themselves to a contemptuous mercy by a display of their imbecility and meanness even in their greatest military efforts and the greatest display of their fortitude they seem not to hope they do not even appear to wish the extinction of what subsists to their certain ruin their ambition is only to be admitted to a more favored class in the order of servitude under that domineering power  this seems the temper of the day at first the french force was too much despised now it is too much dreaded as inconsiderate courage has given way to irrational fear so it may be hoped that through the medium of deliberate sober apprehension we may arrive at steady fortitude who knows whether indignation may not succeed to terror and the revival of high sentiment spurning away the delusion of a safety purchased at the expense of glory may not yet drive us to that generous despair which has often subdued distempers in the state for which no remedy could be found in the wisest councils  other great states having been without any regular certain course of elevation or decline we may hope that the british fortune may fluctuate also because the public mind which greatly influences that fortune may have it is changes we are therefore never authorized to abandon our country to it is fate or to act or advise as if it had no resource there is no reason to apprehend because ordinary means threaten to fail that no others can spring up whilst our heart is whole it will find means or make them the heart of the citizen is a perennial spring of energy to the state because the pulse seems to intermit we must not presume that it will cease instantly to beat the public must never be regarded as incurable i remember in the beginning of what has lately been called the seven years war that an eloquent writer and ingenious speculator dr brown upon some reverses which happened in the beginning of that war published an elaborate philosophical discourse to prove that the distinguishing features of the people of england had been totally changed and that a frivolous effeminacy was become the national character nothing could be more popular than that work it was thought a great consolation to us the light people of this country who were and are light but who were not and are not effeminate that we had found the causes of our misfortunes in our vices pythagoras could not be more pleased with his leading discovery but whilst in that splenetick mood we amused ourselves in a four critical speculation of which we were ourselves the objects and in which every man lost his particular sense of the public disgrace in the epidemic nature of the distemper whilst as in the alps goitre kept goitre in countenance whilst we were thus abandoning ourselves to a direct confession of our inferiority to france and whilst many very many were ready to act upon a sense of that inferiority a few months effected a total change in our variable minds we emerged from the gulf of that speculative despondency and were buoyed up to the highest point of practical vigor never did the masculine spirit of england display itself with more energy nor ever did it is genius soar with a prouder preeminence over france than at the time when frivolity and effeminacy had been at least tacitly acknowledged as their national character by the good people of this kingdom  for one if they be properly treated i despair neither of the public fortune nor of the public mind there is much to be done undoubtedly and much to be retrieved we must walk in new ways or we can never encounter our enemy in his devious march we are not at an end of our struggle nor near it let us not deceive ourselves we are at the beginning of great troubles i readily acknowledge that the state of public affairs is infinitely more unpromising than at the period i have just now alluded to and the position of all the powers of europe in relation to us and in relation to each other is more intricate and critical beyond all comparison difficult indeed is our situation in all situations of difficulty men will be influenced in the part they take not only by the reason of the case but by the peculiar turn of their own character the same ways to safety do not present themselves to all men nor to the same men in different tempers there is a courageous wisdom there is also a false reptile prudence the result not of caution but of fear under misfortunes it often happens that the nerves of the understanding are so relaxed the pressing peril of the hour so completely confounds all the faculties that no future danger can be properly provided for can be justly estimated can be so much as fully seen the eye of the mind is dazzled and vanquished an abject distrust of ourselves an extravagant admiration of the enemy present us with no hope but in a compromise with his pride by a submission to his will this short plan of policy is the only counsel which will obtain a hearing we plunge into a dark gulf with all the rash precipitation of fear the nature of courage is without a question to be conversant with danger but in the palpable night of their terrors men under consternation suppo not that it is the danger which by a sure instinct calls out the courage to resist it but that it  he courage which produces the danger they therefore seek for a refuge from teir fears in the fears themselves and consider a temporizing meanness as the only source of safety  the rules and definitions of prudence can rarely be exact never universal i do not deny that in small truckling states a timely compromise with power has often been the means and the only means of drawling out their puny existence but a great state is too much envied too much dreaded to find safety in humiliation to be secure it must be respected power and eminence and consideration are things not to be begged they must be commanded and they who supplicate for mercy from others can never hope for justice through themselves what justice they are to obtain as the alms of an enemy depends upon his character and that they ought well to know before they implicitly confide  much controversy there has been in parliament and not a little amongst us out of doors about the instrumental means of this nation toward the maintenance of her dignity and the assertion of her rights on the most elaborate and correct detail of facts the result seems to be that at no time has the wealth and power of great britain been so considerable as it is at this very perilous moment we have a vast interest to preserve and we possess great means of preserving it but it is to be remembered that the artificer may be incumbered by his tools and that resources may be among impediments if wealth is the obedient and laborious slave of virtue and of public honor then wealth is in it is place and has it is use but if this order is changed and honor is to be sacrificed to the conservation of riches riches which have neither eyes nor hands nor any thing truly vital in them cannot long survive the being of their vivifying powers their legitimate masters and their potent protectors if we command our wealth we shall be rich and free if our wealth commands us we are poor indeed we are bought by the enemy with the treasure from our own coffers too great a sense of the value of a subordinate interest may be the very source of it is danger as well as the certain ruin of interests of a superior order often has a man lost his all because he would not submit to hazard all in defending it a display of our wealth before robbers is not the way to restrain their boldness or to lessen their rapacity this display is made i know to persuade the people of england that thereby we shall awe the enemy and improve the terms of our capitulation it is made not that we should fight with more animation but that we should supplicate with better hopes we are mistaken we have an enemy to deal with who never regarded our contest as a measuring and weighing of purses he is the gaul that puts his sword into the scale he is more tempted with our wealth as booty than terrifid with it as power but let us be rich or poor let us be either in what proportion we may nature is false or this is true that where the essential public force of which money is but a part is in any degree upon a par in a conflict between nations that state which is resolved to hazard it is existence rather than to abandon it is objects must have an infinite advantage over that which is resolved to yield rather than to carry it is resistance beyond a certain point humanly speaking that people which bounds it is efforts only with it is being must give the law to that nation which will not push it is opposition beyond its convenience  if we look to nothing but our domestic condition the state of the nation is full even to plethory but if we imagine that this country can long maintain it is blood and it is food as disjoined from the community of mankind such an opinion does not deserve refutation as absurd but pity as insane  i do not know that such an improvident and stupid selfishness deserves the discussion which perhaps i may bestow upon it hereafter we cannot arrange with our enemy in the present conjuncture without abandoning the interest of mankind if we look only to our own petty peculium in the war we have had some advantanges advantages ambiguous in their nature and dearly bought we have not in the slightest degree impaired the strength of the common enemy in any one of those points in which his particular force consists at the same time that new enemies to ourselves new allies to the regicide republic have been made out of the wrecks and fragments of the general confederacy so far as to the selfish part as composing a part of the community of europe and interested in it is fate it is not easy to conceive a state of things more doubtful and perplexing when louis the xivth had made himself master of one of the largest and most important provinces of spain when he had in a manner overrun lombardy and was thundering at the gates of turin when he had mastered almost all germany on this side the rhine when he was on the point of ruining the august fabric of the empire when with the elector of bavaria in his alliance hardly any thing interposed between him and vienna when the turk hung with a mighty force over the empire on the other side i do not know that in the beginning of   0  that is in the third year of the renovated war with louis the xiv the state of europe was so truly alarming to england it certainly was not holland and holland is a matter to england of value inestimabl was then powerful was then independent and though greatly endangered was then full of energy and spirit but the great resource of europe was in england not in a sort of england detached from the rest of the world and amusing herself with the puppet show of a naval power it can be no better whilst all the sources of that power and of every sort of power are precarious but in that sort of england who considered herself as embodied with europe but in that sort of england who sympathetick with the adversity or the happiness of mankind felt that nothing in human affairs was foreign to her we may consider it as a sure axiom that as on the one hand no confederacy of the least effect or duration can exist against france of which england is not only a part but the head so neither can england pretend to cope with france but as connected with the body of christendom  our account of the war as a war of communion to the very point in which we began to throw out lures oglings and glances for peace was a war of disaster and of little else the independent advantages obtained by us at the beginning of the war and which were made at the expense of that common cause if they deceive us about our largest and our surest interest are to be reckoned amongst our heaviest losses  the allies and great britain amongst the rest and perhaps amongst the foremost have been miserably deluded by this great fundamental error that it was in our power to make peace with this monster of a state whenever we chose to forget the crimes that made it great and the designs that made it formidable people imagined that their ceasing to resist was the sure way to be secure this pale cast of thought ficklied over all their enterprises and turned all their politics awrythey could not or rather they would not read in the most unequivocal declarations of the enemy and in his uniform conduct that more safety was to be found in the most arduous war than in the friendship of that kind of being it is hostile amity can be obtained on no terms that do not imply an inability hereafter to resist it is designs this great prolific error i mean that peace was always in our power has been the cause that rendered the allies indifferent about the direction of the war and persuaded them that they might always risque a choice and even a change in it is objects they seldom improved any advantage hoping that the enemy affected by it would make a proffer of peace hence it was that all their early victories have been followed almost immediately with the usual effects of a defeat whilst all the advantages obtained by the regicides have been followed by the consequences that were natural the discomfitures which the republic of assassins has suffered have uniformly called forth new exertions which not only repaired old losses but prepared new conquests the losses of the allies on the contrary no provision having been made on the speculation of such an event have been followed by desertion by dismay by disunion by a dereliction of their policy by a flight from their principles by an admiration of the enemy by mutual accusations by a distrust in every member of the alliance of it is fellow of it is cause it is power and it is courage  great difficulties in consequence of our erroneous policy as i have said press upon every side of us far from desiring to conceal or even to palliate the evil in the representation i wish to lay it down as my foundation that never greater existed in a moment when sudden panick is apprehended it may be wise for a while to conceal some great public disaster or to reveal it by degrees until the minds of the people have time to be recollected that their understanding may have leisure to rally and that more steady councils may prevent their doing something desperate under the first impressions of rage or terror but with regard to a general state of things growing out of events and causes already known in the gross there is no piety in the fraud that covers it is true nature because nothing but erroneous resolutions can be the result of fale representations those measures which in common distress might be available in greater are no better than playing with the evil that the effort may bear a proportion to the exigence it is fit it should be known known in it is quality in it is extent and in all the circumstances which attend it great reverses of fortune there have been and great embarrassments in council a principled regicide enemy possessed of the most important part of europe and struggling for the rest within ourselves a total relaxation of all authority whilst a cry is raised against it as if it were the most ferocious of all despotisin a worse phenomenon  our government disowned by the most efficient member of it is tribunals ill supported by any of their constituent parts and the highest tribunal of all from causes not for our present purpose to examine deprived of all that dignity and all that efficiency which might enforce or regulate or if the case required it might supply the want of every other court public prosecutions are become little better than schools for treason of no use but to improve the dexterity of criminals in the mystery of evasion or to show with what complete impunity men may conspire against the commonwealth with what safety assassins may attempt it is awful head every thing is secure except what the laws have made sacred every thing is tameness and languor that is not fury and faction whilst the distempers of a relaxed fiber prognosticate and prepare all the morbid force of convulsion in the body of the state the steadiness of the physician is overpowered by the very aspect of the disease mussabat tacito medicina timore the doctor of the constitution pretending to underrate what he is not able to contend with shrinks from his own operation he doubts and questions the salutary but critical terrors of the cautery and the knife he takes a poor credit even from his defeat and covers impotence under the mask of lenity he praises the moderation of the laws as in his hands he sees them baffled and despised is all this because in our day the statutes of the kingdom are not engrossed in as firm a character and imprinted in as black and legible a type as ever no the law is a clear but it is a dead letter dead and putrid it is insufficient to save the state but potent to infect and to kill living law full of reason and of equity and justice as it is or it should not exist ought to be severe and awful too or the words of menace whether written on the parchment roll of england or cut into the brazen tablet of rome will excite nothing but contempt how comes it that in all the state prosecutions of magnitude from the revolution to within these two or three years the crown has scarcely ever retired disgraced and defeated from it is courts whence this alarming change by a connection easily felt and not impossible to be traced to it is cause all the parts of the state have their correspondence and consent they who bow to the enemy abroad will not be of power to subdue the conspirator at home it is impossible not to observe that in proportion as we approximate to the poisonous jaws of anarchy the fascination grows irresistible in proportion as we are attracted toward the focus of illegality irreligion and desperate enterprise all the venomous and blighting insects of the state are awakened into life the promise of the year is blasted and shrivelled and burned up before them our most salutary and most beautiful institutions yield nothing but dust and smut the harvest of our law is no more than stubble it is in the nature of these eruptive diseases in the state to sink in by fits and reappear but the fuel of the malady remains and in my opinion is not in the smallest degree mitigated in it is malignity though it waits the favorable moment of a freer communication with the source of regicide to exert and to increase it is force  is it that the people are changed that the commonwealth cannot be protected by its laws i hardly think it on the contrary i conceive that these things happen because men are not changed but remain always what they always were they remain what the bulk of us must ever be when abandoned to our vulgar propensities without guide leader or control that is made to be full of a blind elevation in prosperity to despise untried dangers to be overpowered with unexpected reverses to find no clue in a labyrinth of difficulties to get out of a present inconvenience with any risque of future ruin to follow and to bow to fortune to admire successful though wicked enterprise and to imitate what we admire to contemn the government which announces danger from sacrilege and regicide whilst they are only in their infancy and their struggle but which finds nothing that can alarm in their adult state and in the power and triumph of those destructive principles in a mass we cannot be left to ourselves we must have leaders if none will undertake to lead us right we shall find guides who will contrive to conduct us to shame and ruin  we are in a war of a peculiar nature it is not with an ordinary community which is hostile or friendly as passion or as interest may veer about not with a state which makes war through wantonness and abandons it through lassitude we are at war with a system which by it is essence is inimical to all other governments and which makes peace or war as peace and war may best conribute to their subversion it is with an armed doctrine that we are at war it has by it is essence a faction of opinion and of interest and of enthusiasm in every country to us it is a colossus which bestrides our channel it has one foot on a foreign shore the other upon the british soil thus advantaged if it can at all exist it must finally prevail nothing can so completely ruin any of the old governments ours in particular as the acknowledgment directly or by implication of any kind of superiority in this new power this acknowledgment we make if in a bad or doubtful situation of our affairs we solicit peace or if we yield to the modes of new humiliation in which alone she is content to give us an hearing by that means the terms cannot be of our choosing no not in any part  it is laid in the unalterable constitution of things  none can aspire to act greatly but those who are of force greatly to suffer they who make their arrangements in the first run of misadventure and in a temper of mind the common fruit of disappointment and dismay put a seal on their calamities to their power they take a security against any favors which they might hope from the usual inconstancy of fortune i am therefore my dear friend invariably of your opinion though full of respect for those who think differently that neither the time chosen for it nor the manner of soliciting a negotiation were properly considered even though i had allowed i hardly shall allow that with the hord of regicides we could by any selection of time or use of means obtain any thing at all deserving the name of peace  in one point we are lucky the regicide has received our advances with scorn we have an enemy to whose virtues we can owe nothing but on this occasion we are infinitely obliged to one of his vices we owe more to his insolence than to our own precaution the haughtiness by which the proud repel us has this of good in it that in making us keep our distance they must keep their distance too in the present case the pride of the regicide may be our safety he has given time for our reason to operate and for british dignity to recover from it is surprise from first to last he has rejected all our advances far as we have gone he has still left a way open to our retreat  there is always an augury to be taken of what a peace is likely to be from the preliminary steps that are made to bring it about we may gather something from the time in which the first overtures are made from the quarter whence they come from the manner in which they are received these discover the temper of the parties if your enemy offers peace in the moment of success it indicates that he is satisfied with something it shows that there are limits to his ambition or his resentment if he offers nothing under misfortune it is probable that it is more painful to him to abandon the prospect of advantage than to endure calamity if he rejects solicitation and will not give even a nod to the suppliants for peace until a change in the fortune of the war threatens him with ruin then i think it evident that he wishes nothing more than to disarm his adversary to gain time afterward a question arises which of the parties is likely to obtain the greater advantages by continuing disarmed and by the use of time  with these few plain indications in our minds it will not be improper to reconsider the conduct of the enemy together with our own from the day that a question of peace has been in agitation in considering this part of the question i do not proceed on my own hypothesis i suppose for a moment that this body of regicide calling itself a republic is a politic person with whom something deserving the name of peace may be made on that supposition let us examine our own proceeding let us compute the profit it has brought and the advantage that it is likely to bring hereafter a peace too eagerly sought is not always the sooner obtained the discovery of vehement wishes generally frustrates their attainment and your adversary has gained a great advantage over you when he finds you impatient to conclude a treaty there is in reserve not only something of dignity but a great deal of prudence too a sort of courage belongs to negotiation as well as to operations of the field a negotiator must often seem willing to hazard the whole issue of his treaty if he wishes to secure any one material point  the regicides were the first to declare war we are the first to sue for peace in proportion to the humility and perseverance we have shown in our addresses has been the obstinacy of their arrogance in rejecting our suit the patience of their pride seems to have been worn out with the importunity of our courtship disgusted as they are with a conduct so different from all the sentiments by which they are themselves filled they think to put an end to our vexatious solicitation by redoubling their insuits  it happens frequently that pride may reject a public advance while interest listens to a secret suggestion of advantage the opportunity has been afforded at a very early period in the diplomacy of humiliation a gentleman was sent on an errand mr bird sent to state the real situation of the duc de choiseul  of which from the motive of it whatever the event might be we can never be ashamed humanity cannot be degraded by humiliation it is it is very character to submit to such things there is a consanguinity between benevolence and humility they are virtues of the same stock dignity is of as good a race but it belongs to the family of fortitude in the spirit of that benevolence we sent a gentleman to beseech the directory of regicide not to be quite so prodigal as their republic had been of judicial murder we solicited them to spare the lives of some unhappy persons of the first distinction whose safety at other times could not have been an object of solicitation they had quitted france on the faith of the declaration of the rights of citizens they never had been in the service of the regicides nor at their hands had received any stipend the very system and constitution of government that now prevails was settled subsequent to their emigration they were under the protection of great britain and in his majestys pay and service not an hostile invasion but the disasters of the sea had thrown them upon a shore more barbarous and inhospitable than the inclement ocean under the most pitiless of it is storms here was an opportunity to express a feeling for the miseries of war and to open some sort of conversation which after our public overtures had glutted their pride at a cautious and jealous distance might lead to something like an accommodation what was the event a strange uncouth thing a theatrical figure of the opera his head shaded with threecoloured plumes his body fantastically habited strutted from the back scenes and after a short speech in the mockheroic falsetto of stupid tragedy delivered the gentleman who came to make the representation into the custody of a guard with directions not to lose sight of him for a moment and then ordered him to be sent from paris in two hours  here it is impossible that a sentiment of tenderness should not strike athwart the sternness of politics and make us recall to painful memory the difference between this insolent and bloody theater and the temperate natural majesty of a civilized court where the afflicted family of asgill did not in vain solicit the mercy of the highest in rank and the most compassionate of the compassionate sex  in this intercourse at least there was nothing to promise a great deal of success in our future advances whilst the fortune of the field was wholly with the regicides nothing was thought of but to follow where it led and it led to every thing not so much as a talk of treaty laws were laid down with arrogance the most moderate politician in their clan boisly danglas was chosen as the organ not so much for prescribing limits to their claims as to mark what for the present they are content to leave to others they made not laws not conventions not late possession but physical nature and political convenience the sole foundation of their claims the rhine the mediterranean and the ocean were the bounds which for the time they assigned to the empire of regicide what was the chamber of union of louis the fourteenth which astonished and provoked all europe compared to this declaration in truth with these limits and their principle they would not have left even the shadow of liberty or safety to any nation this plan of empire was not taken up in the first intoxication of unexpected success you must recollect that it was projected just as the report has stated it from the very first revolt of the faction against their monarchy and it has been uniformly pursued as a standing maxim of national policy from that time to this it is generally in the season of prosperity that men discover their real temper principles and designs but this principle suggested in their first struggles fully avowed in their prosperity has in the most adverse state of their affairs been tenaciously adhered to the report combined with their conduct forms an infallible criterion of the views of this republic  in their fortune there has been some fluctuation we are to see how their minds have been affected with a change some impression it made on them undoubtedly it produced some oblique notice of the submissions that were made by suppliant nations the utmost they did was to make some of those cold formal general professions of a love of peace which no power has ever refused to make because they mean little and cost nothing the first paper i have seen the publication at hamburgh making a show of that pacific disposition discovered a rooted animosity against this nation and an incurable rancour even more than any one of their hostile acts in this hamburgh declaration they choose to suppose that the war on the part of england is a war of government begun and carried on against the sense and interests of the people thus sowing in their very overtures toward peace the seeds of tumult and sedition for they never have abandoned and never will they abandon in peace in war in treaty in any situation or for one instant their old steady maxim of separating the people from their government let me add  and it is with unfeigned anxiety for the character and credit of ministers that i do add  if our government perseveres in its as uniform course of acting under instruments with such preambles it pleads guilty to the charges made by our enemies against it both on it is own part and on the part of parliament itself the enemy must succeed in his plan for loosening and disconnecting all the internal holdings of the kingdom  it was not enough that the speech from the throne in the opening of the session in      threw out oglings and glances of tenderness lest this coquetting should seem too cold and ambiguous without waiting for it is effect the violent passion for a relation to the regicides produced a direct message from the crown and it is consequences from the two houses of parliament on the part of the regicides these declarations could not be entirely passed by without notice but in that notice they discovered still more clearly the bottom of their character the offer made to them by the message to parliament was hinted at in their answer but in an obscure and oblique manner as before they accompanied their notice of the indications manifested on our side with every kind of insolent and taunting reflection the regicide directory on the day which in their gipsey jargon they call the  th of pluviose in return for our advances charge us with eluding our declarations under evasive formalities and frivolous pretextswhat these pretexts and evasions were they do not say and i have never heard but they do not rest there they proceed to charge us and as it should seem our allies in the mass with direct perfidy they are so conciliatory in their language as to hint that this perfidious character is not new in our proceedings however notwithstanding this our habitual perfidy they will offer peace on conditions as moderate  as what as reason and as equity require no as moderate as are suitable to their national dignity national dignity in all treaties i do admit is an important consideration they have given us an useful hint on that subject but dignity hitherto has belonged to the mode of proceeding not to the matter of a treaty never before has it been mentioned as the standard for rating the conditions of peace no never by the most violent of conquerors indemnification is capable of some estimate dignity has no standard it is impossible to guess what acquisitions pride and ambition may think fit for their dignity but lest any doubt should remain on what they think for their dignity the regicides in the next paragraph tell us that they will have no peace with their enemies until they have reduced them to a state which will put them under an impossibility of pursuing their wretched projects that is in plain french or english until they have accomplished our utter and irretrievable ruin this is their pacific language it flows from their unalterable principle in whatever language they speak or whatever steps they take whether of real war or of pretended pacification they have never to do them justice been at much trouble in concealing their intentions we were as obstinately resolved to think them not in earnest but i confess jests of this sort whatever their urbanity may be are not much to my taste  to this conciliatory and amicable public communication our sole answer in effect is this  citizen regicides whenever you find yourselves in the humor you may have a peace with us that is a point you may always command we are constantly in attendance and nothing you can do shall hinder us from the renewal of our supplications you may turn us out at the door but we will jump in at the window  to those who do not love to contemplate the fall of human greatness i do not know a more mortifying spectacle than to see the assembled majesty of the crowned heads of europe waiting as patient suitors in the antichamber of regicide they wait it seems until the sanguinary tyrant carnot shall have snorted away the fumes of the indigested blood of his sovereign then when sunk on the down of usurped pomp he shall have sufficiently indulged his meditations with what monarch he shall next glut his ravening maw he may condescend to signify that it his pleasure to be awake and that he is at leisure to receive the proposals of his high and mighty clients for the terms on which he may respite the execution of the sentence he has passed upon them at the opening of those doors what a sight it must be to behold the plenipotentiarie of royal impotence in the precedence which they will intrigue to obtain and which will be granted to them according to the seniority of their degradation sneaking into the regicide presence and with the relics of the smile which they had dressed up for the levee of their masters still flickering on their curled lips presenting the faded remains of their courtly graces to meet the scornful ferocious sardonic grin of a bloody ruffian who whilst he is receiving their homage is measuring them with his eye and fitting to their size the slider of his guillotine these ambassadors may easily return as good courtiers as they went but can they ever return from that degrading residence loyal and faithful subjects or with any true affection to their master or true attachment to the constitution religion or laws of their country there is great daner that they who enter smiling into this prophonian cave will come out of it sad and serious conspirators and such will continue as long as they live they will become true conductors of contagion to every country which has had the misfortune to send them to the source of that electricity at best they will become totally indifferent to good and evil to one institution or another this species of indifference is but too generally distinguishable in those who have been much employed in foreign courts but in the present case the evil must be aggravated without measure for they go from their country not with the pride of the old character but in a state of the lowest degradation and what must happen in their place of residence can have no effect in raising them to the level of true dignity or of chaste self estimation either as men or as representatives of crowned heads  our early proceeding which has prodced these returns of affront appeared to me totally new without being adapted to the new circumstances of affairs i have called to my mind the speeches and messages in former times i find nothing like these you will look in the journals to find whether my memory fails me before this time never was a ground of peace laid as it were in a parliamentary record until it had been as good as concluded this was a wise homage paid to the discretion of the crown it was known how much a negotiation must suffer by having any thing in the train toward it prematurely disclosed but when those parliamentary declarations were made not so much as a step had been taken toward a negotiation in any mode whatever the measure was an unpleasant and unseasonable discovery  i conceive that another circumstance in that transaction has been as little authorized by any example and that it is as little prudent in itself i mean the formal recognition of the french republic without entering for the present into a question on the good faith manifested in that measure or on it is general policy i doubt upon mere temporary considerations of prudence whether it was perfectly advisable it is not within the rules of dexterous conduct to make an acknowledgment of a contested title in your enemy before you are morally certain that your recognition will secure his friendship otherwise it is a measure worse than thrown away it adds infinitely to the strength and consequently to the demands of the adverse party he has gained a fundamental point without an equivalent it has happened as might have been foreseen no notice whatever was taken of this recognition in fact the directory never gave themselves any concern about it and they received our acknowledgment with perfect scorn with them it is not for the states of europe to judge of their title but in their eye the title of every other power depends wholly on their pleasure  preliminary declarations of this sort thrown out at random and sown as it were broadcast were never to be found in the mode of our proceeding with france and spain whilst the great monarchies of france and spain existed i do not say that a diplomatick measure ought to be like a parliamentary or a judicial proceeding according to strict precedent i hope i am far from that pedantry but this i know that a great state ought to have some regard to it is ancient maxims especially where they indicate it is dignity where they concur with the rules of prudence and above all where the circumstances of the time require that a spirit of innovation should be resisted which leads to the humiliation of sovereign powers it would be ridiculous to assert that those powers have suffered nothing in their estimation i admit that the greater interests of state will for a moment supersede all other considerations but if there was a rule that a sovereign never should let down his dignity without a sure payment to his interest the dignity of kings would be held high enough at present however fashion governs in more serious things than furniture and dress it looks as if sovereigns abroad were emulous in bidding against their estimation it seems as if the preeminence of regicide was acknowledged and that kings tacitly ranked themselves below their sacrilegious murderers as natural magistrates and judges over them it appears as if dignity were the prerogative of crime and a temporising humiliation the proper part for venerable authority if the vilest of mankind are resolved to be the most wicked they lose all the baseness of their origin and take their place above kings this example in foreign princes i trust will not spread it is the concern of mankind that the destruction of order should not be a claim to rank that crimes should not be the only title to preeminence and honor  at this second stage of humiliation i mean the insulting declaration in consequence of the message to both houses of parliament it might not have been amiss to pause and not to squander away the fund of our submissions until we know what final purposes of public interest they might answer the policy of subjecting ourselves to further insults is not to me quite apparent it was resolved however to hazard a third trial citizen barthelemi had been established on the part of the new republic at basie where with his proconsulate of switzerland and the adjacent parts of germany he was appointed as a sort of factor to deal in the degradation of the crowned heads of europe at bsle it was thought proper in order to keep others i suppose in countenance that great britai should appear at this market and bid with the rest for the mercy of the peopleking  on the th of march      mr wickham in conequence of authority was desired to sound france on her disposition toward a general pacification to know whether she would consent to send ministers to a congress at such a place as might be hereafter agreed upon to know whether they would communiate the general grounds of a pacification such as france the diplomatick name of the regicide power would be willing to propose as a foundation for a negotiation for peace with his majesty and his allies but he had no authority to enter into any negciation or discussion with citizen barthelemi upon these subjects  on the part of great britain this measure was a voluntary act wholly uncalled for on the part of regicide suits of this sort are at least strong indications of a desire for accommodation any other body of men but the directory would be somewhat soothed with such advaces they could not however begin their answer which was given without much delay and communicated on the   th of the same month without a preamble of insult and reproach they doubt the sincerity of the pacifick intentions of this courtshe did not begin say they yet to know her real interests she did not seek peace with good faiththis or something to this effect has been the constant preliminary observation now grown into a sort of officeform on all our overtures to this power a perpetual charge on the british government of fraud evasion and habitual perfidy  it might be asked from whence did these opinions of our insincerity and ill faith arise it was because the british ministry leaving to the directory however to propose a better mode proposed a congress for the purpose of a general pacification and this they said would render negotiation endlessfrom hence they immediately inferred a fraudulent intention in the offer unquestionably their mode of giving the law would bring matters to a more speedy conclusion as to any other method more agreeable to them than a congress an alternative expressly proposed to them they did not condescend to signify their pleasure  this refusal of treating conjointly with the powers allied against this republic furnishes matter for a great deal of serious reflection they have hitherto constantly declined any other than a treaty with a single power by thus dissociating every state from every other like deer separated from the herd each power is treated with on the merit of his being a deserter from the common cause in that light the regicide power finding each of them insulated and unprotected with great facility gives the law to them all by this system for the present an incurable distrust is sown amongst confederates and in future all alliance is rendered impracticable it is thus they have treated with prussia with spain with sardinia with bavaria with the ecclesiastical state with saxony and here we see them refuse to treat with great britain in any other mode they must be worse than blind who do not see with what undeviating regularity of system in this case and in all cases they pursue their scheme for the utter destruction of every independent power especially the smaller who cannot find any refuge whatever but in some common cause  renewing their taunts and reflections they tell mr wickham that their policy has no guides but openness and good faith and that their conduct shall be conformable to these principlesthey say concerning their government that yielding to the ardent desire by which it is animated to procure peace for the french republic and for all nations it will not fear to declare itself openly charged by the constitution with the execution of the  it cannot make or listen to any proposal that would be contrary to them the constitutional act does not permit it to consent to any alienation of that which according to the existing laws constitutes the territory of the republic  with respect to the countries occupied by the french armies and which have not been united to france they as well as other interests political and commercial may become the subject of a negotiation which will present to the directory the means of proving how much it desires to attain speedily to a happy pacification that the directory is ready to receive in this respect any overtures that shall be just reasonable and compatible with the dignity of the republic on the head of what is not to be the subject of negotiation the directory is clear and open as to what may be a matter of treaty all this open dealing is gone she retires into her shell there she expects overtures from you  and you are to guess what she shall judge just reasonable and above all compatible with her dignity  in the records of pride there does not exist so insulting a declaration it is insolent in words in manner but in substance it is not only insulting but alarming it is a specimen of what may be expected from the masters we are preparing for our humbled country their openness and candor consist in a direct avowal of their despotism and ambition we know that their declared resolution had been to surrender no object belonging to france previous to the war they had resolved that the republic was entire and must remain so as to what she has conquered from the allies and united to the same indivisible body it is of the same nature that is the allies are to give up whatever conquests they have made or may make upon france but all which she has violently ravished from her neighbors and thought fit to appropriate are not to become so much as objects of negotiation  in this unity and indivisibility of possession are sunk ten immense and wealthy provinces full of strong flourishing and opulent cities the austrian netherlands the part of europe the most necessary to preserve any communication between this kingdom and its natural allies next to holland the most interesting to this country and without which holland must virtually belong to france savoy and nice the keys of italy and the citadel in her hands to bridle switzerland are in that consolidation the important territory of liege is torn out of the heart of the empire all these are integrant parts of the republic not to be subject to any discussion or to be purchased by any equivalent why because there is a law which prevents it what law the law of nations the acknowledged public law of europe treaties and conventions of parties no not a pretense of the kind it is a declaration not made in consequence of any prescription on her side not on any cession or dereliction actual or tacit of other powers it is a declaration pendente lite in the middle of a war one principal object of which was originally the defense and has since been the recovery of these very countries  this strange law is not made for a trivial object not for a single port or for a single fortress but for a great kingdom for the religion the morals the laws the liberties the lives and fortunes of millions of human creatures who without their consent or that of their lawful government are by an arbitrary act of this regicide and homicide government which they call a law incorporated into their tyranny  in other words their will is the law not only at home but as to the concerns of every nation who has made that law but the regicide republic itself whose laws like those of the medes and persians they cannot alter or abrogate or even so much as take into consideration without the least ceremony or compliment they have sent out of the world whole sets of laws and lawgivers they have swept away the very constitutions under which the legislatures acted and the laws were made even the fundamental sacred rights of man they have not scrupled to profane they have set this holy code at naught with ignominy and scorn thus they treat all their domestic laws and constitutions and even what they had considered as a law of nature but whatever they have put their seal on for the purposes of their ambition and the ruin of their neighbors this alone is invulnerable impassible immortal assuming to be masters of every thing human and divine here and here alone it seems they are limited cooped and cabined inand this omnipotent legislature finds itself wholly without the power of exercising it is favorite attribute the love of peace in other words they are powerful to usurp impotent to restore and equally by their power and their impotence they aggrandize themselves and weaken and impoverish you and all other nations  nothing can be more proper or more manly than the state publication called a note on this proceeding dated downingstreet the  0th of april      only that it is better expressed it perfectly agrees with the opinion i have taken the liberty of submitting to your consideration this court has seen with regret how far the tone and spirit of that answer the nature and extent of the demands which it contains and the manner of announcing them are remote from any dispositions for peace  the inadmissible pretension is there avowed of appropriating to france all that the laws existing there may have comprised under the denomination of french territory to a demand such as this is added an express declaration that no proposal contrary to it will be made or even listened to and even this under the pretense of an internal regulation the provisions of which are wholly foreign to all other nations  while these dispositions shall be persisted in nothing is left for the king but to prosecute a war equally just and necessary  whenever his enemies shall manifest more pacific sentiments his majesty will at all times be eager to concur in them by lending himself in concert with his allies to all such measures as shall be calculated to reestablish general tranquillity on conditions just honorable and permanent either by the establishment of a general congress which has been so happily the means of restoring peace to europe or by a preliminary discussion of the principles which may be proposed on either side as a foundation of a general pacification or lastly by an impartial examination of any other way which may be pointed out to him for arriving at the same salutary end  downingstreet april  0        i place it below at full length as my justification in thinking that this astonishing paper from the directory is not only a direct negative to all treaty but is a rejection of every principle upon which treaties could be made to admit it for a moment were to erect this power usurped at home into a legislature to govern mankind it is an authority that on a thousand occasions they have asserted in claim and whenever they are able exerted in practice the dereliction of this whole scheme of policy became therefore an indispensible previous condition to all renewal of treaty the remark of the british cabinet on this arrogant and tyrannical claim is natural and unavoidable our ministry state  that while these dispositions shall be persisted in nothing is left for the king but to prosecute a war that is just and necessary  it was of course that we should wait until the enemy showed some sort of disposition on his part to fulfill this condition it was hoped indeed that our suppliant strains might be suffered to steal into the august ear in a more propitious season that season however invoked by so many vows conjurations and prayers did not come every declaration of hostility renovated and every act pursued with double animosity  the overrunning of lombardy  the subjugation of piedmont  the possession of its impregnable fortresses  the seizing on all the neutral states of italy  our expulsion from leghorn  instances for ever renewed for our expulsion from genoa  spain rendered subject to them and hostile to us  portugal bent under the yoke  half the empire overrun and ravaged were the only signs which this mild republic thought proper to manifest of her pacific sentiments every demonstration of an implacable rancour and an untameable pride were the only encouragements we received to the renewal of our supplications  here therefore they and we were fixed nothing was left to the british ministry but to prosecute a war just and necessary  a war equally just as at the time of our engaging in it  a war become ten times more necessary by every thing which happened afterward this resolution was soon however forgot it felt the heat of the season and melted away new hopes were entertained from supplication no expectations indeed were then formed from renewing a direct application to the french regicides through the agent general for the humiliation of sovereigns at length a step was taken in degradation which even went lower than all the rest deficient in merits of our own a mediator was to be sought  and we looked for that mediator at berlin the king of prussias merits in abandoning the general cause might have obtained for him some sort of influence in favor of those whom he had deserted  but i have never heard that his prussian majesty had lately discovered so marked an affection for the court of st jamess or for the court of vienna as to excite much hope of his interposing a very powerful mediation to deliver them from the distresses into which he had brought them  if humiliation is the element in which we live if it is become not only our occasional policy but our habit no great objection can be made to the modes in which it may be diversified though i confess i cannot be charmed with the idea of our exposing our lazar sores at the door of every proud servitor of the french republic where the courtdogs will not deign to lick them we had if i am not mistaken a minister at that cour who might try it is temper and recede and advance as he found backwardness or encouragement but to send a gentleman there on no other errand than this and with no assurance whatever that he should not find what he did find a repulse seems to me to go far beyond all the demands of a humiliation merely politic i hope it did not arise from a predeliction for that mode of conduct  the cup of bitterness was not however drained to the dregs basle and berlin were not sufficient after so many and so diversified repulses we were resolved to make another experiment and to try another mediator among the unhappy gentlemen in whose persons royalty is insulted and degraded at the seat of plebeian pride and upstart insolence there is a minister from denmark at paris without any previous encouragement to that any more than the other steps we sent through this turnpike to demand a passport for a person who on our part was to solicit peace in the metropolis at the footstool of regicide itself it was not to be expected that any one of those degraded beings could have influence enough to settle any part of the terms in favor of the candidates for further degradation besides such intervention would be a direct breach in their system which did not permit one sovereign power to utter a word in the concerns of his equal  another repulse  we were desired to apply directly in our persons  we submitted and made the application  it might be thought that here at length we had touched the bottom of humiliation our lead was brought up covered with mud but in the lowest deep a lower deep was to open for us still more profound abysses of disgrace and shame however in we leaped we came forward in our own name the passport such a passport and safe conduct as would be granted to thieves who might come in to betray their accomplices and no better was granted to british supplication to leave no doubt of it is spirit as soon as the rumor of this act of condescension could get abroad it was formally announced with an explanation from authority containing an invective against the ministry of great britain their habitual frauds their proverbial punick perfidy no such state paper as a preliminary to a negotiation for peace has ever yet appeared very few declarations of war have ever shown so much and so unqualified animosity i place it below official note extracted from the journal of the defenders of the country  executive directory  different journals have advanced that an english plenipotentiary had reached paris and had presented himself to the executive directory but that his propositions not having appeared satisfactory he had received orders instantly to quit france  all these assertions are equally false  the notices given in the english papers of a minister having been sent to paris there to treat of peace bring to recollection the overtures of mr wickham to the ambassador of the republic at basle and the rumors circulated relative to the mission of mr hammond to the court of prussia the insignificance or rather the subtle duplicity the punick style of mr wickhams note is not forgotten according to the partisans of the english ministry it was to paris that mr hammond was to come to speak for peace when his destination became public and it was known that he went to prussia the same writer repeated that it was to accelerate a peace and notwithstanding the object now well known of this negotiation was to engage prussia to break her treaties with the republic and to return into the coalition  the court of berlin faithful to its engagements repulsed these perfidious propositions but in converting this intrigue into a mission for peace the english ministry joined to the hope of giving a new enemy to france that of justifying the continuance of the war in the eyes of the english nation and of throwing all the odium of it on the french government such was also the aim of mr wickhams note such is still that of the notices given at ths time in the english papers  this aim will appear evident if we reflect how difficult it is that the ambitious government of england should sincerely wish for a peace that would snatch from it it is maritime preponderancy would reestablish the freedom of the seas would give a new impulse to the spanish dutch and french marines and would carry to the highest degree of prosperity the industry and commerce of those nations in which it has always found rivals and which it has considered as enemies of it is commerce when they were tired of being it is dupes  but there will no longer be any credit given to the pacific intentions of the english ministry when it is known that it is gold and it is intrigues it is open practices and it is insinuations besiege more than ever the cabinet of vienna and are one of the principal obstacles to the negotiation which that cabinet would of itself be induced to enter on for peace  they will no longer be credited finally when the moment of the rumor of these overtures being circulated is considered the english nation supports impatiently the continuance of the war a reply must be made to it is complaints it is reproaches the parliament is about to reopen it is sittings the mouths of the orators who will declaim against the war must be shut the demand of new taxes must be justified and to obtain these results it is necessary to be enabled to advance that the french government refuses every reasonable proposition of peace   as a diplomatick curiosity and in order to be the better understood in the few remarks i have to make upon a piece which indeed defies all description  none but itself can be it is parallel  i pass by all the insolence and contumely of the performance as it comes from them the present question is not how we are to be affected with it in regard to our dignity that is gone i shall say n more about it light lie the earth on the ashes of english prid i shall only observe upon it politically and as furnishing a direction for our own conduct in this low business  the very idea of a negotiation for peace whatever the inward sentiments of the parties may be implies some confidence in their faith some degree of belief in the professions which are made concerning it a temporary and occasional credit at least is granted otherwise men stumble on the very threshold i therefore wish to ask what hope we can have of their good faith who as the very basis of the negotiation assume the ill faith and treachery of those they have to deal with the terms as against us must be such as imply a full security against a treacherous conduct  that is such terms as this directory stated in it is first declaration to place us in an utter impossibility of executing our wretched projects this is the omen and the sole omen under which we have consented to open our treaty  the second observation i have to make upon it much connected undoubtedly with the first is that they have informed you of the result they propose from the kind of peace they mean to grant you that is to say the union they propose among nations with the view of rivalling our trade and destroying our naval power and this they suppose and with good reason too must be the inevitable effect of their peace it forms one of their principal grounds for suspecting our ministers could not be in good earnest in their proposition they make no scruple beforehand to tell you the whole of what they intend and this is what we call in the modern style the acceptance of a proposition for peace in old language it would be called a most haughty offensive and insolent rejection of all treaty  thirdly they tell you what they conceive to be the perfidious policy which dictates your delusive offer that is the design of cheating not only them but the people of england against whose interest and inclination this war is supposed to be carried on  if we proceed in this business under this preliminary declaration it seems to me that we admit now for the third time by something a great deal stronger than words the truth of the charges of every kind which they make upon the british ministry and the grounds of those foul imputations the language used by us which in other circumstances would not be exceptionable in this case tends very strongly to confirm and realize the suspicion of our enemy i mean the declaration that if we do not obtain such terms of peace as suits our opinion of what our interests require then and in that case we shall continue the war with vigor this offer so reasoned plainly implies that without it our leaders themselves entertain great doubts of the opinion and good affections of the british people otherwise there does not appear any cause why we should proceed under the scandalous construction of our enemy upon the former offer made by mr wickham and on the new offer made directly at paris it is not therefore from a sense of dignity but from the danger of radicating that false sentiment in the breasts of the enemy that i think under the auspices of this declaration we cannot with the least hope of a good event or indeed with any regard to the common safety proceed in the train of this negotiation i wish ministry would seriously consider the importance of their seeming to confirm the enemy in an opinion that his frequent use of appeals to the people against their government has not been without it is effect if it puts an end to this war it will render another impracticable  whoever goes to the directorial presence under this passport with this offensive comment and foul explanation goes in the avowed sense of the court to which he is sent as the instrument of a government dissociated from the interests and wishes of the nation for the purpose of cheating both the people of france and the people of england he goes out the declared emissary of a faithless ministry he has perfidy for his credentials he h national weakness for his full powers i yet doubt whether any one can be found to invest himself with that character if there should it would be pleasant to read his instructions on the answer which he is to give to the directory in case they should repeat to him the substance of the manifesto which he carries with him in his portfolio  so much for the first manifesto of the regicide court which went along with the passport left this declaration should seem the effect of haste or a mere sudden effusion of pride and insolence on full deliberation about a week after comes out a second this manifesto is dated he fifth of october one day before the speech from the throne on the vigil of the festive day of codi unanimity so happily celebrated by all parties in the british parliament in this piece the regicides our worthy friends i call them by advance and by courtesy what by law i shall be obliged to call them hereafter our worthy friends i say renew and enforce the former declaration concerning our faith and sincerity which they pinned to our passport on three other points which run through all their declarations they are more explicit than ever  first they more directly undertake to be the real representatives of the people of this kingdom and on a supposition in which they agree with our parliamentary reformers that the house of commons is not that representative the function being vacant they as our true constitutional organ inform his majesty and the world of the sense of the nation they tell us that the english people see with regret his majestys government squandering away the funds which had been granted to him this astonishing assumption of the public voice of england is but a slight foretaste of the usurpation which on a peace we may be assured they will make of all the powers in all the parts of our vassal constitution if they do these things in the green tree what shall be done in the dry  next they tell us as a condition to our treaty that this government must abjure the unjust hatred it bears to them and at last open it is ears to the voice of humanity  truly this is even from them an extraordinary demand hitherto it seems we have put wax into our ears to shut them up against the tender oning strains in the affets of humanity warbled from the throats of reubel carnot tallien and the whole chorus of confiscators domiciliary visitors committee men of research jurors and presidents of revolutionary tribunals regicides assassins massacrers and septembrizers it is not difficult to discern what sort of humanity our government is to learn from these siren singers our government also i admit with some reason as a step toward the proposed fraternity is required to abjure the unjust hatred which it bears to this body of honor and virtue i thank god i am neither a minister nor a leader of opposition i protest i cannot do what they desire if i were under the guillotine or as they ingeniously and pleasantly express it looking out of the little national windoweven at that opening i could receive none of their light i am fortified against all such affections by the declaration of the government which i must yet consider as lawful made on the   th of october      in their place has succeeded a system destructive of all public order maintained by proscriptions exiles and confiscations without number by arbitrary imprisonment by massacres which cannot be remembered without horror and at length by the execrable murder of a just and beneficent sovereign and of the illustrious princess who with an unshaken firmness has shared all the misfortunes of her royal consort his protracted sufferings his cruel captivity and his ignominious death  they the allies have had to encounter acts of aggression without pretext open violations of all treaties unprovoked declarations of war in a word whatever corruption intrigue or violence could effect for the purpose so openly avowed of subverting all the institutions of society and of extending over all the nations of europe that confusion which has produced the misery of france   this state of things cannot exist in france without involving all the surrounding powers in one common danger without giving them the right without imposing it upon them as a duty to stop the progress of an evil which exists only by the successive violation of all law and all property and which attacks the fundamental principles by which mankind is united in the bonds of civil society  the king would impose none other than equitable and moderate conditions not such as the expense the risques and the sacrifices of the war might justify but such as his majesty thinks himself under the indispensible necessity of requiring with a view to these considerations and still more to that of his own security and of the future tranquillity of europe his majesty desires nothing more sincerely than thus to terminate a war which he in vain endeavored to avoid and all the calamities of which as now experienced by france are to be attributed only to the ambition the perfidy and the violence of those whose crimes have involved their own country in misery and disgraced all civilized nations  the king promises on his part the suspension of hostilities friendship and as far as the course of events will allow of which the will of man cannot dispose security and protection to all those who by declaring for a monarchical form of government shall shake off the yoke of sanguinary anarchy of that anarchy which has broken all the most sacred bonds of society dissolved all the relations of civil life violated every right confounded every duty which uses the name of liberty to exercise the most cruel tyranny to annihilate all property to seize on all possessions which founds it is power on the pretended consent of the people and itself carries fire and sword through extensive provinces for having demanded their laws their religion and their lawful sovereign  declaration sent by his majestys command to the commanders of his majestys fleets and armies employed against france and to his majestys ministers employed at foreign courts  whitehall oct            and still ringing in my ears this declaration was transmitted not only to all our commanders by sea and land but to our ministers in every court of europe it is the most eloquent and highly finished in the style the most judicious in the choice of topics the most orderly in the arrangement and the most rich in the coloring without employing the smallest degree of exaggeration of any state paper that has ever yet appeared an ancient writer plutarch i think it is quotes some verses on the eloquence of pericles who is called the only orator that left stings in the minds of his hearers like his the eloquence of the declaration not contradicting but enforcing sentiments of the truest humanity has left stings that have penetrated more than skindeep into my mind and never can they be extracted by all the surgery of murder never can the throbbings they have created be assuaged by all the emollient cataplasms of robbery and confiscation i cannot love the republic  the third point which they have more clearly expressed than ever is of equal importance with the rest and with them furnishes a complete view of the regicide system for they demand as a condition without which our ambassador of obedience cannot be received with any hope of success that he shall be provided with full powers to negociate a peace between the french republic and great britain and to conclude it definitively between the two powers with their spear they draw a circle about us they will hear nothing of a joint treaty we must make a peace separately from our allies we must as the very first and preliminary step be guilty of that perfidy toward our friends and associates with which they reproach us in our transactions with them our enemies we are called upon scandalously to betray the fundamental securities to ourselves and to all nations in my opinion it is perhaps but a poor one if we are meanly bold enough to send an ambassador such as this official note of the enemy requires we cannot even dispatch our emissary without danger of being charged with a breach of our alliance government now understands the full meaning of the passport  strange revolutions have happened in the ways of thinking and in the feelings of men but it requires a very extraordinary coalition of parties indeed and a kind of unheard of unanimity in public councils which can impose this newdiscovered system of negotiation as sound national policy on the understanding of a spectator of this wonderful scene who judges on the principles of any thing he ever before saw rad or heard of and above all on the understanding of a person who has had in his eye the transactions of the last seven years  i know it is supposed that if good terms of capitulation are not granted after we have thus so repeatedly hung out the white flag the national spirit will revive with tenfold ardour this is an experiment cautiously to be made reculer pour mieux souter according to the french byword cannot be trusted to as a general rule of conduct to diet a man into weakness and languor afterward to give him the greater strength has more of the empirick than the rational physician it is true that some persons have been kicked into courage and this is no bad hint to give to those who are too forward and liberal in bestowing insults and outrages on their passive companions but such a course does not at first view appear a wellchosen discipline to form men to a nice sense of honor or a quick resentment of injuries a long habit of humiliation does not seem a very good preparative to manly and vigorous sentiment it may not leave perhaps enough of energy in the mind fairly to discern what are good terms or what are not men low and dispirited may regard those terms as not at all amiss which in another state of mind they would think intolerable if they grow peevish in this state of mind they may be roused not against the enemy whom they have been taught to fear but against the ministry ut lethargicus hic cum fit pugil et medicum urget  hor  who are more within their reach and who have refused conditions that are not unseasonable from power that they have been taught to consider as irresistible  if all that for some months i have heard have the least foundation i hope it has not the ministers are perhaps not quite so much to be blamed as their condition is to be lamented i have been given to understand that these proceedings are not in their origin properly theirs it is said that there is a secret in the house of commons it is said that ministers act not according to the votes but according to the dispositions of the majority i hear that the minority has long since spoken the general sense of the nation and that to prevent those who compose it from having the open and avowed lead in that house or perhaps in both houses it was necessary to preoccupy their ground and to take their propositions out of their mouths even with the hazard of being afterward reproached with a compliance which it was foreseen would be fruitless  if the general disposition of the people be as i hear it is for an immediate peace with regicide without so much as cnsidering our public and solemn engagements to the party in france whose cause we had esoused or the engagements expressed in our general alliances not only without an enquiry into the terms but with a certain knowledge that none but the worst terms will be offered it is all over with us it is strange but it may be true that as the danger from jacobinism is increased in my eyes and in yours the fear of it is lessened in the eyes of many people who formerly regarded it with horror it seems they act under the impression of terrors of another sort which have frightened them out of their first apprehensions but let their fears or their hopes or their desires be what they will they should recollect that they who would make peace without a previous knowledge of the terms make a surrender they are conquered they do not treat they receive the law is this the disposition of the people of england then the people of england are contended to seek in the kindness of a foreign systematick enemy combined with a dangerous faction at home a security which they cannot find in their own patriotism and their own courage they are willing to trust to the sympathy of regicides the guarantee of the british monarchy they are content to rest their religion on the piety of atheists by establishment they are satisfied to seek in the clemency of practiced murderers the security of their lives they are pleased to confide their property to the safeguard of those who are robbers by inclination interest habit and system if this be our deliberate mind truly we deserve to lose what it is impossible we should long retain the name of a nation  in matters of state a constitutional competence to act is in many cases the smallest part of the question without disputing god forbid i should dispute the sole competence of the king and the parliament each in it is province to decide on war and peace i venture to say no war can be long carried on against the will of the people this war in particular cannot be carried on unless they are enthusiastically in favor of it acquiescence will not do there must be zeal universal zeal in such a cause and at such a time as this is cannot be looked for neither is it necessary a zeal in the larger part carries the force of the whole without this no government certainly not our government is capable of a great war none of the ancient regular governments have wherewithal to fight abroad with a foreign foe and at home to overcome repining reluctance and chicane it must be some portentous thing like regicide france that can exhibit such a prodigy yet even she the mother of monsters more prolifick than the country of old called ferax monstrorum shows symptoms of being almost effete already and she will be so unless the fallow of a peace comes to recruit her fertility but whatever may be represented concerning the meanness of the popular spirit i for one do not think so desperately of the british nation our minds as i said are light but they are not depraved we are dreadfully open to delusion and to dejection but we are capable of being animated and undeceived  it cannot be concealed we are a divided people but in divisions where a part is to be taken we are to make a muster of our strength i have often endeavored to compute and to class those who in any political view are to be called the people without doing something of this sort we must proceed absurdly we should not be much wiser if we pretended to very great accuracy in our estimate but i think in the calculation i have made the error cannot be very material in england and scotland i compute that those of adult age not declining in life of tolerable leisure for such discussions and of some means of information more or less and who are above mental dependence or what virtually is such may amount to about four hundred thousand there is such a thing as a natural representative of the people this body is that representative and on this body more than on the legal constituent the artificial representative depends this is the british public and it is a public very numerous the rest when feeble are the objects of protection when strong the means of force they who affect to consider that part of us in any other light insult while they cajole us they do not want us for counselors in deliberation but to list us as soldiers for battle  of these four hundred thousand political citizens i look upon one fifth or about eighty thousand to be pure jacobins utterly incapable of amendment objects of eternal vigilance and when they break out of legal constraint on these no reason no argument no example no venerable authority can have the slightest influence they desire a change and they will have it if they can if they cannot have it by english cabal they will make no sort of scruple of having it by the cabal of france into which already they are virtually incorporated it is only their assured and confident expectation of the advantages of french fraternity and the approaching blessings of regicide intercourse that skins over their mischievous dispositions with a momentary quiet  this minority is great and formidable i do not know whether if i aimed at the total overthrow of a kingdom i should wish to be encumbered with a larger body of partisans they are more easily disciplined and directed than if the number were greater these by their spirit of intrigue and by their restless agitating activity are of a force far superior to their numbers and if times grew the least critical have the means of debauching or intimidating many of those who are now sound as well as of adding to their force large bodies of the more passive part of the nation this minority is numerous enough to make a mighty cry for peace or for war or for any object they are led vehemently to desire by passing from place to place with a velocity incredible and diversifying their character and description they are capable of mimicking the general voice we must not always judge of the generality of the opinion by the noise of the acclamation  the majority the other four fifths is perfectly sound and of the best possible disposition to religion to government to the true and undivided interest of their country such men are naturally disposed to peace they who are in possession of all they wish are languid and improvident with this fault and i admit it is existence in all it is extent they would not endure to hear of a peace that led to the ruin of every thing for which peace is dear to them however the desire of peace is essentially the weak side of that kind of men all men that are ruined are ruined on the side of their natural propensities there they are unguarded above all good men do not suspect that their destruction is attempted through their virtues this their enemies are perfectly aware of and accordingly they the most turbulent of mankind who never made a scruple to shake the tranquillity of their country to it is center raise a continual cry for peace with france peace with regicide and war with the rest of the world is their motto from the beginning and even whilst the french gave the blows and we hardly opposed the vis inertiae to their efforts from that day to this hour like importunate guineafowls crying one note day and night they have called for peace  in this they are as i confess in all things they are perfectly consistent they who wish to unite themselves to your enemies naturally desire that you should disarm yourself by a peace with these enemies but it passes my conception how they who wish well to their country on it is ancient system of laws and manners come not to be doubly alarmed when they find nothing but a clamor for peace in the mouths of the men on earth the least disposed to it in their natural or in their habitual character  i have a good opinion of the general abilities of the jacobins not that i suppose them better born than others but strong passions awaken the faculties they suffer not a particle of the man to be lost the spirit of enterprise gives to this description the full use of all their native energies if i have reason to conceive that my enemy who as such must have an interest in my destruction is also a person of discernment and sagacity then i must be quite sure that in a contest the object he violently pursues is the very thing by which my ruin is likely to be the most perfectly accomplished why do the jacobins cry for peace because they know that this point gained the rest will follow of course on our part why are all the rules of prudence as sure as the laws of material nature to be at this time reversed how comes it that now for the first time men think it right to be governed by the counsels of their enemies ought they not rather to tremble when they are persuaded to travel on the same road and to tend to the same place of rest  the minority i speak of is not susceptible of an impression from the topics of argument to be used to the larger part of the community i therefore do not address to them any part of what i have to say the more forcibly i drive my arguments against their system so as to make an impression where i wish to make it the more strongly i rivet them in their sentiments as for us who compose the far larger and what i call the far better part of the people let me say that we have not been quite fairly dealt with when called to this deliberation the jacobin minority have been abundantly supplied with stores and provisions of all kinds toward their warfare no sort of argumentative materials suited to their purposes have been withheld false they are unsound sophistical but they are regular in their direction they all bear one way and they all go to the support of the substantial merits of their cause the others have not had the question so much as fairly stated to them  there has not been in this century any foreign peace or war in it is origin the fruit of popular desire except the war that was made with spain in      sir robert walpole was forced into the war by the people who were inflamed to this measure by the most leading politicians by the first orators and the greatest poets of the time for that war pope sung his dying notes for that war johnson in more energetic strains employed the voice of his early genius for that war glover distinguished himself in the way in which his muse was the most natural and happy the crowd readily followed the politicians in the cry for a war which threatened little bloodshed and which promised victories that were attended with something more solid than glory a war with spain was a war of plunder in the present conflict with regicide mr pit has not hitherto had nor will perhaps for a few days have many prizes to hold out in the lottery of war to tempt the lower part of our character he can only maintain it by an appeal to the higher and to those in whom that higher part is the most predominant he must look the most for his support whilst he holds out no inducements to the wise nor bribes to the avaricious he may be forced by a vulgar cry into a peace ten times more ruinous than the most disastrous war the weaker he is in the fund of motives which apply to our avarice to our laziness and to our lassitude if he means to carry the war to any end at all the stronger he ought to be in his addresses to our magnanimity and to our reason  in stating that walpole was driven by a popular clamor into a measure not to be justified i do not mean wholly to excuse his conduct my time of observation did not exactly coincide with that event but i read much of the controversies then carried on several years after the contests of parties had ceased the people were amused and in a degree warmed with them the events of that era seemed then of magnitude which the revolutions of our time have reduced to parochial importance and the debates which then shook the nation now appear of no higher moment than a discussion in a vestry when i was very young a general fashion told me i was to admire some of the writings against that minister a little more maturity taught me as much to despise them i observed one fault in his general proceeding he never manfully put forward the entire strength of his cause he temporised he managed and adopting very nearly the sentiments of his adversaries he opposed their inferences this for a political commander is the choice of a weak post his adversaries had the better of the argument as he handled it not as the reason and justice of his cause enabled him to manage it i say this after having seen and with some care examined the original documents concerning certain important transactions of those times they perfectly satisfied me of the extreme injustice of that war and of the falsehood of the colors which to his own ruin and guided by a mistaken policy he suffered to be daubed over that measure some years after it was my fortune to converse with many of the principal actors against that minister and with those who principally excited that clamor none of them no not one did in the least defend the measure or attempt to justify their conduct they condemned it as freely as they would have done in commenting upon any proceeding in history in which they were totally unconcerned thus it will be they who stir up the people to improper desires whether of peace or war will be condemned by themselves they who weakly yield to them will be condemned by history  in my opinion the present ministry are as far from doing full justice to their cause in this war as walpole was from doing justice to the peace which at that time he was willing to preserve they throw the light on one fide only of their case though it is impossible they should not observe that the other fide which is kept in the shade has it is importance too they must know that france is formidable not only as she is france but as she is jacobin france they knew from the beginning that the jacobin party was not confined to that country they knew they felt the strong disposition of the same faction in both countries to communicate and to cooperate for some time past these two points have been kept and even industriously kept out of sight france is considered as merely a foreign power and the seditious english only as a domestic faction the merits of the war with the former have been argued solely on political grounds to prevent the mischievous doctrines of the latter from corrupting our minds matter and argument have been supplied abundantly and even to surfeit on the excellency of our own government but nothing has been done to make us feel in what manner the safety of that government is connected with the principle and with the issue of this war for any thing which in the late discussion has appeared the war is entirely collateral to the state of jacobinism as truly a foreign war to us and to all our home concerns as the war with spain in      about gardacostas the madrid convention and the fable of captain jenkinss ears  whenever the adverse party has raised a cry for peace with the regicide the answer has been little more than this that the administration wished for such a peace full as much as the opposition but that the time was not convenient for making it whatever else has been said was much in the same spirit reasons of this kind never touched the substantial merits of the war they were in the nature of dilatory pleas exceptions of form previous questions accordingly all the arguments against a compliance with what was represented as the popular desire urged on with all possible vehemence and earnestness by the jacobins have appeared flat and languid feeble and evasive they appeared to aim only at gaining time they never entered into the peculiar and distinctive character of the war they spoke neither to the understanding nor to the heart cold as ice themselves they never could kindle in our breasts a spark of that zeal which is necessary to a conflict with an adverse zeal much less were they made to infuse into our minds that stubborn persevering spirit which alone is capable of bearing up against those vicissitudes of fortune which will probably occur and those burdens which must be inevitably borne in a long war i speak it emphatically and with a desire that it should be marked in a long war because without such a war no experience has yet told us that a dangerous power has ever been reduced to measure or to reason i do not throw back my view to the peloponnesian war of twentyseven years nor to two of the punick wars the first of twentyfour the second of eighteen nor to the more recent war concluded by the treaty of westphalia which continued i think for thirty i go to what is but just fallen behind living memory and immediately touches our own country let the portion of our history from the year      to      be brought before us we shall find that in all that period of twentyfour years there were hardly five that could be called a season of peace and the interval between the two wars was in reality nothing more than a very active preparation for renovated hostility during that period every one of the propositions of peace came from the enemy the first when they were accepted at the peace of ryswick the second where they were rejected at the congress at gertruydenburgh the last when the war ended by the treaty of utrecht even then a very great part of the nation and that which contained by far the most intelligent statesmen was against the conclusion of the war i do not enter into the merits of that question as between the parties i only state the existence of that opinion as a fact from whence you may draw such an inference as you think properly arises from it  it is for us at present to recollect what we have been and to consider what if we please we may be still at the period of those wars our principal strength was found in the resolution of the people that in the resolution of a part only and of the then whole which bore no proportion to our existing magnitude england and scotland were not united at the beginning of that mighty struggle when in the course of the contest they were conjoined it was in a raw an illcemented an unproductive union for the whole duration of the war and long after the names and other outward and visible signs of approximation rather augmented than diminished our insular feuds they were rather the causes of new discontents and new troubles than promoters of cordiality and affection the now single and potent great britain was then not only two countries but from the party heats in both and the divisions formed in each of them each of the old kingdoms within itself in effect was made up of two hostile nations ieland now so large a source of the common opulence and power which wisely managed might be made much more beneficial and much more effective was then the heaviest of the burdens an army not much less than forty thousand men was drawn from the general effort to keep that kingdom in a poor unfruitful and resourceless subjection  such was the state of the empire the state of our finances was worse if possible every branch of the revenue became less productive after the revolution silver not as now a sort of counter but the body of the current coin was reduced so low as not to have above three parts in four of the value in the shilling it required a dead expense of three millions sterling to renew the coin age public credit that great but ambiguous principle which has so often been predicted as the cause of our certain ruin but which for a century has been the constant companion and often the means of our prosperity and greatness had it is origin and was cradled i may say in bankruptcy and beggary at this day we have seen parties contending to be admitted at a moderate premium to advance eighteen millions to the exchequer for infinitely smaller loans the chancellor of the exchequer of that day montagu the father of public credit countersecuring the state by the appearance of the city with the lord mayor of london at his side was obliged like an agent at an election to go cap in hand from shop to shop to borrow an hundred pound and even smaller sums when made up in driblets as they could their best securities were at an interest of    per cent even the paper of the bank now at par with cash and even sometimes preferred to it was often at a discount of twenty per cent by this the state of the rest may be judged  as to our commerce the imports and exports of the nation now six and forty million did not then amount to ten the inland trade which is commonly passed by in this sort of estimates but which in part growing out of the foreign and connected with it is more advantageous and more substantially nutritive to the state is not only grown in a proportion of near five to one as the foreign but has been augmented at least in a tenfold proportion when i came to england i remember but one river navigation the rate of carriage on which was limited by an act of parliament it was made in the reign of william the third i mean that of the air and calder the rate was settled at thirteen pence so high a price demonstrated the feebleness of these beginnings of our inland intercouse in my time one of the longest and sharpest contests i remember in your house and which rather resembled a violent contention amongst national parties than a local dispute was as well as i can recollect to hold the price up to threepence even this which a very scanty justice to the proprietors required was done with infinite difficulty as to private credit there were not as i best remember twelve bankers shops at that time out of london in this their number when i first faw the country i cannot be quite exact but certainly those machines of domestic credit were then very few indeed they are now in almost every market town and this circumstance whether the thing be carried to an excess or not demonstrates the astonishing increase of private confidence of general circulation and of internal commerce an increase out of all proportion to the growth of the foreign trade our naval strength in the time of king williams war was nearly matched by that of france and though conjoined with holland then a maritime power hardly inferior to our own even with that force we were not always victorious though finally superior the allied fleets experienced many unpleasant reverses on their own element in two years three thousand vessels were taken from the english trade on the continent we lost almost every battle we fought  in      it is not quite an hundred years ago in that state of things amidst the general debasement of the coin the fall of the ordinary revevenue the failure of all the extraordinary supplies the ruin of commerce and the almost total extinction of an infant credit the chancellor of the exchequer himself whom we have just seen begging from door to door  came forward to move a resolution full of vigor in which far from being discouraged by the generally adverse fortune and the long continuance of the war the commons agreed to address the crown in the following manly spirited and truly animating style  this is the eighth year in which your majestys most dutiful and loyal subjects the commons in parliament assembled have assisted your majesty with large supplies for carrying on a just and necessary war in defense of our religion and preservation of our laws and vindication of the rights and liberties of the people of england  afterward they proceed in this manner  to show to your majesty and all christendom that the commons of england will not be amused or diverted from their firm resolutions of obtaining by war a safe and honorable peace we do in the name of those we represent renew our assurances to support your majesty and your government against all your enemies at home and abroad and that we will effectually assist you in carrying on the war against france  the amusement and diversion they speak of was the suggestion of a treaty proposed by the enemy and announced from the throne thus the people of england felt in the eighth not in the fourth year of the war no sighing or panting after negotiation no motions from the opposition to force the ministry into a peace no messages from ministers to palsy and deaden the resolution of parliament or the spirit of the nation they did not so much as advise the king to listen to the propositions of the enemy nor to seek for peace but through the mediation of a vigorous war this address was moved in an hot a divided a factious and in a great part disaffected house of commons and it was carried nemine contradicente  while that first war which was ill smothered by the treaty of ryswick slept in the thin ashes of a seeming peace a new conflagration was in it is immediate causes a fresh and a far greater war was in preparation a year had hardly elapsed when arrangements were made for renewing the contest with tenfold fury the steps which were taken at that time to compose to reconcile to unite and to discipline all europe against the growth of france certainly furnish to a statesman the finest and most interesting part in the history of that great period it formed the masterpiece of king williams policy dexterity and perseverance full of the idea of preserving not only a local civil liberty united with order to our country but to embody it in the political liberty the order and the independence of nations united under a natural head the king called upon his parliament to put itself into a posture  to preserve to england the weight and influence it at present had on the councils and affairs abroad it will be requisite europe should see you will not be wanting to yourselves  baffled as that monarch was and almost heartbroken at the disappointment he met with in the mode he first proposed for that great end he held on his course he was faithful to his object and in councils as in arms over and over again repulsed over and over again he returned to the charge all the mortifications he had suffered from the last parliament and the greater he had to apprehend from that newly chosen were not capable of relaxing the vigor of his mind he was in holland when he combined the vast plan of his foreign negociations when he came to open his design to his ministers in england even the sober firmness of summers the undaunted resolution of shrewsbury and the adventurous spirit of montagu and orford were staggered they were not yet mounted to the elevation of the king the cabinet met on the subject at tunbridge wells the   th of august school and there lord summers holding the pen after expressing doubts on the state of the continent which they ultimately refer to the king as best informed they give him a most discouraging portrait of the spirit of this nation so far as relates to england say these ministers it would be want of duty not to give your majesty this clear account that there is a deadness and want of spirit in the nation universally so as not to be at all disposed to entering into a new war that they seem to be tired out with taxes to a degree beyond what was discerned till it appeared upon occasion of the late elections this is the truth of the fact upon which your majesty will determine what resolution ought to be taken  his majesty did determine and did take and pursue his resolution in all the tottering imbecility of a new government and with parliament totally unmanageable he persevered he persevered to expel the fears of his people by his fortitude  to steady their fickleness by his constancy  to expand their narrow prudence by his enlarged wisdom  to sink their factious temper in his public spirit  in spite of his people he resolved to make them great and glorious to make england inclined into shrink into her narrow self the arbitress of europe the tutelary angel of the human race in spite of the ministers who staggered under the weight that his mind imposed upon theirs unsupported as they felt themselves by the popular spirit he infused into them his own soul he renewed in them their ancient heart he rallied them in the same cause  it required some time to accomplish this work the people were first gained and through them their distracted representatives under the influence of king william holland had resisted the allurements of every seduction and had resisted the terrors of every menace with hannibal at her gates she had nobly and magnanimously refused all separate treaty or any thing which might for a moment appear to divide her affection or her interest or even to distinguish her in identity from england having settled the great point of the consolidation which he hoped would be eternal of the countries made for a common interest and common sentiment the king in his message to both houses calls their attention to the affairs of the states general the house of lords was perfectly sound and entirely impressed with the wisdom and dignity of the kings proceedings in answer to the message which you will observe was narrowed to a single point the danger of the states general after the usual professions of zeal for his service the lords opened themselves at large they go far beyond the demands of the message they express themselves as follows  we take this occasion further to assure your majesty that we are sensible of the great and imminent danger to which the states general are exposed and we perfectly agree with them in believing that their safety and ours are so inseparably united that whatsoever is ruin to the one must be fatal to the other  we humbly desire your majesty will be pleased not only to make good all the articles of any former treaties to the sates general but that you will enter into a strict league offensive and defensive with them for their common preservation and that you will invite into it all princes and states who are concerned in the present visible danger arising from the union of france and spain  and we further desire your majesty that you will be pleased to enter into such alliances with the emperor as your majesty shall think fit pursuant to the ends of the treaty of      toward all which we assure your majesty of our hearty and sincere assistance not doubting but whenever your majesty shall be obliged to be engaged for the defense of your allies and securing the liberty and quiet of europe almighty god will protect your sacred person in so righteous a cause and that the unanimity wealth and courage of your subjects will carry your majesty with honor and success through all the difficulties of a just war  the house of commons was more reserved the late popular disposition was still in a great degree prevalent in the representative after it had been made to change in the constituent body the principle of the grand alliance was not directly recognized in the resolution of the commons nor the war announced though they were well aware the alliance was formed for the war however compelled by the returning sense of the people they went so far as to fix the three great immovable pillars of the safety and greatness of england as they were then as they are now and as they must ever be to the end of time they asserted in general terms the necessity of supporting holland of keeping united with our allies and maintaining the liberty of europe though they restricted their vote to the succors stipulated by actual treaty but now they were fairly embarked they were obliged to go with the course of the vessel and the whole nation split before into an hundred adverse factions with a king at it is head evidently declining to his tomb the whole nation lords commons and people proceeded as one body informed by one soul under the british union the union of europe was consolidated and it long held together with a degree of cohesion firmness and fidelity not known before or since in any political combination of that extent  just as the last hand was given to this immense and complicated machine the master workman died but the work was formed on true mechanical principles and it was as truly wrought it went by the impulse it had received from the first mover the man was dead but the grand alliance survived in which king william lived and reigned that heartless and dispirited people whom lord summers had represented about two years before as dead in energy and operation continued that war to which it was supposed they were unequal in mind and in means for near thirteen years  for what have i entered into all this detail to what purpose have i recalled your view to the end of the last century it has been done to show that the british nation was then a great people  to point out how and by what means they came to be exalted above the vulgar level and to take that lead which they assumed among mankind to qualify us for that preeminence we had then an high mind and a constancy unconquerable we were then inspired with no flashy passions but such as were durable as well as warm such as corresponded to the great interests we had at stake this force of character was inspired as all such spirit must ever be from above government gave the impulse as well may we fancy that of itself the sea will swell and that without winds the billows will insult the adverse shore as that the gross mass of the people will be moved and elevated and continue by a steady and permanent direction to bear upon one point without the influence of superior authority or superior mind  this impulse ought in my opinion to have been given in this war and it ought to have been continued to it at every instant it is made if ever war was made to touch all the great springs of action in the human breast it ought not to have been a war of apology the minister had in this conflict wherewithal to glory in success to be consoled in adversity to hold high his principle in all fortunes if it were not given him to support the falling edifice he ought to bury himself under the ruins of the civilized world all the art of greece and all the pride and power of eastern monarchs never heaped upon their ashes so grand a monument  there were days when his great mind was up to the crisis of the world he is called to act in see the declaration  his manly eloquence was equal to the elevated wisdom of such sentiments but the little have triumphed over the great an unnatural as it should seem not an unusual victory i am sure you cannot forget with how much uneasiness we heard in conversation the language of more than one gentleman at the opening of this contest that he was willing to try the war for a year or two and if it did not succeed then to vote for peace as if war was a matter of experiment as if you could take it up or lay it down as an idle frolic as if the dire goddess that presides over it with her murderous spear in her hand and her gorgon at her breast was a coquette to be flirted with we ought with reverence to approach that tremendous divinity that loves courage but commands counsel war never leaves where it found a nation it is never to be entered into without a mature deliberation not a deliberation lengthened out into a perplexing indecision but a deliberation leading to a sure and fixed judgment when so taken up it is not to be abandoned without reason as valid as fully and as extensively considered peace may be made as unadvisedly as war nothing is so rash as fear and the counsels of pusillanimity very rarely put off whilst they are always sure to aggravate the evils from which they would fly  in that great war carried on against louis the xivth for near eighteen years government spared no pains to satisfy the nation that though they were to be animated by a desire of glory glory was not their ultimate object but that every thing dear to them in religion in law in liberty every thing which as freemen as englishmen and as citizens of the great commonwealth of christendom they had at heart was then at stake this was to know the true art of gaining the affections and confidence of an highminded people this was to understand human nature a danger to avert a danger  a present inconvenience and suffering to prevent a foreseen future and a worse calamity  these are the motives that belong to an animal who in his constitution is at once adventurous and provident circumspect and daring whom his creator has made as the poet says of large discourse looking before and after but never can a vehement and sustained spirit of fortitude be kindled in a people by a war of calculation it has nothing that can keep the mind erect under the gusts of adversity even where men are willing as sometimes they are to barter their blood for lucre to hazard their safety for the gratification of their avarice the passion which animates them to that sort of conflict like all the shortsighted passions must see it is objects distinct and near at hand the passions of the lower order are hungry and impatient speculative plunder contingent spoil future long adjourned uncertain booty pillage which must enrich a late posterity and which possibly may not reach to posterity at all these for any length of time will never support a mercenary war the people are in the right the calculation of profit in all such wars is false on balancing the account of such wars ten thousand hogsheads of sugar are purchased at ten thousand times their price the blood of man should never be shed but to redeem the blood of man it is well shed for our family for our friends for our god for our country for our kind the rest is vanity the rest is crime  in the war of the grand alliance most of these considerations voluntarily and naturally had their part some were pressed into the service the political interest easily went in the track of the natural sentiment in the reverse course the carriage does not follow freely i am sure the natural feeling as i have just said is a far more predominant ingredient in this war than in that of any other that ever was waged by this kingdom  if the war made to prevent the union of two crowns upon one head was a just war this which is made to prevent the tearing all crowns from all heads which ought to wear them and with the crowns to smite off the sacred heads themselves this is a just war  if a war to prevent louis the xivth from imposing his religion was just a war to prevent the murderers of louis the xvith from imposing their irreligion upon us is just a war to prevent the operation of a system which makes life without dignity and death without hope is a just war  if to preserve political independence and civil freedom to nations was a just ground of war a war to preserve national independence property liberty life and honor from certain universal havoc is a war just necessary manly pious and we are bound to persevere in it by every principle divine and human as long as the system which menaces them all and all equally has an existence in the world  you who have looked at this matter with as fair and impartial an eye as can be united with a feeling heart you will not think it an hardy assertion when i affirm that it were far better to be conquered by any other nation than to have this faction for a neighbor before i felt myself authorized to say this i considered the state of all the countries in europe for these last three hundred years which have been obliged to submit to a foreign law in most of those i found the condition of the annexed countries even better certainly not worse than the lot of those which were the patrimony of the conqueror they wanted some blessings  but they were free from many very great evils they were rich and tranquil such was artois flanders lorrain alsatia under the old government of france such was silesia under the king of prussia they who are to live in the vicinity of this new fabric are to prepare to live in perpetual conspiracies and seditions and to end at last in being conquered if not to her dominion to her resemblance but when we talk of conquest by other nations it is only to put a case this is the only power in europe by which it is possible we should be conquered to live under the continual dread of such immeasurable evils is itself a grievous calamity to live without the dread of them is to turn the danger into the disaster the influence of such a france is equal to a war it is example more wasting than an hostile irruption the hostility with any other power is separable and accidental this power by the very condition of it is existence by it is very essential constitution is in a state of hostility with us and with all civilized people see declaration whitehall october           a government of the nature of that set up at our very door has never been hitherto seen or even imagined in europe what our relation to it will be cannot be judged by other relations it is a serious thing to have a connection with a people who live only under positive arbitrary and changeable institutions and those not perfected nor supplied nor explained by any common acknowledged rule of moral science i remember that in one of my last conversations with the late lord camden we were struck much in the same manner with the abolition in france of the law as a science of methodized and artificial equity france since her revolution is under the sway of a sect whose leaders have deliberately at one stroke demolished the whole body of that jurisprudence which france had pretty nearly in common with other civilized countries in that jurisprudence were contained the elements and principles of the law of nations the great ligament of mankind with the law they have of course destroyed all seminaries in which jurisprudence was taught as well as all the corporations established for it is conservation i have not heard of any country whether in europe or asia or even in africa on this side of mount atlas which is wholly without some such colleges and such corporations except france no man in a public or private concern can divine by what rule or principle her judgments are to be directed nor is there to be found a professor in any university or a practitioner in any court who will hazard an opinion of what is or is not law in france in any case whatever they have not only annulled all their old treaties but they have renounced the law of nations from whence treaties have their force with a fixed design they have outlawed themselves and to their power outlawed all other nations  instead of the religion and the law by which they were in a great politic communion with the christian world they have constructed their republic on three bases all fundamentally opposite to those on which the communities of europe are built it is foundation is laid in regicide in jacobinism and in atheism and it has joined to those principles a body of systematick manners which secures their operation  if i am asked how i would be understood in the use of these terms regicide jacobinism atheism and a system of correspondent manners and their establishment i will tell you  i call a commonwealth regicide which lays it down as a fixed law of nature and a fundamental right of man that all government not being a democracy is an usurpation nothing could be more solemn than their promulgation of this principle as a preamble to the destructive code of their famous articles for the decomposition of society into whatever country they should enter la convention nationale apres avoir entendu le rapport de ses comittes de finances de la guerre and diplomatiques reunis fidelle au principe de souveainte de peuples qui ne lui permet pas de reconnoitre aucune institution qui y port atteinte etc etc decret sur le rapport de cambon dec         and see the subsequent proclamation  that all kings as such are usurpers and for being kings may and ought to be put to death with their wives families and adherents the commonwealth which acts uniformly upon those principles and which after abolishing every festival of religion chooses the most flagrant act of a murderous regicide treason for a feast of eternal commemoration and which forces all her people to observe it  this i call regicide by establishment  jacobinism is the revolt of the enterprising talents of a country against it is property when private men form themselves into associations for the purpose of destroying the preexisting laws and institutions of their country when they secure to themselves an army by dividing amongst the people of no property the estates of the ancient and lawful proprietors when a state recognizes those acts when it does not make confiscations for crimes but makes crimes for confiscations when it has it is principal strength and all it is resources in such a violation of property when it stands chiefly upon such a violation massacring by judgments or otherwise those who make any struggle for their old legal government and their legal hereditary or acquired possessions  i call this jacobinism by establishment  i call it atheism by establishment when any state as such shall not acknowledge the existence of god as a moral governor of the world when it shall offer to him no religious or moral worship  when it shall abolish the christian religion by a regular decree  when it shall persecute with a cold unrelenting steady cruelty by every mode of confiscation imprisonment exile and death all it is ministers  when it shall generally shut up or pull down churches when the few buildings which remain of this kind shall be opened only for the purpose of making a profane apotheosis of monsters whose vices and crimes have no parallel amongst men and whom all other men consider as objects of general detestation and the severest animadversion of law when in the place of that religion of social benevolence and of individual selfdenial in mockery of all religion they institute impious blasphemous indecent theatric rites in honor of their vitiated perverted reason and erect altars to the personification of their own corrupted and bloody republic  when schools and seminaries are founded at public expense to poison mankind from generation to generation with the horrible maxims of this impiety  when wearied out with incessant martyrdom and the cries of a people hungering and thirsting for religion they permit it only as a tolerated evil  i call this atheism by establishment  when to these establishments of regicide of jacobinism and of atheism you add the correspondent system of manners no doubt can be left on the mind of a thinking man concerning their determined hostility to the human race manners are of more importance than laws upon them in a great measure the laws depend the law touches us but here and there and now and then manners are what vex or sooth corrupt or purify exalt or debase barbarize or refine us by a constant steady uniform insensible operation like that of the air we breathe in they give their whole form and color to our lives according to their quality they aid morals they supply them or they totally destroy them of this the new french legislators were aware therefore with the same method and under the same authority they settled a system of manners the most licentious prostitute and abandoned that ever has been known and at the same time the most coarse rude savage and ferocious nothing in the revolution no not to a phrase or a gesture not to the fashion of a hat or a shoe was left to accident all has been the result of design all has been matter of institution no mechanical means could be devised in favor of this incredible system of wickedness and vice that has not been employed the noblest passions the love of glory the love of country have be debauched into means of it is preservation and it is propagation all sorts of shows and exhibitions calculated to inflame and vitiate the imagination and pervert the moral sense have been contrived they have sometimes brought forth five or six hundred drunken women calling at the bar of the assembly for the blood of their own children as being royalists or constitutionalists sometimes they have got a body of wretches calling themselves fathers to demand the murder of their sons boasting that rome had but one brutus but that they could show five hundred there were instances in which they inverted and retaliated the impiety and produced sons who called for the execution of their parents the foundation of their republic is laid in moral paradoxes their patriotism is always prodigy all those instances to be found in history whether real or fabulous of a doubtful public spirit at which morality is perplexed reason is staggered and from which affrighted nature recoils are their chosen and almost sole examples for the instruction of their youth  the whole drift of their institution is contrary to that of the wise legislators of all countries who aimed at improving instincts into morals and at grafting the virtues on the stock of the natural affections they on the contrary have omitted no pains to eradicate every benevolent and noble propensity in the mind of men in their culture it is a rule always to graft virtues on vices they think every thing unworthy of the name of public virtue unless it indicates violence on the private all their new institutions and with them every thing is new strike at the root of our social nature other legislators knowing that marriage is the origin of all relations and consequently the first element of all duties have endeavored by every art to make it sacred the christian religion by confining it to the pairs and by rendering that relation indissoluble has by these two things done more toward the peace happiness settlement and civilization of the world than by any other part in this whole scheme of divine wisdom the direct contrary course has been taken in the synagogue of antichrist i mean in that forge and manufactory of all evil the sect which predominated in the constituent assembly of      those monsters employed the same or greater industry to desecrate and degrade that state which other legislators have used to render it holy and honorable by a strange uncalled for declaration they pronounced that marriage was no better than a common civil contract it was one of their ordinary tricks to put their sentiments into the mouths of certain personated characters which they theatrically exhibited at the bar of what ought to be a serious assembly one of these was brought out in the figure of a prostitute whom they called by the affected name of a mother without being a wifethis creature they made to call for a repeal of the incapacities which in civilized states are put upon bastards the prostitutes of the assembly gave to this their puppet the sanction of their greater impudence in consequence of the principles laid down and the manners authorized bastards were not long after put on the footing of the issue of lawful unions proceeding in the spirit of the first authors of their constitution succceding assemblies went the full length of the principle and gave a license to divorce at the mere pleasure of either party and at a months notice with them the matrimonial connection is brought into so degraded a state of concubinage that i believe none of the wretches in london who keep warehouses of infamy would give out one of their victims to private custody on so short and insolent a tenure there was indeed a kind of profligate equity in thus giving to women the same licentious power the reason they assigned was as infamous as the act declaring that women had been too long under the tyranny of parents and of husbands it is not necessary to observe upon the horrible consequences of taking one half of the species wholly out of the guardianship and protection of the other  the practice of divorce though in some countries permitted has been discouraged in all in the east polygamy and divorce are in discredit and the manners correct the laws in rome whilst rome was in it is integrity the few causes allowed for divorce amounted in effect to a prohibition they were only three the arbitrary was totally excluded and accordingly some hundreds of years passed without a single example of that kind when manners were corrupted the laws were relaxed as the latter always follow the former when they are not able to regulate them or to vanquish them of this circumstance the legislators of vice and crime were pleased to take notice as an inducement to adopt their regulation holding out an hope that the permission would as rarely be made use of they knew the contrary to be true and they had taken good care that the laws should be well seconded by the manners their law of divorce like all their laws had not for it is object the relief of domestic uneasiness but the total corruption of all morals the total disconnection of social life  it is a matter of curiosity to observe the operation of this encouragement to disorder i have before me the paris paper correspondent to the usual register of births marriages and deaths divorce happily is no regular head of registry amongst civilized nations with the jacobins it is remarkable that divorce is not only a regular head but it has the post of honor it occupies the first place in the list in the three first months of the year      the number of divorces in that city amounted to     the marriages were      so that the proportion of divorces to marriages was not much less than one to three a thing unexampled i believe among mankind i caused an enquiry to be made at doctors commons concerning the number of divorces and found that all the divorces which except by special act of parliament are separations and not proper divorces did not amount in all those courts and in an hundred years to much more than one fifth of those that passed in the single city of paris in three months i followed up the enquiry relative to that city through several of the subsequent months until i was tired and found the proportions still the same since then i have heard that they have declared for a revisal of these laws but i know of nothing done it appears as if the contract that renovates the world was under no law at all from this we may take our estimate of the havoc that has been made through all the relations of life with the jacobins of france vague intercourse is without reproach marriage is reduced to the vilest concubinage children are encouraged to cut the throats of their parents mothers are taught that tenderness is no part of their character and to demonstrate their attachment to their party that they ought to make no scruple to rake with their bloody hands in the bowels of those who came from their own  to all this let us join the practice of cannibalism with which in the proper terms and with the greatest truth their several factions accuse each other by cannibalism i mean their devouring as a nutriment of their ferocity some part of the bodies of those they have murdered their drinking the blood of their victims and forcing the victims themselves to drink the blood of their kindred slaughtered before their faces by cannibalism i mean also to signify all their nameless unmanly and abominable insults on the bodies of those they slaughter  as to those whom they suffer to die a natural death they do not permit them to enjoy the last consolations of mankind or those rights of sepulture which indicate hope and which mere nature has taught to mankind in all countries to soothe the afflictions and to cover the infirmity of mortal condition they disgrace men in the entry into life they vitiate and enslave them through the whole course of it and they deprive them of all comfort at the conclusion of their dishonored and depraved existence endeavoring to persuade the people that they are no better than beasts the whole body of their institution tends to make them beasts of prey furious and savage for this purpose the active part of them is disciplined into a ferocity which has no parallel to this ferocity there is joined not one of the rude unfashioned virtues which accompany the vices where the whole are left to grow up together in the rankness of uncultivated nature but nothing is left to nature in their systems  the same discipline which hardens their hearts relaxes their morals whilst courts of justice were thrust out by revolutionary tribunals and silent churches were only the funeral monuments of departed religion there were no fewer than nineteen or twenty theaters great and small most of them kept open at the public expense and all of them crowded every night among the gaunt hagard forms of famine and nakedness amidst the yells of murder the tears of affliction and the cries of despair the song the dance the mimick scene the buffoon laughter went on as regularly as in the gay hour of festive peace i have it from good authority that under the scaffold of judicial murder and the gaping planks that poured down blood on the spectators the space was hired out for a show of dancing dogs i think without concert we have made the very same remark on reading some of their pieces which being written for other purposes let us into a view of their social life it struck us that the habits of paris had no resemblance to the finished virtues or to the polished vice and elegant though not blameless luxury of the capital of a great empire their society was more like that of a den of outlaws upon a doubtful frontier of a lewd tavern for the revels and debauches of banditti assassins bravos smugglers and their more desperate paramours mixed with bombastick players the refuse and rejected offal of strolling theaters puffing out illsorted verses about virtue mixed with the licentious and blasphemous songs proper to the brutal and hardened course of life belonging to that sort of wretehes this system of manners in itself is at war with all orderly and moral society and is in it is neighborhood unsafe if great bodies of that kind were any where established in a bordering territory we should have a right to demand of their governments the suppression of such a nuisance what are we to do if the government and the whole community is of the same description yet that government has thought proper to invite ours to lay by its unjust hatred and to listen to the voice of humanity as taught by their example  the operation of dangerous and delusive first principles obliges us to have recourse to the true ones in the intercourse between nations we are apt to rely too much on the instrumental part we lay too much weight upon the formality of treaties and compacts we do not act much more wisely when we trust to the interests of men as guarantees of their engagements the interests frequently tear to pieces the engagements and the passions trample upon both entirely to trust to either is to disregard our own safety or not to know mankind men are not tied to one another by papers and seals they are led to associate by resemblances by conformities by sympathies it is with nations as with individuals nothing is so strong a tie of amity between nation and nation as correspondence in laws customs manners and habits of life they have more than the force of treaties in themselves they are obligations written in the heart they approximate men to men without their knowledge and sometimes against their intentions the secret unseen but irrefragable bond of habitual intercourse holds them together even when their perverse and litigious nature sets them to equivocate scuffle and fight about the terms of their written obligations  as to war if it be the means of wrong and violence it is the sole means of justice amongst nations nothing can banish it from the world they who say otherwise intending to impose upon us do not impose upon themselves but it is one of the greatest objects of human wisdom to mitigate those evils which we are unable to remove the conformity and analogy of which i speak incapable like every thing else of preserving perfect trust and tranquillity among men has a strong tendency to facilitate accommodation and to produce a generous oblivion of the rancour of their quarrels with this similitude peace is more of peace and war is less of war i will go further there have been periods of time in which communities apparently in peace with each other have been more perfectly separated than in later times many nations in europe have been in the course of long and bloody wars the cause must be sought in the similitude throughout europe of religion laws and manners at bottom these are all the same the writers on public law have often called this aggregate of nations a commonwealth they had reason it is virtually one great state having the same basis of general law with some diversity of provincial customs and local establishments the nations of europe have had the very same christian religion agreeing in the fundamental parts varying a little in the ceremonies and in the subordinate doctrines the whole of the polity and economy of every country in europe has been derived from the same sources it was drawn from the old germanic or gothic custumary from the feudal institutions which must be considered as an emanation from that custumary and the whole has been improved and digested into system and discipline by the roman law from hence arose the several orders with or without a monarch which are called states in every european country the strong traces of which where monarchy predominated were never wholly extinguished or merged in despotism in the few places where monarchy was cast off the spirit of european monarchy was still left those countries still continued countries of states that is of classes orders and distinctions such as had before subsisted or nearly so indeed the force and form of the institution called states continued in greater perfection in those republican communities than under monarchies from all those scources arose a system of manners and of education which was nearly similar in all this quarter of the globe and which softened blended and harmonized the colors of the whole there was little difference in the form of the universities for the education of their youth whether with regard to faculties to sciences or to the more liberal and elegant kinds of erudition from this resemblance in the modes of intercourse and in the whole form and fashion of life no citizen of europe could be altogether an exile in any part of it there was nothing more than a pleasing variety to recreate and instruct the mind to enrich the imagination and to meliorate the heart when a man traveled or resided for health pleasure business or necessity from his own country he never felt himself quite abroad  the whole body of this new scheme of manners in support of the new scheme of politics i consider as a strong and decisive proof of determined ambition and systematick hostility i defy the most refining ingenuity to invent any other cause for the total departure of the jacobin republic from every one of the ideas and usages religious legal moral or social of this civilized world and for her tearing herself from its communion with such studied violence but from a formed resolution of keeping no terms with that world it has not been as has been falsely and insidiously represented that these miscreants had only broke with their old government they made a schism with the whole universe and that schism extended to almost every thing great and small for one i wish since it is gone thus far that the breach had been so complete as to make all intercourse impracticable but partly by accident partly by design partly from the resistance of the matter enough is left to preserve intercourse whilst amity is destroyed or corrupted in it is principle  this violent breach of the community of europe we must conclude to have been made even if they had not expressly declared it over and over again either to force mankind into an adoption of their system or to live in perpetual enmity with a community the most potent we have ever known can any person imagine that in offering to mankind this desperate alternative there is no indication of a hostile mind because men in possession of the ruling authority are supposed to have a right to act without coercion in their own territories as to the right of men to act any where according to their pleasure without any moraltie no such right exists men are never in a state of total independence of each other it is not the condition of our nature nor is it conceivable how any man can pursue a considerable course of action without it is having some effect upon others or of course without producing some degree of responsibility for his conduct the situations in which men relatively stand produce the rules and principles of that responsibility and afford directions to prudence in exacting it  distance of place does not extinguish the duties or the rights of men but it often renders their exercise impracticable the same circumstance of distance renders the noxious effects of an evil system in any community less pernicious but there are situations where this difficulty does not occur and in which therefore these duties are obligatory and these rights are to be asserted it has ever been the method of public jurists to draw a great part of the analogies on which they form the law of nations from the principles of law which prevail in civil community civil laws are not all of them merely positive those which are rather conclusions of legal reason than matters of statutable provision belong to universal equity and are universally applicable almost the whole praetorian law is such there is a law of neighborhood which does not leave a man perfect master on his own ground when a neighbor sees a new erection in the nature of a nuisance set up at his door he has a right to represent it to the judge who on his part has a right to order the work to be staid or if established to be removed on this head the parent law is express and clear and has made many wise provisions which without destroying regulate and restrain the right of ownership by the right of vicinage no innovation is permitted that may redound even secondarily to the prejudice of a neighbor the whole doctrine of that important head of praetorian law  de novi operis nunciatione is founded on the principle that no new use should be made of a mans private liberty of operating upon his private property from whence a detriment may be justly apprehended by his neighbor this law of denunciation is prospective it is to anticipate what is called damnum infectum or damnum nondum factum that is a damage justly apprehended but not actually done even before it is clearly known whether the innovation be damageable or not the judge is competent to issue a prohibition to innovate until the point can be determined this prompt interference is grounded on principles favorable to both parties it is preventive of mischief difficult to be repaired and of ill blood difficult to be softened the rule of law therefore which comes before the evil is amongst the very best parts of equity and justifies the promptness of the remedy because as it is well observed res damni infecti celeritatem desiderat and periculosa est dilatio this right of denunciation does not hold when things continue however inconveniently to the neighborhood according to the ancient mode for there is a sort of presumption against novelty drawn out of a deep consideration of human nature and human affairs and the maxim of jurisprudence is well laid down vetustas pro lege semper habetur  such is the law of civil vicinity now where there is no constituted judge as between independent states there is not the vicinage itself is the natural judge it is preventively the assertor of it is own rights or remedially their avenger neighbors are presumed to take cognizance of each others acts  vicini vicinorum facta presumuntur scire this principle which like the rest is as true of nations as of individual men has bestowed on the grand vicinage of europe a duty to know and a right to prevent any capital innovation which may amount to the erection of a dangerous nuisance this state of things cannot exist in france without involving all the surrounding powers in one common danger without giving them the right without imposing it on them as a duty to stop the progress of an evil which attacks the fundamental principles by which mankind is united in civil society declaration   th oct      of the importance of that innovation and the mischief of that nuisance they are to be sure bound to judge not litigiously but it is in their competence to judge they have uniformly acted on this right what in civil society is a ground of action in politic society is a ground of war but the exercise of that competent jurisdiction is a matter of moral prudence as suits in civil society so war in the political must ever be a matter of great deliberation it is not this or that particular proceeding picked out here and there as a subject of quarrel that will do there must be an aggregate of mischief there must be marks of deliberation there must be traces of design there must be indications of malice there must be tokens of ambition there must be force in the body where they exist there must be energy in the mind when all these circumstances combine or the important parts of them the duty of the vicinity calls for the exercise of it is competence and the rules of prudence do not restrain but demand it  in describing the nuisance erected by so pestilential a manufactory by the construction of so infamous a brothel by digging a night cellar for such thieves murderers and housebreakers as never infested the world i am so far from aggravating that i have fallen infinitely short of the evil no man who has attended to the particulars of what has been done in france and combined them with the principles there asserted can possibly doubt it when i compare with this great cause of nations the trifling points of honor the still more contemptible points of interest the light ceremonies the undefinable punctilios the disputes about precedence the lowering or the hoisting of a fail the dealing in a hundred or two of wild catskins on the other side of the globe which have often kindled up the flames of war between nations i stand astonished at those persons who do not feel a resentment not more natural than politic at the atrocious insults that this monstrous compound offers to the dignity of every nation and who are not alarmed with what it threatens to their safety  i have therefore been decidedly of opinion with our declaration at whitehall in the beginning of this war that the vicinage of europe had not only a right but an indispensible duty and an exigent interest to denunciate this new work before it had produced the danger we have so sorely felt and which we shall long feel the example of what is done by france is too important not to have a vast and extensive influence and that example backed with it is power must bear with great force on those who are near it especially on those who shall recognize the pretended republic on the principle upon which it now stands it is not an old structure which you have found as it is and are not to dispute of the original end and design with which it had been so fashioned it is a recent wrong and can plead no prescription it violates the rights upon which not only the community of france but those on which all communities are founded the principles on which they proceed are general principles and are as true in england as in any other country they who though with the purest intentions recognize the authority of these regicides and robbers upon principle justify their acts and establish them as precedents it is a question not between france and england it is a question between property and force the property claims and it is claim has been allowed the property of the nation is the nation they who massacre plunder and expel the body of the proprietary are murderers and robbers the state in it is essence must be moral and just and it may be so though a tyrant or usurper should be accidentally at the head of it this is a thing to be lamented but this notwithstanding the body of the commonwealth may remain in all it is integrity and be perfectly sound in it is composition the present case is different it is not a revolution in government it is not the victory of party over party it is a destruction and decomposition of the whole society which never can be made of right by any faction however powerful nor without terrible consequences to all about it both in the act and in the example this pretended republic is founded in crimes and exists by wrong and robbery and wrong and robbery far from a title to any thing is war with mankind to be at peace with robbery is to be an accomplice with it  mere locality does not constitute a body politic had cade and his gang got possession of london they would not have been the lord mayor aldermen and common council the body politic of france existed in the majesty of it is throne in the dignity of it is nobility in the honor of it is gentry in the sanctity of it is clergy in the reverence of it is magistracy in the weight and consideration due to it is landed property in the several bailliages in the respect due to it is moveable substance represented by the corporations of the kingdom all these particular moleculae united form the great mass of what is truly the body politic in all countries they are so many deposits and receptacles of justice because they can only exist by justice nation is a moral essence not a geographical arrangement or a denomination of the nomenclator france though out of her territorial possession exists because the sole possible claimant i mean the proprietary and the government to which the proprietary adheres exists and claims god forbid that if you were expelled from your house by ruffians and assassins that i should call the material walls doors and windows of  the ancient and honorable family of  am i to transfer to the intruders who not content to turn you out naked to the world would rob you of your very name all the esteem and respect i owe to you the regicides in france are not france france is out of her bounds but the kingdom is the same  to illustrate my opinions on this subject let us suppose a case which after what has happened we cannot think absolutely impossible though the augury is to be abominated and the event deprecated with our most ardent prayers let us suppose then that our gracious sovereign was sacrilegiously murdered his exemplary queen at the head of the matronage of this land murdered in the same manner that those princesses whose beauty and modest elegance are the ornaments of the country and who are the leaders and patterns of the ingenuous youth of their sex were put to a cruel and ignominious death with hundreds of others mothers and daughters ladies of the first distinction  that the prince of wales and the duke of york princes the hope and pride of the nation with all their brethren were forced to fly from the knives of assassins  that the whole body of our excellent clergy were either massacred or robbed of all and transported  the christian religion in all it is denominations forbidden and persecuted the law totally fundamentally and in all it is parts destroyed  the judges put to death by revolutionary tribunals  the peers and commons robbed to the last acre of their estates massacred if they staid or obliged to seek life in flight in exile and in beggary  that the whole landed property should share the very same fate  that every military and naval officer of honor and rank almost to a man should be placed in the same description of confiscation and exile  that the principal merchants and bankers should be drawn out as from an hencoop for slaughter  that the citizens of our greatest and most flourishing cities when the hand and the machinery of the hangman were not found sufficient should have been collected in the public squares and massacred by thousands with cannon  if three hundred thousand others should have been doomed to a situation worse than death in noisome and pestilential prisons  in such a case is it in the faction of robbers i am to look for my country would this be the england that you and i and even strangers admired honored loved and cherished would not the exiles of england alone be my government and my fellow citizens would not their places of refuge be my temporary country would not all my duties and all my affections be there and there only should i consider myself as a traitor to my country and deserving of death if i knocked at the door and heart of every potentate in christendom to succor my friends and to avenge them on their enemies could i in any way show myself more a patriot what should i think of those potentates who insulted their suffering brethren who treated them as vagrants or at least as mendicants and could find no allies no friends but in regicide murderers and robbers what ought i to think and feel if being geographers instead of kings they recognized the desolated cities the wasted fields and the rivers polluted with blood of this geometrical measurement as the honorable member of europe called england in that condition what should we think of sweden denmark or holland or whatever power afforded us a churlish and treacherous hospitality if they should invite us to join the standard of our king our laws and our religion if they should give us a direct promise of protection  if after all this taking advantage of our deplorable situation which left us no choice they were to treat us as the lowest and vilest of all mercenaries if they were to send us far from the aid of our king and our suffering country to squander us away in the most pestilential climates for a venal enlargement of their own territories for the purpose of trucking them when obtained with those very robbers and murderers they had called upon us to oppose with our blood what would be our sentiments if in that miserable service we were not to be considered either as english or as swedes dutch danes but as outcasts of the human race whilst we were fighting those battles of their interest and as their soldiers how should we feel if we were to be excluded from all their cartels how must we feel if the pride and flower of the english nobility and gentry who might escape the pestilential clime and the devouring sword should if taken prisoners be delivered over as rebel subjects to be condemned as rebels as traitors as the vilest of all criminals by tribunals formed of maroon negroe slaves covered over with the blood of their masters who were made free and organized into judges for their robberies and murders what should we feel under this inhuman insulting and barbarous protection of muscovites swedes or hollanders should we not obtest heaven and whatever justice there is yet on earth oppression makes wise men mad but the distemper is still the madness of the wise which is better than the sobriety of fools their cry is the voice of sacred misery exalted not into wild raving but into the sanctified phrensy of prophecy and inspiration  in that bitterness of soul in that indignation of suffering virtue in that exaltation of despair would not persecuted english loyalty cry out with an awful warning voice and denounce the destruction that waits on monarchs who consider fidelity to them as the most degrading of all vices who suffer it to be punished as the most abominable of all crimes and who have no respect but for rebels traitors regicides and furious negro slaves whose crimes have broke their chains would not this warm language of high indignation have more of sound reason in it more of real affection more of true attachment than all the lullabies of flatterers who would hush monarchs to sleep in the arms of death let them be well convinced that if ever this example should prevail in it is whole extent it will have it is full operation whilst kings stand firm on their base though under that base there is a surewrought mine there will not be wanting to their levee a single person of those who are attached to their fortune and not to their persons or cause but hereafter none will support a tottering throne some will fly for fear of being crushed under the ruin some will join in making it they will seek in the destruction of royalty fame and power and wealth and the homage of kings with reubel with carnot with revelliere and with the merlins and the talliens rather than suffer exile and beggary with the condes or the broglios the castries the d avrais the serrents the cazales and the long line of loyal suffering patriot nobility or to be butchered with the oracles and the victims of the laws the d ormestons the d espremenils and the malesherbes this example we shall give if instead of adhering to our fellows in a cause which is an honor to us all we abandon the lawful government and lawful corporate body of france to hunt for a shameful and ruinous fraternity with this odious usurpation that disgraces civilized society and the human race  and is then example nothing it is every thing example is the school of mankind and they will learn at no other this war is a war against that example it is not a war for louis the eighteenth or even for the property virtue fidelity of france it is a war for george the third for francis the second and for all the dignity property honor virtue and religion of england of germany and of all nations  i know that all i have said of the systematick unsociability of this newinvented species of republic and the impossibility of preserving peace is answered by asserting that the scheme of manners morals and even of maxims and principles of state is of no weight in a question of peace or war between communities this doctrine is supported by example the case of algiers is cited with an hint as if it were the stronger case i should take no notice of this sort of inducement if i had found it only where first it was i do not want respect for those from whom i first heard it  but having no controversy at present with them i only think it not amiss to rest on it a little as i find it adopted with much more of the same kind by several of those on whom such reasoning had formerly made no apparent impression if it had no force to prevent us from submitting to this necessary war it furnishes no better ground for our making an unnecessary and ruinous peace  this analogical argument drawn from the case of algiers would lead us a good way the fact is we ourselves with a little cover others more directly pay a tribute to the republic of algiers is it meant to reconcile us to the payment of a tribute to the french republic that this with other things more ruinous will be demanded hereafter i little doubt but for the present this will not be avowed  though our minds are to be gradually prepared for it in truth the arguments from this case are worth little even to those who approve the buying an algerine for bearance of piracy there are many things which men do not approve that they must do to avoid a greater evil to argue from thence that they are to act in the same manner in all cases is turning necessity into a law upon what is matter of prudence the argument concludes the contrary way because we have done one humiliating act we ought with infinite caution to admit more acts of the same nature lest humiliation should become our habitual state matters of prudence are under the dominion of circumstances and not of logical analogies it is so absurd to take it otherwise  i for one do more than doubt the policy of this kind of convention with algiers on those who think as i do the argument ad hominem can make no sort of impression i know something of the constitution and composition of this very extraordinary republic it has a constitution i admit similar to the present tumultuous military tyranny of france by which an handful of obscure ruffians domineer over a fertile country and a brave people for the composition too i admit the algerine community resembles that of france being formed out of the very scum scandal disgrace and pest of the turkish asia the grand seignor to disburthen the country suffers the dey to recruit in his dominions the corpse of janisaries or asaphs which form the directory and council of elders of the african republic one and indivisible but notwithstanding this resemblance which i allow i never shall so far injure the janisarian republic of algiers as to put it in comparison for every sort of crime turpitude and oppression with the jacobin republic of paris there is no question with me to which of the two i should choose to be a neighbor or a subject but situated as i am i am in no danger of becoming to algiers either the one or the other it is not so in my relation to the atheistical fanatics of france i am their neighbor i may become their subject have the gentlemen who borrowed this happy parallel no idea of the different conduct to be held with regard to the very same evil at an immense distance and when it is at your door when it is power is enormous as when it is comparatively as feeble as it is distance is remote when there is a barrier of language and usages which prevents corruption through certain old correspondences and habitudes from the contagion of the horrible novelties that are introduced into every thing else i can contemplate without dread a royal or a national tiger on the borders of pegu i can look at him with an easy curiosity as prisoner within bars in the menagerie of the tower but if by habeas corpus or otherwise he was to come into the lobby of the house of commons whilst your door was open any of you would be more stout than wise who would not gladly make your escape out of the back windows i certainly should dread more from a wild cat in my bedchamber than from all the lions that roar in the deserts behind algiers but in this parallel it is the cat that is at a distance and the lions and tigers that are in our antichambers and our lobbies algiers is not near algiers is not powerful algiers is not our neighbor algiers is not infectious algiers whatever it may be is an old creation and we have good data to calculate all the mischief to be apprehended from it when i find algiers transferred to calais i will tell you what i think of that point in the mean time the case quoted from the algerine reports will not apply as authority we shall put it out of court and so far as that goes let the counsel for the jacobin peace take nothing by their motion  when we voted as you and i did with many more whom you and i respect and love to resist this enemy we were providing for dangers that were direct home pressing and not remote contingent uncertain and formed upon loose analogies we judged of the danger with which we were menaced by jacobin france from the whole tenor of her conduct not from one or two doubtful or detached acts or expressions i not only concurred in the idea of combining with europe in this war but to the best of my power ever stimulated ministers to that conjunction of interests and of efforts i joined with them with all my soul on the principles contained in that manly and masterly statepaper which i have two or three times referred to declaration whitehall oct         and may still more frequently hereafter the diplomatick collection never was more enriched than with this piece the historick facts justify every stroke of the master thus painters write their names at co  various persons may concur in the same measure on various grounds they may be various without being contrary to or exclusive of each other i thought the insolent unprovoked aggression of the regicide upon our ally of holland a good ground of war i think his manifest attempt to overturn the balance of europe a good ground of war as a good ground of war i consider his declaration of war on his majesty and his kingdom but though i have taken all these to my aid i consider them as nothing more than as a sort of evidence to indicate the treasonable mind within long before their acts of aggression and their declaration of war the faction in france had assumed a form had adopted a body of principles and maxims and had regularly and systematically acted on them by which she virtually had put herself in a posture which was in itself a declaration of war against mankind  it is said by the directory in their several manifestoes that we of the people are tumultuous for peace and that ministers pretend negotiation to amuse us this they have learned from the language of many amongst ourselves whose conversations have been one main cause of whatever extent the opinion for peace with regicide may be but i who think the ministers unfortunately to be but too serious in their proceedings find myself obliged to say a little more on this subject of the popular opinion  before our opinions are quoted against ourselves it is proper that from our serious deliberation they may be worth quoting it is without reason we praise the wisdom of our constitution in putting under the discretion of the crown the awful trust of war and peace if the ministers of the crown virtually return it again into our hands the trust was placed there as a sacred deposit to secure us against popular rashness in plunging into wars and against the effects of popular dismay disgust or lassitude in getting out of them as imprudently as we might first engage in them to have no other measure in judging of those great objects than our momentary opinions and desires is to throw us back upon that very democracy which in this part our constitution was formed to avoid  it is no excuse at all for a minister who at our desire takes a measure contrary to our safety that it is our own act he who does not stay the hand of suicide is guilty of murder on our part i say that to be instructed is not to be degraded or enslaved information is an advantage to us and we have a right to demand it he that is bound to act in the dark cannot be said to act freely when it appears evident to our governors that our desires and our interests are at variance they ought not to gratify the former at the expense of the latter statesmen are placed on an eminence that they may have a larger horizon than we can possibly command they have a whole before them which we can contemplate only in the parts and even without the necessary relations ministers are not only our natural rulers but our natural guides reason clearly and manfully delivered has in itself a mighty force but reason in the mouth of legal authority is i may fairly say irresistible  i admit that reason of state will not in many circumstances permit the disclosure of the true ground of a public proceeding in that case silence is manly and it is wise it is fair to call for trust when the principle of reason itself suspends it is public use i take the distinction to be this the ground of a particular measure making a part of a plan it is rarely proper to divulge all the broader grounds of policy on which the general plan is to be adopted ought as rarely to be concealed they who have not the whole cause before them call them politicians call them people call them what you will are no judges the difficulties of the case as well as it is fair side ought to be presented this ought to be done and it is all that can be done when we have our true situation distinctly presented to us if then we resolve with a blind and headlong violence to resist the admonitions of our friends and to cast ourselves into the hands of our potent and irreconcilable foes then and not till then the ministers stand acquitted before god and man for whatever may come  lamenting as i do that the matter has not had so full and free a discussion as it requires i mean to omit none of the points which seem to me necessary for consideration previous to an arrangement which is for ever to decide the form and the fate of europe in the course therefore of what i shall have the honor to address to you i propose the following questions to your serious thoughts   whether the present system which stands for a government in france be such as in peace and war affects the neighboring states in a manner different from the internal government that formerly prevailed in that country   whether that system supposing it is views hostile to other nations possesses any means of being hurtful to them peculiar to itself   whether there has been lately such a change in france as to alter the nature of it is system or it is effect upon other powers   whether any public declarations or engagements exist on the part of the allied powers which stand in the way of a treaty of peace which supposes the right and confirms the power of the regicide faction in france   what the state of the other powers of europe will be with respect to each other and their colonies on the conclusion of a regicide peace   whether we are driven to the absolute necessity of making that kind of peace  these heads of enquiry will enable us to make the application of the several matters of fact and topics of argument that occur in this vast discussion to certain fixed principles i do not mean to confine myself to the order in which they stand i shall discuss them in such a manner as shall appear to me the best adapted for showing their mutual bearings and relations here then i close the public matter of my letter but before i have done let me say one word in apology for myself  in wishing this nominal peace not to be precipitated i am sure no man living is less disposed to blame the present ministry than i am some of my oldest friends and i wish i could say it of more of them make a part in that ministry there are some indeed whom my dim eyes in vain explorein my mind a greater calamity could not have fallen on the public than the exclusion of one of them but i drive away that with other melancholy thoughts a great deal ought to be said upon that subject or nothing as to the distinguished persons to whom my friends who remain are joined if benefits nobly and generously conferred ought to procure good wishes they are entitled to my best vows and they have them all they have administered to me the only consolation i am capable of receiving which is to know that no individual will suffer by my thirty years service to the public if things should give us the comparative happiness of a struggle i shall be found i was going to say fighting that would be foolish but dying by the side of mr pit i must add that if any thing defensive in our domestic system can possibly save us from the disasters of a regicide peace he is the man to save us if the finances in such a case can be repaired he is the man to repair them if i should lament any of his acts it is only when they appear to me to have no resemblance to acts of his but let him not have a confidence in himself which no human abilities can warrant his abilities are fully equal and that is to say much for any man to those which are opposed to him but if we look to him as our security against the consequences of a regicide peace let us be assured that a regicide peace and a constitutional ministry are terms that will not agree with a regicide peace the king cannot long have a minister to serve him nor the minister a king to serve if the great disposer in reward of the royal and the private virtues of our sovereign should call him from the calamitous spectacles which will attend a state of amity with regicide his successor will surely see them unless the same providence greatly anticipates the course of nature thinking thus and not as i conceive on light grounds i dare not flatter the reigning sovereign nor any minister he has or can have nor his successor apparent nor any of those who may be called to serve him with what appears to me a false state of their situation we cannot have them and that peace together  i do not forget that there had been a considerable difference between several of our friends with my insignificant self and the great man at the head of ministry in an early stage of these discussions but i am sure there was a period in which we agreed better in the danger of a jacobin existence in france at one time he and all europe seemed to feel it but why am not i converted with so many great powers and so many great ministers it is because i am old and slow  i am in this year      only where all the powers of europe were in      i cannot move with this procession of the equinoxes which is preparing for us the return of some very old i am afraid no golden era or the commencement of some new era that must be denominated from some new metal in this crisis i must hold my tongue or i must speak with freedom falsehood and delusion are allowed in no case whatever but as in the exercise of all the virtues there is an economy of truth it is a sort of temperance by which a man speaks truth with measure that he may speak it the longer but as the same rules do not hold in all cases  what would be right for you who may presume on a series of years before you would have no sense for me who cannot without absurdity calculate on six months of life what i say i must say at once whatever i write is in it is nature testamentary it may have the weakness but it has the sincerity of a dying declaration for the few days i have to linger here i am removed completely from the busy scene of the world but i hold myself to be still responsible for every thing that i have done whilst i continued on the place of action if the rawest tyro in politics has been influenced by the authority of my gray hairs and led by any thing in my speeches or my writings to enter into this war he has a right to call upon me to know why i have changed my opinions or why when those i voted with have adopted better notions i persevere in exploded error  when i seem not to acquiesce in the acts of those i respect in every degree short of superstition i am obliged to give my reasons fully i cannot set my authority against their authority but to exert reason is not to revolt against authority reason and authority do not move in the same parallel that reason is an amicus curiae who speaks de plano not pro tribunali it is a friend who makes an useful suggestion to the court without questioning it is jurisdiction whilst he acknowledges it is competence he promotes it is efficiency i shall pursue the plan i have chalked out in my letters that follow this  letter ii on the genius and character of the french revolution as it regards other nations my dear sir i closed my first letter with serious matter and i hope it has employed your thoughts the system of peace must have a reference to the system of the war on that ground i must therefore again recall your mind to our original opinions which time and events have not taught me to vary  my ideas and my principles led me in this contest to encounter france not as a state but as a faction the vast territorial extent of that country it is immense population it is riches of production it is riches of commerce and convention  the whole aggregate mass of what in ordinary cases constitutes the force of a state to me were but objects of secondary consideration they might be balanced and they have been often more than balanced great as these things are they are not what make the faction formidable it is the faction that makes them truly dreadful that faction is the evil spirit that possesses the body of france that informs it as a soul that stamps upon it is ambition and upon all it is pursuits a characteristick mark which strongly distinguishes them from the same general passions and the same general views in other men and in other communities it is that spirit which inspires into them a new a pernicious a desolating activity constituted as france was ten years ago it was not in that france to shake to shatter and to overwhelm europe in the manner that we behold a sure destruction impends over those infatuated princes who in the conflict with this new and unheard of power proceed as if they were engaged in a war that bore a resemblance to their former contests or that they can make peace in the spirit of their former arrangements of pacification here the beaten path is the very reverse of the safe road  as to me i was always steadily of opinion that this disorder was not in it is nature intermittent i conceived that the contest once begun could not be laid down again to be resumed at our discretion but that our first struggle with this evil would also be our last i never thought we could make peace with the system because it was not for the sake of an object we pursued in rivalry with each other but with the system itself that we were at war as i understood the matter we were at war not with it is conduct but with it is existence convinced that it is existence and it is hostility were the same  the faction is not local or territorial it is a general evil where it least appears in action it is still full of life in it is sleep it recruits it is strength and prepares it is exertion it is spirit lies deep in the corruptions of our common nature the social order which restrains it feeds it it exists in every country in europe and among all orders of men in every country who look up to france as to a common head the center is there the circumference is the world of europe wherever the race of europe may be settled every where else the faction is militant in france it is triumphant in france is the bank of deposit and the bank of circulation of all the pernicious principles that are forming in every state it will be a folly scarcely deserving of pity and too mischievous for contempt to think of restraining it in any other country whilst it is predominant there war instead of being the cause of it is force has suspended it is operation it has given a reprieve at least to the christian world  the true nature of a jacobin war in the beginning was by most of the christian powers felt acknowledged and even in the most precise manner declared in the joint manifesto published by the emperor and the king of prussia on the  th of august      it is expressed in the clearest terms and on principles which could not fail if they had adhered to them of classing those monarchs with the first benefactors of mankind this manifesto was published as they themselves express it to lay open to the present generation as well as to posterity their motives their intentions and the disinterestedness of their personal views taking up arms for the purpose of preserving social and political order amongst all civilized nations and to secure to each state it is religion happiness independence territories and real constitution  on this ground they hoped that all empires and all states ought to be unanimous and becoming the firm guardians of the happiness of mankind that they cannot fail to unite their efforts to rescue a numerous nation from it is own fury to preserve europe from the return of barbarism and the universe from the subversion and anarchy with which it was threatened the whole of that noble performance ought to be read at the first meeting of any congress which may assemble for the purpose of pacification in that piece these powers expressly renounce all views of personal aggrandizement and confine themselves to objects worthy of so generous so heroic and so perfectly wise and politic an enterprise it was to the principles of this confederation and to no other that we wished our sovereign and our country to accede as a part of the commonwealth of europe to these principles with some trifling exceptions and limitations they did fully accede see declaration whitehall oct         and all our friends who did take office acceded to the ministry whether wisely or not as i always understood the matter on the faith and on the principles of that declaration  as long as these powers flattered themselves that the menace of force would produce the effect of force they acted on those declarations but when their menaces failed of success their efforts took a new direction it did not appear to them that virtue and heroism ought to be purchased by millions of rixdollars it is a dreadful truth but it is a truth that cannot be concealed in ability in dexterity in the distinctness of their views the jacobins are our superiors they saw the thing right from the very beginning whatever were the first motives to the war among politicians they saw that it is in it is spirit and for it is objects a civil war and as such they pursued it it is a war between the partisans of the ancient civil moral and political order of europe against a sect of fanatical and ambitious atheists which means to change them all it is not france extending a foreign empire over other nations it is a sect aiming at universal empire and beginning with the conquest of france the leaders of that sect secured the center of europe and that secured they knew that whatever might be the event of battles and sieges their cause was victorious whether it is territory had a little more or a little less peeled from it is surface or whether an island or two was detached from it is commerce to them was of little moment the conquest of france was a glorious acquisition that once well laid as a basis of empire opportunities never could be wanting to regain or to replace what had been lost and dreadfully to avenge themselves on the faction of their adversaries  they saw it was a civil war it was their business to persuade their adversaries that it ought to be a foreign war the jacobins every where set up a cry against the new crusade and they intrigued with effect in the cabinet in the field and in every private society in europe their task was not difficult the condition of princes and sometimes of first ministers too is to be pitied the creatures of the desk and the creatures of favor had no relish for the principles of the manifestoes they promised no governments no regiments no revenues from whence emoluments might arise by perquisite or by grant in truth the tribe of vulgar politicians are the lowest of our species there is no trade so vile and mechanical as government in their hands virtue is not their habit they are out of themselves in any course of conduct recommended only by conscience and glory a large liberal and prospective view of the interests of states passes with them for romance and the principles that recommend it for the wanderings of a disordered imagination the calculators compute them out of their senses the jesters and buffoons shame them out of every thing grand and elevated littleness in object and in means to them appears soundness and sobriety they think there is nothing worth pursuit but that which they can handle which they can measure with a twofoot rule which they can tell upon ten fingers  without the principles of the jacobins perhap whout any rinciples at all they played the ge of that faction there was a beaten road before them the powers of europe were armed france had always appeared dangerous the war was easily diverted from france as a faction to france as a state the princes were easily taught to slide back into their old habitual course of politics they were easily led to consider the flames that were consuming france not as a warning to protect their own buildings which wee without any paty wall and linked by a contignation into the edifice of france as an happy occasion for pillaging the goods and for carrying ff the materials of their neighbors house their provident fears were changed into avaricious hopes they carried on their new designs without seeming to abandon the principles of their old policy they pretended to ek or they flattered themselves tha they sought in the accession of new fortresses and ew territories a defensive security but the security wanted was against a kind of power which was not so truly dangerous in it is fortresses nor in it is territories as in it is spirit and it is principles they aimed or pretended to aim at defending themselves against a danger from which there can be no security in any defensive plan if armies and fortresses were a defense against jacobinism louis the sixteenth would this day reign a powerful monarch over an happy people  this error obliged them even in their offensive operations to adopt a plan of war against the success of which there was something little short of mathematical demonstration they refused to take any step which might strike at the heart of affairs they seemed unwilling to wound the enemy in any vital part they acted through the whole as if they really wished the conservation of the jacobin power as what might be more favorable than the lawful government to the attainment of the petty objects they looked for they always kept on the circumference and the wider and remoter the circle was the more eagerly they chose it as their sphere of action in this centrifugal war the plan they pursued in it is nature demanded great length of time in it is execution they who went the nearest way to work were obliged to cover an incredible extent of country it left to the enemy every means of destroying this extended line of weakness ill success in any part was sure to defeat the effect of the whole this is true of austria it is still more true of england on this false plan even good fortune by further weakening the victor put him but the further off from his object  as long as there was any appearance of success the spirit of aggrandizement and consequently the spirit of mutual jealousy seized upon all the coalesced powers some sought an accession of territory at the expense of france some at the expense of each other some at the expense of third parties and when the vicissitude of disaster took it is turn they found common distress a treacherous bond of faith and friendship  the greatest skill conducting the greatest military apparatus has been employed but it has been worse than uselessly employed through the false policy of the war the operations of the field suffered by the errors of the cabinet if the same spirit continues when peace is made the peace will fix and perpetuate all the errors of the war because it will be made upon the same false principle what has been lost in the field in the field may be regained an arrangement of peace in it is nature is a permanent settlement it is the effect of counsel and deliberation and not of fortuitous events if built upon a basis fundamentally erroneous it can only be retrieved by some of those unforeseen dispensations which the allwise but mysterious governor of the world sometimes interposes to snatch nations from ruin it would not be pious error but mad and impious presumption for any one to trust in an unknown order of dispensations in defiance of the rules of prudence which are formed upon the known march of the ordinary providence of god  it was not of that sort of war that i was amongst the least considerable but amongst the most zealous advisers and it is not by the sort of peace now talked of that i wish it concluded it would answer no great purpose to enter into the particular errors of the war the whole has been but one error it was but nominally a war of alliance as the combined powers pursued it there was nothing to hold an alliance together there could be no tie of honor in a society for pillage there could be no tie of a common interest where the object did not offer such a division amongst the parties as could well give them a warm concern in the gains of each other or could indeed form such a body of equivalents as might make one of them willing to abandon a separate object of his ambition for the gratification of any other member of the alliance the partition of poland offered an object of spoil in which the parties might agree they were circumjacent and each might take a portion convenient to his own territory they might dispute about the value of their several shares but the contiguity to each of the demandants always furnished the means of an adjustment though hereafter the world will have cause to rue this iniquitous measure and they most who were most concerned in it for the moment there was wherewithal in the object to preserve peace amongst confederates in wrong but the spoil of france did not afford the same facilities for accommodation what might satisfy the house of austria in a flemish frontier afforded no equivalent to tempt the cupidity of the king of prussia what might be desired by great britain in the west indies must be coldly and remotely if at all felt as an interest at vienna and it would be felt as something worse than a negative interest at madrid austria long possessed with unwise and dangerous designs on italy could not be very much in earnest about the conservation of the old patrimony of the house of savoy and sardinia who owed to an italian force all her means of shutting out france from italy of which she has been suppod to hold the k would not purchase the means of strength upon one side by yielding it on the ther she would not readily give the possession f nvar for the hope of savoy no continental power was willing to lose any of it is oenal objects for the increase of the naval power of great britain and great britain would not give up ay of the objects she souht for as the mean of an increase to her naval power to further their aggrandizement  the moment this war came to be considered as  war merely of profit the actual circumstances are such that it never could become really a war of alliance nor can the peace be a peace of alliance until things are put upon their right bottom  i dont find it denied that when a treaty is entered into for peace a demand will be made on the regicides to surrender a great part of their conquests on the continent will they in the present state of the war make that surrender without an equivalent this continental cession must of course be made in favor of that party in the alliance that has sufferedlosses that party has nothing to furnish toward an equivalent what equivalent for instance has holland to offer who has lost her all what equivalent can come from the emperor every part of whose territories contiguous to france is already within the pale of the regicide dominion what equivalent has sardinia to offer for savoy and for nice i may say for her whole being what has she taken from the faction of france she has lost very near her all and she has gained nothing what equivalent has spain to give alas she has already paid for her own ransom the fund of equivalent and a dreadful equivalent it is to england and to herself but i put spain out of the question she is a province of the jacobin empire and she must make peace or war according to the orders she receives from the directory of assassins in effect and substance her crown is a fief of regicide  whence then can the compensation be demanded undoubtedly from that power which alone has made some conquests that power is england will the allies then give away their ancient patrimony that england may keep islands in the west indies they never can protract the war in good earnest for that object nor can they act in concert with us in our refusal to grant any thing toward their redemption in that case we are thus situated either we must give europe bound hand and foot to france or we must quit the west indies without any one object great or small toward indemnity and security i repeat it without any advantage whatever because supposing that our conquest could comprize all that france ever possessed in the tropical america it never can amount in any fair estimation to a fair equivalent for holland for the austrian netherlands for the lower germany that is for the whole ancient kingdom or circle of burgundy now under the yoke of regicide to say nothing of almost all italy under the same barbarous domination if we treat in the present situation of things we have nothing in our hands that can redeem europe nor is the emperor as i have observed more rich in the fund of equivalents  if we look to our stock in the eastern world our most valuable and systematick acquisitions are made in that quarter is it from france they are made france has but one or two contemptible factories subsisting by the offal of the private fortunes of english individuals to support them in any part of india i look on the taking of the cape of good hope as the securing of a post of great moment it does honor to those who planned and to those who executed that enterprise but i speak of it always as compararively good as good as any thing can be in a scheme of war that repels us from a center and employs all our forces where nothing can be finally decisive but giving as i freely give every possible credit to these eastern conquests i ask one question on whom are they made it is evident that if we can keep our eastern conquests we keep them not at the expense of france but at the expense of holland our ally of holland the immediate cause of the war the nation whom we had undertaken to protect and not of the republic which it was our business to destroy if we return the african and the asiatick conquests we put them into the hands of a nominal state to that holland is reduced unable to retain them and which will virtually leave them under the direction of france if we withhold them holland declines still more as a state and she loses so much carrying trade and that means of keeping up the small degree of naval power she holds for which policy alone and not for any commercial gain she maintains the cape or any settlement beyond it in that case resentment faction and even necessity will throw her more and more into the power of the new mischievous republic but on the probable state of holland i shall say more when in this correspondence i come to talk over with you the state in which any sort of jacobin peace will leave all europe  so far as to the east indies  as to the west indies indeed as to either if we look for matter of exchange in order to ransom europe it is easy to show that we have taken a terribly roundabout road i cannot conceive even if for the sake of holding conquests there we should refuse to redeem holland and the austrian netherlands and the hither germany that spain merely as she is spain and forgetting that the regicide ambassador governs at madrid will see with perfect satisfaction great britain sole mistress of the isles in truth it appears to me that when we come to balance our account we shall find in the proposed peace only the pure simple and unendowed charms of jacobin amity we shall have the satisfaction of knowing that no blood or treasure has been spared by the allies for support of the regicide system we shall reflect at leisure on one great truth that it was ten times more easy totally to destroy the system itself than when established it would be to reduce it is power  and that this republic most formidable abroad was of all things the weakest at home that her frontier was terrible  her interior feeble  that it was matter of choice to attack her where she is invincible and to spare her where she was ready to dissolve by her own internal disorders we shall reflect that our plan was good neither for offense nor defense  my dear friend i hold it impossible that these considerations should have escaped the statesmen on both sides of the water and on both sides of the house of commons how a question of peace can be discussed without having them in view i cannot imagine if you or others see a way out of these difficulties i am happy i see indeed a fund from whence equivalents will be proposed i see it but i cannot just now touch it it is a question of high moment it opens another iliad of woes to europe  such is the time proposed for making a common political peace to which no one circumstance is propitious as to the grand principle of the peace it is left as if by common consent wholly out of the question  viewing things in this light i have frequently sunk into a degree of despondency and dejection hardly to be described yet out of the profoundest depths of this despair an impulse which i have in vain endeavored to resist has urged me to raise one feeble cry against this unfortunate coalition which is formed at home in order to make a coalition with france subversive of the whole ancient order of the world no disaster of war no calamity of season could ever strike me with half the horror which i felt from what is introduced to us by this junction of parties under the soothing name of peace we are apt to speak of a low and pusillanimous spirit as the ordinary cause by which dubious wars terminate in humiliating treaties it is here the direct contrary i am perfectly astonished at the boldness of character at the intrepidity of mind the firmness of nerve in those who are able with deliberation to face the perils of jacobin fraternity  this fraternity is indeed so terrible in it is nature and in it is manifest consequences that there is no way of quieting our apprehensions about it but by totally putting it out of sight by substituting for it through a sort of periphrasis something of an ambiguous quality and describing such a connection under the terms of  the usual relations of peace and amity by this means the proposed fraternity is hustled in the crowd of those treaties which imply no change in the public law of europe and which do not upon system affect the interior condition of nations it is confounded with those conventions in which matters of dispute among sovereign powers are compromised by the taking off a duty more or less by the surrender of a frontier town or a disputed district on the one side or the other by pactions in which the pretensions of families are settled as by a conveyancer making family substitutions and successions without any alteration in the laws manners religion privileges and customs of the cities or territories which are the subject of such arrangements  all this body of old conventions composing the vast and voluminous collection called the corpse diplomatique forms the code or statute law as the methodized reasonings of the great publicists and jurists form the digest and jurisprudence of the christian world in these treasures are to be found the usual relations of peace and amity in civilized europe and there the relations of ancient france were to be found amongst the rest  the present system in france is not the ancient france it is not the ancient france with ordinary ambition and ordinary means it is not a new power of an old kind it is a new power of a new species when such a questionable shape is to be admitted for the first time into the brotherhood of christendom it is not a mere matter of idle curiosity to consider how far it is in it is nature alliable with the rest or whether the relations of peace and amitywith this new state are likely to be of the same nature with the usual relations of the states of europe  the revolution in france had the relation of france to other nations as one of it is principal objects the changes made by that revolution were not the better to accommodate her to the old and usual relations but to produce new ones the revolution was made not to make france free but to make her formidable not to make her a neighbor but a mistress not to make her more observant of laws but to put her in a condition to impose them to make france truly formidable it was necessary that france should be newmodelled they who have not followed the train of the late proceedings have been led by deceitful representations which deceit made a part in the plan to conceive that this totally new model of a state in which nothing escaped a change was made with a view to it is internal relations only  in the revolution of france two sorts of men were principally concerned in giving a character and determination to it is pursuits the philosophers and the politicians they took different ways but they met in the same end the philosophers had one predominant object which they pursued with a fanatical fury that is the utter extirpation of religion to that every question of empire was subordinate they had rather domineer in a parish of atheists than rule over a christian world their temporal ambition was wholly subservient to their proselytizing spirit in which they were not exceeded by mahomet himself  they who have made but superficial studies in the natural history of the human mind have been taught to look on religious opinions as the only cause of enthusiastic zeal and sectarian propagation but there is no doctrine whatever on which men can warm that is not capable of the very same effect the social nature of man impels him to propagate his principles as much as physical impulses urge him to propagate his kind the passions give zeal and vehemence the understanding bestows design and system the whole man moves under the discipline of his opinions religion is among the most powerful causes of enthusiasm when any thing concerning it becomes an object of much meditation it cannot be indifferent to the mind they who do not love religion hate it the rebels to god perfectly abhor the author of their being they hate him with all their heart with all their mind with all their soul and with all their strength he never presents himself to their thoughts but to menace and alarm them they cannot strike the sun out of heaven but they are able to raise a smouldering smoke that obscures him from their own eyes not being able to revenge themselves on god they have a delight in vicariously defacing degrading torturing and tearing in pieces his image in man let no one judge of them by what he has conceived of them when they were not incorporated and had no lead they were then only passengers in a common vehicle they were then carried along with the general motion of religion in the community and without being aware of it partook of it is influence in that situation at worst their nature was left free to counterwork their principles they despaired of giving any very general currency to their opinions they considered them as a reserved privilege for the chosen few but when the possibility of dominion lead and propagation presented themselves and that the ambition which before had so often made them hypocrites might rather gain than lose by a daring avowal of their sentiments then the nature of this infernal spirit which has evil for it is goodappeared in it is full perfection nothing indeed but the possession of some power can with any certainty discover what at the bottom is the true character of any man without reading the speeches of vergniaux francais of nantz isnard and some others of that sort it would not be easy to conceive the passion rancour and malice of their tongues and hearts they worked themselves up to a perfect phrenzy against religion and all it is professors they tore the reputation of the clergy to pieces by their infuriated declamations and invectives before they lacerated their bodies by their massacres this fanatical atheism left out we omit the principal feature in the french revolution and a principal consideration with regard to the effects to be expected from a peace with it  the other sort of men were the politicians to them who had little or not at all reflected on the subject religion was in itself no object of love or hatred they disbelieved it and that was all neutral with regard to that object they took the side which in the present state of things might best answer their purposes they soon found that they could not do without the philosophers and the philosophers soon made them sensible that the destruction of religion was to supply them with means of conquest first at home and then abroad the philosophers were the active internal agitators and supplied the spirit and principles the second gave the practical direction sometimes the one predominated in the composition sometimes the other the only difference between them was in the necessity of concealing the general design for a time and in their dealing with foreign nations the fanatics going strait forward and openly the politicians by the surer mode of zigzag in the course of events this among other causes produced fierce and bloody contentions between them but at the bottom they thoroughly agreed in all the objects of ambition and irreligion and substantially in all the means of promoting these ends  without question to bring about the unexampled event of the french revolution the concurrence of a very great number of views and passions was necessary in that stupendous work no one principle by which the human mind may have it is faculties at once invigorated and depraved was left unemployed but i can speak it to a certainty and support it by undoubted proofs that the ruling principle of those who acted in the revolution as statesmen had the exterior aggrandizement of france as their ultimate end in the most minute part of the internal changes that were made we who of late years have been drawn from an attention to foreign affairs by the importance of our domestic discussions cannot easily form a conception of he general eagerness of the active and energetick part of the french nation itself the most active and energetick of all nations previous to it is revolution upon that subject i am convinced that the foreign speculators in france under the old government were twenty to one of the same description then or now in england and few of that description there were who did not emulously set forward the revolution the whole official system particularly in the diplomatic part the regulars the irregulars down to the clerks in office a corpse without all comparison more numerous than the same amongst us cooperated in it all the intriguers in foreign politics all the spies all the intelligencers actually or late in function all the candidates for that sort of employment acted solely upon that principle  on that system of aggrandizement there was but one mind but two violent factions arose about the means the first wished france diverted from the politics of the continent to attend solely to her marine to feed it by an increase of commerce and thereby to overpower england on her own element they contended that if england were disabled the powers on the continent would fall into their proper subordination that it was england which deranged the whole continental system of europe the others who were by far the more numerous though not the most outwardly prevalent at court considered this plan for france as contrary to her genius her situation and her natural means they agreed as to the ultimate object the reduction of the british power and if possible it is naval power but they considered an ascendancy on the continent as a necessary preliminary to that undertaking they argued that the proceedings of england herself had proved the soundness of this policy that her greatest and ablest statesmen had not considered the support of a continental balance against france as a deviation from the principle of her naval power but as one of the most effectual modes of carrying it into effect that such had been her policy ever since the revolution during which period the naval strength of great britain had gone on increasing in the direct ratio of her interference in the politics of the continent with much stronger reason ought the politics of france to take the same direction as well for pursuing objects which her situation would dictate to her though england had no existence as for counteracting the politics of that nation to france continental politics are primary they looked on them only of secondary consideration to england and however necessary but as means necessary to an end  what is truly astonishing the partisans of those two opposite systems were at once prevalent and at once employed and in the very same transactions the one ostensibly the other secretly during the latter part of the reign of lewis xv nor was there one court in which an ambassador resided on the part of the ministers in which another as a spy on him did not also reside on the part of the king they who pursued the scheme for keeping peace on the continent and particularly with austria acting officially and publicly the other faction counteracting and opposing them these private agents were continually going from their function to the bastille and from the bastille to employment and favor again an inextricable cabal was formed some of persons of rank others of subordinates but by this means the corpse of politicians was augmented in number and the whole formed a body of active adventuring ambitious discontented people despising the regular ministry despising the courts at which they were employed despising the court which employed them  the unfortunate louis the sixteenth it may be right to do justice to louis xvi he did what he could to destroy the double diplomacy of france he had all the secret correspondence burnt except one piece which was called conjectures rasonnees sur la situation de la france dans le systeme politic de leurope a work executed by m favier under the direction of count broglie a single copy of this was said to have been found in the cabinet of louis xvi it was published with some subsequent state papers of vergennes turgot and others as a new benefit of the revolution and the advertisement to the publication ends with the following words il sera facile de se convaincre qu y compris meme la revolution en grande party on trouve dans ces memoires et ses conjectures le germe de tout ce qu arriva aujourdhui and quon ne peut pas sans les avoir lus etre bien au fait des interets and meme des vues actuelles des diverses puissances de leurope the book is entitled politic de tous les cabinets de leurope pendant les regnes de louis xv and louis xvi it is altogether very curious and worth reading was not the first cause of the evil by which he suffered he came to it as to a sort of inheritance by the false politics of his immediate predecessor this system of dark and perplexed intrigue had come to it is perfection before he came to the throne and even then the revolution strongly operated in all it is causes  there was no point on which the discontented diplomatic politicians so bitterly arraigned their cabinet as for the decay of french influence in all others from quarrelling with the court they began to complain of monarchy itself as a system of government too variable for any regular plan of national aggrandizement they observed that in that sort of regimen too much depended on the personal character of the prince that the vicissitudes produced by the succession of princes of a different character and even the vicissitudes produced in the same man by the different views and inclinations belonging to youth manhood and age disturbed and distracted the policy of a country made by nature for extensive empire or what was still more to their taste for that sort of general overruling influence which prepared empire or supplied the place of it they had continually in their hands the observations of machiavel on livy they had montesquieu grandeur and decadence des romans as a manual and they compared with mortification the systematic proceedings of a roman senate with the fluctuations of a monarchy they observed the very small additions of territory which all the power of france actuated by all the ambition of france had acquired in two centuries the romans had frequently acquired more in a single year they severely and in every part of it criticized the reign of louis the xivth whose irregular and desultory ambition had more provoked than endangered europe indeed they who will be at the pains of seriously considering the history of that period will see that those french politicians had some reason they who will not take the trouble of reviewing it through all it is wars and all it is negociations will consult the short but judicious criticism of the marquis de montalambert on that subject it may be read separately from his ingenious system of fortification and military defense on the practical merit of which i am unable to form a judgment  the diplomatick politicians of whom i speak and who formed by far the majority in that class made disadvantageous comparisons even between their more legal and formalising monarchy and the monarchies of other states as a system of power and influence they observed that france not only lost ground herself but through the languor and unsteadiness of her pursuits and from her aiming through commerce at naval force which she never could attain without losing more on one side than she could gain on the other three great powers each of them as military states capable of balancing her had grown up on the continent russia and prussia had been created almost within memory and austria though not a new power and even curtailed in territory was by the very collision in which she lost that territory greatly improved in her military discipline and force during the reign of maria theresa the interior economy of the country was made more to correspond with the support of great armies than formerly it had been as to prussia a merely military power they observed that one war had enriched her with as considerable a conquest as france had acquired in centuries russia had broken the turkish power by which austria might be as formerly she had been balanced in favor of france they felt it with pain that the two northern powers of sweden and denmark were in general under the sway of russia or that at best france kept up a very doubtful conflict with many fluctuations of fortune and at an enormous expense in sweden in holland the french party seemed if not extinguished at least utterly obscured and kept under by a stadtholder leaning for support sometimes on great britain sometimes on prussia sometimes on both never on france even the spreading of the bourbon family had become merely a family accommodation and had little effect on the national politics this alliance they said extinguished spain by destroying all it is energy without adding any thing to the real power of france in the accession of the forces of it is great rival in italy the same family accommodation the same national insignificance were equally visible what cure for the radical weakness of the french monarchy to which all the means which wit could devise or nature and fortune could bestow toward universal empire was not of force to give life or vigor or consistency  but in a republic out the word came and it never went back  whether they reasoned right or wrong or that there was some mixture of right and wrong in their reasoning i am sure that in this manner they felt and reasoned the different effects of a great military and ambitious republic and of a monarchy of the same description were constantly in their mouths the principle was ready to operate when opportunities should offer which few of them indeed foresaw in the extent in which they were afterward presented but these opportunities in some degree or other they all ardently wished for  when i was in paris in      the treaty of      between austria and france was deplored as a national calamity because it united france in friendship with a power at whose expense alone they could hope any continental aggrandizement when the first partition of poland was made in which france had no share and which had farther aggrandized every one of the three powers of which they were most jealous i found them in a perfect phrenzy of rage and indignation not that they were hurt at the shocking and uncoloured violence and injustice of that partition but at the debility improvidence and want of activity in their government in not preventing it as a means of aggrandizement to their rivals or in not contriving by exchanges of some kind or other to obtain their share of advantage from that robbery  in that or nearly in that state of things and of opinions came the austrian match which promised to draw the knot as afterward in effect it did still more closely between the old rival houses this added exceedingly to their hatred and contempt of their monarchy it was for this reason that the late glorious queen who on all accounts was formed to produce general love and admiration and whose life was as mild and beneficent as her death was beyond example great and heroic became so very soon and so very much the object of an implacable rancour never to be extinguished but in her blood when i wrote my letter in answer to m de menonville in the beginning of january      i had good reason for thinking that this description of revolutionists did not so early nor so steadily point their murderous designs at the martyr king as at the royal heroine it was accident and the momentary depression of that part of the faction that gave to the husband the happy priority in death  from this their restless desire of an overruling influence they bent a very great part of their designs and efforts to revive the old french party which was a democratick party in holland and to make a revolution there they were happy at the troubles which the singular imprudence of joseph the second had stirred up in the austrian netherlands they rejoiced when they saw him irritate his subjects profess philosophy send away the dutch garrisons and dismantle his fortifications as to holland they never forgave either the king or the ministry for suffering that object which they justly looked on as principal in their design of reducing the power of england to escape out of their hands this was the true secret of the commercial treaty made on their part against all the old rules and principles of commerce with a view of diverting the english nation by a pursuit of immediate profit from an attention to the progress of france in it is designs upon that republic the system of the oeconomists which led to the general opening of commerce facilitated that treaty but did not produce it they were in despair when they found that by the vigor of mr pit supported in this point by mr fox and the opposition the object to which they had sacrificed their manufactures was lost to their ambition  this eager desire of raising france from the condition into which she had fallen as they conceived from her monarchical imbecility had been the main spring of their precedent interference in that unhappy american quarrel the bad effects of which to this nation have not as yet fully disclosed themselves these sentiments had been long lurking in their breasts though their views were only discovered now and then in heat and as by escapes but on this occasion they exploded suddenly they were professed with ostentation and propagated with zeal these sentiments were not produced as some think by their american alliance the american alliance was produced by their republican principles and republican policy this new relation undoubtedly did much the discourses and cabals that it produced the intercourse that it established and above all the example which made it seem practicable to establish a republic in a great extent of country finished the work and gave to that part of the revolutionary faction a degree of strength which required other energies than the late king prossessed to resist or even to restrain it spread every where but it was no where more prevalent than in the heart of the court the palace of versailles by it is language seemed a forum of democracy to have pointed out to most of those politicians from their dispositions and movements what has since happened the fall of their own monarchy of their own laws of their own religion would have been to furnish a motive the more for pushing forward a system on which they considered all these things as encumbrances such in truth they were and we have seen them succeed not only in the destruction of their monarchy but in all the objects of ambition that they proposed from that destruction  when i contemplate the scheme on which france is formed and when i compare it with these systems with which it is and ever must be in conflict those things which seem as defects in her polity are the very things which make me tremble the states of the christian world have grown up to their present magnitude in a great length of time and by a great variety of accidents they have been improved to what we see them with greater or less degrees of felicity and skill not one of them has been formed upon a regular plan or with any unity of design as their constitutions are not systematical they have not been directed to any peculiar end eminently distinguished and superseding every other the objects which they embrace are of the greatest possible variety and have become in a manner infinite in all these old countries the state has been made to the people and not the people conformed to the state every state has pursued not only every sort of social advantage but it has cultivated the welfare of every individual his wants his wishes even his tastes have been consulted this comprehensive scheme virtually produced a degree of personal liberty in forms the most adverse to it that liberty was found under monarchies styled absolute in a degree unknown to the ancient commonwealths from hence the powers of all our modern states meet in all their movements with some obstruction it is therefore no wonder that when these states are to be considered as machines to operate for some one great end that this dissipated and balanced force is not easily concentred or made to bear with the whole nation upon one point  the british state is without question that which pursues the greatest variety of ends and is the least disposed to sacrifice any one of them to another or to the whole it aims at taking in the entire circle of human desires and securing for them their fair enjoyment our legislature has been ever closely connected in it is most efficient part with individual feeling and individual interest personal liberty the most lively of these feelings and the most important of these interests which in other european countries has rather arisen from the system of manners and the habitudes of life than from the laws of the state in which it flourished more from neglect than attention in england has been a direct object of government  on this principle england would be the weakest power in the whole system fortunately however the great riches of this kingdom arising from a vaiety of causes and the disposition of the people which is as great to spend as to accumulate has easily afforded a disposeable surplus that gives a mighty momentum to the state this difficulty with these advantages to overcome it has called sorth the talents of the english financiers who by the surplus of industry poured out by prodigality have outdone every thing which has been accomplished in other nations the present minister has outdone his predecessors and as a minister of revenue is far above my power of praise but still there are cases in which england feels more than several others though they all feel the perplexity of an immense body of balanced advantages and of individual demands and of some irregularity in the whole mass  france differs essentially from all those governments which are formed without system which exist by habit and which are confused with the multitude and with the complexity of their pursuits what now stands as government in france is struck out at a heat the design is wicked immoral impious oppressive but it is spirited and daring it is systematick it is simple in it is principle it has unity and consistency in perfection in that country entirely to cut off a branch of commerce to extinguish a manufacture to destroy the circulation of money to violate credit to suspend the course of argriculture even to burn a city or to lay waste a province of their own does not cost them a moments anxiety to them the will the wish the want the liberty the toil the blood of individuals is as nothing individuality is left out of their scheme of government the state is all in all every thing is referred to the production of force afterward every thing is trusted to the use of it it is military in it is principle in it is maxims in it is spirit and in all it is movements the state has dominion and conquest for it is sole objects dominion over minds by proselytism over bodies by arms  thus constituted with an immense body of natural means which are lessened in their amount only to be increased in their effect france has since the accomplishment of the revolution a complete unity in it is direction it has destroyed every resource of the state which depends upon opinion and the good will of individuals the riches of convention disappear the advantages of nature in some measure remain even these i admit are astonishingly lessened the command ever what remains is complete and absolute we go about asking when assignats will expire and we laugh at the last price of them but what signifies the fate of those tickets of despotism the despotism will find despotick means of supply they have found the short cut to the productions of nature while others in pursuit of them are obliged to wind through the labyrinth of a very intricate state of society they seize upon the fruit of the labor they seize upon the labourer himself were france but half of what it is in population in compactness in applicability of it is force situated as it is and being what it is it would be too strong for most of the states of europe constituted as they are and proceeding as they proceed would it be wise to estimate what the world of europe as well as the world of asia had to dread from jinghiz khan upon a contemplation of the resources of the cold and barren spot in the remotest tartary from whence first issued that scourge of the human race ought we to judge from the excise and stamp duties of the rocks or from the paper circulation of the sands of arabia the power by which mahomet and his tribes laid hold at once on the two most powerful empires of the world beat one of them totally to the ground broke to pieces the other and in not much longer space of time than i have lived overturned governments laws manners religion and extended an empire from the indus to the pyrennees  material resources never have supplied nor ever can supply the want of unity in design and constancy in pursuit but unity in design and perseverance and boldness in pursuit have never wanted resources and never will we have not considered as we ought the dreadful energy of a state in which the property has nothin to do with the government reflect my dear sir reflect again and again on a government in which the property is in complete subjection and where nothing rules but the mind of desperate men the condition of a commonwealth not governed by it is property was a combination of things which the learned and ingenious speculator harrington who has to sed about society into all forms never could imagine to be possible we have seen it the world has felt it and if the world will shut their eyes to this state of things they will feel it more the rulers there have found their resources in crimes the discovery is dreadful the mine exhaustless they have every thing to gain and they have nothing to lose they have a boundless inheritance in hope and there is no medium for them betwixt the highest elevation and death with infamy never can they who from the miserable servitude of the desk have been raised to empire again submit to the bondage of a starving bureau or the profit of copying music or writing plaidoyers by the sheet it has made me often smile in bitterness when i have heard talk of an indemnity to such men provided they returned to their allegiance  from all this what is my inference it is that this new system of robbery in france cannot be rendered safe by any art that it must be destroyed or that it will destroy all europe that to destroy that enemy by some means or other the force opposed to it should be made to bear some analogy and resemblance to the force and spirit which that system exerts that war ought to be made against it in its vulnerable parts these are my inferences in one word with this republic nothing independent can coexist the errors of louis the xvith were more pardonable to prudence than any of those of the same kind into which the allied courts may fall they have the benefit of his dreadful example  the unhappy louis xvi was a man of the best intentions that probably ever reigned he was by no means deficient in talents he had a most laudable desire to supply by general reading and even by the acquisition of elemental knowledge an education in all points originally defective but nobody told him and it was no wonder he should not himself divine it that the world of which he read and the world in which he lived were no longer the same desirous of doing every thing for the best fearful of cabal distrusting his own judgment he sought his ministers of all kinds upon public testimony but as courts are the field for caballers the public is the theater for mountebanks and impostors the cure for both those evils is in the discernment of the prince but an accurate and penetrating discernment is what in a young prince could not be looked for  his conduct in it is principle was not unwise but like most other of his wellmeant designs it failed in his hands it failed partly from mere ill fortune to which speculators are rarely pleased to assign that very large share to which she is justly entitled in all human affairs the failure perhaps in part was owing to his suffering his system to be vitiated and disturbed by those intrigues which it is humanly speaking impossible wholly to prevent in courts or indeed under any form of government however with these aberrations he gave himself over to a succession of the statesmen of public opinion in other things he thought that he might be a king on the terms of his predecessors he was conscious of the purity of his heart and the general good tendency of his government he flattered himself as most men in his situation will that he might consult his ease without danger to his safety it is not at all wonderful that both he and his ministers giving way abundantly in other respects to innovation should take up in policy with the tradition of their monarchy under his ancestors the monarchy had subsisted and even been strengthened by the generation or support of republics first the swiss republics grew under the guardianship of the french monarchy the dutch republics were hatched and cherished under the same incubation afterward a republican constitution was under it is influence established in the empire against the pretensions of it is chief even whilst the monarchy of france by a series of wars and negotiations and lastly by the treaties of westphalia had obtained the establishment of the protestants in germany as a law of the empire the same monarchy under louis the xiiith had force enough to destroy the republican system of the protestants at home  louis the xvith was a diligent reader of history but the very lamp of prudence blinded him the guide of human life led him astray a silent revolution in the moral world preceded the political and prepared it it became of more importance than ever what examples were given and what measures were adopted their causes no longer lurked in the recesses of cabinets or in the private conspiracies of the factious they were no longer to be controlled by the force and influence of the grandees who formerly had been able to stir up troubles by their discontents and to quiet them by their corruption the chain of subordination even in cabal and sedition was broken in it is most important links it was no longer the great and the populace other interests were formed other dependencies other connexions other communications the middle classes had swelled far beyond their former proportion like whatever is the most effectively rich and great in society these classes became the seat of all the active politics and the preponderating weight to decide on them there were all the energies by which fortune is acquired there the consequence of their success there were all the talents which assert their pretensions and are impatient of the place which settled society prescribes to them these descriptions had got between the great and the populace and the influence on the lower classes was with them the spirit of ambition had taken possession of this class as violently as ever it had done of any other they felt the importance of this situation the correspondence of the monied and the mercantile world the literary intercourse of academies but above all the press of which they had in a manner entire possession made a kind of electrick communication every where the press in reality has made every government in it is spirit almost democratick without the great the first movements in this revolution could not perhaps have been given but the spirit of ambition now for the first time connected with the spirit of speculation was not to be restrained at will there was no longer any means of arresting a principle in it is course when louis the xvith under the influence of the enemies to monarchy meant to found but one republic he set up two when he meant to take away half the crown of his neighbor he lost the whole of his own louis the xvith could not with impunity countenance a new republic yet between his throne and that dangerous lodgment for an enemy which he had erected he had the whole atlantic for a ditch he had for an outwork the english nation itself friendly to liberty adverse to that mode of it he was surrounded by a rampart of monarchies most of them allied to him and generally under his influence yet even thus secured a republic erected under his auspices and dependent on his power became fatal to his throne the very money which he had lent to support this republic by a good faith which to him operated as perfidy was punctually paid to his enemies and became a resource in the hands of his assassins  with this example before their eyes do any ministers in england do any ministers in austria really flatter themselves that they can erect not on the remote shores of the atlantic but in their view in their vicinity in absolute contact with one of them not a commercial but a martial republic  a republic not of simple husbandmen or fishermen but of intriguers and of warriors  a republic of a character the most restless the most enterprizing the most impious the most fierce and bloody the most hypocritical and perfidious the most bold and daring that ever has been seen or indeed that can be conceived to exist without bringing on their own certain ruin  such is the republic to which we are going to give a place in civilized fellowship the republic which with joint consent we are going to establish in the center of europe in a post that overlooks and commands every other state and which eminently confronts and menaces this kingdom  you cannot fail to observe that i speak as if the allied powers were actually consenting and not compelled by events to the establishment of this faction in france the words have not escaped me you will hereafter naturally expect that i should make them good but whether in adopting this measure we are madly active or weakly passive or pusillanimously panickstruck the effects will be the same you may call this faction which has eradicated the monarchy  expelled the proprietary persecuted religion and trampled upon law see our declaration   you may call this france if you please but of the ancient france nothing remains but it is central geography it is iron frontier it is spirit of ambition it is audacity of enterprise it is perplexing intrigue these and these alone remain and they remain heightened in their principle and augmented in their means all the former correctives whether of virtue or of weakness which existed in the old monarchy are gone no single new corrective is to be found in the whole body of the new institutions how should such a thing be found there when everything has been chosen with care and selection to forward all those ambitious designs and dispositions not to control them the whole is a body of ways and means for the supply of dominion without one heterogeneous particle in it  here i suffer you to breathe and leave to your meditation what has occurred to me on the genius and character of the french revolution from having this before us we may be better able to determine on the first question i proposed that is how far nations called foreign are likely to be affected with the system established within that territory i intended to proceed next on the question of her facilities from the internal state of other nations and particularly of this for obtaining her ends but i ought to be aware that my notions are controverted  i mean therefore in my next letter to take notice of what in that way has been recommended to me as the most deserving of notice in the examination of those pieces i shall have occasion to discuss some others of the topics i have recommended to your attention you know that the letters which i now send to the press as well as a part of what is to follow have been long since written a circumstance which your partiality alone could make of importance to you but which to the public is of no importance at all retarded their appearance the late events which press upon us obliged me to make some few additions but no substantial change in the matter  this discussion my friend will be long but the matter is serious and if ever the fate of the world could be truly said to depend on a particular measure it is upon this peace for the present farewell
