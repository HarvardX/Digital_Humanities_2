the drop and pill of mr ward considered as well in respect to their composition as their operation and effects  wherein as there is great reason to believe the genuine receipt of both  in an epistle to dr james jurin fellow of the college of physicians and of the royal society from daniel turner of the same college of physicians in london  london printed for john clarke at the bible under the royal exchange mdccxxxv price sixpence  the drop and pill of mr ward considered in an epistle etc sir you may wonder possibly that i who have been so uncivilly treated by some who call themselves gentlemen on the account of my enquiry after the crude quicksilver should give myself any manner of concern about the well or ill fare of my fellow citizens but leave them rather to the ancient and common saying if they will be let them be deceived  i dare be confident whatever certain envious persons may think to the contrary you will be so charitable as to believe that i have no ends of my own to serve by an undertaking in which though i may happen to please some i shall in all likelihood displease others  the friendship indeed of good as well as learned men and such i esteem yourself i shall at all times value whilst the malice and ill nature of the petulant and profligate however learned i have long since learned to despise but what alas avail the smiles or frowns of the world to an old man that must soon leave it and provided he has a well grounded peace in his own breast when he takes that leave has less reason to be concerned at the unjust censure of unreasonable men  to detain you no longer i am satisfied you are no stranger to the fame this drop and pill of mr ward have acquired within these twelve months past how deservedly we are now to examine but first a word or two of their composition  the conjectures about which are various as the diverse judgments and opinions of the conjecturers have diversely led them  some surely without reason have surmised the same to be mercurial yet among the hundreds daily taking them not one instance can be given of a sore mouth or tongue much less salivation which must at some time have inevitably fallen out if the basis was mercurial  others more rightly therefore conclude them antimonial among these there are who pretend to be masters of the secret and who tell us that the pill is the same with the kermes mineralis of the french dispensatory made out of four parts antimony and one of fixed nitre boiled in rainwater and then filtered after which more water is added and more also of the nitre boiling and filtering as before when still more water and nitre in the several proportions observed by the prescript are decocted finally the several liquors filtered having stood to settle twentyfour hours are poured off from the sediment which being sweetened by often washing the same is dried and twice flagrated with spirit of wine  but this praecipitate which i have seen prepared comes forth of a deeper red than mr wards nor will it operate in so small a quantity as his pill  hartman has one more simple than the former which he calls his sulphur of antimony answering nearer to the color and working after like manner both upwards and downwards not so doggedly in the same weight though it has been given sometimes to four or five grains  this is made of the fine powder of antimony digested for a week in a strong lixivium of aqua calcis when it is filtered and after gentle boiling a red powder is thrown down which being washed is dried and kept for use  his copier salmon says this powder performs all that the crocus can do  related to the foregoing is that of beguinus which is nothing but the same mineral boiled also in a strong lixivium and after precipitated with rainwater impregnated with the spirit of vinegar  the lixivium used for these purposes is made commonly of the sal tartari calx viva and common salt a dissolved in water and then filtered or of the alkaline salt of plants although the aqua calcis as above very frequently supplies the place  again there is a sulphur of antimony made from the crocus metallorum boiled in the same lixive and precipitated with the acet destil having the virtues of the crocus and is much the finer of the two given in the same dose from two to four grains or five  the golden sulphur is prepared by boiling the dross separated from the regulus in a lixivium as the rest then precipitating with vinegar there falls a powder of the color of gold whence the name which is sweetened by ablution in a large quantity of rainwater and dried for use  but the true sulphur according to our last recited author is prepared from cinnabar finely powdered and boiled in a solution of salt of tartar nitre and calx viva after decanting the liquor from the quicksilver at the bottom filter and incline the vessel that the red sulphur may settle which you must sweeten with hot water and dry gently so have you with this gentleman the true sulphur antimonti which opens all obstructions of the liver spleen mesentery and hypochonders expelling all humors whatever or wherever heaped up in the body both upwards and downwards  of this sulphur and the regulus there is a panacaea compounded wonderfully extolled by hartman as a universal medicine curing all obstinate diseases as the lues lepra scurvy etc by the way of sweat  mr wilson gives us another little differing from the former unless in the strength of the lee i e by the pouring one pound of the lixivium capitale or the first running of the soapmakers lees upon four ounces of the finest levigated antimony set to digest in warm sand four or five days shaking them well together then put thereto some warm water after thus standing to settle for some time it is poured off into a clean pan this ablution is to be repeated till all the brownish powder is separated from that which appears like the crude antimony upon which more lees are thrown and the washing renewed till the whole of the antimony is reduced into the powder aforesaid which being well rinsed from the salts is to be kept dry till called for  the virtues are much the same with the rest being emetic cathartick and diaphoretick i e by vomit stool and sweat according to our chemist this process was used as a succedaneum to that which went formerly under the name of russels powder  besides the abovementioned i could enumerate others drawn from the same mineral by the torture of fire as when fluxd in the crucible together with sal armoniack thus the antimon resuscitatum or with nitre common salt and charcoal put into a red hot crucible by a spoonful at a time then either pouring it into a cone or suffering it to cool in the crucible there will be found three different substances viz at the bottom a little regulus above that a closer or more compact matter like the liver of antimony and on the surface a finer and lighter mass  the two last of these are to be kept asunder putting by the regulus powdering the other and washing them apart till freed from their salts which you may know by the taste of the water the uppermost is accounted the best being of a fine red color after it has been washed the middle substance looks not of so pleasant a color and works more roughly the undermost or regulus is the same with the regulus of antimony  these red flowers with monsieur lemery are the more sulphurous parts of antimony sublimed by fire as the same are precipitated from the lixivia or lees by the ablution with water and vinegar  powder says he and mix together four pounds of common glass with one pound of antimony put them into a retort set in a reverberatory furnace fitted with a receiver lute the junctures giving a little fire at first then increase and you will see the red flowers come forth into the receiver  their operation as of the rest is by vomit and stool being given in the venereal disease the gout dropsy scurvy and other chronical distempers from two to four grains  it was the former of these processes according to mr wilson that mr lockyer aimed at in the composition of his pill by which he acquired a great estate  now whether or no these flowers of antimony thus raised by fire or any of the praecipitates of the same color here observed as by some has been thought be the composition of mr wards pill is less material to our purpose since it is i think out of dispute that most of them will do as much good and as much mischief also when directed by ignorant persons and taken by the like at all adventures although to deal plainly when i consider the strange ravage it makes among the solid as well as fluid parts of the body in so small a quantity as one grain weight as much even as the glass itself or crocus would do i have been ready to apprehend it rather a praecipitate like the algarct though of a different color from the same caustic oil or butter of antimony which if fit to be countenanced or to have a sanction from any one in regular practice i leave all such with yourself to determine  about the same time give me leave to acquaint you of mr lockyer and mr russel aforementioned viz about fifty or sixty years past there was another russel who had been an itinerant mountebank traveling the countries but happening to marry a lady of some condition as well as estate he hired a very handsome house in holborn near graysinngate and coming here acquainted with a chemist who had been as he said an operator in mr boyles elaboratory he got a preparation of antimony from him like this of mr wards if not the same which was prepared at the doctors house being called by the name of his panacea or golden sulphur of antimony by which many famous cures were said to be effected  it happened i was at this time the doctors patient and going often to his house as living but a few doors off i have seen his black bring of this red powder in a small earthen platter into his study where his master weighing it out would moisten the same with a liquor and form it into pills of the bigness of large pinsheads resembling both in bulk and color these of our new aesculapius ten of which being put into a small tin box were sold for as many shillings the poor who made an interest to my lady had them gratis their operation was rough both upwards and downwards like the other dr russels powder and as lockyers would frequently work according as they met with constitutions more robust or weak or as the fibers of the stomach and guts were more or less susceptible of the stimulating salt and sulphur in the preparation  what i would observe farther from these persons remedies is this that my neighbor the doctor his pill did not survive him but through some fatal accidents like these of mr wards was soon blasted and he fell then upon a safer and more popular medicine which was his spirit of scurvy grass both plain and purging with which he furnished all parts of the kingdom as well as many abroad  his namesakes powder kept its fame longer and was i remember in much esteem with some midwives as a specific to forward childbirth but gradually declined for the same cause and is now in a manner lost  mr lockyers held out still and till within twenty or thirty years past some hundreds of pounds i have been informed have been annually returned thereby though i have known mischief ensue thence upon his death it came into the hands of mr fyge an apothecary in my neighborhood and is to this day in his family but i believe now with little emolument or advantage to what it has been formerly  thus my friend you see the fate of these empirical medicines and how it is possible for some antiquated ones after mischiefs forgot to come into play again or be revived an instance of which we have surely now before us as lately in the crude quicksilver which was tampered with in the last age and brought once more into great request in this but sunk almost again by the popular eulogye of the drop and pill  thus it must always fare with remedies however powerful in themselves distributed without judgment or indiscriminately to all people without any regard to the state and condition of the bowels which are to entertain them or to any circumstances whatever in the sick or his disease favoring or opposing their administration  having laid down my thoughts as to their composition i shall next proceed to the pretended cures and possibly some real ones effected thereby with the method how the same may be brought about  and here if we duly consider the action of the stomach or the force under which the same is acted during the operation of a strong vomit like most of these antimonial ones together with that of all the muscles therein concerned which according to mathematick calculus is scarce credible we shall less wonder that not only its own cavity or the near adjacent but the most remote also in the whole animal fabric being drawn into consent therewith should have their contents impeld forwards by so forcible a contraction of all the fibers by which the most rivetted obstructions therein may in time be this way opened whilst the fluxion of humors on any particular part is called off whence tumors or swellings of any kind may be softened and diminished ulcers disposed for healing which before would yield to no application whatever of this you know we have constant experience in our venereal cancers and other corrosive phagedaenick ulcers when a dose or two of the turpeth minerale will render those sores in a few days tractable which for many weeks before would not yield to any topics administered by the best artists and surely we need not wonder if by the same way of revulsion many chronical diseases from the heaping up of humors and obstructing the vessels should by this drop and pill thus daily repeated for some time give way many scorbutic serpiginous leproas or venereal affects of the skin clear off whilst the morbid matter furnishing the same out of the blood is eliminated or cast forth by this double if not triple discharge first by vomit secondly by stools when thirdly the remainder is by the conflict raised therein during the violent commotion thereof perspired in sweat  this i say is the plain and obvious as well as mechanic process by which many surprising alterations are brought about and cures performed by such remedies yet if we reflect upon the great hazard some persons undergo it is surely incumbent upon all who take upon them the administration of any such or who may advise them to consider thoroughly the state and condition of the sick in regard to the soundness of his bowels and blood vessels and of the fibers in general which compose them and which are to undergo so forcible a contraction under the operation as well as that of the whole nervous system suffering likewise under the shock and for want of regard to which there will sometimes fall out as great harm and as much mischief as at others benefit or advantage  to avoid the accidents of this nature the honorable mr boil who understood the chemical pharmacy as well as the animal structure much better i dare say than mr ward pretends yet being fearful of the least injury that might arise by the trusting to his own judgment and tender of life when he had found out any remedy or had any such recommended to him after preparing the same gave it into the hand of some learned and experienced physician of his acquaintance to make such trials therewith as might be done with safety and to report to him the success that if found safe and beneficial they might encourage it or if any ways detrimental point out the danger or lay it wholly aside nor as i have been told would he suffer any one of those which go under the name of his receipts of which a collection has been published since his death to go abroad till it had the approbation of one or other of the faculty to recommend it  if mr ward had taken the same method he might doubtless have been the author of much greater good to his country men by avoiding the danger that will attend his medicines in this promiscuous distribution of them to all sorts and conditions of the people under whatever temperament as well as distemper  from his pill give me leave just to make mention of what is called his drop but here whether he gives one or more is uncertain being diffused in a sack vehicle and possibly if rightly understood may differ little from that common infusion of our crocus metallorum at least is of the same family with his pill which we need not stay to scrutinize  every one who is tolerably acquainted with the chemists furnace must know that many liquids in the forms of tincture spirit or oil may be drawn with this mineral which in a very small quantity as that of a drop or two however diluted will work too powerfully for some weakly habits or tender constitutions an instance of this we have in the preparation of its cinnabar where a caustic oil called the butter of antimony will arise the least drop of which notwithstanding its dilution is not safe to be given inwardly being chiefly used by the surgeons to destroy what they term proud flesh and to level the callous rising lips of ulcers though there have been those who as lemery observes have given a drop two or three of this butter or oil of antimony in broth to cause vomiting which practice says he i cannot approve because it is too strong and produces the same effects as the powder of algarot which is nothing but the said butter washed in warm water whence a white powder is praecipitated called but very improperly mercurius vitae which to some i have known in like manner a mercurius mortis  the vast subtilty of this mineral in some of its preparations is very surprising and in none more remarkably than in that called the vomiting cup without any sensible diminution in its weight or virtue  one of these compounded of the regulus and mars i have now by me which was sent me as a present about forty years past by a country gentleman practicing among his poor neighbors in the way of charity this cup was lent out from one neighbor to another in which they steeped cider stale beer or other spirituous liquors all night and drank them the next day to cure fevers and agues but after two persons for whom it proved too strong were destroyed thereby it lost all the credit it had gotten and whereas before it went by the name of the angelick it was now called the devils cup quickly after being sent back to the owner it so happened that i became its proprietor who have never suffered one trial to be made with it since it was in my possession  the operation of all these antimonial vomits is so very precarious that no man can be absolutely certain how they will turn out monsieur lemerys observation being very just in the words sollowing  when the medicine diffuseth itself suddenly in the stomach mixing with the juices thereof and there stimulating its nervous fibers the same is constrained to throw up its contents if it stays longer or till some of its particles are derived to the guts the same stimulus twitching their fibers a purging downwards happens they must differ also according to different constitutions in those who take them and very often the same which makes a person vomit at one time purges him by stool only at an other nay at sometimes will move only by sweat which shall often ensue both those operations course of chym p     with all which i am sure you are well acquainted but there is one observation give me leave to take notice of this great chemist about this mineral which may give us to understand of how little service a mere hypothesis will be to us in our practice which is daily contradicted thereby and that is this that the crude antimony is dangerous for to take inwardly or in substance because it may meet with an acid in the stomach that would open its body and be the cause of great vomitings to ensue  what has led this gentleman into a mistake of this kind must be surely his surmise that the natural heat of the stomach bears some affinity or resemblance with the artificial of the furnace or crucible placed therein by which the body of the said mineral being opened and its texture broken the sulphur is set free and enabled to raise such disturbance therein  for my own part who have given many pounds of crude antimony i have rarely known it to operate otherwise unless in too great a dose than as an alterative correcting the salt and acrid humors in the blood and by that means subduing those corrosive scorbutic eruptions on the skin which have stood out even against mercury itself for these purposes i direct ss of the crude antimony most finely levigated and j of the cons cochlear hort with j jss or ij of the gum guaj to be formed s a into an electuary with a q s of the sir e suc aurant of which the patient takes the quantity of a nutmeg night and morning drinking after it a small draught of the decoct ex lignis or of batess aq bened simpl which from the gum but hardly from the antimony gives a stool sometimes two or three in a day yet without regimen and for the psora scabies or common pruritus i know of few or none that excel after a mercurial purge or two the same mineral with an equal quantity of aethiops made up in like manner and taken the same way to return whence i have digressd  from this account of these remedies with the hazard and uncertainty of their operation and the manifest danger that must frequently attend upon many of those who think proper to venture on them from the warranty of such as know as little as themselves of the nature of the remedies they recommend much less of the diseases for which they recommend them and less still of the human frame which is to grapple with them and for want of which many persons must risque their lives for these reasons i say i thought i might do an acceptable piece of service to the public if i laid down some cautions in reference thereunto and surely the dispenser of them to necessitous persons will not be displeased at the same since the more good he can do with them without any unhappy accident supervening the greater applause to him as well as esteem for his remedies nor will there be found any better method for securing that estimation or that can render them of long continuance which like others of like kind palmd upon the world for great and useful discoveries for want of proper caution have through some fatal miscarriages soon dwindled away as these doubtless will do in a little time to nothing  first then i would advise all hysterical or hypochondriacal people subject to be ruffled by any evacuation especially of so rough a nature as these medicines may produce or to be thrown into convulsive suffocations palpitations at heart with tremors on the nerves to be careful how they engage with them some such i have known to suffer from the weak frame thereof and the hurry their spirits have been thrown into under the operation not recoverable for a long time after  secondly these medicines can by no means agree with the hectical or consumptive and thin habits under any inflammatory state of their blood their vessels tender and the same apt upon any straining to break its enclosures some of these also i have heard of falling into profuse haemorrhages or bleeding at the nose and one that i was lately sent for to seized the night following the taking one of these pills with a vomiting up a large quantity of blood to which he is still liable between whiles and which i have cause to believe will be at long run fatal for the same reason no person whatever with an overbearing heat therein or fullness of the vessels should enter upon this course before they have emptied them by free and repeated bleeding  thirdly such as labor under ruptures whether of the navel groin or scrotum must shun these medicines as they would ratsbane the pressure of the parts of the lower belly being so great under the working of any vomit much more such as these that there would be the greatest danger imaginable of rendering the malady irretrievable dr d  d told a friend of mine very lately he had visited a woman with a navel rupture brought upon her by the hard straining in the working of this pill of mr wards  fourthly such as have weakened the tone of their stomachs by dramdrinking all day whetting in the morning or bottling a nights and have brought upon them a loathing to all food or after taking the same immediately throwing it up again can be no fit subjects for these remedies for that besides their feeble if not rotten viscera with their weak and tender vessels rendering them liable to a breach therein their constant retchings more especially in a morning which scarce any remedy can bridle or put a stop to will be increased and an over vomiting or purging hasten their deaths of which i have had an account of two instances in three months past  fifthly those who bear not this evacuation unless with difficulty also such as are easily set on vomiting must be careful they are not with the foregoing overset thereby for that at sometimes the sulphur of the antimony adhering to or being entangled in the tender coats of the stomach whose lining by preceding evacuation has been scoured off is continually stimulating to the excretion and i could give as many examples of those where the operation has never ceased till the sick has been quite run down and died strongly convulsed for this cause it will be always found expedient that the diseased patient before he enterprises either of these medicines if they may be so denominated be provided with a proper quantity of chicken or mutton broth which may serve to sheath and blunt the salts and sulphur rendering their stimuli more tolerable to the nervous fibers preventing those hard strainings which might otherwise endanger the animal fabric  this you know sir was the advice of monsieur lemery  course of chemistry page     in the following words  broth a little fat is necessary when the patient finds an inclination to vomit because it will render the same easier and be the means of hindering those great efforts under the operation of these remedies which sometimes break the vessels and occasion mortal haemorrhages when if notwithstanding the use of these the vomiting will not cease you may dissolve a little cream of tartar in the said broth and take some spoonfulls every quarter of an hour this says he stops the vomiting because joining with the antimony it fixes the same so that together they are precipitated by stool  the last general caution i have to impart leaveing you to judge if it be not a very necessary one is this that children weakly persons and all others naturally prone to fluxes of any kind and who are apt to throw up what they take upon the slightest occasion not from any viscid or phlegmatic humors nestling in the plushy coat of the stomach but from mere debility or atony as it is named by us of the fibers thereof must be exceeding careful how they engage with these remedies for fear as in my last caution of raising such a storm as may not be laid again but by the patients death one single pill the only he ever took taken by a poor fellow who had been my patient for a venereal nocturnal headache after a most violent vomiting for some hours produced as i was told by the surgeon consulted between sixty and seventy stools not without the most imminent danger of his life  having laid down these cautions very necessary for all people to observe who think fit to venture upon such medicines i shall speak now of the diseases for which they have been recommended and in which according to vulgar report they have been at some times found successful  here indeed we have a large field to survey because there are very few wherein by some or other they have not been tried by the approbation of their author first of all and after from one to another however among the principal have been reckoned many of the most obstinate such as the gout and rheumatism the scurvy palsy lues venerea kings evil and cancer itself  the former i think we may readily give up provided we had one instance of a true cancer absolutely cured thereby this i say would and ought to be acknowledged the greatest gift of heaven to poor mortals on this side the grave the most useful discovery i will call it the most inestimable jewel of a medicine since the infancy of the healing art provided at the same time it was found a certain and withal a safe one  i have already observed to you how we may reconcile the removal of many stubborn obstructions of the vessels how the fluxion of humors may be called off for the present from some part burdened therewith how scabs blotches fretful sores and eating ulcers in this way of revulsion especially in those who can bear the repeated shocks are disposed to crumble off and heal though quickly after they have broke out again and spread with greater virulence than before but admit these cures to stand i am exceeding doubtful whether the cancer will bear to be handled after the same manner which i never found would suffer any other than lenients whether internal or external being ever exasperated by a stimulus of any kind so that the strength of such a revulsion however it may for the present take off the tention relax the glands and soften in some measure the induration for a time yet soon after the old leaven fermenting afresh the disease repullulates sprouts anew and rages oftentimes worse than before at length putting an end to a miserable life  what i have seen of this nature myself or which has been imparted to me by persons of credit as well as judgment in their profession i shall now communicate unto you  this last summer c  l c  r from the w  t i  s came over to england to consult some gentlemen as well physicians as surgeons about a stubborn sore above his eyebrow among the latter mr c  l  n was the first called in quickly after he had a meeting with dr m  d and dr h  s and afterward as i was told by the apothecary mr st h  l and mr s  n  at one of these meetings i was proposed by the c  l but it so happened that i was put by at the time of these consultations he was under the care of mr c  l  n but soon after at the desire of some about the court and the relations he received of several as bad cases set to rights by mr wards medicines that gentleman was advised with and undertook the chyrurgery as well as the physical regimen  whilst he was under this persons care he desired a visit from me when i saw his sore dressed the ulcer had spread all over one side of the forehead extending itself toward the temple sideways and was making havoc downwards through the brow into the orbit of the eye in some places it appeared sloughy and foul in others fresh and red with unequal callous lips and had the aspect of an ulcer truly cacooethic or what we call of an ill dispofition the whole of the local medicine was warm buttermilk to wash the sore and the curd to be applied after instead of a plaster which is the gentlemans usual topic  whilst the ulcer lay bare for my view the c  l asked me what i called his malady i told him it might well bear the name of an herpes exedens and what says he does that differ from a cancer i answered every ulcerated cancer might bear that name yet there were of the herpes kind which were not cancerous and that i hoped his might be such  in order to subdue the virulency of the ulcer and dispose it for healing i proposed salivation which he said he had been under in the country but as i understood neither raised by the unction nor continued for due time i then mentioned my cinnabar suffitus and the quicksilver pill by the former i proposed to gain at least this satisfaction that if the edges of the ulcer spread not under it but contracted and looked better conditioned i should have made less doubt of his cure by a salivation raised by the anointing having lessened his fears as well as my own of its being cancerous which indeed were not ill grounded since by his observation it would not suffer any detersive medicine such as the praecipit rub his surgeon had formerly sprinkled on the sordid parts without being exasperated thereby so that he had prudently left off the same and dressed with dry lint and a digestive over all  the patient seemed inclinable to the experiment i had proposed but said he must go on a while longer with mr wards medicines or else his friends would say he had mist his cure for want of perseverance how long he continued that regimen after my visit i cannot say exactly but finding at length his body harrassd by this constant vomiting and purging without any encouragement from his sore the next news i had was from mr j  s d  ie to whom i had imparted the case who told me the c  l had sent for him and that having found the ulcer in the condition i had represented it he had whilst mr c  l  n was by delivered his opinion that the salivation by unction might be of service to him and probably lay a foundation for his cure to which that gentleman assented  after this having laid aside mr wards method or fully purposing so to do two gentlemen of his acquaintance came to me in order to let me know they could not be satisfied unless the c  l was put under my care and that they would persuade him to remove into the city for the convenience of my attendance where i promised to do him what service i could and in the way i had proposed viz by smoking the ulcer for three or four times and finding encouragement to proceed instantly with the unction  in a few days more they came again and told me they had concluded upon the removal of their friend to an equal distance between me and mr c  l  n for the convenience of us both i now objected a misunderstanding between myself and that gentleman which he had not rectified in the manner i expected and therefore i proposed mr d  ie whom the c  l had so lately consulted as a person more agreeable to me and with whom i could act with more freedom and satisfaction but whilst this matter was under debate some other empirical undertaker who knows i hear as little of the affair as the former by means doubtless of stronger assurance of a cure than he had from us has undertaken him but with what success i know not  this case has been variously reported about the town some have taken the liberty to give out that mr ward has cured him after all these consultations others of that gentlemans friends that he would have cured him had he gone on and others again that i had left him in as bad a condition as i found him intimating his having been under my care who never saw him more than once nor prescribed one grain of medicine for him  the second case of a cancer under this method i had from mr d  ie in a poor woman recommended to him with a painful schirrous hardness in the glands of her breast for which he advised her to be quiet and not to tamper at the same time she had the opinion of the surgeons of the house particularly of mr f  ke who were of the same opinion that nothing could be done more than to palliate and keep her quiet however by some interest or other she was recommended to mr ward and took his medicines with such success that when mr d  ie saw her some weeks after he told me he was surpised the tention of the skin by means of the strong revulsion made by the operation under the repeated vomiting being much lessened the glands softened and the whole breast reduced but some weeks after this out of curiosity making her another visit the aspect it seems was not so promising for the wolf as the common people express themselves which before had withdrawn it for a season began to show its head again i e the fomes stiffled for a time threatening to bust out afresh since when she has been denied and the surgeons not admitted to see her possibly for that her cure is not yet completed which is the mildest construction can be put upon the case if not for that the disease is now raging as at first but by the way this poor woman is since dead of her cancer  since i had this account of mr d  ies i was desired by a gentleman to visit his spouse in one of whose breasts i felt a large and painful knot which had lain quiet for some years but by improper topics was exasperated and had put on the appearance of a true cancer of which she had already been informed i asked her whether she had courage to part with her breast not that i am over fond of recommending these excissions but it might so fall out that she might herself think of it when by the increase or adhaesion or communicating with the glands of the axilla it was not practicable  this i found had given offense and i heard no more of her till about a month or six weeks after when by accident meeting her husband in the street and enquiring how she did he told me she was almost well by taking mr wards pill which unknown to him by the interest of some friend or acquaintance she had procured and in the working of which her breast broke and discharged a great quantity of bloody water since which her nipple had been drawn in but she was easier and the breast a great deal less than when i saw it i told him i wished a continuance of the amendment but owned myself very doubtful for this retraction of the tubuli lactiferi or milk pipes with the tuckingin of the nipple is always an untoward appearance and generally speaking as sure a sign of a cancer in the breast as the painful knot therein itself and truly by the distant enquiry i have since made this truce was but of a short duration the distemper being again worse than ever the remedy by reason of its rough operation long since laid aside and the patient as i heard but this day deceased also  the last instance i will give you upon my own knowledge in respect to the pretended cures of cancers shall be that of c  n w  s lady whom i visited this last summer not long after mr f  n had been to see her on the same occasion i perceived one of her breasts of an uncommon magnitude the whole body of which was one continued induration and so very ponderous that she was forced to wear a suspensory round her neck for the better support of it she was prepared to receive any sentence i should pass on her disease but finding we were able to administer little comfort at the importunity of a friend mr ward was consulted and gave her if i am rightly informed the greatest assurance of a cure by his buttermilk and curds externally and his drop and pill internally administered nay when she told him she feared by the great stretch of the skin the breast would burst he made very light thereof and replied no matter his medicines would make it whole again  how long this unhappy gentlewoman prosecuted his method i am not positive but have heard as long and as often as he himself desired her at first with that seeming advantage that she apprehended herself lithsomer and better able to turn herself in her bed but at this time now many months past i understand in as bad a state as ever and although under the same gentlemans care the drop pill and pultis having failed him he now has changed them for a different set of medicines at least the old in a different disguise  these are the cases which have fallen under my own inspection or have been confirmed by the persons concerned relating to the cure of cancers i have heard indeed of more and some which common rumor has spread for cures completed but whether or no they have been really or truly cancers or only so reported remains with me a doubt  i should be glad if the author or his confident who gives them out would be careful to collect a history of his cures more especially of this kind well attested where any artist had before passed the sentence of a true cancer which might very much conduce to the clearing up of this affair and we may allow i dare say of nine miscarriages if every tenth experiment in this terrible distemper has been attended with success among those i have talked with or have heard from others the far greater number on whatever occasion they may have taken the same have bitterly inveighed against the roughness of the operation without any benefit thereby  from the cancer in the inverted order i took notice of them i come to the scrofula or kings evil and here i must say that i have seen some stubborn ulcers where there were no foul bones better disposed for healing after taking of these pills three or four times but they have cracked festerd and spread again quickly after nor have i heard of any strumous glands about the neck and fauces thereby resolved here indeed the revulsion is lost because the humors in the operation of vomiting are still more derived to these parts as is evident in those constant tiplers of strong liquors who sometimes from their violent retchings and throwing up all they take whether food or physic shall have their faces bloated when the rest of their bodies are emaciated and wasted away  these remedies have been also cried up as infallible in the lues venerea or french pox here also as in the foregoing as likewise in scorbutic affects of the skin i have heard of scabs and other breakings out which by using of the pill have cast off and dried away as i have before observed but whether or no the venereal poison is this way to be extirpated as it has been at sometimes by the late misaubins and by the quicksilver pill as i have hinted in my discourse thereon i am alike doubtful yet as to safety in the operation i must give the preference to either of the two last having known as i took notice before a poor fellow very merely destroyed by the first  the palsy is another disease reported to be cured thereby and for those who can bear the ruffle of such repeated revulsion it is not improbable but that examples may be given where not only obstructed blood vessels but obstructed nerves by a pituitous humor therein impacted such as the gutta serena which is a palsy of the optic nerves may be thence discharged in like manner the apoplexy lethargy coma carus and other phlegmatic soporous disorders where the nervous fibers are relaxed and sluggish with the sensation dull and torpid and where these antimonial vomits may be more safely enterprizd than when those fibers are in a state of tention and the spirits more active  a remarkable recovery of this kind mr ward has given us in the london evening post nov   and continued in several other papers which he tells us was drawn up by my lord chief baron reynoldss own hand but that surely does not appear by the barons letter to him who says only that he had sent him the case enclosed drawn up with exactness in point of fact for which he desires his credit may be looked upon as a guarantee as doubtless it will be but it can hardly be supposed that if the narrative had been drawn by him the case would have been expressed as follows mary betts a young country maid servant in the lord chief baron reynoldss family and constantly residing at his house in st edmunds bury etc  besides the terms emetic cathartic emmenagogue denote the same however signed by the baron to have been originally drawn up by the physician or apothecary at least concerned and if indeed in the manner it is drawn it was intended for the information of the common reader great part thereof might have been modestly omitted as absolutely useless to them and that without any way lessening the cure if for the instruction of the faculty few of these i dare say will think it strange that from so great a force upon the blood vessels under the violent streining together with the stimulus added to the blood itself from the medicine the same should break through not only the vessels of the uterus but those of other parts also as it has done in others under the same force however as these obstructions might have no share in the palsy unless every woman thus obstructed was paralitical or vice versa every paralitiek thus obstructed this part of the history was superaboundant no less the pulling down of the eyelids to bring on sleep and the lifting them up again that she might lie awake as if either depended on those motions or that a man could not sleep with his eyes open which some do frequently and others are forced to do from a cicatrix after a wound or absces on the upper lid occasioning such a stricture as will not suffer the same to be depressed or that he could not lie awake with his eyes shut which others are constrained to do also where the elevating muscle has had its fibers transverfly divided so that the lid falls  there seems i must own something singular in this paralysis of the maids eyelids that upon lifting them up they should keep so and not fall down again upon removing the finger this part however of the description together with her inability to compress the glands of her eyes in order to shed tears with that also of lifting up the lip for the taking in of her nourishment however inaccurate were i suppose intended to give us to understand that there was a universal resolution of the whole system of the nerves unless possibly those of the sphincters of which no notice is taken and whether or no a salivation was any part of regular practice or carried any likelihood of bracing up the fibers or invigorating their tone thus debilitated i shall leave to you and others in such practice to determine  if we go upon those two great principles of the strictum et laxum of the animal fiber and consider the latter to be the condition of it for the most part if not always in paralytic patients the cold submersion especially in a youthful subject had carried greater probability of success than a salivation which i have known to have brought on that disease but rarely that i remember proved its cure  we are not i must acknowledge certain that this experiment also of cold bathing was not tried among other parts of the regular practice mentioned nor will i question all proper methods taken for the poor girls relief by the physician who was concerned i will grant farther all that mr ward or his friends can desire that it was by the threefold evacuation vomiting sweating and purging that this remarkable cure was effected and that these were the result of his drop and pill but with whatever views this narrative was made public i hope no one under the like circumstances will try the experiment upon an expectation of the same success or run unadvisedly thereon let them consider i say first that part of the story relating to the operation and then possibly they may judge it fit only for those who choose the chance and a very sorry one of being cured or killed rather than drag on longer a very miserable life the case writer says that after two or three days interval from the drop mrs reynolds gave her one of the pills which had so violent an operation both as an emetic and cathartick ie upwards and downwards that the maid weakened to the last degree by her former long course of physic was for twelve hours together with great difficulty kept alive  a case somewhat related to this in a paralytick farther advanced in years has been with great industry concealed where a violent vomiting began the tragedy and after seventy or nearer eighty stools most of them blood the patient died upon the bedpan  if then the same tender concern for the peoples welfare the same humanity mr ward takes notice of in my lord c  baron puts me and i solemnly declare to the world it is nothing else upon giving them this advice and delivering these cautions i hope i shall stand clear of any unreasonable or unkind censure as well from the b  n who recommends as mr ward himself the dispenser of these remedies  i must own sir to you it was ever my opinion that private gentlemen or others of fortune unacquainted with human bodies and the disorders it is subject to might employ their charity to much better advantage by succouring the indigent with food and raiment than by administering physic especially such as must inevitably be attended with equal if not greater mischief than benefit or advantage whether the good intention will atone for the homicides happening in this way is out of my province but if the people cannot be content without some quackery it were better surely they would return again to their quicksilver as the least hazardous of the two  asking pardon for this digression occasioned by so notable an advertisement i proceed  the rheumatism and gout they tell us have been removed by the same medicines of which i can say nothing any more than of the foregoing upon my own knowledge it is i grant less to be wondered at if some strong habits with robust fibers both muscular as well as nervous should in the like method of revulsion with some others after repeated evacuation of the humors as well upwards as downwards be set free of their confinement but i should expect the same regimen exceedingly hazardous to those of differing temperaments and constitutions the sound bottom may ride out the storm when the leaky founders  and now lastly in respect to the gout it has been long since my settled judgment that the prime physical intentions are with sydenham to strengthen the digestion and fortify the noble parts leaving the gouty matter thrown forth upon the joints to spend itself there for though at some times i have heard of such who by the use of my namesakes powder of turbith hermodacts scammony etc have put by a fit as they thought or lessened the same by discharging the gouty matter in the way of stool i have heard of others who by the same means have brought the distemper upon their bowels their stomach or their brains where notwithstanding all endeavors they have lost their lives thereby an example of which i was a witness about four years past in an elderly gentleman who laboring long therewith upon his feet was persuaded to take one of these purges the day after which he grew easier on those parts but was instantly tortured in his bowels to such degree that the strongest dose of opium would scarce give ease hence the distemper took to his stomach and raised as great a storm with incessant vomiting his apothecary had given an easy dose as i remember twelve grains of the indian root and in the evening an opiate again which freed him from this new attack but before morning the same matter had seized his head when he grew stupid snorted and fell into a coma out of which neither volatiles sharp clysters cupping blistering vomiting sternutatories or any stimulus could rouse him in this condition he lay for fortyeight hours and then expired through the unfortunate translation of a disease with which could he have been content to have conflicted as formerly some days longer whilst the same was upon the extreme parts he might as in those he had formerly undergone in all probability have protracted his life  these considerations which i readily submit sir to your judgment i thought proper to communicate to the public at a time when great numbers of the people who can so readily come at them are trying experiments with remedies so often hazardous to their welfare and by which as it may fall out some benefit so also much mischief must ensue the present method of promiscuously taking them or through the want of proper information  if that which i now offer or from the cautions here laid down i may be instrumental in saving one single life it will afford me abundantly more real pleasure and satisfaction than the idle cavils of evilminded men the snarling of looseprincipled persons or the scurrilities offered by debauchees who destitute of argument fly to slander shall give disquiet  i am sir in the strictest sincerity your friend and very humble servant d turner  postscript the following cases are drawn with so much judgment and appear withal so authentic that i have taken the liberty to transcribe them for the satisfaction of all those into whose hands the journal whence they are extracted has not fallen and as i have been charged with being the compiler i take this opportunity to declare that i know not the author yet at the same time return him hearty thanks as the whole kingdom ought to do for his industry in collecting them and that honest zeal he has shown to safeguard his countrymen from that danger they may see others have been betrayed into under the specious views of infallible remedies  case i a gentleman of a middle age of a very robust and strong habit of body having no other disorder but some of the common symptoms of the scurvy was about three months ago brought to take one of these drops and two of the pills the drop worked very roughly but he went on in hopes of being made quite sound by this pretended catholicon and took one pill that carried on the disturbance and so shook his constitution that he broke out all over his body with many other disorders too tedious to mention he goes to ward himself tells his complaints and asks further advice which was given him that he must take more pills he bought four more but upon taking one became so shattered with its violence that his under jaw became paralytick so that without the assistance of his hand he could not move it up or down the eruptions increased and grew troublesome in some parts leaking a sharp ichor he recovered the use of his jaw in a little time but languishd with vain hopes that other disorders would mend but the tendons of his insteps and of the backs of his hands swelled he had a general weakness of his joints all over his body the tendonous parts apt to swell upon any little exercise and be painful his head grew much disturbed he almost loft his hearing of his right ear and had a continual noise in it his eyes grew watery and sore and so weak he could not read five minutes at a time without pain and smarting in this declining state he fell into a fever about three weeks ago but by safer remedies is recovered only those ill effects of wards medicines are not yet removed  those who are curious to know this gentlemans name may enquire of the bookseller  case ii mrs tempro servant to francis whitworth esquire in cliffordstreet burlingtongardens aged about thirtyfive had some wandering pains and other small complaints about last whitsuntide she took one dose of wards nostrum which vomited and purged her very much and so affected her nerves that one of her hands became numbed upon it she took a second and that was so violent it threw her into strong convulsions and brought a confirmed palsy upon both her hands and arms so that she could make no manner of use of them attended with grievous sickness and vomiting almost continually she applied for relief to those in the physical way near hand for she was then in one of the lodges in windsor forest but they being unable to relieve her she was brought to london about the second of october has received some benefit here and is in a way of recovery  i shall in the second place relate some cases which have proved mortal  case iii eliz moor servant to mrs burton in kingsstreet near st anns church aged thirtyfour subject to hysteric fits advised with mr ward first of all on friday july        he ordered her to take his pill she took one that night which had no operation at all so that she went about her business the tuesday night following she took another which operated no more than the first then she went to mr ward again who advised her to take another which she did the next wednesday night being july the  0th this operated no more than the others that night but the next day she was taken very ill at a neighbors house and was brought home in a coach screaming and crying out of an intolerable pain in her stomch and guts declaring to her friends who stood by that the pill had killed her her pulse was scarcely to be felt she had cold sweats fell into convulsions and died about three oclock on friday morning the   th  case iv hester staps a waiter at the bagnio charing cross aged about fortyfive of a moderate strong constitution and troubled with no other distemper but some small scorbutic pimples which used to break out spring and fall would needs try mr wards panacea the first dose she said vomited and purged her times beyond numbering and brought upon her many disorders she hoping that repeating the like medicine would cure them took a third dose but instead of curing them it brought on a violent disorder and pain in her head loss of appetite an inward continual fever or fever on the spirits with great dejection and lowness of spirits and continual griping pain in her bowels she grew from hence pleuretic and pthisical but more than all these the third dose threw out all over her body a most violent leprosy this disease she never had any sign of before but now it was so violent that the scales which came off her were very offensive thus she miserably wasted away and the beginning of last month died which was about two months from her taking the third dose from ward  case v and vi john wooten aged thirtysix and daniel his brother thirtyfour being pthisical took wards drop and daniel took one of his pills besides they both had the drop mixed in a decoction of riasins which they took near two months but grew much worse and daniels pill burst a vessel within him in the working and forced up a quantity of blood he died about four days after and his brother john the next day they were chairmen in lumleycourt in the strand  case vii mr t king baker in st giless about forty years old was consumptive but with the direction of an eminent physician grew better he took one of wards pills the twentythird of july last which vomited him for three days then turned downward and purged him as much till it brought a quantity of blood with his stools and the first of august he died  case viii samuel gray middle aged being ill of a consumption in the parish workhouse of st george hanoversquare would needs take wards medicine he died within an hour after taking the second dose  case ix marcum cambel about forty years old of patinstreet hanoversquare having an ague took six doses of wards medicine but was made so ill by them that being sent three days after to the infirmary at hydeparkcorner he could not there be relieved but died in five days  case x mrs magees daughter of carnabymarket about five years of age was only ill of a rash took three doses and died the next morning after taking the third dose it never operating with her  case xi anne eving servant to mr burton of conduitstreet about thirty years old had only scrophulous tumors on her neck took five doses of wards medicines and died two days after taking the last dose  case xii mrs gilbert who kept the horseshoe alehouse in essexstreet of a middle age and robust constitution took one of wards pills the beginning of july last it vomited her thirtyfour and purged her twentytwo times she sent for an eminent physician and apothecary the next day who found her very feverish and thirsty having continual retchings to vomit violent pains in her belly and to be short with all the symptoms of bowels a mortifying and what was almost as bad the operation had caused a violent navel rupture the physician used his utmost endeavors to assist her but could get nothing to pass through her but on the morrownight she miserably died  to the foregoing give me leave to add the two following  i have already observed in discoursing of the palsy a case industriously concealed and notwithstanding all the application and interest i could make have been denied admittance to the widow of the deceased thus much upon the most solemn assurance that no names should ever be brought upon the stage i have gathered from a relation to the family that about the middle of last month the brother of the deceased having read in the public papers of a great cure of a palsy persuaded him to take one of these pills when i asked what condition he was in at that time they said he had a palsy on one side under which he labored several years that in four hours after taking of the pill he was seized with a violent vomiting and could not keep from the closestool till he fell off in a fit that they then laid him on the bed with the pan under him where he lay in cold sweats and very great agonies the stools continuing to run from him till he lost all sense and fell into convulsions his jaws locked up and all his limbs contracted in which posture he died the same evening  i now enquired what report the searchers had made upon so violent a death and so evidently brought on by the poison he had taken and received for answer that they supposed it was returned convulsions  whence sir it seems plain to me that whilst these poor women employed as searchers either ignorantly or through corruption pass by such miserable deaths we shall never be able to come at the tenth part of these miscarages to detect which i think it absolutely necessary that every parish clark lay the strictest injunction upon these creatures to make a true report of all those immediately ensuing the taking of these medicines where they can come to understand that any such had been given the same or the day or two before and that these symptoms of violent vomitings or fluxes have instantly destroyed the deceased person if this trust had been duly executed i question whether we should have had one weekly bill these three or four months past wherein there might not have been inserted among the accidents poisoned by the drop and pill   if a person voluntarily or with design of destroying himself takes poison and these pills we see will do the same execution he is deemed a felo de se and an inquesi must sit upon the body nay if by mistake or accident he is destroyed the same way yet still there must be the same enquiry why then should so many of his majestys subjects be thus hurried out of the world and no notice taken for that some others have struggled and got the better as well of the said poison as the discase sometimes for which it was taken  you very well know that every member of the college is sworn to present what is justly denominated by us mala praxis dear doctor tell me what is this but as the gentlemen of the faculty care not to turn informers neither the governing part of the college to take cognizance yet a while thereof so possibly the government itself may in time see cause to enquire into an affair of so great moment and either wholly suppress the distribution of these dangerous druggs among the people or take care to see that they are placed under a better regulation  about ten days past a gentleman in company with his wife having some tetterish eruptions on her skin consulted with mr ward who made no doubt of curing her in time if she pursued his directions when she objected the weakness of her constitution unable to undergo the operation of any rough medicines he did assure her that he would order nothing which the weakest person might not venture on with the greatest safety and gave her at that time two of his drops that is the same number of his sack draughts one of which she took on the sunday morning following without other effect than a little sickness and vomiting on the tuesday she took the other with as small disturbance as the first on the next day which was wednesday she went again to mr ward who now gave her two of his pills the one of which she swallowed the next morning viz on thursday this had as little effect as the draughts but at night she found herself swelled as if she had been poisoned which indeed she was however on the friday she lay by continuing thus full and pained in her bowels on the saturday she ventured on her second pill in hopes that might work off the rest when by noon she was taken with enormous vomiting and purging at the same time which after some hours continuance threw her into strong convulsions so that she lost her senses and seemed as one dead to the assistants round about the apothecary was called and her husband proposed a physician but he told them the whole stress lay upon getting down what quantities they could of small broths or other dilating liquors which might wash off the poisonous salts and defend her bowels from a mortification thereby  in this condition she continued all night her fainting and convulsions often returning and frequently no pulse or other signs of life the day following she came a little to herself yet is not at this time free from the malign impression left upon her nerves by the poison being still upon the least occasion subject to the convulsive motions nor possibly may she suddenly if ever get clear from the same  in the first of these relations i could have the opportunity of letting myself only into the misfortune of a family which must it seems remain secreted from the world under a pretext of preventing the surviving brother running out of his senses who was instrumental in procuring and giving the fatal pill if the same were to be made public in this last though i am forbid the publication of names yet i have leave given to send any gentleman or lady of reputation who doubts the truth of the narrative to the house where the husband will confirm it as well as the gentlewoman herself who underwent the cruel symptoms and who has so narrowly escaped with life  to these instances it may be objected that many hundreds of people have taken and are daily devouring these draughts and pills without these mischievous accidents to which may be answered that the same number might very likely take arsnick in that dose with as little complaint it is not every one who takes ten times as much that can dispatch themselves thereby as they had intended either some quantity of liquor already in the stomach or poured down immediately after dissolving and diffusing the caustic salts nature rousing by strong efforts throws up by vomit as in these cases what lies therein discharging at the same time however with horrid gripings what is passed lower by the way of stool and at length frees herself therefrom though much weakened and almost spent thus i say and i doubt not you will join issue with me that it is possible for many by the strength of a good constitution or some lucky incident in their favor to escape these symptoms and to suffer little otherwise than under common vomiting and purgeing from a rough medicine of a different tribe but indeed it is so very difficult to come at all which have fallen out in this way that it may be made a question whether the one hundredth part is brought to light the people who have been imposed on being ashamed of their credulity in listening with the herd after them have stifled all they can and unless they have been destroyed outright which too you see has been the case their friends care not it should be known but endeavor what they can to conceal them had this been the fate of a great mans servant and surely nothing could be more near she also had in all likelihood died simply as some others of convulsions without an inquest and why it should be made an example as it was for others to imitate is i own above my comprehension but the nature of these medicaments will better appear from the following more certain account of their composition as the same is reported to have been communicated by the french kings physician the original of which is at this time i hear or was very lately in the custody of that worthy and very learned man dr p  t  mr wards drop  butyr antimon ij crem tartar iv m et coq in aq com q s per octo horas deinde add gradatim ol tart p deliq iv cola and evapora ut paretur sal quod fluat p deliq capiat hujus a gut j ad plures in haustulo vini albi cujuslibet mollioris  the pill  is said to be no other than the vitrum antimonij formed with the drop into small pills each of a grain weight  now sir as none but the physician apothecary or chemist can rightly inform the world of the poisonous nature of these compositions and the dangerous effects thereof upon the more sensible parts of mens bodies such i mean as the nerves i will readily submit to the whole body of these gentlemen whether any one of a sound judgment in physic and well acquainted with the human frame will either prescribe any such himself or consent to their being taken and if it must not denote all those to have a weak one in this particular how knowing soever in some others who shall venture to take them especially after so fair a warning as has been given in the journal already referred to as well as from the farther intimation here delivered by  sir once more your humble servant  advertisement whoever shall think fit to send an account of what they know of the good or bad consequences that equal justice may be done the same from the taking of these medicines by a letter directed for the author to be left at mr john clarkes bookseller under the royal exchange the favor will be acknowledged and provided the facts are truly stated with the patients names and places of residence at least private allowance for any diffident person to satisfy themselves of the truth of such facts the persons name who sends such information shall be made no other use of than he himself gives free permission  finis
