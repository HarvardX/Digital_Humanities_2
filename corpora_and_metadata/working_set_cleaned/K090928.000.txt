a dissertation concerning misletoe a most wonderful specific remedy for the cure of convulsive distempers  calculated for the benefit of the poor as well as the rich and heartily recommended for the common good of mankind  by sir john colbatch a member of the college of physicians  london printed for william churchill at the blackswan in paternosterrow       the preface i have been many years a debtor to the world and since i have not as yet been able to pay off my old scores to my own satisfaction the following dissertation comes out by way of composition which i hope will be accepted in part of payment till the original debt can be discharged  that this comes out alone is from an impression that i have had upon my spirits for some weeks past that it would be highly criminal in me to let another misletoe season pass without informing the world what a treasure god almighty has every year presented to their view and that no body at least very few have received any benefit from it  the article of convulsions in the bills of mortality of this great city is by much the largest of any very commonly amounting to about a fifth part of the whole and as i have been credibly informed happens principally amongst infant children from whence it seems plain that a generous anticonvulsive remedy is wanting i have published the noble qualities of this wonderful medicine in the most plain and familiar manner that thereby it may be rendered of more public use and i am not without the greatest hopes that people of all ranks will receive benefit from it  i hope i shall not be blamed for the earnestness of my recommendation of this neglected but extraordinary plant because my only aim in so doing is to press people to the use of that which every family may one time or other receive advantage from  the performance is rough and unpolished but i have chosen rather to suffer reproach upon that account than let another season slip which i am satisfied would be to the detriment of many  a dissertation concerning misletoe having some years since had a very terrible instance of an epileptical case in one that was most near and dear unto me and which baffled all endeavors that were used for his recovery it occasioned me many sad and serious reflections upon the subject as he was daily before my eyes so his distress made the more sensible impressions upon me i had recourse to the most celebrated remedies recommended in all ages and the assistance of my friends most eminent in their profession  four or five years were spent in fruitless attempts he every year growing worse and worse till at last he became cataleptick he would be seized as he was standing and continue in that posture like a lifeless statue without sense or motion when he was so seized he was constantly laid upon a bed or couch his fit would last some hours but i am confident that had he been let alone he would have continued in the same posture in which he was seized during the whole time of the fit  being one day upon a journey i saw some hazletrees plentifully stocked with misletoe it immediately entered into my mind that there must be something extraordinary in that uncommon beautiful plant that the almighty had designed it for farther and more noble uses than barely to feed thrushes or to be hung up superstitiously in houses to drive away evil spirits and that the misletoe that grew upon other trees was capable of being as serviceable to mankind as that which grew upon the oak  amongst many other authors that have wrote concerning the epilepsy i had lately read marcus marci his liturgia mentis the most satisfactory treatise upon the subject as to theory that i have met with and indeed to lay a foundation for a physician to practice rationally in the cure of all convulsive distempers  having made the most strict inquiry into the nature of misletoe that i was capable of i concluded a priori that it was a medicine very likely to subdue not only the epilepsy but all other convulsive disorders upon the foot of marcus marcis hypothesis i mean the ordinary and common misletoe the praises of misletoe of the oak had been proclaimed for many ages past and none else esteemed or regarded as to any medicinal virtue  the youth before mentioned had indeed taken misletoe in small quantities in the pulvis de gutteta and other compound remedies recommended in epileptical cases but when i reflected that misletoe was but one ingredient amongst a farrago of others there was no determining from the effects of those medicines whether misletoe were capable of doing any thing toward the conquering of so herculean a distemper  in reading the scattered and imperfect accounts of the druids formerly priests and philosophers in this island and other neighboring countries who were had in the highest veneration by people of all ranks i conjectured that this veneration in great measure proceeded from the wonderful cures they wrought by means of the misletoe of the oak this tree being sacred to them but none so that had not misletoe upon them which consideration also further prompted me to try common misletoe in its utmost extent after i had seen some of its amazing effects i conclude that it was from this divine remedy that they had almost divine honors paid them  but misletoe of the oak being the only misletoe recommended as good for any thing i was in great straits how to procure a quantity of it for i did not remember in all my travels to have seen any of it so amongst all my acquaintance from that time to this i do not know that i have met with above two that have  this put me upon considering whether or no the misletoe received any advantage from the tree upon which it grew or whether all misletoe were not the same  after my thoughts had been some time employed upon this subject i concluded that the misletoe of the crab the lime the pear or any other tree were of equal virtue with that of the oak for the following reasons and which has been confirmed to me since by large experience which is beyond every thing else  now suppose that the misletoe of the oak does surpass that of all other trees yet from ten years large experience i find the ordinary misletoe to be the most noble medicine i ever knew and since it is every where to be had at least in this island it ought to be esteemed as a great blessing and if the other excel it those that are capable of procuring it ought to esteem it accordingly  but if the misletoe were in any manner produced from the tree upon which it grows as the gaul is from the oak then it might reasonably be expected that it should partake of the quality of the tree that produces it as the gaul does having the same stiptick qualities with the acorn or the bark of the tree but as it is propagated by the way of inoculating or grafting it is quite otherwise  an apricock or a peach grafted upon a plumbstock or a fine apple or pear upon a crabtree one will not produce plumbs or crabs but apricocks and peaches and fine pears and apples  as far as i can learn misletoe is commonly propagated after the following manner there is a bird generally known by the name of the misletoe thrush which name i suppose it derives from its feeding upon misletoeberries during the winter season from the pulp of the berries it is nourished but the seeds are discharged with the excrement undigested now the excrement being of a slimy nature sticks fast to the branches of the trees upon which it falls and if there be any crack in the bark there the seed lodges itself and produces a plant the next year the excrement being of the nature of birdlime and birdlime as it is said being to be made of the berries of the plant i suppose gave rise to that very old saying that turdus cacat in sui excidium  it has been often propagated by cutting a slit into the bark of a tree and sticking in a seed i have been told of one that has adorned his trees with it to make them delightful in the winterseason and surely a more beautiful plant can scarce be seen  pliny says that it is apt to exhaust and wear out the tree upon which it grows in which i am inclined to believe he was mistaken the reason i suppose that induced him to be of that opinion was that it most frequently grows upon old trees now i conclude that it more frequently grows upon them than young ones because the twigs and branches of the old trees are more liable to cracks and accidents than young ones are and being most commonly seen upon old trees he from thence concluded that they were worn out by it  there seems however to be a difference betwixt this plant and all other trees propagated by grafting or inoculating they being most certainly entirely nourished by the juice of the stock into which they are inserted notwithstanding which as is before observed they change the nature of the juice brought up by the stock into their own but whether misletoe receives its full nourishment from the juice of the tree seems to me a doubt it is true it continues alive during the summer but it does not begin to flourish and appear in vigor till the sap of the tree is fallen or otherwise spent and the leaves dropped its berries are full ripe and in perfection about the latter end of december and the more rigorous and severe the weather is the more vigorous and flourishing is the misletoe now considering that the sap or nutritious juice of the tree is at this time in a manner spent i am inclined to conjecture that it derives its principal support from the air i have had some thoughts that it was no hard matter to try by easy experiments whether this be so or not but being confined to the town i have wanted conveniences of so doing  how it thrives in hot countries or whether it ever grows upon those trees that never cast their leaves i am ignorant of  of all the ancient authors that take notice of it which i have read pliny in his natural history seems to be most full but what he says is little to the purpose and almost every body else recommends misletoe of the oak in epileptical cases but none of them give directions how even that should be used in a rational manner  amongst the moderns the honorable mr boil in the second part of his usefulness of experimental philosophy page     gives the following relation  a young lady of great birth having been long troubled with an almost hereditary epileptical distemper and after having been wearied by courses of physic prescribed her by the famousest doctors that could be procured without at all mending but rather growing worse so that sometimes she would have in one day eight or ten of such dismal fits as you and i have seen her in was cured only by the powder of the true misletoe of the oak given as much as would lie upon a sixpence early in the morning in blackcherry water or even in beer for some days near the full moon and i am assured partly by the patient herself and partly by those that gave her the medicine that though it had scarce any sensible operation upon her and did not make her sickish especially when she slept upon it yet after the first day she took it she never had but one fit and this remedy an ancient gentleman who being casually present when she suddenly fell down as dead gave it her professed himself constantly to have cured that distemper with it when he could procure the right simple which is here exceeding scarce and what further experiments some friends of yours have successfully made i may elsewhere have occasion to relate  my most worthy friend dr cole encouraged by the common voice of antiquity and being farther prompted to it by this relation of mr boil was induced to try what it would do upon a patient that fell into his hands by the death of his former physician who for three months had in vain been attempting his cure he relates the case and the circumstances of his cure as follows  a certain youth of a sprightly genius of about fifteen years of age who at first had labored under a fever from which he was perfectly freed was soon after attacked with an epileptical fit which was about three months since after a few days another and after that with many but without any regular periods these fits had so affected his nerves and brought such a weakness upon all his joints that he could not walk without difficulty nor lift the weight of a few ounces with his hands nor hold a pen to write withal in which he before excelled to this youth various remedies having before been given without success i prescribed a vomit of salt of vitriol then a purge or two with some calomel afterward i took care that misletoe of the oak should be given him twice a day with some cephalic vehicle and the apothecary had procured the misletoe that was genuine happy he for to this time i could never procure any proceeding in this order his fits never returned the misletoe being continued to this time he sensibly perceived a gradual restoration of the strength of all the parts so that he could now not only walk but run and write elegantly of which i was an eyewitness so that i have reason to hope that from the continued use of this medicine he may be perfectly freed from his illness etc  the good doctor was one of those that afforded his utmost assistance to the distressed youth before mentioned but no misletoe of the oak being to be procured all other misletoe was looked upon as despicable and the reason why the pulvis de gutteta did no good was judged to proceed from the apothecaries making use of common misletoe in the composition of it instead of that of the oak but be that as it will and let the difference be never so great the quantity of misletoe in that composition is so small as to render it of no effect and as for the misletoe contained in the antiepileptick waters the great zwelfer has remarked that it will not yield any of its virtues by ordinary distillation  misletoe of the oak not being to be obtained i furnished myself with a large quantity of that of the lime the trees in one of the parks at hampton court affording great plenty at least they did so at that time i ordered it to be gathered at the latter end of december the leaves berries and very tender twigs i got dried over a bakers oven where there was a constant gentle heat and then had it made into very fine powder to be put into a glass covered with bladder or leather and kept in a very dry place if it be not kept close and dry it will contract a dampness grow moldy and be good for nothing if it be scorched by the fire in drying it will also be spoiled and of no effect  the larger stalks must also be carefully dried and preserved for decoctions and infusions  furnished with my medicine though of no reputation not being suspended upon the oak i was very impatient to see the effect of it and immediately went to work with it  the distressed youth had for five years been laboring in vain and every month grew worse and worse so that his constitution both of body and mind were spoiled to such a degree that i could not be so presumptuous as to hope for a cure the utmost i could wish for was some relief and to render the remainder of his life someway comfortable to him  from being one of the sprightliest of youths at twelve years of age at seventeen he was a perfect mope a most melancholy spectacle both in and out of his fits however bad as he was having carefully inquired into the nature of my medicine i went to work with it i was sure it could do him no hurt if it did him no good  his fits in the beginning kept pace with the moon rarely having any but about the new or the full but in tract of time he had them at all seasons so i began with him without any regard to that affair  from the first i gave him half a dram of the powder made into a bolus with syrup of pioneys every six hours and after it a large draught of a strong infusion of the stalks bruised and sweetened with syrup of pioneys  to my great surprise he had not one fit from the time he began to take this glorious medicine for a month or more and never one cataleptick fit to the day of his death he continued to take it on for three years but after some months only night and morning and in the main during that whole space he enjoyed his health tolerably well but as his memory had been almost entirely lost by the former fiveyears calamity so it was not judged proper to set him to any sort of hard study or employ him in any business that should give him any trouble upon which score it was thought necessary to send him into the country to a good air with one constantly to keep him company and to secure him against accidents  there he lived with great comfort to himself and pleasure to those he conversed with and was sometimes capable of applying himself to his studies he would now and then have a fit but sometimes not one in three months and those fits he had very favorable ones which he had always warnings of beforehand so that he could be trusted on horseback  at last he was taken ill in a manner different from what he had formerly been and died in about four and twenty hours i could not see him after he was dead but desired that his head should be opened having great reason to believe that the beginning of his illness proceeded from an unfortunate blow upon the left temple in which part he would often complain of great pain especially in the first part of his illness before he became stupid and the account i had of that matter was that there was a blackish spot upon the dura matter of the bigness of a shilling just under the os temporis  it is true here was no cure neither could i expect one i had the utmost success i could reasonably propose to myself which was to render the short remains of a miserable life comfortable and easy and by so doing to have a reasonable opportunity of introducing to the world a most glorious and useful medicine which has one peculiar property attending it that it is capable of doing the greatest good in the most formidable of diseases and i dare say will never do any hurt  the jesuits bark is a most noble medicine in fevers regularly intermitting and in some other cases but i have frequently known the misapplication of it of terrible and fatal consequence but for misletoe i dare engage for it that it will never hurt any one and tho it be so innocent yet it will frequently cure diseases that in appearance as the great dr willis represents them in his description of the epilepsy in his tract de morbis convulsivis do not much differ from those we read of in the gospels that were cured by the redeemer of the world the eternal son of god but his cures were wrought by a word and not by medicines glory be to him that in the absence of himself has created such medicines for the relief of the distressed as this i am treating of  no one can think that i am so far divested of reason as to recommend this medicine in the manner i do there not being the least prospect of advantage to myself in it but that i am sure of its effects from thorough experience and that i have all imaginable reason to believe that it will prove of general advantage to the world there not being a family to which it may not at one time or other be of the greatest use  i have many times known about a scruple of the powder mixed with a little blackcherry water restore children that have been agonizing with the most exquisite convulsions that can be conceived but then it has been repeated in less quantity very often till they were perfectly well i hardly ever knew it given to children without advantage a cure is not always to be expected but relief is a great blessing in such miserable diseases  it is good in their gripes either to obtund the acrimony of the bile or pancreatick juices and if they will not take it any other way may be given in their pap pannadoe or breastmilk even to infants there can be no error in giving them too much but the more they take the better it being of a nourishing quality and no ways hot or in the least tending to throw them into a fever nay is rather of itself a febrifuge i have often found it of great use in the dismal slow fevers attended with convulsive symptoms  i have never through the course of my practice seen but two persons laboring under that frightful distemper called the chorea sancti vitis or st vitess dance or at least that might be truly called so the first was before i knew the use of misletoe she had the assistance of other physicians besides me but in spite of all that could be done she died miserably  about three years since the second a girl of about seven years of age was brought to me every muscle of her seemed to be convulsed if she were upon her feet she was always dancing and throwing her arms about the muscles of her face would be variously distorted and her head moving backward or forward or from side to side so as to be a most moving object of compassion if she were in bed she was under the same circumstances one being obliged to be constantly by her to keep the clothes upon her and she had no sleep she took about two drams of the powder every day and by that time she had taken twelve or fourteen ounces she was made perfectly well and so continues she grew better by that time she had taken it two days and in a manner well in about a fortnight but i ordered the continuance of the medicine till she had taken the quantity before mentioned to secure her against returns  i have an intimate acquaintance an exellent gentlewoman who had labored under convulsive disorders for twenty years and did not want the best advice her life was rendered thoroughly miserable but by the use of the powder of misletoe for a year or two she is become perfectly well enjoying the comfort of life as much as any one does  i have known so many instances both in young and old in rich and poor of both sexes some of whom had been many years afflicted with epilepsies and other convulsive disorders that have been either cured or received benefit from this divine remedy that i think myself bound in conscience to divulge the use of it to the world since as i have before observed it is capable of doing greater things than ever i knew performed by any one remedy and i think it incapable of doing any hurt  another principal reason that has induced me to it is for the sake of the poor the meanest being able to procure it as well as the rich and that it wants little or no skill in the administration of it  whilst the virtues of misletoe were confined to that of the oak only it was of little or no use to the world as not being to be procured i have been five and thirty years a diligent searcher after it but never could yet see one sprig and as i have before observed have never met with above two that had if the common misletoe that is to be met with in every county of our fortunate island is capable of doing as great things as have ever been recorded of the misletoe of the oak i shall have that pleasure and satisfaction of mind which generally redounds to those that have the happiness of being benefactors to the age they live in which i have in every part and circumstance of life endeavored  but if from the common voice of all ages and the modern instances i have produced misletoe of the oak must still be preferred i do not doubt but every oak in england may be made to produce misletoe by the method i have before proposed and perhaps the druids took that method to propagate it upon such oaks as were for their turn and when that can be had in plenty it will be no great difficulty to distinguish whether it excels or not but i am really of opinion that all misletoe is the same for the reasons before alleged  in this dissertation i have carefully avoided entering into the reason why misletoe is so excellent a remedy in epilepsies and of consequence in all other convulsive distempers but recommend it to the use of the world from the large experience i have had of it which is the same way that the famous peruvian bark was ushered in and perhaps the experience of future practitioners may make that matter more clear than at present i am capable of doing nay should i attempt it it would swell the bulk and of consequence the price of this dissertation and be of no advantage to the ordinary sort of people whose benefit by this publication i propose as much as the rich  i began with it upon a rational foundation and the success has answered my expectation even to my amazement in some instances i dont doubt but others will try whether what i have said be true and when they see that it answers their expectations also i hope it will exercise the fine geniuss of the age to draw consequences from it that may be of great use  as the bark does sometimes want an auxiliary to enable it entirely to overcome an obstinate quartan ague so i have sometimes found that misletoe has done better in some obstinate old epilepsies with the assistance of an auxiliary than alone  a dram of sal martis added to an ounce of the bark will make that ounce more effectually to cure an inveterate quartan than six times the quantity of the bark alone will do without it so i have sometimes known a dram of assafoetida added to an ounce of the misletoe powder and made into an electuary make it act much more powerfully than alone  gentle purging and sometimes bleeding are useful before the giving of the misletoe but i have been for some years afraid of giving vomits even of the gentlest sort in convulsive distempers from some terrible accidents that have been like to ensue from moderate doses of ipecacuana itself the safest and perhaps the best vomit that ever was made known to the world barely as a vomit to cleanse the stomach  if the plant be not dried powdered and preserved in the manner i have directed there is scarce any other way of keeping it but that it will be rendered entirely useless this i desire may be carefully observed by every body  i dont doubt but even misletoe of the oak itself or what people have called so has often unsuccessfully been given from not being gathered in right time or if it has been so either ill dried or not carefully preserved afterward  from the hints i have given i hope others will be disposed to try this medicine to a further extent than i have been able to do i have been cramped in it because it was not to be had in more than two apothecaries shops that i could depend upon for its being regularly managed but for the future since it will put them but to very small expense i hope no shop in the kingdom will be without it  if any one will be so good as to communicate to me any either medicinal or natural observations that they have already or shall hereafter make in relation to the subject here treated of they shall not fail of my most grateful acknowledgments  finis
