works on government     a defence of the constitutions of government of the united states of america against the attack of m turgot in his letter to dr price dated the twentysecond day of march      by john adams as for us englishmen thank heaven we have a better sense of government delivered to us from our ancestors we have the notion of a public and a constitution how a legislative and how an executive is moulded we understand weight and measure in this kind and can reason justly on the balance of power and property the maxims we draw from hence are as evident as those in mathematics our increasing knowledge shows us every day more and more what common sense is in politics shaftesburys charact vol i p  0   t is scarce a quarter of an agessince such a happy balance of power was settled between our prince and people as has firmly secured our hitherto precarious liberties and removed from us the fear of civil commotions wars and violence either on account of the property of the subject or the contending titles of the crown in three volumes vol ii     a defence of the constitutions of government of the united states of america volume ii chapter first italian republics of the middle age florence there is no example of a government simply democratical yet there are many of forms nearly or remotely resembling what are understood by all authority in one centre there once existed a cluster of governments now generally known by the name of the italian republics of the middle age which deserve the attention of americans and will further illustrate and confirm the principles we have endeavored to maintain if it appears from the history of all the ancient republics of greece italy and asia minor as well as from those that still remain in switzerland italy and elsewhere that caprice instability turbulence revolutions and the alternate prevalence of those two plagues and   scourges of mankind tyranny and anarchy were the effects of governments without three orders and a balance the same important truth will appear in a still clearer light in the republics of italy the sketches to be given of these cannot be introduced with more propriety than by the sentiments of a late writer because they coincide with every thing that has been before observed limited monarchies were the ancient governments the jealousies and errors of the nobles or the oppressions they suffered stimulated them to render monarchy unpopular and erect aristocracies ancient nations were in one point very generally defective in their constitutions and that was the incertitude of the sovereignty and by consequence the instability of government which was in all the republics of italy a perpetual occasion of infinite confusion in no part of italy however united together was found established an absolute hereditary monarch by many examples it is manifest that kings either were created by the favor of the multitude or at least sought their consent and consulted the people in affairs of most importance and greatest danger the government of the grandees which succeeded was rather a fraudulent or violent usurpation than a true and proper aristocracy established by law or confirmed by long and uncontested possession and a popular government was never so free or so durable as when it was mixed with the authority of one supreme head or of a senate so that mixed governments were almost always preferred one of the three kinds of governments nevertheless fell when another arose and all the italian republics nearly at one time by the same gradations passed from one form of administration to another in this particular all the memorials of ancient italy agree they were from the beginning governed by kings the tuscans had kings the sabines had kings and so had the people of latium and as every city and every borough formed an independent government these kings could not have much magnificence many states often obeyed the same king for he who had the lordship of one city procured himself to be elected the head of another porsenna whom dionysius calls king of tuscany because he was followed by many tuscan nations was   from the beginning only king of chiusi the kings of rome by various means gained the command of the latin cities which nevertheless two centuries afterwards reputed themselves still independent of the state of rome the king of the veientes had the lordship of fidena a free city and independent of the veientes in the same manner as the visconti lords of milan castruccio lord of lucca and the scala lords of verona and so many other princes and tyrants of the later ages before the exaltation of charles v made such progress in obtaining the sovereignty of many cities which had nothing in common with milan or lucca or verona these kingdoms were either simply elective or at least required the express consent of the people howsoever often one relation succeeded to another neither were royal governments generally displeasing to the people but the grandees and nobles who were the most exposed to the caprice of the prince both in their persons and property studied to generate in the minds of the common people a hatred to the name of king and to excite the desire of liberty they flattered themselves that if the principality which often fell into the hands of new men and adventurers such as tarquin in rome and aristodemus in cuma were abolished they should be able to live not only with more security and greater license but with more authority command and power in what nation and in which city the revolution first began is not easy to determine but in the course of the third century of the roman era one people following the example of another this by means of one and that of another opportunity either expelled by violence their present kings or desisted from electing new ones and all italy hoisting as it were a common signal changed at once its whole form of government the odium of the royal name and an enthusiasm for liberty seized so universally and with such energy the whole italian nation that if any city wished either to continue or recover the custom of kings this inclination was scarcely manifested before it was pointed out and reviled by the other cities and upon all great occasions abandoned the veientes either from a disgust at the cabals and ambition which arose from the annual creation of new magistrates or the better to provide for war created afresh   a king by which resolution they incurred to such a degree the hatred and contempt of the other people of tuscany that contrary to every rule of policy duty and custom they were left alone to sustain that obstinate war with the romans which ended in their ruin in the beginning of the fourth century of the roman history there is seldom or never mention made of kings in any of the states of italy the whole authority and administration of public affairs passed into the hands of the nobility or the senate and that body constituting at first the middle order between the king and the people became the supreme head of the government and although the greater magistracies were elected by the voices or suffrages of the people nevertheless all the honors and all the power of the government were collected in the grandees who easily commanded the votes of the electors and who alone were the elected for none of the plebeians dared to pretend to offices civil or military and it is too evident that in every kind of community the rich and the noble endeavor as it were by their very nature to exclude the poor and the plebeians most of the public affairs relative to peace or war were treated in a senate composed essentially of patricians and nobles who in every thing that regarded the constitution inclined more to aristocracy than to popular government no city was so mean or so ill ordered as not to have a public council or a senate livy speaks of the senate not only of naples capua and cuma but of nola pipernum tusculum tivoli the veientes and of others so frequently that it is clear that in all the republics there was an order distinct from the plebeians who retained in their hands the essence of the government but the plebeians once become obstinate at the solicitation of the nobility in a hatred of tyranny had not far to go before they opened their eyes upon their own condition and learned that they had done nothing more than exchange one master for many and they began to make every exertion to obtain in fact the possession of that liberty of which they had until then obtained a taste in words from the order of patricians and the senate as the multitude began to make trial of their strength the sovereign authority was ceded to them by little and little and the nobility in their turn were tormented and tyrannized by the plebeians livy observes that about the time of the carthaginian war by a kind of epidemical malady spread   through the italian republics the plebeians applied themselves to persecute the nobility nevertheless the order of the grandees always preserved a great part of the power for the nature of popular government being variable inconstant and incapable of conducting itself the senate and the nobility who act with more maturity of deliberation and with interests more united can generally counterpoise the party of the plebeians and from time to time overcome it from whence it happened that all the cities were exposed to continual revolutions of government and very rarely enjoyed that perfect equality which is the end of a free state but either the favor of the people or the necessity of the senate devolved the principal authority on some individual who with or without the title of supreme magistrate was always regarded as the head of the government thus we find a manilius head of the latins an accius tullius principal of the volsci a herennius of the samnites a calavius of the campanians a valerius a camillus and a fabius chiefs of the romans and to speak the truth there was never any great and important success in any free state either at home or abroad except in those times when some one citizen held the will of the public in his own power but waving the rest of these general observations for the present let us descend to particulars and quitting the ancient republics of italy descend to those of the middle age among which florence is the most illustrious as the history of that noble city and magnanimous people has been written by two authors among a multitude of others who may be compared to any of the historians of greece or rome we have here an example more fully delineated an experiment more perfectly made and more accurately described than any we have examined before we shall not therefore find it tedious to consider minutely the affairs of a brave and enlightened people to whom the world is indebted for a machiavel a guicciardini and an americus vespucius in a great degree for the resurrection of letters and a second civilization of mankind next to athens and rome there has not existed a more interesting city the history is full of lessons of wisdom extremely to our purpose we have all along contended that the predominant passion of all men in power whether kings nobles or plebeians is the same that tyranny will be the effect whoever are the governors  0 whether the one the few or the many if uncontrolled by equal laws made by common consent and supported protected and enforced by three different orders of men in equilibrio in florence where the administration was by turns in the nobles the grandees the commons the plebeians the mob the ruling passion of each was the same and the government of each immediately degenerated into a tyranny so insupportable as to produce a fresh revolution we have all along contended that a simple government in a single assembly whether aristocratical or democratical must of necessity divide into two parties each of which will be headed by some one illustrious family and will proceed from debate and controversy to sedition and war in florence the first dissension was among the nobility the second between the nobles and commons and the third between the commons and plebeians in each of which contests as soon as one party got uppermost it split into two and executions confiscations banishments assassinations and dispersions of families were the fruit of every division even with more atrocious aggravations than in those of greece having no third order to appeal to for decision no contest could be decided but by the sword it will enable us the better to understand machiavel whose history will be abridged and commented on if we premise from nardi that the city of florence had like all other cities its people consisting of three genera of inhabitants that is to say the nobility the people of property† and the common people although some too diligently divided the nobility into three sorts calling the first nobles the second grandees and the third families meaning to signify that some of the inhabitants had come into the city and become citizens having been deprived of their own proper country by conquest while they were attempting to enlarge and extend their territories others originally of this country had become abundant in riches and powerful in dependents either by their own industry or the favor of fortune and others having been foreigners had come in like manner to inhabit the city but from their primitive condition they still retained the distinctions of lord and vassal by habit and by fraud both in the city and the country and all this mixture were indifferently called nobles grandees and families and they were    equally hated contradicted and opposed in the government of the republic and in all their other actions by that party which was called the substantial people il popolo grasso the lower class of people the plebeians il popolo minuto never intervened in government at all excepting on one single occasion when with violence they usurped it as in its proper place will be related some persons made still another division of the plebeians and not without reason for those who possessed real estate in the city or country and were recorded in the public books of taxes and tributes of the city and were called the enregistered esteemed themselves and were considered by their fellowcitizens as holding a middle station the remainder of the lower class who possessed no kind of property were held of no account nevertheless all this undistinguished aggregate were called the people of florence and the expression is still in use as the people of athens or the people of rome anciently comprehended the whole body of the inhabitants of those cities to which confused and in its nature pernicious aggregate as that of the head and tail always is the body of middling citizens will always remain extremely useful and proportioned to the constitution of a perfect republic as machiavel is the most favorable to a popular government and is even suspected of sometimes disguising the truth to conceal or mollify its defects the substance of this sketch will be taken from him referring at the same time to other authors so that those young americans who wish to be masters of the subject may be at no loss for information the most useful erudition for republicans is that  which exposes the causes of discord by which they may learn wisdom and unanimity from the examples of others the factions in florence are the most remarkable of any most other commonwealths have been divided into two that city was distracted into many in rome the contest between patricians and plebeians which arose after the expulsion of kings continued to the dissolution of the republic the same happened in athens and all the other commonwealths of greece italy and asia minor    such was the patriotism or good fortune of florence that she seems to have gathered fresh vigor and risen stronger for her factions some who escaped in the struggles contributed more by their courage and constancy to the exaltation of themselves and their country than the malignity of faction had done to distress them and if such orders and balances had been established in their form of government as would have kept the citizens united after they had shaken off the yoke of the empire it might have equalled any republic ancient or modern in military power and the arts of peace the city of florence  was begun by the inhabitants of fiesole who situated on the top of a hill marked out a plot of ground upon the plain between the hill and the river arno for the conveniency of merchants who first built stores there for their goods when the romans had secured italy by the destruction of carthage this place multiplied exceedingly and became a city by the name of villa arnina sylla was the first and after him the three roman citizens who revenged the death and divided the empire of cæsar who sent colonies to fiesole that settled in the plain not far from the town already begun and the place became so full of buildings and inhabitants and such provisions were made for a civil government that it might well be reckoned among the cities of italy whence it took the name of florence is not so well known tacitus calls the town florentia and the people florentines it was founded under the roman empire but when that was overrun by barbarians totila king of the ostrogoths took and demolished it two hundred and fifty years afterwards it was rebuilt by charlemagne from whose time till      it followed the fortune of those who successively ruled in italy for during that period it was governed first by the posterity of charlemagne then by the berengarii and last of all by the german emperors in  0 0 the florentines took and destroyed fiesole when the popes assumed greater authority in italy and the power of the german emperors was upon the wane all the towns of that province began to govern themselves in  0 0 italy was divided between henry iii and the church until      the florentines always submitted to the strongest having no other ambition    than to preserve themselves but as in our bodies the later diseases come the more dangerous they are so the longer florence put off taking a part in the troubles of italy the more fatal these proved the cause of its first division is well known the most powerful families in florence in      were the buondelmonti and the uberti and next to them the amidei and donati a quarrel happened about a lady and messer buondelmonte was killed this murder divided the whole city one part of it siding with the buondelmonti and the other with the uberti and as both of the families were powerful in alliances castles and adherents the quarrel continued many years till the reign of the emperor frederick ii who being likewise king of naples and desirous to strengthen himself against the church and establish his interest more securely in tuscany joined the uberti who by his assistance drove the buondelmonti out of florence and thus that city became divided as all the rest of italy was before into the two factions of guelphs and ghibellines the guelphs thus driven out of the city retired into the valley which lies higher up the arno where their strong places and dependencies lay and defended themselves as well as they could but when frederick died the neutral people in the city    endeavored to reunite it and prevailed upon the guelphs to forget the wrongs they had suffered and return and the ghibellines to dismiss their jealousies and receive them after they were reunited they divided the city into six parts and chose twelve citizens two to govern each ward with the title of anziani but to be changed every year to prevent any feuds or discontents that might arise from the determination of judicial matters they constituted two judges that were not florentines one of whom was styled the captain of the people and the other the podestà to administer justice to the people in all causes civil and criminal and since laws are but of little authority and short duration where there is not sufficient power to support and enforce them they raised twenty bands or companies in the city and seventysix more in the rest of their territories in which all the youth were enlisted and obliged to be ready armed under their respective colors whenever they were required so to be by the captain or the anziani their standardbearers were changed every year with great formality this is the very short description of their constitution the twelve anziani appear to have had the legislative and executive authority and to have been annually eligible—a form of government as near that of m turgot and marchmont nedham as any to be found—yet the judicial power is here separated and the people could so little trust themselves or the anziani with this power that it was given to foreigners by such discipline in their civil and military affairs the florentines laid the foundation of their liberty and it is hardly to be conceived how much strength and authority they acquired in a very short time for their city not only became the capital of tuscany but was reckoned among the principal in italy and indeed there is no degree of grandeur to which it might not have attained if it had not been obstructed by new and frequent factions after this pompous preamble one can scarce read without smiling the words that follow for the space of ten years they lived under this form of government especially when it appears that during all these ten years they were constantly employed in wars abroad as appears by the following words during which time they forced the states of pistoia arezzo and siena to enter into a confederacy with them and in their return with    their army from the last city they took volterra demolished several castles and brought the inhabitants to florence the united states of america calculated their governments for a duration of more than ten years there is little doubt to be made that they might have existed under the government of state congresses for ten years while they were constantly at war and all the active and idle were in council or in arms but we have seen that a state which could be governed by a provincial congress and indeed that could carry on a war without any government at all while danger pressed has lately in time of profound peace and under a good government broke out in seditions  this democratical government in florence could last no longer for in all these expeditions says machiavel the guelphs had the chief direction and command as they were much more popular than the ghibellines who had behaved themselves so imperiously in the reign of frederick when they had the upper hand that they were become very odious to the people and because the party of the church was generally thought to favor their attempts to preserve their liberty whilst that of the emperor endeavored to deprive them of it the ghibellines in the mean time finding their authority so dwindled were not a little discontented and only waited for a proper opportunity to seize upon the government again they entered into correspondence with manfred the son of frederick king of naples in hopes of his assistance but for want of due secrecy in these practices they were discovered by the anziani who thereupon summoned the family of the uberti to appear before them but instead of obeying they took up arms and fortified themselves in their houses at which the people were so incensed that they likewise ran to arms and by the help of the guelphs obliged the whole party of the ghibellines to quit florence and transport themselves to siena there they sued to manfred for aid who granted it and the guelphs were defeated upon the banks of the river arbia with such slaughter by the kings forces under the conduct of farinata de gli uberti that those who escaped from it giving up their city for lost fled directly to lucca manfred had given the command of the    auxiliaries which he sent to the ghibellines to count giordano a soldier of no small reputation in those times this giordano after his victory immediately advanced with the ghibellines to florence and not only forced the city to acknowledge manfred for its sovereign but deposed the magistrates and either entirely abrogated or altered all laws and customs that might look like remains of their former liberty which being executed with great rigor and insolence inflamed the people to such a degree that if they did not love the ghibellines before they now became their inveterate and implacable enemies which aversion continually increasing at last proved their utter destruction there is an admirable example of patriotism at this period of the florentine history in farinata uberti who successfully and decidedly opposed a plan of his own party of ghibellines and their allies for the demolition of the city he preserved it however only for his enemies the guelphs who driven out of lucca went to parma and joined their friends the guelphs in that city drove out the ghibellines and had their confiscated estates for their reward they then joined the pope against manfred who was defeated and slain in consequence of this victory the guelphs of florence grew daily bolder and more vigorous and the party of the ghibellines weaker and weaker upon which count guido novello and those that were left in commission with him to govern florence resolved to try by lenity and gentler treatment to recover the affections of the people whom they found they had exasperated to the last degree by their oppressive and violent manner of proceeding to cajole and ingratiate themselves with the people they chose sixandthirty citizens out of the people of florence and two gentlemen of higher rank from among their friends at bologna to whom they gave a commission to reform the state these delegates divided the city into distinct arts or trades over which they constituted a magistrate who was to administer justice to all who were in his department and to every art a separate banner was assigned under which they might assemble in arms whenever the safety of the public required it but count guido must have a tax to maintain his soldiers the citizens would not pay it he attempted to take back the new privilege of magistrates to each trade the people rose in arms chose giovanni soldanieri for their leader fought the count    and his ghibellines and drove them out of the city the people having thus got the upper hand resolved to unite the city if possible and recall all such citizens as had been forced to leave their homes whether guelphs or ghibellines the guelphs returned after six years banishment the late attempt of the ghibellines was pardoned and they were suffered to come back again but they still continued very odious both to the guelphs and the people the former not being able to forgive the disgrace and hardships of their long exile nor the latter to forget their insolence and tyranny when they had the government in their hands so that their ancient animosities were not yet entirely extinguished either on one side or the other the wrangle soon came to a crisis and the ghibellines fled out of the city upon the interposition of a foreign force from charles king of naples in favor of the guelphs after the departure of the ghibellines the florentines newmodelled their government and chose twelve principal magistrates who were to continue in authority no longer than two months under the title of buoni homini next in power under them they appointed a council of eighty citizens which they called the credenza after this a hundred and eighty more were elected out of the people thirty to serve for each sixth who together with the credenza and the twelve buoni homini were called the general council besides which they instituted another council consisting of a hundred and twenty members equally chosen out of the nobility citizens and commonalty which was to confirm whatsoever had been resolved upon by the others and to act jointly with them in disposing of the public honors and offices of the commonwealth the first government of the anziani was as near a simple democracy as there is any example of we found it accordingly ineffectual the next of buoni homini was no better and that could not support itself now we come to a new plan which discovers in the authors of it a sense of the imperfection of the former two and an attempt to obviate its inconveniences and dangers but instead of a judicious plan founded in the natural divisions of the people it is a jumble which common sense would see at this day must fall to pieces the buoni homini the credenza and the thirty of the hundred and eighty wore an appearance of three orders but instead of being kept    separate they are all huddled together in the general council another council still of a hundred and twenty equally chosen out of the nobility citizens and commonalty was to confirm whatever was resolved on by the others here are two branches with each a negative but the mistake was that the aristocratical and democratical parts of the community were mixed in each of them which shows at first blush that there never could be harmony in either both being naturally and necessarily split into two factions but a greater defect if possible than even this was giving the executive power the power of disposing of public honors and offices to a joint assemblage of buoni homini credenza and the two other assemblies all in one the consequence must be that although every one of these four orders must be divided at once into factions for the loaves and fishes yet the nobility by their superior influence in elections would have the whole power unhappy florence thou art destined from this moment to neverending factions seditions and civil wars accordingly we read in the next page what any one might have foreseen from this sketch of their constitution that the government of florence was fallen into great disorder and misrule for the guelph nobility being the majority were grown so insolent and stood in so little awe of the magistracy and how could they stand in awe of magistrates whom they had created and who were ever at their devotion that though many murders and other violences were daily committed yet the criminals generally escaped with impunity through favor of one or other of the nobles in order to restrain these enormities instead of twelve governors they resolved to have fourteen seven of each party who should be nominated by the pope and remain in office one year under this form of government in which they had been obliged in reality to submit to a foreign master they continued for two years when the rage of faction again blazed out they rose in arms and put the city under a new regulation this was in      when the companies of arts and trades ordained that instead of fourteen citizens three only should govern and that for two months who were to be chosen indifferently out of the nobility or commons provided they were merchants or professed any art or occupation and these were called priori afterwards    the chief magistracy was vested in six persons one for each ward under which regulation the city continued till the year       but the course of events for these sixty years should be carefully traced in order to see the operation of such a form of government even in a single city this institution as might be expected occasioned the ruin of the nobility who upon divers provocations were excluded and entirely suppressed by the people the nobility indeed were divided among themselves and by endeavoring to supplant each other and aspiring to the sole government of the commonwealth they quite lost all share in it the priori were afterwards distinguished by the name of signori there remained some sparks of animosity betwixt the nobility and commonalty which are incident to all republics for one side being naturally jealous of any encroachment upon their liberty and legal rights and the other ambitious to rule and control the laws it is not possible they should ever long agree together this humor however did not show itself in the nobility while they were overawed by the ghibellines but when the latter were depressed it began to appear and the people were daily injured and abused in such a manner that neither the laws nor the magistracy had authority enough to relieve them as every nobleman supported himself in his insolence by the number of his friends and relations both against the power of the signori  0 and the captain of the people the heads of the arts wishing to remedy so great an evil provided that every signory should appoint a standardbearer of justice out of the people with a thousand men divided into twenty companies under him who should be always ready with their standard and arms whenever ordered by the magistracy this establishment met little opposition on account of the jealousy and emulation that reigned among the nobility who were not in the least aware that it was levelled at them till they felt the smart of it then indeed they were not a little awed by it for some time but in a while they returned to the commission of their former outrages for as some of them always found means to insinuate themselves into the signory they had it in their power to prevent the standardbearer from executing his office besides as witnesses were always required upon any accusation the plaintiff could hardly ever find any one that durst give evidence against the nobility so that in a short time florence was involved in its former distractions and the people exposed to violence and oppression as justice was grown dilatory and sentence though passed seldom or never executed the people not knowing what course to take giano della bella a strenuous patriot though of a very noble family encouraged the heads of the arts once more to reform the city by his advice it was enacted that the gonfalonier should always reside with the signori and have four thousand armed men under his command they also entirely excluded the nobility out of that council of the signori and made a law that all accessaries or abettors should be liable to the same punishment with those that were principals in any crime and that common fame should be sufficient evidence to convict them by these laws which were called li ordinamenti della giustizia  but which were in reality    as tyrannical as the edicts of any despot could be the people regained great weight and authority but giano being looked upon by the nobility as the author of these laws to bridle their power became very odious not only to them but to the richest of the commonalty as well he might for laws more oppressive and destructive of liberty could not have been made tyrannical as they were however they were not enough so for the people for upon the trial of corso donati a nobleman for a murder although he was acquitted even under these new laws the people were enraged and ran to arms and demolished the magistrates house instead of applying to the signori the whole city exceedingly resented this outrage upon all law and government the blame of it was laid upon giano and he was accused before the magistrates as an encourager of insurrection while his cause was depending the people took arms to defend him against the signori giano went voluntarily into banishment to appease this tumult the nobility then petitioned the signori that the severity of the laws against them might be mitigated as soon as this petition was publicly known the commons apprehending the signori would comply with it immediately rose in a tumultuous manner so that ambition on one side and jealousy on the other at last occasioned an open rupture between them and both sides were prepared for battle but by the interposition and mediation of some prudent men whose arguments with both parties were very judicious the people at last consented that no accusation should be admitted against a nobleman without sufficient evidence to support it both parties laid down their arms but retained their jealousies and began soon to raise forces and fortify themselves as fast as they could the people thought fit to newmodel the government and reduce the number of the signori as they suspected some of that body to be too favorably inclined to the nobility a momentary tranquillity succeeded but the sparks of jealousy and envy still remained betwixt the nobility and people    which soon broke out on occasion of a quarrel between two families the cerchi and donati both considerable for their riches nobility and dependents the signori were under no small apprehensions that the whole city would become engaged in the dispute and hourly expected the two parties would openly attack each other as soon afterwards happened and a skirmish ensued in which many were wounded on both sides the whole city commons as well as nobility divided upon it nor did the contagion confine itself to the city alone but infected all the country so ineffectual was this contemptible government of the signori to the suppression of this animosity that the pope was applied to he sent his nuncio to no purpose and then put the city under an interdict but this answered no end but to increase the confusion and frequent battles took place till the whole city took arms neither the power of the magistracy nor the authority of the laws being able to restrain the fury of the multitude the wisest and best of the citizens were in great terror and the donati being the weaker party not a little doubtful of their safety such is the effect of a government of all authority in one centre here all was concentrated in the signori chosen by the people frequently enough yet although the nobility were arbitrarily excluded from that council those who were chosen were indebted for their elections probably to those very nobles and chiefly to the donati and cerchi the donati were the minority upon the whole and therefore had great reason to be doubtful of their safety it was agreed at a meeting betwixt corso donati the heads of the neri family and the captains of the arts  to solicit the pope    to send some person of royal extraction to reform the city here nature breaks out in spite of all attempts to stifle it a royal dignity is the most obvious thought to extinguish animosities between nobles and commons in this case the captains of the arts that is the people perceived it as well as corso and the neri the contending nobles this meeting and the result of it was notified to the signori by the other party who represented it as a conspiracy against the public liberty both sides however were in arms again and dante who was one of the signori had the courage to advise that sovereign assembly to arm the people and they being joined by great numbers out of the country found themselves able to force the chiefs of each party to lay down their arms they assumed an appearance of dignity banished corso and the neri and to show their impartiality several of the bianchi but this government had no permanent strength the bianchi upon plausible pretences were soon permitted to return corso and his associates obtained the same indulgence but instead of being quiet they went to rome to persuade the pope to appoint a person of royal extraction as they had before petitioned his holiness in their letters charles of valois brother of the king of france was sent accordingly by the pope though the bianchi family who then had the upper hand in florence looked upon him with an evil eye yet as he was patron of the guelphs and sent by the pope they durst not oppose his coming on the contrary to make him their friend they gave him full power to regulate the city as he thought best he caused his friends to arm themselves this made the people so jealous that he intended to deprive them of what they called their liberties that they took arms the cerchi and the heads of the bianchi having had the chief government of the city some time in their hands and behaved with great arrogance were become generally odious which encouraged corso and others of the neri who had fled to return upon an assurance that charles and the captains of the party were their friends and would support them accordingly whilst the city was thus alarmed with the apprehensions of    charless designs corso with all his associates and many other of their followers made their entry into it without resistance and though véri de cerchi was called upon to oppose them he declined it and said the people against whom they came should themselves chastise them as they were likely to be the greatest sufferers by them but the contrary happened for instead of chastising them they received them with open arms whilst véri was forced to fly for his safety corso having forced his entrance at the porta pinti drew up and made a stand near his own house and being joined by a great number of his friends and others assembled in hopes of a change of government he released all prisoners civil and criminal divested the signori of their authority chose new magistrates all of the party of the neri out of the people to supply their places and plundered the houses of the bianchi the cerchi and the heads of their faction seeing the people for the most part their enemies and charles not their friend fled out of the city and in their turn implored the interposition of the pope though they would not listen to his exhortations before such is the series of alternate tragedy comedy and farce which was called the liberty of florence during this collection of all authority into one centre the signori in which no man of any party could be one moment secure of his life property or liberty amidst continual exaltations and depressions of parties in favor of different noble families although those nobles were all excluded from the government the exclusion was but a form nearly all the power was in their hands and the signori in office were only alternate tools of one noble family or another and thus it must ever be exclude the aristocratical part of the community by laws as tyrannical as you will they will still govern the state underhand the persons elected into office will be their tools and in constant fear of them will behave like mere puppets danced upon their wires but our humorous entertainment is not yet ended the pope now at the intercession of the cerchi sent a legate acquasparta to florence who made an accommodation betwixt the cerchi and donati and fortified it by several intermarriages between them but this spiritual policy though deep and sound did not answer his end for when he insisted that the bianchi should share in the chief offices of the commonwealth    that was refused by the neri who were in full possession of them upon this the legate left the city as dissatisfied as ever and excommunicated it a second time for its contumacy the neri however seeing their old enemies in their bosom again were not a little afraid they would use all means to ruin them in order to recover their former authority and both parties were still discontented and fresh occasions of discord soon occurred niccolo de cerchi and simon a son of corso donati met and fought the battle was so sharp and bloody that niccolo was killed upon the spot and simon so desperately wounded that he died the same night this accident as it is called though an event springing necessarily from the form of government and state of parties threw the whole city into an uproar again and although the neri were the most in fault as simon assaulted niccolo yet they were screened by the magistracy and before judgment could be obtained a conspiracy was discovered betwixt the bianchi and pietro ferrante a nobleman who attended charles of valois with whom they had been tampering to persuade his master to reinstate them in the government the plot was detected by some letters from the cerchi to pietro though it was the common opinion they were forged by the donati to wipe off the odium they had incurred by the murder of niccolo de cerchi nevertheless all the family of the cerchi with many of their followers of the bianchi party and among the rest dante the poet were immediately sent into banishment their estates confiscated and their houses demolished by the strength of those forged letters after which their party with many of the ghibellines who had joined them were dispersed in different places the quiet that ensued was very short for corso donati was dissatisfied that he did not enjoy the degree of authority in florence he thought due to his merit the government being in the hands of the people and conducted by those who were in all respects much inferior to him to varnish over his designs and revenge with a fair pretext he accused several citizens who had been entrusted with public money with embezzling it and many were ignorant and credulous enough to believe that corso    did this out of pure concern and affection for his country the persons thus calumniated were in favor with the people and stood upon their justification and after many law suits and long litigations these disputes grew to such a height that it became absolutely necessary to take up arms on one side were corso and lottieri bishop of florence with many of the nobility and some of the commons on the other were the signori and the greater part of the people nothing was to be seen but affrays and skirmishes in every part of the city in such a right constitution as this such a government of the peoples successive sovereign assemblies as the signori were the body of the nation never can be unanimous all the most wealthy bestborn besteducated and ablest men will unanimously despise and detest the government except a few artful hypocrites among them who will belie their judgments and feelings for the sake of a present popularity for some private ends those who thus hate the form of government will have numerous connections relations and dependents among the people who will follow them so that there never can be more than a small majority of the people on the side of government hence its constant weakness hence it is a mere football continually kicked from one side to another by three or four principal families thus it appeared in this case the signori feeling their weakness and perceiving themselves in great danger utterly unable to punish crimes support their friends or curb their enemies were obliged to send to lucca a foreign state for aid and were fortunate enough to find all the people of that city willing to come to their assistance the tumults were composed for a time but the signori and people were too feeble to punish the author of the disturbance this interval of tranquillity was no more durable than former ones the pope again sent his legate niccolo da prato who ingratiated himself with the people so that they gave him a commission to newmodel the city in order to obtain the recall of the ghibelline faction from banishment he flattered the people by restoring their ancient companies which added much    to their strength and diminished that of the nobility but the project of restoring the exiles was obnoxious to the signori who forced the legate out of the city which he put under an interdict at his departure and left in the utmost confusion two factions not being sufficient the city was now divided and subdivided into several as those of the people and nobility the guelphs and ghibellines the bianchi and the neri and some who wished for the return of the exiles being disappointed in their hopes now the legate was gone grew clamorous and outrageous so that the whole city was in an uproar and many skirmishes ensued those that were most active in raising this clamor were the medici and giugni who had openly sided with the legate in favor of the exiles this is the first mention made of that family of medici who acted so distinguished a part afterwards finally subverted the commonwealth and changed it into an absolute sovereignty under the title of a grand dukedom a form it still wears let us look back to      when this government of priori or signori chosen every two months by the people was established from thence to   0  is only twentytwo years in which we see a constant quarrel between the nobility and people and between one party of nobles and another and the neighboring states of naples rome and lucca in turn called in to aid the different factions alternate murders banishments confiscations and civil wars as one party and the other prevailed and instead of a government and a system of justice and liberty constant anarchy and the perpetual rolling of a mob in this year   0  florence was visited in this lamentable manner with fire and sword a great fire broke out and was ascribed as usual in such times by some to accident and by some to party design corso donati was the only person of any distinction who did not take up arms he thought that when all parties grew tired of fighting he was the more likely to be called in arbitrator to decide their differences they did indeed lay down their arms but more out of weariness of their miseries and that they might have time to take breath than from any real desire of being reunited and living in peace it was only stipulated that the exiles should not be suffered to return which was agreed to by those that favored them merely because they proved to be the weaker side    new disturbances arising the pope was advised by his legate to summon to rome twelve of the principal malcontents of florence they readily obeyed the summons and among them was corso donati as soon as they were set out upon their journey the legate acquainted the exiles that now was their time to return to florence as the city was then clear of the only men that had authority enough to oppose their entrance drawing together what forces they could they immediately marched and entered the city but those very citizens who but a little before when they petitioned in the most humble and submissive manner to be admitted had exerted themselves in the most strenuous manner for their return now they saw them approach in a hostile manner were the first that took up arms against them and joined with the people to drive them back one is however astonished at the reflection of machiavel—such was the spirit of patriotism amongst them in those days that they cheerfully gave up their private interests for the public good—when every page of his history shows that the public good was sacrificed every day by all parties to their private interests friendships and enmities after the exiles were repulsed the citizens relapsed into their former distractions and after much violence the governors of the commonwealth reestablished the companies of the people and restored the colors under which the arts had formerly been used to assemble their captains were called standardbearers of the companies and colleagues of the signori and were directed not only to assist the signori in times of peace with their counsel but to support and defend them by dint of arms in all exigencies and commotions to assist the two judges who had been constituted in the beginning of their state they appointed an officer called il esecutore or sheriff who was to act in conjunction with the standardbearers and see their orders carried into execution whenever the nobility should be guilty of any enormity or act of oppression the pope died the eleven citizens returned with corso whose restless ambition occasioned such troubles in order to make himself popular he constantly opposed the nobility in all their schemes and which way soever he observed the people to incline he turned all his authority to support them in it and gain their affection so that in all contests and divisions or when    they had any extraordinary point to carry they always resorted to him and put themselves under his directions machiavel indeed observes that all might now have lived in peace if the restless ambition of corso had not occasioned fresh troubles but in this machiavel is mistaken if corso had not existed the people would have found some other leader and confidant when the people feel that the government is unable or unwilling to protect them against the oppressions of the nobles they always seek out a cassius mælius manlius or corso to assist the old or to erect a new government that will be able and willing to protect them it is the defect in the government and the wants of the people that excite and inspirit the ambition of private men to be sure the man of any distinction who listens to the complaints of the people in such cases whether from ambition or humanity always creates for himself much hatred and envy among the most considerable citizens in this instance these passions increased to such a degree that the faction of the neri divided and quarrelled among themselves to alienate the affections of the people from corso they gave out as the aristocracy always does in such cases that he secretly designed to seize upon the government and make himself king and his magnificent manner of living and marriage into the family of faggivola head of the bianchi and ghibellines made it easily believed encouraged by this his enemies took up arms against him and the greater part of the people instead of appearing in his defence forsook him and joined his adversaries he was impeached refused to obey the summons and was declared a contumacious rebel between the accusation and the sentence there was not the interval of more than two hours a civil war ensued many were killed on both sides after a furious defence corso threw himself from his horse and was killed such was the unfortunate end of corso donati to whom his country and the neri owed much both of their good and bad fortune one of the most eminent men that florence ever produced but machiavel should have laid the blame upon the constitution not upon the restless disposition or turbulent spirit of  0 corso because it is impossible for a man of corsos genius valor and activity in such a government not to be restless and turbulent he is never safe himself and large bodies of people are continually flattering and soliciting him while others are threatening and persecuting him no nation has a right to blame such a citizen until it has established a form of government that is capable of protecting him on one side and the people against him on the other this flimsy sovereignty of the signori was inadequate to either purpose after the death of corso the exiles from florence excited henry the emperor to a war against that city for their restoration the magistrates applied to robert king of naples and gave him the government of the city for five years to defend it and protect them this storm after raging some time blew over by the death of the emperor† the ghibellines then under the command of faggivola renewed the war by making themselves masters of pisa and committing depredations on the florentine territories the florentines fought him and were totally defeated they then applied to king robert‡ for another general he sent them the count di andria whose bad conduct added says machiavel to the impatient temper of the florentines which is soon tired with any form of government and ready to fall into factions upon every accident occasioned the city to divide again machiavels severity ought however to have been applied to the form of government not to the temper of the people the latter being but the natural and necessary effect of the former in such a government the people have no protection or security they are continually oppressed vexed and irritated by one faction or another one ally or enemy or another one aspiring citizen or family or another against whose usurpations as the constitution affords no redress they are obliged to recur to arms and a change of government the florentines in this case sought assistance from france and germany but could obtain none they were determined however to carry their point took arms drove the count out of the city and sent for one lando of agobbio and made him their esecutore or rather dictator or executioner§ with full    power over all the citizens lando being naturally rapacious and cruel went about the city with a gang of armed men at his heels hanging up one man and then another as those who had sent for him gave him directions and at last to such a height of power did he arrive by the dissensions of the citizens as to coin bad money with the florentine stamp which nobody had courage enough to oppose miserable indeed was the condition of the city at that time which neither the bitter remembrance of the evils produced by their former dissensions nor the dread of a foreign enemy at their gates nor the authority of a king was sufficient to keep united even though their possessions were daily ravaged and plundered abroad by faggivola and at home by lando the nobility most of the considerable commons and all the guelphs took the kings side and opposed lando and those who supported him and to free themselves from so ignominious a yoke they wrote to king robert privately and entreated him to appoint count guido his lieutenant at florence which he readily complied with and the other party though they had the signori on their side durst not venture to oppose a man of so established a reputation but the count soon found he had very little authority in the city as the magistracy and the standardbearers of the several companies openly favored lando and his friends soon afterwards the citizens were reconciled and united under the king by the friendly counsel of his daughterinlaw and lando deprived of his authority was sent back to agobbio satiated with blood and rapine the government of the king of naples was continued three years longer and as the seven who were then in the signori were all of landos party six others were added to them of the kings and they continued thirteen for some time but were afterwards reduced to seven again about this time castruccio castracani† drove out faggivola and succeeded him in the government of lucca and pisa the florentines had enough to do to obstruct the growth of the power of this spirited and fortunate youth at the head of the    ghibelline interest and to defend themselves against him that the signori in this war might proceed with maturer deliberation and execute with greater authority they chose twelve citizens whom they called buoni homini without whose advice and consent the signori were not to pass any act of importance but this effort of nature to form a balance to this simple government was of short duration the dominion of king robert expired and the government once more reverted to the citizens who set up the same form of magistracy that had been formerly instituted the whole city was soon obliged to march against castruccio to the relief of prato and a proclamation was issued by the signori that every exile of the guelph party who came in to the relief of prato should afterwards have liberty to return home this policy added four thousand men to their army which before consisted of twenty thousand foot and fifteen hundred horse castruccio afraid of so formidable a force retreated to lucca upon this retreat great disputes arose in the florentine camp between the nobility and the people about pursuing castruccio these disputes were referred to the signory which consisting at this time of commoners as well as of nobility was also divided in opinion upon this the people rose in a tumult and forced the signory to give way to them but it was now too late to follow castruccio and the people were so exasperated that they would not suffer the public faith to be kept with the exiles the nobility having some regard to their honor though the people had not took the part of the exiles which produced another civil war as it generally happens in all commonwealths that after any revolution or remarkable crisis  some or other of the old laws are abrogated and new ones made in their room so though the signori at first were changed every two months yet the magistrates who were now in office having great power took upon themselves to constitute a signory out of all the most considerable citizens to continue forty months their names were to be put into a bag or purse which was called imborsation  and a certain number of them drawn out by lot at the end of every second month whereas before when the old magistrates went out of office new ones were always chosen by the council    as the council consisted only of the most considerable citizens the government was before but a selfcreated or at least selfcontinued aristocracy now it was equally so with this difference only that lot was substituted in the room of choice as the lot was not to be now renewed till after a term of above three years it was thought they had extinguished the causes of all such disgusts and tumults as used to happen from the frequent return of elections and the number of competitors for the magistracy not being aware how little advantage and how many mischiefs were likely to flow from it  in      in a war with castruccio the florentines were betrayed by their general raymondo this man saw that the florentines had been so liberal in disposing of themselves that they had sometimes conferred their government upon kings sometimes upon legates and sometimes upon persons of much inferior quality he thought if he could reduce them to any extremity they perhaps would make him their prince he was very importunate with them to give him the same command in the city that he had over their army as he pretended he could not otherwise either require or expect that necessary obedience which was due to a general not being gratified he trifled and delayed till he was attacked and defeated with great slaughter and the loss of his own life receiving that punishment from the hands of fortune which his ambition and perfidy had merited from the florentines the havoc the depredations imprisonments burnings and every other kind of devastation made by castruccio upon the florentines after this victory forced them to offer their government to charles duke of calabria son of king robert upon condition that he would defend them for as that family had been used to rule over them they chose rather to shelter themselves under him as their prince than to trust him as an ally but charles being engaged in the wars of sicily sent gaultier a frenchman and duke of athens as his lieutenant who newmodelled    the magistracy as he thought fit his behavior at first was in appearance so modest and temperate that he gained the affections of every one charles then came in person with a thousand horse and his presence gave some check to castruccio and prevented him from roving and plundering the country as he had done but if the citizens saved any thing abroad it was lost again at home and when their enemies were curbed they became a prey to the insolence and oppression of their friends as the signori were entirely under the influence of the duke of athens he exacted four hundred thousand florins from the city in one year though it was expressly stipulated in the agreement made with him that he should not raise above two hundred thousand in the whole besides which either charles or his father was continually laying some heavy tax or other upon the citizens these miseries were still increased by new jealousies fresh enemies and more extensive wars in which all the neighboring powers were involved till suddenly castruccio and charles duke of calabria and lord of florence both died the florentines unexpectedly delivered from the oppression of one and dread of the other and having once more recovered their liberty began to reform the commonwealth they abrogated the ordinances of all former councils and created two new ones one of which consisted of three hundred of the commons and the other of two hundred and fifty of both commoners and nobility the former was called the council of the people and the latter the common council after the death of castruccio till the year    0 the florentines continued wholly intent upon their affairs and wars abroad in that year new disturbances arose at home the governors of the city had two ways of maintaining and increasing their authority one was by managing the imborsations in such a manner as always to secure the signory either to themselves or their creatures the other by getting judges chosen who they knew would be favorable to them in their sentences and how is it possible in any simple government to prevent such management to draw all the legislative executive and judicial power into one centre and that centre a junto of aristocratics but in this case— not content with two judges the governors sometimes constituted    a third whom they called captain of the guards with which office they now vested jacopo dagobbio and gave him an absolute power over the citizens this jacopo under the direction of the governors behaved with the most shameless insolence and partiality daily injuring or affronting somebody or other some who were nobly born and men of high spirit were provoked to such a degree that a stranger should be introduced into the city by a few of their fellowcitizens who had the power in their hands on purpose to insult and abuse all the rest that they entered into a conspiracy with many other noble families and some of the commoners that were disgusted at so tyrannical a government to revenge themselves hence a conspiracy that again involved the city in blood by artifice and force together the signori prevailed and suppressed the conspiracy beheading some and proclaiming several other families rebels however it did not satiate the revenge of those in administration to have conquered and suppressed those families but like almost all other men whose insolence commonly increases with their power they grew more imperious and arbitrary as they grew stronger for though they had only one captain of the guards to tyrannize over the city before they now appointed another to reside in the country and vested him with very great authority so that any one who was in the least obnoxious to government could not live quietly either within the city or without it the nobility in particular were daily abused and insulted by them in such a manner that they only waited for an opportunity to revenge themselves at any rate and as one soon happened they did not fail to take advantage of it the florentines had purchased lucca but defeated in securing the possession of it they carried on a war to recover it after a long struggle they were driven out of it with much dishonor and the loss of all their purchasemoney this disaster as it usually happens in like cases threw the people of florence into such a rage against their governors that they publicly insulted and upbraided them with their ill conduct and administration in all places and upon every opportunity in the beginning of the war the management of it had been committed to twenty citizens who appointed malatesta de rimini    commanderinchief of their forces in that expedition but as he executed that charge with little courage and less discretion they solicited robert king of naples for supplies which he accordingly sent them under the command of gaultier duke of athens who as the evil destiny of the city would have it arrived there just when the enterprise against lucca had miscarried the duke arrived at this time and the governors being in great fear of the multitude made him conservator of the peace and commanderinchief that he might have both authority and power enough to defend them  imagining there was no other way left to get the better of the people who had so long domineered over them than to reduce them into subjection to a prince who being well acquainted with the worth and generosity of the nobility and the insolence of the commons might treat both parties according to their deserts the nobility now resolved to take their revenge even though it should occasion the destruction of the city they had many private meetings to persuade the duke to take the government wholly into his hands and promised to support him with all their interest and power several of the most considerable commoners joined them particularly the families of the peruzzi acciaivoli antellesi and buonaccorsi such encouragement and so fair an opportunity inflamed the duke who was naturally ambitious with a still greater thirst of power and in order to ingratiate himself with the lower sort of people by acting like a just and upright magistrate he ordered a process to be commenced against those that had been entrusted with the management of the late war against the lucchese in consequence of which giovanni demedici and two more were put to death several others banished and many obliged to pay large sums of money for their pardon this severe manner of proceeding alarmed the middle sort of citizens though it was very grateful to the nobility and common people as the latter generally delight in evil and the former were not a little rejoiced at the fall of those by whom they had been so grievously oppressed so that whenever the duke passed through the streets they resounded    with acclamations and praises of his justice and resolution while every one exhorted him to persevere in his endeavors to detect the guilty and to bring them to condign punishment notwithstanding the expostulations of the signori in an assembly of all the people the government was given to the duke for life and he was carried about in a chair amidst the acclamations of the multitude the standard of the city was torn to pieces and the dukes planted in its stead at which all the good citizens were infinitely grieved and mortified whilst those who either out of malice or stupidity had consented to this election did not a little rejoice machiavels next task is to give us a detail of the dukes tyrannical behavior which was as wild cruel and mad as all other tyrannies have been which were created on the ruins of a republic the duke perceived the general odium he had incurred but affected to think himself extremely beloved he was informed of a plot against him in which the family of the medici and others were concerned but he ordered the informer to be put to death he cut out the tongue of bettoni for complaining of heavy taxes c his outrages were sufficient to rouse the florentines who neither knew how to value their liberty nor to endure slavery says machiavel but the truth is they had no liberty to value and nothing but slavery to endure their constitution was no protection of right their laws never governed they were slaves to every freak and passion every party and faction every aspiring or disappointed noble sometimes to the pope sometimes to the king of naples sometimes to lando sometimes to one nobleman sometimes to another sometimes to their own signori and sometimes to their captains of arts if the word republic must be used to signify every government in which more than one man has a share it is true this must be called by that name but a republic and a free government may be different things there were now three conspiracies on foot against the duke at once but each conspiracy was a new system of tyranny and aimed only at introducing one system instead of another instead of any concert or reasonable combination to take down a bad government and set up a good one the three natural divisions of society formed three different plots to set up a new tyranny each in its own way the nobility had one plot the    commons another and the artificers a third what ideas of the rights of mankind must these people have entertained the commons had been deprived of the government and they had no idea that the nobility or artisans had any rights the nobility were not restored to the government which was all they wanted and the artisans had lost their business but none of these orders could communicate with the others assassination of the duke seems to have been all the object in view as if that would remedy all the evils the plots however were too freely communicated and at last were told to the duke in      the city was all in a tumult and liberty liberty was the cry a war was carried on in the city and each party changed sides several times but after long distractions and much bloodshed and devastation the duke was blocked up in the palace and the citizens assembled to reform the government fourteen persons one half of them of the nobility and the other commoners with the archbishop had full power given them to newmodel the state the judicial department was committed to six magistrates who were to administer justice till the arrival of the person who should be chosen to fill that office greater certainly says machiavel and more cruel is the resentment of the people when they have recovered their liberty than when they are acting in defence of it and an instance of brutal ferocity happened here that is a disgrace to human nature the people insisted upon some persons being delivered up to them and among them a father and son when these were brought out and delivered up to thousands of their enemies and though the son was not eighteen yet neither his youth or innocence nor the gracefulness of his person was sufficient to protect him from the rage of the multitude many who could not get near enough to reach them whilst they were alive thrust their swords into them after they were dead and not content with this they tore their carcasses to pieces with their nails and teeth that so all their senses might be glutted with revenge and after they had feasted their ears with their groans their eyes with their wounds and their touch with tearing the flesh off their bones as if all this was not enough the taste likewise must have its share and be gratified     this is machiavels description of this savage barbarity and his words are here preserved that it may be seen and considered that human nature is the same in a mob as upon a throne and that unbridled passions are at least as brutal and diabolical and unlimited power as tyrannical in a mob as in a monarch or senate they are worse for there is always a number among them who are under less restraints of shame and decency when the people were thus satiated with blood the duke and his friends were suffered to withdraw with their effects unmolested out of florence after some disputes between the nobility and people it was agreed that one third of the signori and one half of the other magistrates and other officers of state should consist of the nobility the city was divided into six parts each of which chose one of the signori and though it sometimes happened that their number was increased to twelve or thirteen yet they were afterwards again reduced to six but as these six parts were not duly proportioned and they designed to give more power and authority to the nobility it was necessary to make a new regulation in this point and to increase the number of signori they divided the city therefore into quarters and chose three of the signori out of each the standardbearer of justice and those of the several companies were laid aside and instead of the twelve buoni hommi they created eight counsellors four of each quality the commonwealth says machiavel being settled upon this bottom might have continued quiet and happy if the nobility could have been content to confine themselves within the bounds of that moderation which is requisite in all republican governments it is impossible to read these grave reflections of machiavel and nedham so often repeated with patience it would be as wise to say that the nation might be quiet and happy under a despot or monarch if the despot or monarch and his ministers and minions could be content and moderate or that the commonwealth might be happy under an oligarchy or simple aristocracy  0 if all concerned in government could be content and moderate when we know human nature to be utterly incapable of this content why should we suppose it human nature is querulous and discontented wherever it appears and almost all the happiness it is capable of arises from this discontented humor it is action not rest that constitutes our pleasure all we have to do is to guard and provide against this quality we cannot eradicate it but the behavior of the nobility was quite the contrary says machiavel for as they always disdained the thoughts of equality even when they lived a private life so now they were in the magistracy they thought to domineer over the whole city and every day produced fresh instances of their pride and arrogance which exceedingly galled the people when they saw they had deposed one tyrant only to make room for a thousand all this one may safely believe to be exactly true but what then why they ought to have separated the nobles from the commons and made each independent on the other mixed together in equal halves the nobles will forever tyrannize the insolence of one side and the indignation and impatience of the other at last increased to such a height that both sides flew to arms and the people being most numerous carried their point and deprived the nobles in the signory of their authority the four counsellors of their order were also turned out of their offices and the remaining number increased to twelve which consisted of commoners only besides which the eight who remained in the signory not only made a new standardbearer of justice and sixteen other standardbearers over the companies of the people but modelled all the councils in such a manner that the government was now entirely in the hands of the people and we shall soon see how well it operated there happened a great dearth in florence so that there were grievous discontents both among the nobility and common people the former repining at the loss of their authority and the latter murmuring for want of bread andrea strozzi sold corn as cheap as mælius did in rome this drew such numbers to his house that he boldly mounted his horse one morning and putting himself at the head of them called upon all the rest of the people to take up arms by which means he got together above four thousand men in less than an hour and conducting    them to the palace of the signori demanded the doors to be thrown open to him this attempt was too bold and rash to succeed yet it gave the nobility fresh hopes of recovering their power now they saw the inferior sort of people so incensed against the commons they resolved to take arms and make use of all manner of allies to regain that by force which they conceived had been taken from them with so much injustice and to insure success they provided themselves with arms fortified their houses and sent to their friends in lombardy for supplies the commons and the signori on the other hand were no less busy in arming themselves and sent to the sienese and perugians to desire their assistance so that when the auxiliaries on each side arrived the whole city was soon in arms we ought to pause here and remark a combination of parties that is perfectly natural though it has seldom occurred in the history of any nation so distinctly as to be descanted on by historians or politicians here is as distinct a division between the commons and the lower class as there ever was between nobles and commons by the commons in this place are meant those citizens who in every nation of the world are commonly denominated the middling people who it must be confessed have been in all ages and countries the most industrious and frugal and every way the most virtuous part of the community in all countries they have some influence in many they have had some share in the government but no other instance than this is at present recollected where they have ever had a sovereignty in their hands exclusive both of the highest and lowest classes of citizens as if it had been the intention of providence to exhibit to mankind a demonstration that power has the same effects upon all minds we find in this instance the florentine commons discovering the same disposition to tyrannize over all above and all below them as clearly as ever kings nobles or mobs discovered it when they had the power the nobility drew up in three divisions the commons assembled under the standard of justice and the colors of their respective companies and under the command of the medici immediately attacked one of the divisions of the nobility at this time the medici were only commoners we shall hereafter see that they became nobles and sovereigns and placed sons and daughters on some of the thrones of europe the action was hot and bloody for three    hours during which they had great stones tumbled down upon their heads from the tops of the houses and were terribly galled with crossbows below all parties behaved with an obstinate bravery that would have done honor to any good cause but it is unnecessary to relate all the attacks and defences and all the vicissitudes of fortune in the course of the civil war the numbers of the commoners finally prevailed upon which says machiavel the people especially the inferior sort of them naturally rapacious and greedy of spoil began to plunder the houses of the nobility which they afterwards burnt down to the ground and committed such other outrages as the bitterest enemy to the city of florence would have been ashamed of the nobility being in this manner entirely subdued the people took upon them to reform the state and as there were three degrees of them it was ordained that the highest rank should have the nomination of two of the signori the middle sort of three and the lowest of three more and that the standardbearer of justice should be chosen by turns out of all three the old laws were revived and put in execution against the nobility and to reduce them still more effectually many of them were incorporated with the other classes by these means they were brought so low that they became abject and pusillammous and never durst rise any more against the people so that being deprived of their arms and honors their spirit and generosity likewise seemed to be extinguished after this depression of the nobles the plague of which above ninetysix thousand people died in florence and a war with the visconti kept the city in tranquillity for a time but the war being ended new factions sprung up in the city for though the nobility were ruined fortune found other means to raise fresh troubles and dissensions the bitter animosities† which generally happen between the people and nobility from an ambition in the one to command and a reluctance in the other to obey are the natural sources of those calamities that are incident to commonwealths for all other evils that usually disturb their peace are both occasioned and fomented by this contrariety of dispositions it was this that kept rome so long divided this also gave birth to    the factions that sprung up in florence though indeed it produced at last very different effects in the two cities for the division that first arose between the nobility and people of rome terminated with disputes that at florence only with the sword in rome that was effected by a law which in florence could hardly be done by the banishment and death of numbers of its citizens the quarrels of the romans still added to their spirit and military virtue while those of the florentines utterly extinguished them the former destroyed that equality which was at first established and introduced a prodigious disparity among the citizens the latter on the contrary abolished all superiority or difference of rank and put every man upon the same level this diversity of effects must certainly have proceeded from a difference of views the people of rome desired no more than to share with the nobility in the administration of the commonwealth but the people of florence were not only desirous to have the government of the state to themselves but used violent measures and took up arms to exclude their nobles from any part in it and as the desires of the roman people were more moderate their demands seemed not unreasonable to the nobility who therefore complied with them so that after some little bickerings and without coming to an open rupture a law was made by which the people were satisfied at least for a time and the nobles continued in their honors and offices on the other hand the demands of the florentine people were so extravagant and injurious that the nobility took up arms to support their privileges and their quarrels grew to such a height that numbers were either banished or slain before they could be ended and the laws afterwards made were calculated rather for the advantage of the victors than the common good the success of the people of rome made that state more powerful for as they were admitted to govern the commonwealth and to command their armies and provinces equally with the nobility they became inspired with the same virtue and magnanimity and as the city through them grew more publicspirited its power also increased but in florence when the people had subdued the nobility they divested them of all manner of authority and left them no possibility of recovering any part of it except they would entirely conform to their customs and way of living and not only submit to appear but to be    commoners like themselves and this was the reason that induced them to change their arms and vary their titles and the names of their families which was so frequent in those times among the nobility in order to insinuate themselves into the affections of the people so that the military spirit and greatness of soul for which the nobility had been held in such veneration were utterly extinguished and not by any means to be raised in the people where there were no seeds of it by which means florence became every day more abject and pusillanimous and whereas rome at last grew so powerful and wanton by the effect of its virtue that it could not be governed otherwise than by one prince florence was reduced so low that a wise legislator might easily have modelled it and given it what form he pleased the factions between the nobility and the commons which ended in the utter ruin of the former have been already related but peace was not obtained all authority was in one centre the commons and there were other orders of citizens who were not satisfied the same contest therefore continued under a new form and new names they now happened between the commons and plebeians which were only new names in reality for a new nobility and commons the commons now took the place of the nobility and the plebeians that of the commons machiavel is as clear and full for a mixed government as any writer but the noble invention of the negative of an executive upon a legislature in two branches which is the only remedy in contests between nobles and commons seems never to have entered his thoughts and nothing is more entertaining than that mist which is perpetually before eyes so piercing so capable of looking far through the hearts and deeds of men as his for want of that thought there seemed to be no seeds of future dissensions left in florence no seeds not one seed had been eradicated all the seeds that ever existed remained in full vigor the seeds were in the human heart and were as ready to shoot in commons and plebeians as they had been in nobles but the evil destiny of our city and want of good conduct occasioned a new emulation between the families of the albizzi and the ricci which produced as fatal divisions as those between the    buondelmonti and uberti and the other between the cerchi and donati had done before it was no evil destiny peculiar to florence it is common to every city nation village and club the evil destiny is in human nature and if the plebeians had prevailed over the commons as these had done over the nobility some two plebeian families would have appeared upon the stage with all the emulation of the albizzi and ricci to occasion divisions and dissensions seditions and rebellions confiscations and banishments assassinations conflagrations and massacres and all other such good things as appear forever to recommend a simple government in every form  when it is found in experience and appears probable in theory that so simple an invention as a separate executive with power to defend itself is a full remedy against the fatal effects of dissensions between nobles and commons why should we still finally hope that simple governments or mixtures of two ingredients only will produce effects which they never did and we know never can why should the people be still deceived with insinuations that those evils arose from the destiny of a particular city when we know that destiny is common to all mankind betwixt the two families of albizzi and ricci there was a mortal hatred each conspiring the destruction of the other in order to engross the sole management of the commonwealth with less difficulty however they had not as yet taken up    arms or proceeded to open violence on either side but only thwarted each other in council and the execution of their offices a private quarrel happened in the market and a rumor was instantly spread nobody knew by whom that the ricci were going to attack the albizzi and by others it was said that the albizzi were preparing to fall upon the ricci these stories were carried to both parties and occasioned such an uproar throughout the whole city that the magistrates found it very difficult to keep the two families and their friends from coming to a battle in earnest though neither side had intended any such thing as was maliciously reported this disturbance though accidental inflamed the former animosities and determined both sides to strengthen their parties and be upon their guard and since the citizens were reduced to such a degree of equality by the suppression of the nobility that the magistrates were held in greater reverence than ever they had been before each family resolved to avail itself rather of public and ordinary means than of private violence the intrigues of these two families to supplant each other are very curious but as the detail of them is long we shall leave the reader to amuse himself with them at his leisure and come to a speech made to the signori by an eminent citizen when affairs were become so critical and dangerous as to alarm all impartial men the common disease says he magnificent signors of the other cities in italy has invaded ours and is continually eating deeper and deeper into its vitals all our towns for want of due restraint have run into extremes and from liberty degenerated into downright licentiousness making such laws and instituting such governments as were rather calculated to foment and support factions than maintain freedom from this source are derived all the defects and disorders we labor under no friendship or union is to be found among the citizens except betwixt such as are accomplices in some wicked design either against their neighbors or their country all religion and fear of god are utterly extinguished promises and oaths are no further binding than they serve to promote some private advantage and they are resorted to not with any design to observe them but as necessary means to facilitate the perpetration of fraud which is even honored and applauded in proportion to its    success from hence it comes to pass that the most wicked and abandoned wretches are admired as able enterprising men while the innocent and conscientious are laughed at and despised as fools the young men are indolent and effeminate the old lascivious and contemptible without regard to age or sex every place is full of the most licentious brutality for which the laws themselves though good and wholesome are yet so partially executed that they do not afford any remedy this is the real cause of that selfish spirit which now so generally prevails and of that ambition not for true glory but for places which dishonors the possessors hence proceed those fatal animosities those seeds of envy revenge and faction with their usual attendants executions banishments depression of good men and exaltation of the wicked the ringleaders of parties varnish over their pernicious designs with some sacred title for being in reality enemies to all liberty they more effectually destroy it by pretending to defend the rights sometimes of the nobility sometimes of the commons since the fruit which they expect from a victory is not the glory of having delivered their country but the satisfaction of having conquered the opposite party and secured the government of the state to themselves and when once they have obtained that there is no sort of cruelty injustice or rapine that they are not guilty of from thenceforward laws are enacted not for the common good but for private ends war and peace are made and alliances concluded not for the honor of the public but to gratify the humors of particular men our laws our statutes and civil ordinances are made to indulge the caprice or serve the ambition of the conqueror not to promote the true interest of a free people so that one faction is no sooner extinguished than another is lighted up a city that endeavors to support itself by parties instead of laws can never be at peace for when one prevails and is left without opposition it necessarily divides again when the ghibellines were depressed every one thought the guelphs would then have lived in peace and security and yet it was not long before they divided into the factions of the neri and bianchi when the bianchi were reduced new commotions arose sometimes in favor of the exiles sometimes betwixt the    nobility and people and to give that away to others which we could not or would not possess quietly ourselves we first committed our liberties into the hands of king robert then of his brother next of his son and last of all to the mercy of the duke of athens never settling or reposing under any government as people that could neither be satisfied with being free nor submit to live in slavery nay so much was our state inclined to division that rather than acquiesce under the government of a king it meanly prostituted itself to the tyranny of a vile and pitiful agobbian the duke of athens was no sooner expelled but we took up arms again and fought against each other with more rancor and inveteracy than ever till the ancient nobility were entirely subdued and lay at the mercy of the people it was then the general opinion there would be no more factions or troubles in florence since those were humbled whose insupportable pride and ambition had been the chief occasion of them but we now see that pride and ambition which was thought to be utterly extinguished by the fall of the nobility now springs up again among the people who begin to be equally impatient for authority and aspire with the same vehemence to the first offices in the commonwealth it seems the will of heaven that certain families should spring up in all commonwealths to be the pest and ruin of them our city owes its miseries and distractions not merely to one or two but to several of those families first to the buondelmonti and uberti next to the donati and cerchi and now to our shame be it spoken to the ricci and albizzi why may not this commonwealth in spite of former examples to the contrary not only be united but reformed and improved by new laws and constitutions you must not impute the factions of our ancestors to the nature of the men but to the iniquity of the times which being now altered afford this city fair hopes of better fortune and our disorders may be corrected by the institution of wholesome laws by a prudent restraint of ambition by prohibiting such customs as tend to nourish and propagate faction and by substituting others that may conduce to maintain liberty and good civil government this speech although upon the whole it is excellent has several essential mistakes that certain families will spring up in every simple government and in every injudicious mixture of    aristocracy and democracy to be the pest and ruin of them is most certain it is the will of heaven that the happiness of nations as well as that of individuals should depend upon the use of their reason they must therefore provide for themselves constitutions which will restrain the ambition of families without the restraint the ambition cannot be prevented nature has planted it in every human heart the factions of their ancestors ought not to have been imputed to the iniquity of the times for all times and places are so iniquitous those factions grew out of the nature of men under such forms of government and the new form ought to have been so contrived as to produce a remedy for the evil this might have been done for there is a way of making the laws more powerful than any particular persons or families as this advice was conformable to the sentiments of the signori they appointed fiftysix citizens to provide for the safety of the commonwealth but as most people are fitter to preserve good order than to restore it when lost these citizens took more pains to extinguish the present factions than to provide against new ones which was the reason that they succeeded in neither for they not only did not take away the occasion of fresh ones but made one of those that were then subsisting so much more powerful than the other that the commonwealth was in great danger they deprived three of the family of albizzi and as many of the ricci of all share in the magistracy for three years except in such branches of it as were particularly appropriated to the guelph party of which number piero de gli albizzi and uguccione dericci were two these provisions bore much harder upon the ricci than the albizzi for though they were equally stigmatized yet the ricci were the greatest sufferers pietro indeed was excluded from the palace of the signori but he had free admittance into that of the guelphs where his authority was very great and though he and his associates were forward enough in their admonitions  before they became much more  0 forward after this mark of disgrace and new accidents occurred which still more inflamed their resentment gregory xi was pope at that time and residing as his late predecessors had done at avignon he governed italy by legates who being haughty and rapacious had grievously oppressed several of the cities one of these legates being then at bologna took advantage of a scarcity and resolved to make himself master of tuscany this occasioned the war with the pope the florentines entered into a confederacy with galeazzo and all the other states that were at variance with the church after which they appointed eight citizens for the management of it whom they invested with an absolute power of proceeding and disbursing money without control or account this war gave fresh courage to the ricci who in opposition to the albizzi had upon all occasions favored galeazzo and appeared against the church and especially because all the eight were enemies to the guelphs but though they made a vigorous war against the pope they could not defend themselves against the captains and their adherents the envy and indignation with which the guelphs looked upon the eight made them grow so bold and insolent that they often affronted and abused them as well as the rest of the principal citizens the captains were no less arrogant they were even more dreaded than the signori and men went with greater awe and reverence to their houses than to the palace so that all the ambassadors who came to florence were instructed to address themselves to them after the death of the pope the city had no war abroad but was in great confusion at home for on one hand the guelphs were become so audacious that they were no longer supportable and on the other there was no visible way to suppress them it was necessary therefore to take up arms and leave the event to fortune on the side of the guelphs were all the ancient nobility and the greater part of the more powerful citizens on the other were all the inferior sort of people headed by the eight and joined by george scali strozzi the ricci the alberti and the    medici the rest of the multitude as it almost always happened joined with the discontented party the power of their adversaries seemed to the heads of the guelphs to be formidable and their danger great if at any time a signory that was not on their side should attempt to depress them they found the number of persons who had been admonished was so great that they had disobliged most of the citizens and made them their enemies they thought there was no other remedy now they had deprived them of their honors but to banish them out of the city seize upon the palace of the signori and put the government of the state wholly into the hands of their own creatures according to the example of the guelphs their predecessors whose quiet and security were entirely owing to the total expulsion of their enemies but as they differed in opinion about the time of putting their project in execution the eight aware of the trick intended deferred the imborsation and sylvestro the son of alamanno de medici was appointed gonfalonier as he was born of one of the most considerable families of the commoners he could not bear to see the people oppressed by a few grandees with alberti strozzi and scali he secretly prepared a decree by which the laws against the nobility  were to be revived the authority of the captains retrenched and those who had been admonished admitted into the magistracy sylvestro being president and consequently prince of the city for a time caused both a college and council to be called the same morning but his decree was thrown out as an innovation he went away to the council and pretended to resign his office and leave the people to choose another person who might either have more virtue or better fortune than himself upon this such of the council as were in the secret and others who wished for a    change raised a tumult in      at which the signori and the colleges immediately came together seeing their gonfalonier retiring they obliged him partly by their authority and partly by their entreaties to return to the council which was in great confusion many of the principal citizens were threatened and treated with the utmost insolence among the rest carlo strozzi was collared by an artificer and would have been knocked on the head if some of the bystanders had not rescued him but the person who made the greatest disturbance was benedetto de gli alberti who got into one of the windows of the palace and called out to the people to arm upon which the piazza was instantly full of armed men and the colleges were obliged to do that by fear which they would not come into when they were petitioned but whoever intends to make any alteration in a commonwealth and to effect it by raising the multitude will find himself deceived if he thinks he can stop where he will and conduct it as he pleases the design of sylvestro was to quiet and secure the city but the thing took a very different turn for the people were in such a ferment that the shops were shut up the houses barricaded and many removed their goods for security into churches and convents all the companies of the arts assembled and each of them appointed a syndic the signori called the colleges together and were a whole day in consultation with the syndies how to compose the disorders to the satisfaction of all parties but they could not agree the council then to hold out some hopes of satisfaction to the arts and the rest of the people gave a full power which the florentines called a balia to the signori the colleges the eight the captains of the party and the syndics of the arts to reform the state but while they were employed in this some of the inferior companies of the arts at the instigation of certain persons who wanted to revenge the late injuries they had received from the guelphs detached themselves from the rest and went to plundering and burning houses they broke open the jails set the prisoners at liberty and plundered the monasteries and convents the next morning the balìa proceeded to requalify the ammoniti    the admonished though with an injunction not to exercise any function in the magistracy for three years they repealed such laws as had been made by the guelphs to the prejudice of the other citizens and proclaimed rebels many who had incurred the hatred of the public after which the names of the new signori were published and luigi guicciardini was declared their gonfalonier if those who were admonished the ammoniti could have been content the city was in a fair way of being quieted but they thought it hard to wait three years longer before they could enjoy any share in the magistracy the arts assembled again to obtain satisfaction for them and demanded of the signori that for the good and quiet of the city it should be decreed that no citizen for the future should be admonished as a ghibelline who had ever been one of the signori or the college or the captains of the companies or the consuls or syndies of any of the arts and further that a new imborsation should be made of the guelph party and the old one burnt it seldom happens that men who covet the property of others and long for revenge are satisfied with a bare restitution of their own accordingly some who expected to advance their fortunes by exciting commotions† endeavored to persuade the artificers that they could never be safe except many of their enemies were either banished or cut off the city continued in the utmost confusion between the two new parties of commons and plebeians but waving a particular detail the essence of several years miseries may be collected from two speeches one is of luigi guicciardini a standardbearer to the plebeians—the more we grant says he the more shameless and arrogant are your demands if we speak thus to you we do so not to offend but to lead you to reform to which end we are willing that others may say to you what will please whilst our province remains to say that which may do you good tell us on your honor what is there that you can reasonably ask more of us you desired to have the    captains of the party deprived of their authority they have been deprived you insisted that the old imborsation should be burnt and a new one made we consented you wanted to have those reinstated in the magistracy that had been admonished it has been granted at your intercession we pardoned such as had been guilty of burning houses and robbing churches and we banished many of our principal citizens at your instigation to gratify you the grandees are bridled with new laws and every thing done that might give you content where then can we expect your demands will stop or how long will you thus abuse your liberty why will ye suffer your own discords to bring the city into slavery what else can ye expect from your divisions what from the goods ye have already taken or may hereafter take from your fellowcitizens but servitude and poverty the persons you plunder are those whose fortunes and abilities are the defence of the state and if they fail how must it be supported whatever is got that way cannot last long and then ye have nothing to look for but remediless famine and distress these expostulations made some impression and they promised to be good citizens and obedient but a fresh tumult soon arose more dangerous than the former the greater part of the late robberies and other mischiefs had been committed by the rabble and dregs of the people and those of them who had been the most audacious apprehended that when the most material differences were composed they should be called to an account for their crimes and deserted as it always happens by those very persons at whose instigation they had committed them besides which the inferior sort of people had conceived a hatred against the richer citizens and principals of the arts upon a pretence that they had not been rewarded for their past services in proportion to what they deserved to show how divisions grow wherever human nature is without a check it is worth while to be particular here when the city was first divided into arts in the time of charles i there was a proper head or governor appointed over each of them to whose jurisdiction in civil cases every person in the several arts was to be subject these arts or companies as we have said were at first but twelve but afterwards they were increased to twentyone and arrived at such power and authority that in a    few years they wholly engrossed the government of the city and because some were more and others less honorable among them they came by degrees to be distinguished and seven of them were called the greater arts and fourteen the less from this division proceeded the arrogance of the captains of the party for the citizens who had formerly been guelphs to which party those offices were always appropriated had made it a constant rule to favor the greater arts and to discountenance the less and all those who sided with them which chiefly gave occasion to all the tumults we have hitherto made mention of and as in the division of the people into arts and corporations there were many trades in which the meaner sort are usually occupied that were not incorporated into any distinct or particular company of their own but admitted into any of the others as they most approached the nature of their craft it happened that when they were not duly satisfied for their labor or any otherwise oppressed by their masters they had no other head to apply to for redress but the magistrate of that company to which the person belonged that employed them who they commonly thought did not do them justice now of all the companies in the city that of the clothiers had the most of this sort of people depending upon it and being more opulent and powerful than any of the rest it maintained by far the greater part of the multitude the meaner sort of people therefore both of this company and the others were for the causes assigned highly enraged and being also terrified at the apprehension of being punished for their late outrages they had frequent meetings in the night where considering what had happened they represented to each other the danger they were in and to animate and unite them all one of the boldest and most experienced of them harangued his companions in this manner—  if it was now to be debated whether we should take arms to plunder and burn the houses of our fellowcitizens and rob the churches i should be one of those who would think it worthy of great consideration and perhaps be induced to prefer secure poverty to hazardous gain but since arms have been already taken up and much mischief done the first points to be considered are in what manner we may retain them and ward off the penalties we have incurred the whole city is full of    rage and complaints against us the citizens are daily in council and the magistrates frequently assembled assure yourselves they are either preparing snares for us or contriving how to raise forces to destroy us it behoves us therefore to have two objects chiefly in view at these consultations—first how to avoid the punishment for our late actions and in the next place to devise the means of living in a greater degree of liberty and with more satisfaction for the future than we have done hitherto to come off with impunity for our past offences it is necessary to add still more to them to redouble our outrages our robberies and burnings and to do our best to associate numbers for our protection for where many are guilty none are chastised small crimes are punished great ones rewarded and where many suffer few seek revenge a general calamity being always borne with more patience than a particular one to multiply evils is the surest way to procure us a pardon for what has been already done and to obtain the liberty we desire nor is there any difficulty to discourage us the enterprise is easy and the success not to be doubted those who could oppose us are opulent indeed but divided their disunion will give us the victory and their riches when we have got them will maintain it let not the antiquity of their blood nor the meanness of our own with which they so insolently upbraid us frighten you all families having the same original are of equal antiquity and have been made by nature after one fashion let both sides be stripped naked and both will be found alike clothe yourselves in their robes and them in your rags and then you will appear the nobles and they the plebeians for it is poverty alone that makes the real difference betwixt us it fills me with just concern indeed to hear that some of you repent forsooth of what you have done and out of a qualm of conscience resolve to proceed no farther certainly if this be true you are not the men i took you for neither conscience nor the fear of infamy ought to terrify you for those who succeed in their attempts let them have used what means soever are never disgraced and as for conscience we have no reason to give ourselves any trouble about it where the dread of famine and dungeons enters as in our case what greater terror can or should there be in hell  the speech is long and all in the same strain it so inflamed    his audience that they determined to rise and took an oath to stand by each other the signori had secret information of the plot but although they took the best measures in their power the government had not sufficient energy to prevent or suppress the tumult they burnt many houses and committed all sorts of outrages if any one of the plebeians had been injured or affronted by a particular citizen he led the mob directly to his enemys house nay it was sufficient barely to mention the persons name or to call out to such a mans house or to such a mans shop they glutted themselves with mischief and then to crown all they knighted sixtyfour citizens among whom was their favorite sylvestro de medici their levity was very curious for they conferred the honor of knighthood upon some of those very persons whose houses they had burnt down but a few hours before such is the caprice of the multitude and so soon are their disgusts changed into favor and affection the behavior of the signori and the council of the people was such as might be expected from men conscious of having neither dignity nor authority derived from the laws before a law could be passed it was necessary it should have the assent of the common council as well as of the signori it was contrary to established custom for two councils to be held on the same day so that when the signori had agreed it was necessary to wait till next day for the common council to deliberate upon the demands of the mob these demands were extremely grievous and dishonorable to the government one of them in particular that no person that was incorporated into the arts should be compelled to pay any debt under the sum of fifty ducats in two years at which time the principal only should be paid to the creditor and the interest into the bank yet the signori had agreed to them and the common council were the next morning deliberating the multitude naturally voluble and impatient got together again under the palace the law passed but the destruction of the city was not the less expected the signori and counsellors left the palace one by one and the people entered it hæc natura multitudinis est aut servit humiliter aut superbe dominatur when the people entered the palace michael di lando a woolcomber a barefooted ragged fellow carried the standard of justice before them you see my friends said    michael this palace is yours and the city is in your hands what would you have done now they unanimously cried out that he should be their chief magistrate and govern the city as he pleased michael a shrewd fellow more obliged to nature than fortune accepted the government with a design however to compose the city to amuse the people he sent them to search for one nuto the hangman  and immediately issued a proclamation that nobody should dare to burn or plunder any mans house for the future and to enforce the observance of it he ordered a gibbet to be erected in the great piazza the mob soon brought master nuto into the piazza and hung him up by one leg upon the gibbet and as every one tore away a joint or a piece of his flesh in two or three minutes there was nothing left of him but the foot by which he hung michael gallantly newmodelled the state appointed new signori and gave the rents of all the shops upon the old bridge to sylvestro de medici took a good share to himself  and was very liberal to many other citizens who had befriended the plebeians not only out of gratitude for past favors but to engage them to support him in future against envy but the plebeians thought michael had been too partial to some of the principal commoners flew to arms again appointed eight heads over them with other subordinate officers and magistrates so that the city had now two tribunals and was governed by two distinct administrations they took away all honors and emoluments that had been granted to sylvestro de medici and to michael di lando but michael showed himself in valor generosity and prudence far superior to any other citizen and well deserves to be reckoned among those few that have been real benefactors to their country if he had been of an ambitious or selfinterested disposition the republic must have relapsed into a more intolerable degree of servitude than it was under the tyranny of the duke of athens but his integrity would not suffer him to cherish any design that might be prejudicial to the good of the public and his prudence taught him to conduct himself in such a manner as not only gained him the first place and confidence of his own party but enabled him to triumph over that of his    enemies he suppressed this new rebellion against his authority with great address and spirit and those proceedings struck a terror into the plebeians and opened the eyes of the better sort of people who could not help wondering at their own stupidity that after they had suppressed the pride of the nobility they could so patiently submit to be insulted by the very dregs and refuse of the city when michael obtained this complete victory over the plebeians the new signori were already appointed two of whom were of so base and abject condition that every one seemed desirous to be rid of such infamous magistrates as they entered on the magistracy there was an uproar in the piazza which was full of armed men who shouted with one voice no plebeians  in the signori the rest of the signori in order to appease the tumult degraded their two associates and chose two others in their room they likewise dissolved the plebeian companies and deprived all those of their offices who had any connection with them except michael and a few of the best of them they also divided the subordinate magistracy into two separate jurisdictions one of which was to preside over the greater arts and the other over the less for the signori it was only provided in general that five of that body should be drawn out of the less companies and four out of the greater and the standardbearer alternately out of each sylvestro de medici and a few others who had promoted this new regulation became in a manner the chief governors of the city these proceedings and this new model of government revived the old divisions betwixt the more considerable commoners and the lower sort of mechanics which had first been occasioned by the ambition of the ricci and albizzi and because they afterwards produced terrible consequences machiaavel henceforward distinguishes these two factions by the names of the popular and plebeian though this constitution of government lasted but three years it abounded with executions and banishments for as those who were chiefly concerned in the administration well knew there were great numbers of malcontents both within the city and without it they lived in perpetual fear and alarm the  0 disaffected within the walls either actually did or were supposed to cabal daily against the state and those without were continually raising disturbances abroad by the assistance of foreign princes or republics sometimes in one part sometimes in another in such a government the laws are insulted by every party in turn accusations were laid before the magistrates against a number of citizens for corresponding with the exiles at bologna concerning a plot against the city the prisoners were examined and nothing criminal could be proved against them the magistrate was going to acquit and discharge them the people rose in such a ferment of clamor and calumnies that the magistrate was forced to pass sentence of death upon them their execution occasioned fresh murmurs and discontents in the city so that both those who had got the upper hand and those who were depressed lived in continual fear and suspicion of each other dreadful indeed were the consequences which flowed from the apprehension of the former as every little accident furnished them with a handle to trample on their fellowcitizens some of whom they daily put to death or sent into exile they likewise made several new laws to strengthen their hands and keep those down of whom they entertained the least suspicion these suspicions growing stronger and stronger every day made them behave with more rigor to the other party a manner of proceeding that only served to multiply their discontents and to increase instead of allaying their own fears which were not a little heightened by the insolence of georgio scali and tomaso strozzi whose authority was much superior to that of the magistrates and therefore they all stood in awe of those two citizens as they knew it was in their power if they should join the plebeians to turn them entirely out of the administration this intemperate and tyrannical manner of governing began to grow intolerable not only to all good citizens but even to the seditious themselves and it was not possible that the arrogance of scali in particular could be long supported by delivering a friend and tool of his out of the hands of justice by a mob he soon furnished his enemies with a fair opportunity not only of wreaking their own private revenge upon him but of delivering the commonwealth out of his hands and the hands of the plebeians who had so unmercifully tyrannized over it for three years    they engaged in this design benedetto a man of immense fortune very humane strict in his morals and principles a steady friend to the liberties of his country and sufficiently disgusted at the tyrannical proceedings of the government so that it was no difficult matter to engage him in any measures that might contribute to the downfall of scali as the insolence and oppression of the principal commoners had made him their enemy and a friend to the plebeians so when he saw the latter pursuing the very same measures he quickly detached himself from them having brought benedetto and the heads of the arts into their design they seized upon scali and the next day he was beheaded which struck such a terror into his party that not one of them offered to stir in his favor though they crowded in great numbers to see his execution when he came to suffer death in the face of that very people who had so lately worshipped him with a degree of idolatry he could not help complaining of the hardness of his destiny and of the wickedness of those citizens who by their oppressions had forced him to caress a rabble in which he found there was neither honor nor gratitude he bewailed his folly in having trusted to the fidelity of plebeians which he might well have known is ever liable to be shaken and seduced by any little suspicion misrepresentation or blast of envy he told benedetto this is the last day of my misfortunes and the first of yours after him some of his chief confidants were put to death and their bodies dragged through the streets by the people his death threw the whole city into a ferment as the city was full of different humors every one had a separate view and was eager to accomplish it before he laid down his arms the ancient nobility now called grandees could not bear to live any longer without some share in the public honors and exerted their utmost efforts to recover them for which purpose they endeavored to have the captains of the party restored to their former authority the heads of the popular faction and the greater arts were disgusted that the government of the state was shared in common with them by the inferior arts or plebeians the inferior arts instead of giving up any part of their authority were very desirous to increase it and the plebeians were afraid of having their new companies dissolved from these different views    and apprehensions there was nothing to be seen in florence but tumults for a whole year sometimes the grandees sometimes the greater sometimes the lesser arts and sometimes the plebeians were in an uproar and it often happened that they all took arms at the same time in different parts of the city after many mischiefs dangers and troubles and many consultations and conferences a new form of government was established all were recalled who had been banished since sylvestro de medici was standardbearer all offices and appointments conferred in      were abolished the new companies dissolved and reincorporated in their respective arts the inferior arts were not to choose any standardbearer of justice instead of enjoying one half of the public honors they were now limited to one third and those too of the lower rank the popular nobility and the guelphs reassumed their superiority and the plebeians were utterly dispossessed of it after they had held it from      to      but the new administration was no less grievous and oppressive than that of the plebeians had been several of the popular nobility and many of the heads of the plebeians were banished and among the rest michael† whom the remembrance of his former great merit in restraining the fury of the populace when so licentiously plundering the city was not sufficient to protect from the resentment of the governing party from such impolitic proceedings in princes and governors of commonwealths it happens that men naturally growing disgusted with their illtimed severity and ingratitude often incur their displeasure before they are aware of it as such executions and banishments had ever been disapproved of by benedetto he could not help blaming the authors of these upon which the government began to grow jealous of him as a favorer of the plebeian party and one that had consented to the death of scali not out of any real disapprobation of his conduct but that he might the more easily get the reins of government into his own hands they kept a strict watch over him and resolved to ruin him intrigues were soon laid by which benedetto was sent into banishment‡ you see my dear friends said he when he took leave of them in what    manner fortune has contrived my ruin and how she still threatens you at which neither do i wonder nor should you it is the lot of those who endeavor to maintain their integrity among the wicked and who desire to sustain that which more desire to destroy from the same principle of love to my country which once induced me to join sylvestro de medici and afterwards to separate myself from scali i could not forbear censuring the proceedings of those who are now at the helm who having nobody to chastise them are likewise desirous to get rid of every one who dares to reprehend them he preserved his character for piety and humanity abroad and there died his bones were brought back to florence and interred there with the highest honors by those very people who had persecuted him while alive with so much rancor and injustice the family of the alberti were not the only sufferers in these distractions for many other citizens were either admonished or sent into exile the members of this balìa having done what they were deputed for were going to break up as they thought it would have an appearance of modesty but the people hearing of their resolution ran to arms in the palace and insisted that they should banish and admonish several others before they resigned their authority nevertheless to diminish the authority of the plebeians still more the signori made a decree that the third part of the honors which they before enjoyed should be reduced to a fourth and that there might be two at least in the signori always of approved fidelity to the government they gave the gonfalonier and four other citizens authority to make a fresh imborsation and to put the names of a select number of citizens into a particular purse out of which two of every new signory should always be drawn tranquillity now continued till      when giovanni galeazzo viconti commonly called the conte di virtù thought to make himself king of italy by arms as he had made himself    duke of milan by treachery but after making himself master of bologna pisa perugia and siena and preparing to be crowned king of italy at florence he died during the war with the duke maso de gli albizzi was gonfalonier a bitter enemy to the alberti he resolved though benedetto was now dead to be revenged before he went out of office on the rest of that family for pietros unfortunate end he accused the two heads of the family of corresponding with the exiles and took them into custody upon this the whole city was in an uproar the signori called the people together and appointed a new balia by which many citizens besides almost all the alberti were banished and many artificers admonished or put to death and a fresh imborsation of magistrates was made this tyrannical manner of proceeding so enraged the arts and lower sort of people who now saw their lives and honors wantonly taken away that they rose in arms some of them running to the piazza and others to the house of véri de medici who after the death of sylvester was become the head of that family and earnestly entreated him to take the government into his hands and deliver them from the oppression of citizens who were daily endeavoring to destroy the commonwealth and every good man in it antonio de medici was most importunate with him though they had been long at open enmity all writers agree that if véri had been as ambitious as he was virtuous he might have made himself lord of the city but he put himself at the head of the people marched to the piazza and there publicly refused to do any thing unconstitutional but prayed the signori to redress the grievances of the people they highly commended him and promised to give all satisfaction upon these assurances and a reliance on véris word the people returned to their houses as soon as the tumult was composed the signori instead of fulfilling their promises fortified the piazza enrolled two thousand citizens to defend them forbid all others to bear arms put many citizens to death and banished others who had been most active in the late insurrection the few alberti who were left and the medici thought themselves and the people deceived and    were extremely disgusted by these proceedings but the first who had courage to oppose them was donato acciaivoli one of the grandees rather superior to maso albizzi who by the steps he had taken while he was gonfalonier was become in a manner the head of the commonwealth donato endeavored to get those who had been sent into exile recalled and those who had been admonished requalified to hold their former honors and employments he first attempted it by persuasion but not succeeding he threatened to do it by force for this he was cited convicted and banished to barletta alamanno and antonio de medici and all those who were of alamannos family with many of the inferior arts who had any interest among the plebeians were likewise banished all these things happened within two years after maso de gli albizzi had assumed the government in      the exiles at bologna spirited young men among whom was antonio de medici depending upon the peoples rising in their favor determined at all events to return to their country and assassinate maso but either from a terror of the government or prejudice against the exiles the people would not move and the conspirators fled to the church where they were put to death this conspiracy was scarcely quashed when another one still more dangerous of other exiles scattered over lombardy in concert with the duke of milan was discovered but this was defeated and the authors punished then a new balìa was instituted with authority to provide for the safety of the commonwealth by this council six of the ricci six of the alberti two of the medici three of the scali two of the strozzi and many others of lower condition were proclaimed rebels all the rest of the alberti ricci and medici except some very few were rendered incapable of holding any office for ten years one of the alberti only was spared on account of his quiet character antonio but the government was jealous of him and soon found a pretence for banishing him to a distance of three hundred miles from the city and to free the government from the continual apprehensions they lived under of the alberti they banished all that family that were above fifteen years of age these things happened in   00†    in      some of the alberti returned from banishment and another balìa was appointed which made new laws for the security of the state and inflicted other penalties on the family in      ended the war with ladislaus king of naples whose death delivered florence from as much danger as that of the conte di virtù had done the period from      to      is that which is boasted of by machiavel as the prosperous one but the prosperity of which he attributes to the virtues and abilities of maso pisa cortona arezzo leghorn and monte pulciano were added to the dominion all republics especially such as are not well constituted undergo frequent changes in their laws and manner of government and this is not owing to the nature either of liberty or subjection in general as many think but to downright oppression on one hand or unbridled licentiousness on the other  it is very true that most republics have undergone frequent changes in their laws but this has been merely because very few republics have been well constituted it is very true also that there is nothing in the nature of liberty or of obedience which tends to produce such changes on the contrary real liberty and true obedience rather tend to preserve constancy in government it is indeed oppression and license that occasion changes but where the constitution is good the laws govern and prevent oppression as well as license the name of liberty is often nothing more than a specious pretence  made use of both by the instruments of licentiousness who for the most part are commoners and by the promoters of slavery who generally are the nobles each side being equally impatient of restraint and control this is a truth which is proved as well as illustrated by every page of the foregoing history as well as by the history of almost all other republics ancient and modern and the next paragraph shows that machiavel had an accurate idea of the evil though a confused one of the remedy    when it fortunately happens which indeed is very seldom that some wise good and powerful citizen has sufficient authority in the commonwealth to make such laws as may extinguish all jealousies betwixt the nobility and the people or at least so to moderate and restrain them that they shall not be able to produce any bad effect then that state may properly be called free and its constitution looked upon as firm and permanent for being once established upon good laws and institutions it has no further occasion like other states for the virtue of any particular man to support it one would be apt to conjecture from this that machiavel was about to propose a first magistrate armed by the constitution with sufficient authority to mediate at all times between the nobles and commons such a magistrate possessed of the whole executive power with a negative to defend it has always authority to intervene between the nobles and commons and to preserve the energy of the laws to restrain both and whether this executive magistrate is wise and good or not if the commons have the negative upon the purse and the laws and the inquest of grievances abuses and state crimes that executive power can hardly be ill used on such laws and principles many of those ancient commonwealths which so long subsisted were formerly constituted rome and sparta were in some degree constituted upon these principles and in proportion as they conformed to them they were free and happy but neither was perfectly conformed to them for want of them others have often varied their form of government from tyranny to license and from license to tyranny and for want of them such will ever be the vibration for as each of those states always has powerful enemies to contend with it neither is nor can be possible they should be of any long duration and while they last the liberty and happiness of the citizens are constantly sacrificed all good and wise men must of necessity be disgusted at them so much so that if it were not for the chance and hope of obtaining a better constitution after all the changes any man of that character would prefer a simple monarchy at once since much evil may very easily be done in the former and hardly any good in the latter the insolent having too    much authority in one and the ignorant and inexperienced in the other these characters of simple aristocracies and simple democracies which succeed each other so rapidly where the third power is not introduced to control and moderate both the nobles and people are very just and machiavel says what is near the truth both must be upheld by the spirit and fortune of one man alone who yet may either be suddenly taken off by death or overpowered by adversity it is a pity he had not said parties must be upheld together by the constitutional legal authority of one man alone possessed of the whole executive power of the state and then if he is taken off by death another will succeed if he be overpowered by adversity the whole state must be overpowered with him and no form of government can be devised to warrant states against pestilence earthquake and famine the inevitable and irresistible judgments of heaven i say therefore that the model of government which took place in florence after the death of scali in      was at first solely maintained by the conduct of maso de gli albizzi and afterwards by that of niccolò uzzano this is a strong instance of the efficiency of one man so situated as to be able to mediate between the aristocratical and democratical ingredients in society and an argument for providing such an officer by the constitution whose duty and business it shall always be to act the same part nay who shall be necessitated from the principle of selfpreservation and selfdefence to preserve the balance between them the city continued in tranquillity from      to      eight years uzzano and six others had the chief authority those animosities however which were at first kindled in the city by the quarrel betwixt the albizzi and the ricci and afterwards blown up to such height by sylvestro de medici were never extinguished and although that party which had the largest share in the affections of the people continued only three years in the administration and was turned out of it in      yet as they were favored and supported by the greater part of the citizens they could not be totally suppressed the frequent admonitions and continual persecutions that were carried on against the heads of it from      to   00 had indeed brought them very low the alberti and the medici suffered most by these proceedings several of them had their estates confiscated    others were banished or put to death and those who were suffered to continue in the city were deprived of all their honors and employments by which their party was much depressed and almost reduced to nothing they retained however sharp resentments and determined to take revenge though under the present circumstances they thought proper to dissemble this administration composed of the most considerable commoners or popular nobility which had kept the city so long in peace at last were guilty of two errors in point of conduct which proved their ruin as soon as they thought themselves safe from the attempts of the alberti they grew insolent and they quarrelled among themselves two faults that have ever been committed by every single assembly whether of nobles or commons and which ever must be committed by all that are to come amidst their supineness oppressions and divisions the medici recovered their former authority and power the first of this family that began to lift up his head again was giovanni the son of bicci de medici who being a man of great humanity and grown very rich was admitted to a share in the government of the state at which there were such extraordinary rejoicings among the people that many of the graver sort of the citizens were not a little alarmed when they saw the old humors began to show themselves again uzzano represented to his colleagues† that he knew giovanni was a person of much greater influence and abilities than ever sylvestro had been and that it was dangerous to promote a man of so general a reputation to such a degree of power but the rest of the governors envied uzzanos reputation and were glad to avail themselves of any assistance to ruin him so that giovanni was set up as it often happens to pull down uzzano when a popular assembly or a senate have the management of the executive power disputes forever arise concerning every step in foreign affairs and discords and factions have full play thus it happened in florence upon occasion of a negotiation with philip visconti lord of lombardy every faction had a different opinion that however in favor of a war prevailed ten superintendents of the war were appointed soldiers were  0 raised and taxes imposed which occasioned great murmurs in the city the taxes were said to be heavier on the poor than the rich every one exclaimed against the oppression of the governors who had wantonly embroiled the state in an expensive and unnecessary war only to gratify their own private interests and ambition and to establish themselves in their tyranny the majority of the governors at last judged it necessary to declare war notwithstanding that the resolution still met with great opposition especially from giovanni de medici who publicly protested against it and occasioned a multitude of arguments pro and con the war was unfortunate and a battle was lost by the badness of the weather this misfortune occasioned great consternation in florence especially among the governing party who had been its chief promoters they saw the enemy powerful and elated themselves disarmed and without allies and what was worse hated to the last degree by the people who insulted them whenever they appeared in the streets complaining of insupportable taxes and upbraiding them with the heavy expenses of an unnecessary war machiavel enumerates the taunts which fury suggested upon this occasion to an enraged and unbridled multitude the signori called a meeting of the principal citizens and earnestly exhorted them to use their good offices to soothe the people and appease the general indignation which their clamors had excited rinaldo the eldest son of the late maso de gli albizzi having secretly entertained some hopes of becoming sole governor of the republic by the merit of his own services and the reputation of his father made a long speech in justification of the war a commission was given to twenty citizens to raise further supplies for the maintenance of the war who seeing the governing party now humbled took courage and laid the chief burden of the taxes upon their shoulders at which they were not a little mortified in their turn they complained of it as too heavy but when this came to the ears of the council they took effectual care to have it collected and in order to make all impositions appear for the future the more grievous and hateful to the people they gave a strict charge to their officers to collect this with the utmost rigor and to kill any one that should dare to oppose them or refuse to pay it and so many were murdered or wounded that it was apprehended the two parties would come    to blows for those who had been so long in power and used to be treated with such reverence and distinction could not bear the thoughts of being insulted in this manner and the other side were resolved that every man in his turn should equally feel the sting of these oppressions the principal citizens had now many private conferences but giovanni was not there either because he was not invited as a person in whom they could not thoroughly confide or refused to come because he did not approve of such cabals rinaldo de gli albizzi made an harangue he represented how the government had again fallen into the hands of the people from whom their fathers had recovered it in      he reminded them of the tyranny of those who were in the administration from      till that time in which interval either the father or grandfather or some near relation of almost every one who was then present had been unjustly put to death that the city was now going to relapse into the same state of confusion and oppression since the multitude had already taken upon them to impose taxes and if not either curbed by force or restrained by some other expedient they would certainly in the next place proceed to appoint such officers as they thought fit after which they would turn the present magistrates out of their seats to the utter destruction of an administration which had governed the city with so much glory and reputation for fortytwo years the consequence of which would be that florence must either be blindly governed by the caprice of the multitude and then one party would live in continual danger and apprehension while the other rioted in all manner of licentiousness or it must fall under the subjection of some one person who would make himself absolute lord and perhaps tyrant over it as the audaciousness of the multitude was in a great measure owing to the largeness of the imborsations and the little care that was taken in making them which had filled the palace with new and mean men he thought the only remedy for such disorders would be to restore the authority of the nobility and diminish that of the minor arts by reducing them from fourteen to seven this would lessen the power of the plebeians in the councils both by retrenching their number and by throwing more weight into the scale of the grandees who would out of revenge for old injuries be sure to use all possible endeavors to depress them that wise men    always availed themselves of different sorts of people at different seasons and if their fathers had made use of the assistance of the plebeians to humble the insolence of the grandees now the latter were brought so low and the former become so audacious it would be no bad expedient to join with the grandees to lower them uzzano made answer that it might be done if they could draw giovanni de medici into their designs for if he concurred with them the multitude being deprived of their head would not be able to make any opposition rinaldo was deputed to wait upon giovanni and persuade him to join them giovanni replied to him that he had always thought it the duty of a good citizen to endeavor to prevent any change in the established laws by such changes some were turned out and others brought in and the first generally thought themselves more aggrieved than the others benefited by which few friends and many enemies were made mankind being naturally more prone to revenge than gratitude that the citizens of florence generally dealt basely and perfidiously with each other that as soon as the promoters and advisers of this plan had sufficiently depressed the people by the help of his authority they would certainly fall upon him next with the whole force and assistance of the plebeians whose affections he must have lost by such a conduct and then he would be utterly deserted and ruined he could not help remembering the fate of benedetto who at the instigation of such as conspired his destruction consented to the severe proceedings against scali and soon after was sent into exile himself by the very persons who had inveigled him into those measures that for his part he should never agree to have any alterations made in the laws or constitution of his country these deliberations when known still added to the reputation of giovanni and increased the hatred of the people against the other citizens on the contrary alamanno de medici his relation and cosimo his son urged giovanni to take this opportunity of humbling his enemies and exalting his friends reproaching him with his coldness which they said emboldened those who wished him ill to form daily conspiracies against him and would one time or other prove the ruin of all his family and dependents but he was deaf to all their remonstrances and prognostications and determined to pursue his own measures    the designs of the faction were however now plainly discovered and the city began once more to divide itself into factions under such forms of government there can never be an independent judicial power all parties are either courting or threatening or persecuting the judges  there were at this time two presiding under the signori in the supreme court of justice martino who was one of them was of uzzanos party and paolo the other followed that of the medici rinaldo finding giovanni inflexible resolved to turn paolo out of his office as he thought that the court would then be wholly at his devotion but the other side being aware of this were beforehand with him and contrived matters so well that they got paolo continued and martino discharged to the great mortification and prejudice of his party the war lasted from      to      and the citizens were impoverished by taxes personal estate was now to be taxed as well as real this was likely to fall heavily upon the rich upon which account before it passed into a law  it was vehemently opposed by them all except giovanni who publicly expressed his approbation of it so that it was carried against them this tax was regulated by a law made on purpose and not left to the arbitrament of partial or interested persons so that the more powerful citizens were in some measure restrained from oppressing the inferior sort and influencing their votes in the councils as they had been used to do by the threats of taxing them according as they gave their suffrages this tax therefore was very cheerfully submitted to by the generality though highly disgustful to the rich but as it is the nature of mankind to be ever restless and discontented and when they have gained one advantage to be still grasping at a higher the people not satisfied with this equality of taxation established    by the law demanded a retrospect by which it might appear how much less the rich citizens had paid before than they ought to have done by this regulation and by which every one should be made to account for deficiencies this question occasioned very long and ingenious arguments on both sides but giovanni represented to the people the bad consequences of retrospects and with many arguments soothed them till they dropped this demand in      peace was concluded and fresh commotions began in the city on the subject of the new plan of taxation in this juncture giovanni fell sick and calling his two sons cosimo and lorenzo to his bedside he advised them if you would live with safety and comfort be content with such a share in the government as your fellowcitizens confer upon you by which you will avoid envy and danger for it is that which a man arrogates to himself that makes him odious and not what is voluntarily given him he died lamented by the whole city for he was very charitable and compassionate his universal benevolence taught him to love good men and pity the evil he never solicited honors though he obtained the highest he died possessed of immense riches and full of glory and reputation leaving his son cosimo heir to his fortune and fame both which he not only maintained but augmented ambition soon kindled new wars the whole city was divided into little meetings and cabals of all ranks of people the generality of whom were for commencing hostilities against the lucchese among the more considerable citizens who favored this enterprise were all the followers of the medici family those who opposed it were uzzano and his party it seems almost incredible that there should be such a change of opinions in the same citizens on this occasion concerning the expediency of a war and yet those very persons who after a peace that had lasted ten years opposed a war against duke philip which was undertaken in defence of their own liberties now strenuously insisted upon one against lucca to invade the rights of others and at a time too when the city was to the last degree exhausted and impoverished by the heavy expenses of the last from hence we may observe how much more ready mankind are to    usurp the property of others than to defend their own and how much stronger the hope of gain is than the fear of loss the signori assembled the common council where the matter was debated by some of the leading men of the republic in the presence of four hundred and ninetyeight citizens the debate was conducted by rinaldo on one side and uzzano on the other and upon a ballot only ninetyeight were against the war the war was commenced and carried on with all that rapacious avarice and ambition which had begun it and grievous complaints and accusations were brought against astorre and rinaldo for their behavior in it in      niccolò da uzzano died and rinaldo succeeded as head of his family and party rinaldo returned in a rage against the magistrates and presenting himself before the council of war he told them he well knew how difficult and dangerous a thing it was to serve an unbridled people and a divided state since the one was carried away with every rumor the other put a malicious interpretation upon actions that were doubtful and always punished the evil but never rewarded the good so that if a commander succeeded in an expedition he had no praise at all if he was guilty of an error his conduct was censured by the generality but if he miscarried he was sure to be condemned by every one for in the one case his own party would envy his success and in the other his adversaries would not fail to insult him the council endeavored to appease his resentment but gave the command abroad to others the war was conducted afterwards rather unsuccessfully until they came to a battle before the town of lucca and were totally defeated as the expedition had been undertaken almost by general consent the people in the utmost consternation and not knowing where else to turn their rage began to abuse those who had conducted the war since they could not blame those who by their own instigation had first advised it and they revived their old calumnies against rinaldo but the person whom they fell upon with the greatest violence was guicciardini who they said might easily have put an end to the war if he had not been bribed nay they went so far as to charge him with sending a    horseload of money to his own house and particularly mentioned the names both of those that carried and those that received it these clamors and accusations made such a noise that the captain of the people could not help taking cognizance of so public a charge especially as he was importunately called upon so to do by giovannis enemies having cited him therefore to clear himself of this imputation he made his appearance but with much seeming indignation and contempt of their malice and his relations exerted themselves so strenuously for the honor of their family that the captain was obliged to stop all further proceedings against him the insinuation here is very obvious that the judge was bribed in      a general peace was concluded whereby all towns that had been taken by the florentines lucchese and sienese were mutually restored to their former possessors so that the expense of this war was all lost during the course of it the factious humors began to ferment again at home and cosimo began to act with greater spirit in public affairs and with more openness and zeal for the good of his friends than ever his father had done so that those who rejoiced at the death of giovanni were not a little damped at the proceedings of his son cosimo was a man of very great prudence of a sedate and agreeable countenance exceedingly liberal and humane never entering into any measures that would be pernicious to the state or even the party that he opposed but taking all opportunities of doing good to every one and of conciliating to himself the affections of his fellowcitizens by his goodness and generosity so noble an example of benevolence greatly increased the hatred which the public had already conceived against the governing party and at the same time was the best method he thought he could take to enable himself either to live with reputation and security in florence or by the interest he had with the people and even if necessary by force of arms to get the better of any persecution that the malice of his enemies might raise against him there were two citizens who contributed to promote this interest averardo de medici and puccio pucci the one by his boldness and activity the other by his great wisdom and experience which added much reputation to his party indeed the judgment and authority of the latter were so generally    revered that he gave a name to the party which was not called cosimos but puccios party in this divided state of the city the expedition against lucca was undertaken which instead of extinguishing the rage of faction still added fuel to it for though puccios party had promoted and advised a war yet those of the other side were chiefly employed in conducting it as they had greater power in the government and since averardo and his friends could not by any means prevent this they took every opportunity of defaming them and calumniating their actions so that when they met with any misfortune it was not imputed to the superior strength or better management of the enemy but to the misconduct and imprudence of the commissary this was the occasion why the enormities committed by astorre gianni though of themselves very great indeed were still exaggerated it was this sort of treatment that provoked rinaldo to such a degree that he left his command without permission this was the true cause of giovanni guicciardini being cited to appear before the captain of the people from hence proceeded all the charges and complaints that were exhibited against other magistrates and commissaries and whilst those that had any foundation were always aggravated and sometimes supported by downright falsehood the people out of the hatred they bore to them greedily swallowed all whether true or false uzzano and the other heads of that party perfectly well aware of these base artifices had had several private meetings to consider of proper means to prevent the effect of them yet they could not fix upon any expedient it was very dangerous they knew to connive at them and not less to proceed to open violence uzzano himself was averse to any remedies of that kind barbadori seeing they were harassed in this manner with war abroad and faction at home made a visit to uzzano whom he found alone and very thoughtful in his study and as he himself wished to see the ruin of cosimo he left no method untried to prevail upon uzzano to join with rinaldo to drive him out of the city uzzano replied—  common prudence would be sufficient to induce those who advise the expulsion of cosimo to compare their own strength with his our party it seems is now distinguished by the name of the nobility and the other by that of the plebeians remember    the fate of the ancient nobility of this city who at last were utterly suppressed in their contests with the plebeians our party is divided while that of our adversaries is compact and entire neri and nerone two of the chief men in the city have not yet declared themselves and it is uncertain what side they will take several families are divided among themselves and many there are that hate us and favor our adversaries merely out of envy or malice to their own brothers or some other near relations among the sons of maso luca out of hatred to rinaldo is gone over to the other side in the family of the guicciardini pietro the son of luigi is a mortal enemy to his brother giovanni and joins our adversaries tomaso and niccolò soderini openly oppose us out of pique to their uncle francisco so that if we consider the quality of those who constitute their party and of whom our own consists i see no reason why one should be called the nobility in preference to the other if it is because they are followed by the whole body of the plebeians that very circumstance makes them so much superior to us that if ever we come to an open trial of our strength we shall not be able to stand before them and if we still continue in possession of the first places in the commonwealth it is entirely owing to the established credit of an administration which has now supported itself for the space of fifty years but if things should come to extremities and our present weakness be discovered you may depend upon it we should be forced out of the magistracy perhaps to our utter destruction cosimo it is true freely lends money to every one that wants it not only to private people but to the public upon any emergency and to foreigners as well as florentines he is a friend to such as stand in need of protection and sometimes helps to advance an acquaintance to a reputable employment in the commonwealth by the interest which his universal benevolence has gained him among the people what shall we be able to plead in excuse for endeavoring to expel him the city shall we accuse him of being charitable friendly liberal and beloved by every one what law condemns charity liberality and beneficence indeed these virtues are sometimes counterfeited to cajole the vulgar by such as aspire to dominion but they do not appear in that light at present nor is it in our power to make them we have lost our reputation by our late misconduct and a people naturally prone to faction    and corrupted by continual divisions will no longer put any confidence in us or give credit to such accusations if he is banished he will return with more friends and we shall have more enemies if it is intended to put him to death in a judicial manner that can never be effected for as he is rich and the magistracy corrupt he will be sure to escape all punishment but if he is banished or condemned what will the commonwealth gain by that no sooner will it be free from the apprehensions it was under from cosimo but it will be liable to the same from rinaldo for my own part i am one of those who never desire to see one citizen exceed another in authority and if one of these two must seize the reins i know not any reason that should induce me to prefer rinaldo to cosimo i pray god to preserve this city from ever falling under the dominion of any one man but if a time should ever come when our sins shall bring that judgment upon us i pray still more earnestly that we may not become subject to rinaldo the far greater part of the citizens some out of stupidity and others out of malice are thoroughly disposed to sell their country and fortune has been so favorable to them as to provide a purchaser live quietly then and as to any invasion of our liberties be assured you have as much to apprehend from our own party as the other  this speech contains a volume of instruction the situation of such a government where there are two parties and no third power to balance them is admirably described neri and nerone who were yet neuters are looked up to as capable when they please of overturning the balance and effecting a revolution family quarrels are resorted to and inflamed in order to make different branches take different sides though one party is called patrician and the other plebeian so many individuals of each desert their colors and go over to the enemy that it is impossible to say which party is really the patrician and which the plebeian timid and irresolute to the last degree the government dares not disoblige an individual even by punishing a crime the government really esteeming its enemies more than its own members and opposition approving members of government more than their own associates all parties endeavoring to get an influence over the judges as essential to their existence the judicial power unavoidably corrupted—it was easy for uzzano to say and perhaps sincerely  0 that he never desired to see one citizen exceed another in influence but according to machiavel the existence of the government had long depended upon the superior authority of uzzano himself and no better plan of liberty than this deplorable one of florence can ever be preserved without some one citizen legally vested with authority to control each in turn of the contending parties uzzano died in      and all restraint was at an end rinaldo now was head of the party and was continually teazing and importuning such citizens as he thought likely to be judges that is standardbearers of justice to take arms and deliver their country out of the hands of cosimo who taking advantage of the stupidity of some and the malice of others would certainly enslave it thus rinaldo by endeavoring to supplant his adversaries and they to support themselves kept the whole city in continual alarm and suspicion so that when new magistrates were appointed it was presently known how many there were on one side and how many on the other and at the imborsations for the signori there was nothing to be seen but tumult and uproar every trifling affair that was brought before the magistracy created a division all secrets were divulged they had no regard to justice the good and the evil were treated alike and there was not so much as one magistrate that did his duty rinaldo impatient to lower the authority of cosimo intrigued to get bernardo guadagni drawn for standardbearer and succeeded he went to congratulate him and told him how much the nobility were rejoiced to see him in possession of that dignity represented to him the danger they were in from their divisions and that the surest way to restore union among them was to rid themselves of cosimo bernardo answered he was fully convinced of the expediency and necessity of what he had urged and desired him to prepare their friends to take arms bernardo then summoned cosimo to appear before the signori the signori assembled the people and appointed a balia consisting of two hundred citizens to reform the state and the first thing debated was whether cosimo should be put    to death or not some argued for it others thought banishment sufficient and many sat silent cosimo was committed prisoner to federigo malavolti in the turret of the palace from this place he could hear the clamors of the armed men who were below in the piazza and frequent outcries for a balia which made him apprehend that his life was in danger but much more that his particular enemies would take some extravagant method to despatch him for that reason he would eat no meat for the space of four days except a mouthful or two of bread federigo observing this bid him take courage and eat his meat and keep himself alive for the good of his friends and his country and that you may have no more suspicion says he i will eat with you cosimo embraced him with tears in his eyes acknowledging his generosity and assuring him he would amply recompense his kindness if ever fortune should put it in his power to show his gratitude federigo invited farganaccio a friend of the standardbearer to sup with him cosimo after many fair words and promises gave his guest a draught upon his banker for eleven hundred ducats desiring him to keep one hundred himself and present the other thousand to the standardbearer this he willingly undertook to perform and gave the money to bernardo who then began to grow cooler and more moderate in the prosecution so that after all cosimo was only banished to padua though rinaldo used his utmost endeavors to have him put to death averardo de medici and many others of that family were likewise banished at the same time and with them puccio and giovanni pucci cosimo was brought before the signori   october      who pronounced the sentence of banishment upon him he received the sentence with a cheerful countenance saying that in what part of the world soever he should sojourn his person and fortune should ever be at the service of the republic the people and the signori the standardbearer told him he would take care that his life should be in no danger and having conducted him to his own house to sup with him ordered a party of the guards to escort him to the confines of the florentine dominions wherever he came he was received with great honor and publicly visited by the venetians who treated him not as an    exile but as a person of the first rank and consequence in the state florence being thus deprived of so great a man and so universally beloved rinaldo saw a storm arising and advised his friends to collect their strength and fortify themselves that so when their enemies should rise upon them which was daily to be expected they might be able to clear the city of them by dint of force since it seemed they could not do it in a judicial manner that they must regain the affections of the grandees by restoring them to their honors and authority he was answered that the insolence and tyranny of the grandees always had been and always would be insupportable and that it would be madness to run headlong into a certain and slavish subjection to them when the danger that was apprehended from the plebeians might only be imaginary rinaldo seeing his advice rejected could not help lamenting the misfortunes that he foresaw were going to fall upon himself and his party but he modestly imputed them rather to the malevolence of their destiny than to the blindness and perverseness of men but both rinaldo and machiavel would have been much better advised if they had imputed all these evils to their true cause an imperfect and unbalanced constitution of government rather than to destiny or the perverseness of men in such a form of government destiny itself without a miracle cannot prevent the blindness and perverseness of men those who see the clearest are forced to shut their eyes and those who are most upright are compelled to be perverse letters were soon intercepted from agnolo to cosimo advising him to stir up a war from some quarter or another and to make neri his friend as he thought then the people would be in want of money to carry it on agnolo was banished which did not however restrain the ardor of those who favored cosimo it was now almost a year since cosimo had been banished at the end of august niccolò di cocco was drawn standardbearer for the two next months and with him eight new signors all cosimos friends at which rinaldo and his party were alarmed rinaldo was for taking arms and obliging the standardbearer    to assemble the people in the piazza to appoint another balia and depose the new signori he would get others drawn more fit for their purpose by burning the old imborsation and making a fresh one in which the purses might be filled only with the names of their friends strozzi a man of a peaceable and humane disposition and given to study rather than to faction opposed it and it was resolved to let the new signori enter peaceably upon the magistracy having been created by cosimos party they no sooner took possession of the palace than the standardbearer began his office by an action which was to give him reputation and strike a damp into such as might think of opposing him he immediately committed his predecessor to prison upon pretence that he had embezzled the public money after which he began to sound his associates about cosimos return finding them well disposed to it he communicated their design to those who were reputed heads of the medici party who all encouraged him to attempt it he then cited rinaldo and others the principals of the other party to appear before him who instead of obeying him flew to arms but their party was irresolute lost its opportunity and gave time to the signori to provide for their defence the signori sent to acquaint rinaldo and those who were with him that they could not conceive what was the cause of such a commotion that if it was upon cosimos account they could assure them they had no thought of recalling him these promises however made but little impression on rinaldo who said he would take care of himself by turning them all out of their offices but it seldom happens that any design succeeds where the authority of the conductors is equal and their opinions different ridolfo replied that for his part he desired nothing more than that cosimo might not be suffered to return so that all hope of success being defeated by the delay of rinaldo the pusillanimity of strozzi and the desertion of ridolfo peruzzi the rest of the party began to lose their spirits and grow cool pope eugenius iv driven out of rome by the people was then at florence and interposed his mediation till he persuaded the party to lay down their arms as soon as the signori saw their adversaries disarmed they began to treat with them through the mediation of the pope at the same time they sent privately into    the mountains of pistoia for a body of footsoldiers which being joined by all the horse they had in the adjacent territories were brought into florence by night having taken possession of all the passes and strong places in the city they called the people together in the piazza before the palace and appointed a new balia which at their first meeting recalled cosimo and all the other citizens who had been banished with him on the other hand they not only sent rinaldo peruzzi barbadori and strozzi into banishment but such numbers of others that most parts of italy and some other countries were crowded with them to the great impoverishment of florence both in regard to its wealth its inhabitants its trade and manufactures but the pope seeing that party which upon his assurances and intercession had consented to lay down their arms entirely ruined and dissipated was exceedingly enraged as well as rinaldo the latter however affected to say it would give him no great regret to be banished a city where private men had more authority than the laws cosimo having notice immediately repaired to florence it has seldom happened that any commander though returning in triumph from victory has been received with such acclamations and universal joy as cosimo was by his fellowcitizens who ran in multitudes to meet him and saluted him with one voice the benefactor of the people and the father of his country machiavel begins his fifth book as if he supposed his reader convinced that the commonwealth of florence had expired and an absolute sovereignty in cosimo had commenced by grave reflections upon the changes that are incident to all governments they often degenerate into anarchy and confusion and from thence emerge again to good order and regularity for since it is ordained by providence that there should be a continual ebb and flow in the things of this world as soon as they arrive at their utmost perfection and can ascend no higher they must of necessity decline and on the other hand when they have fallen    through any disorder to the lowest degree that is possible and can sink no lower they begin to rise again and thus there is a constant succession of prosperity and adversity in all human affairs virtue is the mother of peace peace produces idleness idleness contention and misrule and from thence proceed ruin and confusion this occasions reformation and better laws good laws make men virtuous and public virtue is always attended with glory and success at the return of cosimo those citizens who had been his chief friends and some others who had been injured and oppressed by the late administration were determined at all events to take the government of the state into their own hands the signori therefore who were drawn for the two ensuing months of november and december not content with what their predecessors had already done in favor of their party prolonged the term changed the residence of several who had been banished and sent numbers of others into exile and this was done not only out of party rage but likewise on account of their riches alliances and private connections so that this proscription except in the article of bloodshed might in some measure be compared to that under sylla and octavius there were however some executions for antonio the son of bernardo was beheaded and four other citizens having left the place to which they had been banished and gone to reside at venice were secured by the venetians who set a greater value upon cosimos friendship than their own reputation and sent prisoners to florence where they were put to death in an ignominious manner these examples greatly increased the strength of cosimos party and struck a terror into that of his enemies when they had thus cleared the city of their enemies and such as they thought disaffected to their government they began to strengthen their hands by caressing and heaping favors upon others for this purpose they recalled the family of the alberti and all the rest of the exiles that had been formerly banished they reduced the grandees except some very few to the rank of commoners and divided among themselves the possessions of those whom they had banished after this they fortified themselves with new laws and ordinances and made a fresh imborsation taking the names of all suspected persons out of the purses and filling them up with those of their own friends they likewise took    care that such magistrates as had the power of life and death entrusted to them should always be chosen out of the most eminent of their party for which purpose they ordained that the syndics who inspected the imborsations in conjunction with the old signori should have the power of appointing the new they left the cognizance of capital offences to the eight wardens and enacted that no exile should return even after the term of his banishment was expired till he had obtained the consent of the signori and thirtyfour of the colleges though the whole number of them amounted to no more than thirtyseven all persons were prohibited to write or receive any letters from them every word or sign or gesture that displeased the governors was punished with the utmost severity and if there was any suspected person left in florence who had not fallen under their lash for such offences they took care to load him severely with new taxes and impositions so that one part of their adversaries being driven out of the city and the other depressed and overawed by these means they in a short time secured the government to themselves and to support their power with foreign aid and deprive their enemies of all assistance if they should offer to disturb them they entered into a defensive league with the pope the venetians and the duke of milan cosimo is very tenderly treated by machiavel yet he has impartiality enough to record the tragical story of neri and baldaccio among  those who had the chief authority in the government neri was one of whose reputation cosimo was more jealous than of that of any other person as he had not only very great credit in the city but was exceedingly beloved by the soldiery whose affections he had gained by his bravery humanity and good conduct when he commanded the troops of the republic as he had done upon several occasions besides which the remembrance of the victories that had been gained by him and his father one of whom had taken pisa and the other defeated piccinino at the battle of anghiari made him respected by many and feared by others who did not desire any more associates in the government but of all their generals baldaccio d anghiari was certainly    the most eminent nor was there any man at that time in italy who surpassed him either in courage or military skill or bodily accomplishments and having always commanded the infantry they had such an opinion of him that it was generally believed he could influence them to execute any purpose and that they would follow him in any undertaking whatsoever this baldaccio was very intimate with neri for whom he had the highest esteem on account of his valor and other good qualities of which he had long been a witness but it was a connection that excited infinite jealousy among the rest of the principal citizens who thinking it dangerous to let him enjoy his liberty and still more so to imprison him resolved to have him despatched in which fortune seemed to second their design it is very provoking to read these continual imputations to fortune made by machiavel of events which he knew very well were the effects of secret intrigue for there is no doubt it had been previously concerted to get bartolomeo orlandini appointed standardbearer of justice who having been sent to defend the pass of marradi when piccinino invaded tuscany had shamefully deserted it and abandoned all that country from the nature of its situation of itself almost inaccessible to the fury of the enemy so flagrant a piece of cowardice provoked baldaccio to such a degree that he could not help expressing his contempt of him both in public conversation and in letters which he wrote to his friends in terms that not only excited orlandinis resentment but made him thirst for revenge and flatter himself that he should extinguish the infamy of the fact by the death of his accuser to this resolution some other citizens the medici were privy who encouraged him in it and said that by so doing he would sufficiently revenge the injuries which he had suffered himself and at the same time deliver the government from the fear of a man whom it was dangerous to employ and might be their ruin to dismiss orlandini therefore being confirmed in his purpose to assassinate him shut up several armed men in his apartment and the next day when baldaccio came to attend at the palace as he did most days to confer with the magistracy concerning the pay of his soldiers he was ordered to wait on the standardbearer immediately which he did without suspecting any danger as soon as they met and had taken a turn or two in the gallery    which is before the chambers of the signori they began to talk about their affairs and at last coming near the door of the apartment where the armed men were concealed the standardbearer gave them a signal upon which they instantly rushed out and as baldaccio had neither arms nor attendants they soon despatched him and threw him out of the palace window from whence he was carried into the piazza and after they had cut off his head his body was exposed all day as a spectacle to the people this tragical event gave a considerable check to neris interest and diminished the number of his partisans the governors however did not stop here for as they had been now ten years in the administration and the authority of the balìa was expired many began both to talk and act with much greater freedom than they thought was consistent with the security of the state in order therefore to establish themselves in power they judged it necessary to revive that court by which they would have an opportunity of strengthening the hands of their friends and of more effectually depressing their enemies with this view the councils instituted a new balìa in the year      which confirmed the present magistrates in their respective departments vested the privilege of choosing the signori in a few hands and newmodelled the chancery of reformation deposing the president philip peruzzi and setting another person at the head of it who they were well assured would conform himself to their instructions they likewise prolonged the banishment of such as they had before sent into exile imprisoned giovanni the son of simone vespucci and deprived all those of their honors and employments that adhered to their enemies amongst whom were the sons of piero baroncelli the whole family of the seragli bartolomeo fortini francesco castellani and many others by such means they at the same time regained their former authority and reputation quashed all opposition and got entire possession of the government machiavels introduction to his seventh book according to his custom is full of grave reflections those are much mistaken who think any republican government can continue long united so are they who think that any despotical or monarchical government can continue long united it is as easy to form    and preserve the union of a republican as of a monarchical government and more easy a constitution formed upon the nature of man and providing against his discontented temper instead of trusting to what is not in him his moderation and contentment in power may preserve union harmony and tranquillity better than any despotism republics that trust the content of one assembly or two assemblies are as credulous ignorant and servile as nations that trust the moderation of a single man and it is as true of one as the other ubi solitudinem faciunt pacem appellant differences and divisions for the most part are prejudicial to republics and yet it is certain there are some that are of service to them the same is true of despotisms and monarchies divisions are hurtful for the most part yet some are beneficial those indeed are hurtful that are attended with parties and factions but when that is not the case they tend to the benefit of the commonwealth as it is impossible therefore for any legislator or founder of a republic entirely to prevent feuds and animosities in it it ought to be his chief care to provide against their growing up into factions this is easily done by distinct and independent legislative executive and judicial powers and by two councils in the legislature factions may be infinitely better managed in such a republic than in a despotism or monarchy it must be considered then that there are two roads to popularity in such states the one through public stations the other through private life in the former it is acquired by gaining some signal victory by the prudent and careful discharge of an embassy or by giving wise and successful advice in council in the latter by beneficence to ones fellow citizens by screening them from the magistrates by supplying them with money by promoting them to honors and employments even when they do not deserve them by entertaining the people with plays and spectacles and by distributing largesses among them this manner of proceeding procures followers and partisans and as popularity thus obtained is dangerous to the state because it is commonly applied to serve private and selfinterested views so the reputation that is acquired the other way is of credit and advantage to it when not made a tool to party and faction  0 because it conduces to the good of the whole and though emulation and envy will always spring up even among citizens of the latter sort yet as they have no partisans that follow them for their own private ends they cannot hurt the commonwealth on the contrary they must of necessity be of service to it for this very emulation will naturally excite their utmost endeavors to excel each other in their merits towards their country and make them keep so strict a watch over one anothers actions that none of them will have it in their power to transgress the bounds of good citizens but the divisions in florence constantly ended in factions and therefore were always pernicious to the republic nor did any one of those factions continue united any longer than it had subdued the adverse party for when once that was done and consequently all fear and restraint were at an end it immediately subdivided and split itself into others in truth it is impossible that divisions in any form of simple government should ever end in the public good or in any thing but faction the government itself is a faction and an absolute power in a party which being without fear and restraint is as giddy in one of these forms as in any other de l absolu pouvoir vous ignorez l ivresse it must therefore divide if it is not restrained by another faction when that is the case as soon as the other faction prevails they divide and so on but when the three natural orders in society the high the middle and the low are all represented in the government and constitutionally placed to watch each other and restrain each other mutually by the laws it is then only that an emulation takes place for the public good and divisions turn to the advantage of the nation cosimos party got the upper hand in florence in the year      but as there were still many very powerful men left on the side that was depressed they yet stood in some awe of them and therefore thought proper not only to continue united but to behave themselves with moderation nor were they guilty of any misconduct or oppressive act of consequence enough to draw upon them the hatred of the people so that whenever they had occasion for the suffrages of their fellowcitizens to renew their authority they always found them ready to reestablish the chiefs of their party in any office they desired accordingly from      to      a period of twentyone years they were six times appointed by the general council to fill the balìa    there were in these times two very powerful citizens in florence cosimo and neri the latter of whom had acquired his reputation in the public way so that he had many friends but few followers and partisans cosimo on the other hand having gained his authority both by his public and private behavior had not only many friends but partisans and dependents also and these two continuing strictly united never found any difficulty in obtaining whatsoever they asked from the people as their power was founded upon the favor of the public but neri dying in the year      and the adverse faction being utterly suppressed this administration met with much opposition before they recovered their former authority and chiefly from cosimos friends who being now grown very powerful in the state themselves and freed from all further apprehensions of their enemies were likewise desirous to lower his popularity this jealousy gave beginning to the troubles that broke out in the year      for those who were then the leading men advised their fellowcitizens when they were assembled in the general council to take the state of the commonwealth into consideration not to create any more balìas but to resume the imborsations and to choose their magistrates by lot out of the purses that had been formerly filled to cure them of this frenzy cosimo had no other remedy but either to seize forcibly upon the government by the assistance of such partisans as still adhered to him and to crush all opposition at once or to let things take their course and wait till time should convince his friends that they were laboring only to destroy their own power and reputation and not his he chose the latter expedient for he knew he should run no risk in that as the purses were filled with the names of such as were well affected to him and that he might consequently take the administration into his hands again whenever he pleased he suffered them therefore to proceed to an imborsation but when the new magistracy was drawn and every one thought they had now fully recovered their former liberties the magistrates began to act in their respective departments not according to the dictates and directions of those leaders but as they thought fit themselves so that sometimes the friend of one great man sometimes the creature of another met with an unexpected rebuff and those who before used to see their houses filled with presents and solicitors now had neither substance    sufficient to live upon nor even common servants to attend them they likewise had the mortification to see themselves reduced to a level with such as they had used to look down upon with the highest contempt and disdain and those who before were their equals now suddenly advanced far above them they had neither honor nor respect shown them by any one on the contrary they were insulted and abused wherever they went and everybody made so free with their private characters and public conduct that they soon begun to be aware that it was not cosimo but themselves that had lost their authority cosimo in the mean time took little or no notice of these things but when any thing was deliberated upon that he thought would be agreeable to the people he was the first that promoted the execution of it but what struck the greatest terror into these grandees and gave cosimo a fair opportunity of making them repent of their past behavior was the renewal of the catasto established in       by which the taxes were regulated and proportioned by law and not levied according to the caprice or pleasure of particular men this law therefore being revived and officers appointed to see it executed the grandees having had a consultation together went to wait upon cosimo and entreated him to use his endeavors to deliver both them and himself out of the hands of the plebeians and to newmodel the government in such a manner that they might retrieve the reputation which formerly had made him so powerful and them so much respected to which cosimo made answer that he would do what lay in his power for that purpose with all his heart provided it could be brought about legally and quietly and with the goodwill and approbation of the people but that he never would consent to violent measures or using force of any kind they then endeavored to get a law passed in the councils for a new balìa but finding it would not go down they returned to cosimo and besought him in the humblest manner that he would make use of his interest to get it passed but with this cosimo peremptorily refused to comply being determined to make them fully sensible of their error upon which donato cocchi who was the gonfalonier of justice resolved to set up a balìa without his concurrence but cosimo raised such a spirit    among the rest of the magistrates that they not only opposed him with the utmost vehemence but laughed at him and treated him with so much scorn and derision that it drove him stark mad and he was carried back to his own house raging and frantic luca pitti a bold and resolute man being now made gonfalonier of justice cosimo resolved to leave the management to him so that if any miscarriage should happen or any odium be incurred it might be thrown upon the gonfalonier and not upon him luca was very importunate with the people to appoint a balìa but perceiving it was to no purpose he not only treated those who were members of the councils with great insolence but threatened them and soon after put his threats in execution for having filled the palace with armed men in      he called the people together in the piazza and there compelled them by force of arms† to do that which they would not so much as hear of before after they had thus resumed the government they created a balìa and the new magistrates at the instigation of a few particular persons who advised them to support an authority with terror which they had usurped by force began their administration with sending girolamo machiavelli and some others into exile and depriving many more of their honors and employments but girolamo not observing the bounds that were prescribed to him in his banishment was afterwards declared a rebel and travelling about italy to excite other states to make war upon his own country he was betrayed and apprehended at lunigiana by one of the governors of that place who sent him to florence where he was put to death in prison this administration lasted about eight years and was indeed a very tyrannical and insupportable one for cosimo being now grown so old and infirm that he could not attend to public affairs with his usual assiduity the government fell into the hands of a few insolent and rapacious men who knighted lucca pitti for    the good services he had done the state he had also rich presents made him not only from cosimo and the signori but from all the principal citizens so that he became very rich and built several magnificent palaces and finished them by very arbitrary means extorting more and greater presents from the chief citizens whom he obliged to furnish him with all necessary materials and making the commonalty supply him with workmen and artificers the divisions which arose in cosimos party in      were for some time happily composed by his moderation and prudence but in the beginning of the year      he fell sick and soon after died an event much lamented both by his friends and enemies for those who did not love him for reasons of state seeing their governors so greedy and ravenous while he was alive and that they were only restrained by the reverence they bore to his person from proceeding to open violence began to fear now he was dead that they should be utterly ruined and devoured they had but little hopes in his son piero who though a very worthy man had so weakly a constitution and was yet so raw and inexperienced in matters of government that they thought he would be obliged to comply with the measures of the others and there being no longer any person of sufficient authority left to check their career they would become every day more and more oppressive the loss of cosimo was therefore universally regretted and with great reason for considering he was no soldier he was the most renowned and illustrious citizen that florence or any other republic in the memory of man had produced as he surpassed all others of his time in riches and authority so he far exceeded every one in prudence liberality and magnificence which great and amiable qualities made him the head of his country though he showed a truly royal spirit in his great works and actions and was in fact the sovereign of florence yet so remarkable were his prudence and moderation that he never transgressed those bounds of decency which ought to be observed by a modest republican in his little parties of pleasure in his conversation in his alliances and in every respect he both acted and spoke like any other citizen well knowing that pomp and pageantry and ostentatious    parade are not only of little real service but excite that envy among men which is not incident to such actions as are done with an appearance of modesty and humility no man of his time had a more perfect knowledge of mankind in general in all the various revolutions of so fickle and fluctuating a commonwealth he maintained his authority for the space of thirtyone years for as he was naturally sagacious he foresaw dangers afar off and therefore took timely care to prevent them this great man was born in      the former part of his life was full of troubles and disasters but afterwards fortune was so propitious to him that not only all those who adhered to him in the public administration of the commonwealth were aggrandized and enriched by it but such as negotiated his private affairs abroad as he had factors in almost every part of europe acquired great wealth so that many families in florence raised immense fortunes under his influence and several others owed every thing they had entirely to his advice and assistance he was continually laying out vast sums in churches public buildings and charities of different kinds he was likewise a great patron and benefactor to learned men and first brought argyropulus to florence a grecian by birth and the greatest scholar of his age to instruct the youth of florence in the greek tongue and made him preceptor to his son and nephew this writer dedicated his works to the family of medici namely—his translation of aristotles ethics and physics his own book de regno c cosimo was at the expense of maintaining marcilius ficinus the restorer of the platonic philosophy who translated the works of plato plotinus jamblichus proclus c and he had so great an esteem for him that he gave him a house and estate near his own seat at careggi that he might pursue his studies there with more convenience and entertain him with his conversation at leisure hours so that he had great merit in the resurrection of letters and perhaps in the formation of machiavel himself to whom the world is so much indebted for the revival of reason in matters of government and who appears to have been himself so much indebted to the writings of plato and aristotle indeed if ever the rise of any family to absolute sovereignty upon the ruins of a republic could be pardonable this of the medici which was by real virtues abilities and beneficence must be acknowledged to    be an instance of it but it never can be justified nor ought ever to be excused where there is a possibility of establishing a constitution well balanced and really free and it may well be doubted whether any nation that has once been free can ever become so universally or even generally corrupted as not to be able to conduct a government of three wellbalanced branches he died full of glory and with the highest reputation after his death all the states and princes of christendom sent compliments of condolence to his son pietro and he has this inscription engraved on his tomb by a public decree—the father of his country he appears to have had more merit as well as more art than augustus machiavel is conscious that he shall be suspected of writing a panegyric upon cosimo rather than an historical portrait and not without reason for he was a dependent on the medici family and he has evidently hurried over some and glossed over others of cosimos acts it is scarcely worth while to pursue this history and relate the conspiracies which were formed against piero and the medici or the suppression of them the name of medici had become a charm in the ears of the florentines like that of hercules among the greeks cæsar among the romans orange among the dutch and others without end and if absolute power must be established it was as well in the medici as the pazzi but leo x is not so excusable for not adopting a wiser plan about the time of the death of cosimo louis xi of france was embroiled in a troublesome war raised against him by his barons at the instigation of francis duke of bretagne and charles duke of burgundy which they called the war for the public good it lay so heavy upon him that he could give no further assistance to john duke of anjou in his designs upon genoa and naples hence ferdinand of arragon became king of naples and count sforza duke of milan and lord of genoa and these two having contracted family alliances together began to take all proper measures to establish themselves and their posterity in their governments for this purpose it was judged necessary that the king should in the first place make sure of such of the nobility as had taken part with john of anjou against him in the late wars the king made use of every artifice to    reconcile his nobility to him and at last succeeded for they saw that if they continued in arms against their sovereign they must inevitably be ruined but if they came to an accommodation with him or submitted to his mercy they might obtain a pardon accordingly these noblemen made their submission to him but they were afterwards upon one pretence or other at different times all put to death in      paul the second a venetian was elected pope and the next year sforza duke of milan died and was succeeded by his son galeazzo an event that not only added fuel to the animosities that were rekindling in florence but occasioned them to burst out into a flame for after the death of cosimo his son peter being left heir to his riches and authority thought proper to attach himself to neroni a man of very great power and reputation in the city and of whom cosimo had so great an opinion that upon his deathbed he gave peter a strict charge to consult him and to be guided entirely by his advice in every thing that related either to the management of his own estate or the administration of the public in consequence of this command peter sent for him and having told him how great a confidence his father had reposed in him said he hoped he would assist him both in conducting his private concerns and in the government of the city neroni promised to serve him faithfully but when they came to examine cosimos books they found his affairs in very great confusion neroni therefore who was more influenced by motives of selfinterest and ambition than either by the friendship he had professed for peter or the remembrance of the obligations he lay under to his father thinking he had now a fair opportunity of ruining that reputation and authority to which cosimo left him heir gave him a piece of advice which to all appearance indeed seemed both equitable and necessary but ultimately tended to his destruction he represented to him in how great disorder his affairs were and what large sums of money he would have immediate occasion for if he intended to support his family interest and the reputation they had acquired of opulence and power in the commonwealth and that there could be no relief or expedient so proper as to call in the debts that were owing to him both from foreigners and his fellowcitizens for cosimo out of his natural generosity and in order to establish an influence at home and gain friends abroad had always been    so ready to open his purse to every one who stood in need of his assistance that those debts arose to a prodigious amount to this proposal which seemed but just and reasonable peter consented and like an honest man resolved to make use of his own substance only in that emergency but he had hardly called upon two or three of his debtors before the whole city was in an uproar every one upbraiding him with avarice and ingratitude and loading him with all manner of reproaches and ignominious names as if he had come to plunder them of their own property instead of demanding payment of a lawful debt neroni seeing the general resentment which his own counsel had excited against peter turned his back upon him and entered into a combination with luca pitti soderini and acciaivoli to deprive him of all power and authority in the state the end they all had in view was the same but their motives to pursue it were very different pitti was ambitious to succeed cosimo in the government of the republic and he became so great after his death that he disdained the thoughts of stooping to peter neroni who knew that pitti was not equal to so great a charge thought that if they could by any means get rid of peter the chief power must of necessity in a short time devolve upon him soderini was desirous that the city should enjoy more liberty and be governed by the proper magistrates as it used to be in former times acciaivoli had a particular quarrel with the medici thinking cosimo had not used him well in an award between his son and his wife and not being able to revenge himself upon cosimo he was now determined to do it upon peter however they all availed themselves of the same pretext and said that they neither desired nor aimed at any thing further than that the republic might be governed by lawful magistrates and not by a little junto of particular persons the failure of several merchants about that time still increased the clamor that was raised against peter and gave the people fresh occasion to revile him for they made no scruple of imputing the blame to him and said that the sudden and unexpected calling in of his money had been the occasion of those bankruptcies to the great loss and discredit of the merchants in particular and the prejudice of the whole city besides all which as he was going to marry lorenzo his eldest son to clarissa de gli orsini everybody took occasion from thence to calumniate him publicly declaring    that since he could not think any match in florence good enough for his son it was plain he did not regard them any longer in the light of fellowcitizens but was taking his measures to make himself their sovereign from such a temper in the people these ringleaders of sedition promised themselves certain success especially as the greater part of the citizens were so bewitched with the name of liberty which had been made use of to varnish over those private designs that they cheerfully listed under their banners but while these ill humors were fermenting there were some who out of a real love for their country and abhorrence of civil discord resolved to try if they could not stay them for a while at least by turning the attention of the people upon some more entertaining object considering that an idle populace is generally made use of as a tool to serve the purposes of such as attempt innovation to employ them therefore in such a manner as might best divert their thoughts and prevent them from entering into cabals and conspiracies against the government and at the same time to console them in some measure after their mourning for the loss of cosimo who had now been dead a year these citizens thought it would be no bad expedient to revive the public spectacles with which the people used to be entertained tournaments also were instituted in which lorenzo carried away the prize from all others but as soon as these entertainments were over the citizens returned to their former machinations with more ardor than ever from whence arose great troubles and divisions which were much inflamed by the expiration of the balìa and the death of francis sforza duke of milan galeazzo the new duke sent ambassadors to florence to confirm the treaty of alliance that had been concluded between his father and the republic one article of which was that the florentines should pay that prince a certain yearly subsidy the principal of peters enemies took the opportunity which this demand furnished of publicly opposing him in council and refused to comply with it we may pass over the long though entertaining account of the commotions intrigues and civil war between one party whose object was the ruin of peter and the medici family both in their private affairs and in their public influence and the other who exerted themselves for their preservation the last  00 prevailed and the other was banished and confiscated some of these fled to venice and harangued the senate of that republic into a war against florence and the medici but this war was unsuccessful peace was soon made and the florentine exiles deprived of all hopes of ever returning to their country dispersed into different places tranquillity abroad succeeded but now the florentines were grievously harassed and oppressed at home by the tyranny and ambition of their fellowcitizens for peter was so disabled by his infirmities that he had it not in his power to curb the insolence of his own partisans or to provide any remedy he sent however for the principal of them and sharply reprimanded them it is generally believed that if he had lived he would have recalled the exiles to bridle the tyranny and rapacity of his own friends but death in the fiftythird year of his age put an end to these good designs he left two sons lorenzo and giuliano both very promising soderini was at this time the most considerable among the leading men of the state and for his prudence and authority in great reputation not only in florence but with all the princes of italy so that after the death of peter he had the highest reverence and respect shown him by all the citizens who daily resorted in great numbers to his house and several states and princes addressed their letters to him as head of the commonwealth but as he was a wise man and thoroughly understood his own fortune and likewise that of the medici he modestly declined returning any answer to those letters and gave his fellowcitizens to understand that it was not to him but the medici that they ought to pay their court he assembled the heads of all the chief families in the city and presented to them lorenzo and giuliano and said that if they were desirous to live in peace and union at home and secure from foreign invasions it was necessary to continue their observance to the house of medici and support those young gentlemen in the authority which their ancestors had enjoyed that it was but natural to show the same regard to the family which they had so long been used to do and therefore it must rather be a pleasure than a grievance to them for if mankind were apt to be fond of novelties they were for the most part as soon disgusted with them that it had been found much more easy to maintain a power the envy  0  against which was in a manner extinguished by time than to raise another which must unavoidably be subject to new emulations and speedy ruin from many causes and unforeseen accidents lorenzo too though very young made a speech with much gravity and modesty the citizens before the assembly broke up solemnly engaged to be guardians of their youth and they on the other hand as solemnly promised to reverence them at all times as their protectors and parents after which lorenzo and giuliano were looked upon as the heads of the republic and putting themselves under the guidance and direction of soderini the state seemed to be perfectly composed neither distracted by intestine discords nor embroiled in foreign wars but bernardo de nardi soon found means to excite the ruined families who had been exiled at the fall of luca pitti to kindle another war which was extinguished only by the destruction of the town of prato after this insurrection which was suddenly raised and soon suppressed the citizens of florence began to sink into luxury and effeminacy the youth growing more dissolute than ever they had been before and having nothing else to do threw away their time and estates in dress in feasting in gaming in women and other such dissipations their whole study and emulation was to surpass each other in fine clothes a new war broke out on occasion of a mine of alum discovered at volterra soderini thought a lean peace better than a fat war but lorenzo thinking this a favorable opportunity of distinguishing himself and being supported in his opinion by those who envied the authority of soderini his opinion prevailed and volterra was reduced in      happened the assassination of galeazzo duke of milan and the destruction of the assassins who as usual in such cases were left unsupported both by the nobility and the multitude who had at first encouraged them such examples ought to be warnings to princes to reign in such a manner as to make themselves honored and beloved by their subjects and to others against trusting to nobles or the multitude except in a very good cause for though these may be discontented to the last degree they will seldom stir a foot to their assistance in distress or danger after the medici had gained such an ascendant by the  0  defeat of their enemies in       they grew so powerful that they in a manner engrossed the government of the republic wholly to themselves and their power was so great that such as were disaffected to their administration were either obliged to submit to it with patience or endeavor to shake off the yoke by clandestine machinations and conspiracies which being attended with great difficulties and dangers for the most part end in the ruin of the conspirators and only serve still more to aggrandize and strengthen those against whom they are formed italy was divided into two confederacies the pope and the king of naples were on one side the venetians the duke of milan and the florentines on the other when philip de medici archbishop of pisa died the pope appointed francesco salviati an enemy of the family of medici to succeed him the signori refused to give him possession of the see the medici were discountenanced upon all occasions at the court of rome while the greatest respect and partiality were shown there to the pazzi a family indeed which at that time was one of the richest and most powerful in florence cosimo considering their opulence and quality had married his granddaughter bianca to guglielmo de pazzi in hopes of uniting the two families more strictly and hoping to prevent all jealousies and emulation betwixt them by such an alliance but so vain and fallacious are all human designs that the event proved quite contrary to his expectation for some of lorenzos friends having insinuated to him that it would be dangerous to him and a diminution of his own authority to throw any more power into the hands of that family he would not suffer giacopo nor any of his brothers or nephews to enjoy such honors and offices as they seemed in the opinion of their fellowcitizens to deserve the pazzi were so exasperated at this usage that the medici began to be afraid of them and the apprehensions of the one seemed to increase in proportion to the resentment of the other for in all competitions for places of honor or profit the pazzi how much soever they might be favored by the suffrages of the people were always sure to be set aside and rejected by the magistracy the pazzi therefore thinking it intolerable that people of their rank and fortune should be  0  treated in that injurious manner began to meditate revenge francesco accordingly concerted a conspiracy with many other persons and attempted to assassinate both the medici at church giuliano was murdered with such circumstances of perfidy as would disgrace the most infamous cause much more a cause dignified with the name of liberty lorenzo defended himself with great bravery and escaped with a slight wound the insurgents rode about the town and cried liberty liberty and called upon the people to join them but such was the influence of the medici and so much were they beloved on account of their liberality and other princely qualities that the rest of their fellowcitizens did not desire to see any change of government the whole city was raised and lorenzo safely conducted by a great number of armed men to his own house the palace was recovered by the people and all those who had seized upon it were either taken or killed the streets resounded with shouts of long live the medici while the limbs of the conspirators who had been killed were either carried upon halberds or dragged round the city every one endeavoring to show his resentment both in words and actions against the pazzi for they not only plundered their houses but hurried francesco out of his bed to the palace and there hung him up close by the archbishop and his associates so great was the favor and interest which the family of the medici had gained among the people by their prudence and liberality that there was not a citizen of any degree whatsoever who did not go to lorenzo and make him an offer both of his person and fortune rinato and giacopo de pazzi were both apprehended condemned and executed with so many others that the streets and highways were full of their limbs none of them were much lamented except rinato who had always been esteemed a prudent man and void of that family pride which was laid to the charge of all the rest after the conspiracy was suppressed and the authors of it punished the funeral of giuliano was solemnized with great pomp and attended by all the citizens he left one son born some months after his death and named giulio who was afterwards pope clement vii the pope and the king of naples disappointed in bringing about a change of government in florence by underhand  0  machinations now resolved to attempt it by open war but the good fortune of the family lorenzos address and the steady attachment of the florentines to him carried them safely through this danger too after the quarrels among the more considerable states were composed in the course of several years there happened many other disturbances in romagna la marca dancona and siena they were more frequent in siena than anywhere else after the departure of the duke of calabria in      but after many changes and revolutions there in which sometimes the commonalty and sometimes the nobility prevailed the nobility at last effectually suppressing the other party pandolpho and giacopo petrucci one of whom was in the highest repute for his wisdom and the other for his valor became in a manner princes of that city as for the florentines they lived very happily and in perfect tranquillity from the end of the war till the death of lorenzo in      for lorenzo having established a general peace throughout italy by his great wisdom and prudence had begun to turn his thoughts entirely to the aggrandizement of the republic and the care of his own family in the first place he married his eldest son peter to alfonsina daughter to cavaliere orsino and procured a cardinals hat for giovanni his second son who was not quite thirteen years of age when he was promoted to that dignity of which there had been no example before but he ascended by degrees through all the preferments of the church till he was exalted to the pontificate under the name of leo x his third son giuliano was but an infant he also disposed of his daughters very much to their advantage in his mercantile affairs he was rather unfortunate for such was the extravagance of his factors who lived more like princes than private men that they had dissipated the greater part of his merchandise so that he was often obliged to borrow large sums of the public his chief desire was to promote union among the people and support the nobility in that degree of honor and respect that was due to them he showed great favor to those who excelled in any art and was a very liberal patron to learned men he was passionately fond of poetry music and architecture he founded the university of pisa immediately after his death such sparks of discord began to rekindle as shortly broke out into a flame and preyed upon the vitals of italy  0  peter the greatgrandson of the first cosimo having entered into a league with louis xii of france without the consent of the signori was ejected by the florentines and retired to venice so that the florentines recovered and enjoyed their ancient liberties till      when ferdinand king of spain restored the family of medici it was again expelled in      in    0 charles v seized upon florence and made alexander de medici great grandson of lorenzo and who married his natural daughter margaret sovereign and duke of florence alexander was murdered about seven years after and having left no children was succeeded by his brother john whose son cosimo was created grandduke of tuscany by pope pius v in      voltaire says that the period while florence was under the government of the medici ought to be called the medicean age as the polite arts and sciences were then carried to the highest degree of perfection then it was that those great geniuses ariosto machiavel guicciardini cardinal bembo trissino casa bernini raphael michael angelo titian paul veronese and so many others adorned the age and rendered their names immortal  0  chapter second florence guicciardini begins his history of the wars in italy where machiavel concludes that of florence with the death of lorenzo de medici in april      the same year that the sagacity fortitude and good fortune of that ever memorable native of coguretto a village near genoa christopher columbus of plebeian birth but of noble genius in the service of ferdinand and isabella of spain laid the first foundation of the constitutions of the united states of america the death of lorenzo was a severe misfortune to his country which had flourished under the influence of his prudence reputation and genius in all the blessings and embellishments of a long and secure peace and very inconvenient to all italy who regarded him as a principal counterbalance to ferdinand of naples and sforza of milan princes as ambitious as they were powerful peter ii the eldest of his three sons who succeeded him without contradiction was not qualified by experience or abilities for so important a station deviating early from the councils of his father and without consulting the principal citizens he was wholly directed by orsino a relation both by his mother and his wife but a dependent of ferdinand this new connection so prudently avoided by his father excited the jealousy of sforza and was the source of all the ensuing evils without reciting the particulars of his vanity rashness and imprudence especially a foolish treaty with france which he made without consulting the magistrates it is sufficient to say that on the ninth of november      as he was going into the palace nerli a youth of noble birth and great wealth at the head of some others of the magistracy stood armed at the gates† and forbade him to enter the populace as soon as the  0  report of this insurrection spread in the town instantly took arms peter destitute of courage as well as advice returned to his own house where he was informed that the magistrates had declared him a rebel upon which he fled with precipitation to bologna and was followed by his two brothers giovanni the cardinal and giuliano who were likewise attainted thus through the rashness and levity of a thoughtless youth the family of the medici fell for the time from a sovereign power which they had exercised for sixty years from bologna they went to venice after some time the king their ally obtained a reversal of peters attainder and that of his two brothers and a restitution of their effects on condition that peter should not approach within a hundred miles of the borders of the republic this was designed to prevent him from settling in rome his brothers were not to come within a hundred miles of the city after the exile of peter and his brothers the city of florence attempted once more to reform its government but says nerli the citizens who ought to have reformed the state fell into the same error with all who had preceded them in similar enterprises and founded the new government as others had done whose steps they followed upon parties and civil factions as may be seen in the whole history of florence and for the benefit and convenience of the superior party and more powerful factions and not at all for the benefit of the generality or the universal good and therefore it was impossible that a pacific and quiet republic should succeed or a durable government be established they created however according to the ancient custom of the city and by means of a parliament always a scene of violence and inconsistent with all civil modesty twenty accoppiatori or associates with authority to imborse the signori from time to time and to create with other restless disturbers of the public peace the principal magistrates and they resolved that lorenzo di pierfrancesco de medici who then declared himself one of the inhabitants de popolani  though under age should be one  0  of the twenty and this was accomplished by their extraordinary reputation and influence and thus he was made the head of the new government and this whole revolution changed nothing but the head and not at all the nature of the government it was in this convention which nerli calls a parliament that those elegant speeches which guicciardini has preserved or composed one for soderini and the other for vespucci are supposed to have been made but it is surprising to see that neither orator so eloquent and able nor yet the historian who so elegantly reports the debate appears to have once thought of the natural and necessary remedy one is for a government simply popular and the other for a form simply aristocratical but neither thinks of an equal mixture of the three forms nor even of the two nor does an idea occur of separating the legislative from the executive power soderini admits that among all writers upon government praises have been more liberally bestowed upon the administration of a single prince and upon that of a few of the best citizens than upon any popular government but he thinks that the desire of liberty is so natural or habitual in that city and the condition of the citizens so proportioned to that equality which is the necessary foundation of a popular government that it ought without any doubt to be preferred to all others he even thinks a question could not be made of this as in all their consultations it had ever been determined with universal consent that the city should be governed in the name and by the authority of the people but the diversity of opinions arose from this that some would cheerfully consent in the regulation of the convention to that form of a republic with which the city governed itself before her liberty was oppressed by the family of the medici others among whom he reckons himself judging a government so ordered to have in many things rather the name than the effects of a popular government and terrified with the accidents which frequently result from it desire a more perfect form which may preserve concord and security to the citizens blessings which neither from reason nor experience can be expected in this city if it is not under a government dependent entirely on  0  the power of the people this must however be well ordered by two fundamental regulations the first of these is that all the magistrates and officers both in the city and all its dominions shall be distributed from time to time by a universal council of all those who according to our laws are qualified for a participation in government without the approbation of which council new laws cannot be considered hence it not being in the power of private citizens nor of any particular conspiracy or intrigue to distribute dignities or authority none will be excluded from them by the passions or caprice of others but they shall be bestowed according to the virtues and merits of men by consequence every one must endeavor by his virtues good manners and by rendering himself agreeable both in public and private life to open his way to honors every one must abstain from vices and injuries to others and in one word from all those things which are odious in a wellconstituted city it will not be in the power of any one nor of a few by new laws or by the authority of a magistrate to introduce another government or to pretend to alter this but by the resolution of the universal council the second fundamental regulation is this that all the most important deliberations as those of peace and war the examination of new laws and generally all those things which are necessary to the administration of such a city and dominion shall be treated by magistrates particularly destined to this service in a select council of the most experienced and prudent citizens who shall be deputed by the popular council for as the knowledge of these affairs of state is not found in every understanding precautions should be taken that the government may not fall into hands incapable of conducting it and the celerity and secrecy which are often indispensable cannot be consulted or preserved in the deliberations of a multitude neither is it necessary for the maintenance of liberty that such things should be treated by large numbers for liberty remains secure at all times when the distribution of magistracies and the deliberations on new laws depend on universal consent these two points being secured the government will be truly popular the liberty of the city well founded and a laudable and durable form of a republic established he then compares his project with the plan of venice—to   0 which it has not however the smallest resemblance—and proceeds this city of ours has never enjoyed a government like this and therefore our public affairs have been constantly exposed to frequent mutations at one time trampled down by the violence of tyranny at another torn by the ambitious and avaricious dissensions of the few now shaken by the licentious fury of the multitude and although cities are built for no end but the tranquillity security and happy life of the inhabitants the fruits of our government our felicity our repose have been the continual confiscations of our estates the banishments and the executions on the scaffold of our miserable citizens this is the substance of soderinis oration in which he is fully sensible of the tyranny and slavery of alternate factions and the consequent miseries with which the history of florence is filled but instead of proposing a rational remedy he is for aggravating the evil the executive power the appointment of officers had been the cause of discord he now only proposes to give those appointments to the multitude instead of a senate to the universal instead of the particular council the only effect of which would be that more heads would be turned and more passions inflamed the oration of soderini was answered by vespucci a famous lawyer and a man of singular genius and address if says he a government instituted in the manner proposed by soderini most excellent citizens would produce such desirable fruits with the same ease that they may be described he would certainly discover a most corrupted character who should wish any other for the regulation of our country he would be a most pernicious citizen who should not love without reserve a form of republic in which virtue merit and the real value of men should be above all things acknowledged and honored but i confess myself ignorant how it is possible to hope that a government placed absolutely in the power of the people can be productive of such mighty blessings on the contrary i well know what reason teaches experience demonstrates and the authority of the greatest lawgivers confirms that in so great a multitude there can never be found such prudence such experience and such order as may give us room to promise ourselves the wise will be preferred to the ignorant the good to the bad or men of experience to those who have never seen a public transaction     for as from an incapable and unskilful judge it is not possible to hope for a sagacious sentence so from a people immersed in ignorance and involved in confusion we cannot expect unless by accident prudent deliberations or rational elections can we believe that a multitude inexpert unskilful compounded of so great a variety of geniuses conditions and customs and wholly devoted to their private affairs can possibly distinguish and know those intricate interests and duties of the public which men of the most consummate wisdom who are wholly inattentive to any other business are often with great difficulty able to discern not to mention that the unbounded esteem which every one entertains of himself will stimulate them all to become ambitious of honors it will never be satisfactory to men in a popular government to enjoy the honest fruits of liberty but all will aspire to the highest rank and be impatient to intermeddle in deliberations upon affairs of the most importance and greatest difficulty for among us there is less than in any other city in the world of that modesty which yields the precedence to him who has more knowledge or more merit persuading ourselves as we do that in reason and by right we ought all of us to be equal in all things the places of virtue and merit if left in the disposition of the multitude will be confounded and this ambition being diffused through the majority will designedly bestow the most power on the most ignorant and the least meritorious because being by much the most numerous they will have the most influence in a state so constituted that opinions in it are numbered and not weighed what certainty therefore can you have that although they may be satisfied with the form that you introduce at present they will not presently disarrange the institutions the most wisely concerted by their novel inventions and imprudent laws and these the wisest citizens will not be able to resist these things at all times dangerous in such a government will be much more so at present because it is the nature of mankind when they fly from one extreme in which they have been held by violence to rush with greater violence without stopping at the mean to the other extremity thus he who escapes from a tyranny if unrestrained precipitates himself into an unbridled licentiousness which also may most justly be called a tyranny for a people is exactly like a tyrant when they give to him who has no merit and take away from him who has     much when they confound all gradations and distinctions of persons and their tyranny is perhaps so much the more pestiferous as ignorance which has no weights nor measures nor laws is more dangerous even than malignity which does govern itself by some rule restrain itself by some bridle and satisfy itself with some end    has this city ever been under the absolute government of the people without becoming an instant prey to discord without being shaken to its foundation and without suffering an immediate revolution in the state why are not our liberties secure under the government proposed in this parliament all things are referred to the disposition of magistrates who are not perpetual but are frequently changed who are not elected by a few but having been approved by many are appointed according to the ancient usage of the city by lot how then can they be appointed by factions or by the will of particular citizens we shall have a much greater certainty that affairs of the most importance will be examined and directed by men of the most wisdom experience and gravity who will govern with more order secrecy and maturity of judgment than it is possible for a people who are incapable of such things to possess a people who are often when there is little occasion for it most extravagantly splendid and expensive and oftener still when there is the most urgent necessity so penurious and niggardly as to rush upon the greatest dangers and expenses for the sake of saving the most trifling sums in truth both these speeches with all their eloquence were thrown away soderini was for collecting all authority into one centre the people and vespucci into another the senate neither dared propose a separation of the executive from both in a first magistrate and without that and admitting both the senate and people to a share there could be no peace nor harmony in florence the question however was not decided by the logic or rhetoric of either few of the citizens attended the convention and the vote would have been for the aristocracy of vespucci if another orator had not intervened this was girolamo savonarola the prophet who declared that he had a divine revelation from heaven in favor of a popular government and that jesus christ should be chosen king of     florence against his own express declaration that his kingdom was not of this world the twenty accoppiatori who had no head to keep them united necessarily fell into a variety of factions and divisions among themselves perceiving their dissensions the other citizens in general and especially all those of the greatest reputation who at the election of the twenty had not been chosen of the number began to take courage and raise a cry against them for the weakness of their government and savonarola declared that god had constituted him his ambassador in florence with full power and express orders to declare his will that christ should be king and that under him the city should be governed only by a single assembly or popular council the multitude believed him and in      the twenty were all obliged to resign and give place to the greater council and popular government† and a new palace was built for them with such ardent enthusiasm that it seemed to be true what savonarola declared that the angels had acted as masons and architects that the work might be the sooner finished but this new government could no better agree than the accoppiatori and for the same reason the new great council as well as the whole city soon divided into three parties the greatest and most powerful was that which depended upon fra girolamo and was called the party of the frateschi and consisted of those who most desired and of nearly all those who were gratified with the latitude of the popular government the second party were desirous of having the government more restrained and in the hands of a smaller number of the principal citizens but they were still desirous of liberty and as well as the frateschi were in opposition to the party of the medici the third party consisted of those who wished for the return of the medici and the restoration of the old government the views motives and manœuvres of these three factions their jealousies envies ambition and various schemes to supplant each other are particularly described by nerli and in so natural a manner that one would think his history written expressly to expose the folly of a government in one centre     in      the florentines met with fresh and dangerous troubles from other quarters excited by the potentates of the league who encouraged peter to attempt his restoration to florence peter like all other exiles ready to embrace every offer imagined his own party so powerful and the new government so odious especially to the nobility that he could not fail of success he made several advances and excited some exertions among his friends but being disappointed of effectual assistance he at length gave up the enterprise in      the pope and the venetians conceived a new project for separating the florentines from the french the unhappy state of their city in which there were such great divisions among the citizens owing to the form of their government gave encouragement to any power that wished to molest them for says guicciardini—  in the first institution of the popular authority in florence there had not been introduced a mixture of those temperaments which whilst they secured by suitable methods the common liberty might prevent the republic from being thrown into confusion by the ignorance and licentiousness of the multitude for this reason the citizens of better rank meeting with less respect than their condition seemed to require the people on the other hand being jealous of their ambition multitudes of mean capacity frequently assisting at important debates and the supreme magistracy to whom was referred the decision of the most difficult affairs changing every two months much confusion was occasioned in the government of the republic to this must be added the great authority of savonarola whose followers were more numerous than those of the contrary opinion and appeared to have much the greater share in the distribution of places in the magistracy and of public honors by which means the city becoming manifestly divided one party still clashed with the other in all the public deliberations as it always happens in divided cities when men care not how much they obstruct the common good in the desire of lowering the reputation of the adverse party these disorders were the more dangerous because besides the long vexations and great burdens borne by that city there was that year a very great scarcity whence it     might be presumed that the halfstarved populace were desirous of a change this unhappy disposition gave hopes to peter who was besides incited by some of the citizens with secret assistance from the venetians and in various other ways he collected together a military force and made an attempt upon florence but having neither genius nor resources he failed his partisans committed a number of massacres in some of the neighboring towns but his plot was discovered and his principal friends in florence after full proof of the order and management of the conspiracy were convicted and sentenced to death by virtue of a law that was made when the popular government was established the relations of the persons condemned appealed to the grand council of the people the other party apprehending that compassion for their rank age and numerous relations might prevail on the affections of the people several members of the supreme magistracy were by pressing importunities and almost by force and menaces constrained to consent that notwithstanding the interposition of the appeal execution should be done the same night of what avail is law in such a government for the protection of life or security of liberty the most zealous sticklers for this were the favorers of savonarola who was reproached for not dissuading his followers from the violation of a law which but a few years before had been proposed by himself as necessary for the preservation of liberty but a dominant party when there are but two and no third power to balance them is never long restrained by law morals or decency the next year      savonarola himself was burnt not for his enthusiastic impostures but for preaching against the corruptions of the court of rome under that hellish monster of vice and cruelty alexander vi this would not have been remembered here if politics and party rather than piety had not produced this event as well as the assassination of a nobleman of great influence francesco valori for being the chief patron of savonarola and the cause that the appeal to the popular council had not been admitted the passions of parties their hatred and revenge as well as their ambition under such unbalanced governments lay hold of any popular prejudice most frequently of religious zeal and the assistance of any means even the friendship of an alexander and a borgia to aid their gratification     but scattering the ashes of this martyr in the arno did not says nerli quench the flames of discord nor heal the divisions of the city the people remained in the same dissensions every one quarrelling for his faction as usual and fresh disputes and dissensions arose first between vitelli and the count di marciano second by reason of the difference between the king of france and the duke of milan and third on account of elections and the magistracies in   00 cæsar borgia† having already subjected a great part of romagna desirous of extending his dominions in tuscany and having good intelligence of the disposition and divisions in the city of florence attempted to restore the medici but was diverted from the enterprise by an embassy and a round sum of money in   0  a rebellion excited in the city of arezzo opened fresh divisions in florence and produced new attempts to reform the government first by giving a head to the greater council and second by constituting a gonfalonier for life soderini who had no children had great qualities was moderately rich of a family of great reputation c and had rendered important services to the state upon many occasions was accordingly elected but he had no thoughts of changing the popular government any further and was soon found to have too much moderation for some of his friends rucellai and lorenzo di pierfrancesco de medici and some other citizens broke off from him would not attend his feasts and grew discontented this year   0  died the pope alexander vi peter de medici with some other noblemen following the french camp after their defeat by the spaniards at gaeta entered on board a bark laden with artillery and was drowned at the mouth of the river by the barks sinking under her burden in a contrary wind but these events so fortunate in appearance for florence could not secure her tranquillity the new gonfalonier for life had many parties in fermentation against him those who desired a more popular government and that his office should be annual or only for three months those of his own party who thought him not zealous enough to make the government more aristocratical and those who wished the restoration of the medici and a government     completely monarchical all these various classes of citizens were daily observing his conduct criticizing his administration exaggerating his errors and destroying his reputation and popularity in   0  bartolomeo d alviano invaded the country with a view to assist the medici but he was routed and put to flight from so great a victory the citizens hoped for happiness quiet and repose but the effects of it were quite the contrary and increased the secret opposition to the gonfalonier and the cabals of the discontented citizens bentivoglio ambitious to be made captaingeneral and giacomini to increase his popularity united in the desire of adding the conquest of pisa to the glory they had acquired in the late victory the project of this enterprise occasioned great confusions in the city the wisest and best men declared themselves against it but such numbers were bent upon it that the gonfalonier either blinded by the same passions arising from success or wishing to counteract his adversaries or confiding too much in bentivoglio fell in with it after tedious disputes angry accusations and mutual reproaches in the city the enterprise was resolved upon in the great council with loud huzzas of the common people a great expense was incurred in ample preparations but the end was as unfortunate as the wiser citizens had predicted the two principal officers destroyed all the credit of their former services and soderini the gonfalonier lost much of his reputation more of the popular confidence and affection and in proportion as these fell those who had opposed the war rose in the public esteem the enemies of the gonfalonier increased and their opposition headed by the salviati grew more active and determined and weakened the government to such a degree that it was alike unable to execute the resolutions when taken by so small majorities to command the soldiers to elect the council the eight commissaries of war or ambassadors or indeed to resolve upon any thing the two parties     could agree upon nothing and all the citizens were such decided partisans either of the gonfalonier or of the salviati that they would not intermarry or even give a vote for any man to any office or public favor who was not of their side in the grand council and in the city causes enough of debate arose from day to day in   0  an ordinance for regulating the militia in the country and enrolling every man from fifteen to fifty years of age under captains and colors for frequent exercise in the military art the demand of alfonsina orsini the widow of peter de medici of the restitution of her dower confiscated with the estate of her husband the marriage of her daughter clarissa to philip strozzi the resignation of the archbishop of florence the appointment of a successor the war of pisa in   0  the creation of commissaries the concession of pisa to the king of france—all occasioned such struggles as excited at last a conspiracy to assassinate the gonfalonier for the purpose of introducing the restoration of the medici this plot was discovered but the guilty persons had such parties in the city and the gonfalonier was become so unpopular that only the slightest punishment could be inflicted as in such a state of parties every measure of government is opposed another controversy arose about the continuance of the truce with siena which was at last agreed to upon the concession of monte pulciano various new disputes were now occasioned by the new council in pisa finally the city found that amidst all the great transactions in italy by the division among the citizens and their continual opposition to each other in every reasonable measure they had not only very ill served their ally the king but had given great offence to the pope in      was the battle of ravenna and after a long series of wars in which the emperor the king of france the king of spain the swiss the pope the venetians and all other states in italy had been concerned a congress was held at mantua giuliano de medici in his own name and that of the cardinal here solicited an enterprise against the florentines a revolution he pretended might be easily effected in that state through the divisions of the citizens many of whom wished for the return of his family by private intelligence which he said he maintained with several noble and powerful personages in the city he thought a sudden attack might easily succeed and the consequence would     be the taking the power of florence out of the hands of one who depended on the king of france and committing it to persons who injured and abused by him would acknowledge no alliance but that of the confederates he was seconded in the name of the pope by bernardo de bibiena afterwards cardinal who had been educated in the family of medici an offer was secretly made to soderini a lawyer and brother of the gonfalonier who was then ambassador from florence that if the florentines would comply with the demand of a sum of money the emperor and king of aragon should take them under their protection the ambassador had no authority to conclude any agreement and could only make his report to the republic it was believed that if the florentines had laid aside their niggardly chaffering about the price they might have diverted the storm but either through the carelessness or the malignity of men the cause of that city was abandoned and it was resolved that the spanish army attended by the cardinal and giuliano de medici should march towards florence and that the cardinal whom the pope in this expedition had declared legate of tuscany should call to his assistance the soldiers of the church and those of the neighboring towns whom he thought fit for his purpose the viceroy at the head of the spanish army no sooner entered the florentine dominions than he was met by an ambassador of the republic to know what he required of them the viceroy demanded in the name of all the confederates that the gonfalonier should be deprived of his office and that such a form of government should be established as would not give occasion of umbrage to the allied powers which could not be effected without restoring the cardinal and giuliano de medici to their country the government of florence was in the greatest consternation from the divisions among the citizens and the inclination of multitudes to a change a message arrived from the viceroy that it was not the intention of the league to make any alteration in the government or liberty of the city but only to remove the gonfalonier from the magistracy for the security of italy and to restore the medici not as heads of the government but as private persons to live in all things under subjection to the laws and to the magistracy various were the opinions in the city according to the difference of mens judgments passions and fears the gonfalonier in a long harangue to the great   0 council offered either to resign his envied office or to defend it at the hazard of his life as they should determine if the medici says he have an inclination to live as private citizens in due subjection to the ordinances of the magistrates and of your laws their restoration would be laudable    but let not any one imagine that the government of the medici will be exercised in the same manner as before their expulsion the form and foundation of things are changed educated among us almost like other private citizens possessed of vast estates in proportion to their high dignity and offended with none they laid the foundation of their greatness in the affections of the citizens but now bred up in strange customs and having little insight into our civil affairs resenting their exile very indigent affronted by so many families conscious that the greater part of the people abhor tyranny constrained by poverty and suspicion they will have no consideration for any citizen but will engross the direction of all affairs to themselves and establish their administration on fear and force not on love and benevolence the city will become like bologna under the bentivogli or like siena and perugia it was with wonderful unanimity resolved to consent to the return of the medici as private citizens but to refuse the removal of the gonfalonier at the hazard of their lives and fortunes and all hands were set to work to prepare for war and the defence of prato the viceroy laid siege to prato and took it by assault which was followed by flight shrieks violence rapine blood and slaughter this sad disaster produced a vast change in the minds of the people at florence the gonfalonier repenting of his counsel was terrified and became deprived at once of all esteem and authority others grew audacious several young noblemen with one of the family of albizzi at their head who had been in secret correspondence with the medici forced the gonfalonier out of the public palace and the magistrates were compelled to     depose him he fled to ragusa ambassadors were sent to the viceroy with whom by means of the cardinal de medici they easily made an accommodation he insisted only on the restoration of his family and their adherents as private citizens with power to redeem within a certain time the confiscated estates indemnifying those to whom they had been transferred for the purchase and improvements the florentines were obliged to enter into the league pay to the emperor forty thousand ducats and to the viceroy eighty thousand for his army and twenty thousand for himself they made a league besides with the king of aragon under reciprocal obligations of assisting each other it is astonishing that the florentines should not yet have been able to see the causes of their continual misfortunes and the necessity of different orders and a balance in their constitution they now applied themselves to reform their government to preserve their liberty and the popular council their all authority in one centre their right constitution of a commonwealth to this end they enacted that the gonfalonier should no longer be elected for life but only for a year that to the council of eighteen which was changed every six months and by whose authority the most weighty affairs were determined should be added for life all those who had discharged the great offices of state at home or abroad that the citizens of greatest quality might always assist at their debates at home such as had been gonfaloniers of justice or of the number of the ten of     the balìa a magistracy of great authority in that republic abroad all who by election of the council of eighty had been sent ambassadors to princes or had been commissariesgeneral in war in all other points the laws remained without alteration ridolfi a noble citizen was elected gonfalonier for the first year the people as usual in troublesome times not paying so much regard to those who were most acceptable to them for popular arts as to a person who by his great authority in the city especially with the nobility and by his own extraordinary talents was best capable of establishing the tottering commonwealth but things were now gone too far and the enemies of public liberty were become too powerful a suspected army was in the country and the most audacious youth in the city were desirous of oppressing liberty with them concurred in thought and deed though in word he pretended the contrary the cardinal de medici for the restoration of his family as private citizens could not have been thought from the beginning a reward worthy of so great fatigues and dangers but now he considered that they must be universally detested by the people from a suspicion that they would be continually exciting conspiracies against their liberty and from the indignation conceived against the family for conducting the spanish army against their country and being the cause of the barbarous sackage of prato the cardinal was stimulated too by those who had before conspired with him and had no honorable station in the new commonwealth he therefore obtained the consent of the viceroy unexpectedly entered florence and repaired to the houses of the medici with a number of italian officers and soldiers the magistrates not daring to forbid their entrance on account of the neighborhood of the spanish army the next day a great number of citizens being assembled in council in the palace and giuliano de medici among the rest the soldiers suddenly forced the gate and rushing up stairs took possession of the palace the gonfalonier and the magistrates were forced to submit to the will of a man whose arms were more powerful than their unarmed reverence and at the motion of giuliano they called by sound of the bell an assembly of the people in the square of the palace here those who met finding themselves surrounded by armed soldiers and the youth of the city in arms for the medici consented that fifty citizens     nominated with the approbation of the cardinal de medici should be invested with the whole sovereign power of the people which the florentines call a balìa the government was reduced to that form which subsisted before      a guard was stationed at the palace and the medici resumed their former grandeur but governed more imperiously and with more absolute authority than their father peter had done after this manner was the liberty of the florentines oppressed by arms being reduced to this condition by the divisions among the citizens  on the first of september      the new signori without any gonfalonier or supreme magistrate united with giuliano de medici and the principal citizens of florence and especially with those who having been in opposition to soderini or being relations or declared friends of the medici were the most in their confidence to give orders for a new reformation of the city it was thereupon ordained by an intrigue of the signori that a cabal of about twenty citizens should determine among themselves the mode of reformation in the state but even in this junto many contests arose and various projects were proposed there were among them some who without considering the forcible manner in which the medici had returned wished to reëstablish the popular government and maintain by all means the grand council at least in part in its authority and in order to give the government a head would constitute a gonfalonier for one year or two at most they further desired in order to give a greater perfection to the government to make an addition of select citizens to the council of eighty who should be as a senate of the best men for life with a certain authority and full power and with certain particular orders and prescribed forms of this opinion were the greater part of those citizens who had been in opposition to soderini not so much from attachment to     the medici as for other reasons the medici and their most avowed partisans and chiefly those who in their opposition to soderini had discovered themselves the most averse to the popular state because they did not think they could obtain pardon from the people could scarcely hope to live in freedom and were sure to have no share in the government would for their greater security restrain the state to its ancient form and remodel it by a convention not believing that they could accomplish it in the ordinary way as it had been restrained in the house of medici before the year      after many accommodating manœuvres of giuliano de medici by his great facility and kindness with those who desired a large government and to preserve the grand council it was concluded to pass a law in this cabal for the reformation of this government and it was accordingly proposed in the grand council and received with great applause for everybody was so dispirited and so terrified with the thoughts of a convention of the people which was much talked of and greatly desired by those who wished to restrain the state into an aristocracy that this new law of reform was highly relished as it lessened the authority both of the people and the grand council by the new law it was ordained that for the future the gonfalonier should be created by the grand council for one year should be disqualified from holding the office for five subsequent years and that all his connections should be excluded during his year from holding any of the greater magistracies such as those of the signori the sixteen gonfaloniers of the companies of the people and the twelve buoni homini the chief magistrate was also prohibited from holding a negotiation or correspondence with any other prince republic or lord in or out of italy from opening any letters addressed to the signori or any other magistrate without the presence of two thirds of the signori his companions or even any letter addressed to him alone without the presence of two at least of the signori who under the pains of perjury were obliged to show such letters to the other signori if they found any thing in them relative to the state or public affairs the ladies too and families of the gonfaloniers were prohibited from inhabiting the palace and from sending any letters or messages to any officer or magistrate abroad or at home and the gonfalonier was assigned for his whole salary four hundred     golden florins a year as to the mode of electing the senate surplusage or optimates before mentioned such disposition was made by this new law for the reformation of the government that for the future at all administrations deliberations and elections of magistrates usually made in the council of eighty all the then present signori and all those citizens who at any time had been gonfaloniers of justice all those who had sat among the ten magistrates for war and all who at any time had been elected ambassadors in the council of eighty to any prince or lord in or out of italy should assist during their lives and to provide for those families or societies in which there were not men of any such description it was decreed by the law that such families might claim as far as two members if they had the number of two or if they had not one with the ordinary qualifications but no more and that such supplementary additions from the families should not amount to more than fifty in the whole to be elected in the council of eighty with its new addition giving of these fifty a convenient part to the lesser arts according to the order at that time in the city and because giuliano de medici and some of his declared friends were incapable either by minority of age or by having in their families two or more who came within the ordinary rules that they might not be excluded it was provided by the law that by a resolution of the signori alone eleven more besides the fifty might be elected eight of whom might be under the age prescribed of forty years in this manner was the council of eighty with its addition to be constituted and in it from time to time were to be created the signori the ten magistrates for war and the eight for the guard in such manner as those magistrates were wont to be elected in the greater council observing the order of elections in the quarters of the arts and all the forms which had been observed in electing such magistrates in the greater council and to facilitate still further the public business and to take away still more effectually both from the people and the great council the opportunity and the power of disarranging the public councils by withholding supplies of money admonished by many past examples the law provided that such provisions of money and impositions of taxes for the public occasions should be passed in the first place in the council of eighty by two thirds of the black votes or     balls according to the forms of balloting and be approved in the greater council by a division of one half of the black votes and one more the law was passed and the same day in october      and in the same council they proceeded to the election of a new gonfalonier at the first ballot there was no choice but at the second giovan batista ridolfi was elected and in the presence of the council took upon him with the other signori the supreme magistracy this plan of reformation however had greatly terrified the partisans and most declared friends of the medici as it appeared to them they should be in great danger when an accommodation should be made with the league and the spanish army should be marched out of the dominions of being again banished from florence to their total ruin that of the new constitution and the whole house of medici and in this apprehension they were well grounded for although there was in the new plan an attempt at three natural branches yet the executive power and the power of the purse were both left in the hands of the aristocracy which would have instantly produced a division both among nobles and people and the destruction of the house of medici as well as of the feeble popular branch of the constitution here was the best possible opportunity for introducing the most perfect form by giving the executive power to one of the medici the power of the purse to the people and the legislative     power to both together with the nobility but either no man understood the subject or too much ambition in the medici too much pride in the nobility too many prejudices in the people or all three together prevented it the election too of ridolfi who was thought to be as indeed he was a spirited man of a celebrated house most illustrious parentage and of great reputation increased their terror especially as in the deliberations on the new reformation he had discovered himself much in favor of a popular life he had been ordinarily conspicuous in the faction of frateschi among the first of whom he had been incorporated after valori and had in all times conjunctures and circumstances favored that party which was ever in opposition to the house of medici as is manifest to any one who has a knowledge of those times whereupon many of the most open friends of the medici and those who most dreaded a popular government entered into close concert with the cardinal de medici for the purpose of correcting the errors which giuliano his brother by his too great facility had suffered to slide in it was not difficult to dispose the cardinal to this as they found him since the late reformation under the same apprehensions and in the same disposition with themselves neither himself nor messer giulio prior of capua his cousin and a natural son remaining of giuliano who died in      by the conspiracy of the pazzi judging it possible securely to continue in florence if the government remained in that manner in the hands of the people and at the free discretion of the citizens wherefore the cardinal came sometimes into the city for he had resided in prato when the reformation of the state was made in florence and took lodgings in st antonio del vescovo a place near the city where he was visited by a multitude of the citizens under various pretences there discoursing with all concerning the condition of affairs as they happened he began with great address to represent to some that it was necessary to think of a good method for securing the state and his house dwelling only upon general observations and not descending to any particulars with those whom he believed to be desirous of a popular government but consulting with his more confidential friends and with those whom he knew to be discontented with the new regulation of the government at last he opened himself to a few showing     the necessity of a convention and a balìa to a small number of citizens in whom they could confide who might contract the state to the form in which it stood before      in the hands of the family of medici after these practices held at st antonio the cardinal came to florence resolved to call a convention and contract the state then those citizens fitly called the blind who had been so opposed to soderini began to see when it was too late and they had no longer power to provide a remedy that danger now at hand which they had not been able to discern when at a distance on the   th of september      the convention was assembled the medici and their friends in arms having seized the palace which had been left without a guard because ridolfi when he entered on his office of gonfalonier either from a want of jealousy of the medici and the viceroy who was yet with his army at prato or for some other reason not only had not armed the palace as in order to establish the new government it was necessary to do but had caused it to be disarmed of the few guards which had been stationed there by the magistrates after the privation and departure of soderini wherefore it was easy for the medici and their partisans to seize it the signori and the gonfalonier and many other citizens seeing the palace taken and the absolute determination of the medici and their armed followers to contract the state and that they could no longer support the popular government yielded to giuliano de medici who was in council and had orders from the cardinal what to do the people were accordingly called together in convention according to the ancient custom of their parliaments in the piazza the signori mounted the rostrum and a balìa was created that is full power was given to fiftyfive citizens for one year with the faculty of prolonging it beyond that period according to circumstances for the convenience and support of the state and the government and with the faculty moreover of associating to themselves in the balìa such other citizens as might be thought useful to the state the first thing resolved on was to add eleven members to the number making in the whole sixtysix whose names nerli has preserved the next was to make a treaty with the league     and to pay well to obtain the consent of the spanish army to march out of prato and the florentine dominions an ambassador was sent to accompany the viceroy of spain and another the locum tenens of maximilian the emperor a strong guard was placed in the palace ridolfi renounced his office of gonfalonier all the members of the family of soderini were taken up and dispersed about in different confinements a plan was established for the appointment of all officers and the sum total of power was lodged in giuliano de medici who however was to consult with the cardinal with messer giulio with lorenzo their nephew the son who remained of piero di lorenzo de medici but when the new distribution of offices took place fresh divisions and dissensions arose and secret plots were discovered whose object was nothing less than the assassination of all the medici among the conspirators were many powerful citizens the chiefs of the party were beheaded and the rest severely punished at length the pope julius ii died and the cardinals in conclave on the seventh day unanimously elected giovanni cardinal de medici who assumed the name of leo x aged thirtyseven this election gave great satisfaction to all christendom all men expecting from the recollection of his fathers great merit and from the fame of his own liberality benevolence charity and irreproachable morals so says the historian but his actions discover an ambition too powerful for his virtue that leo would prove an excellent pontiff and from the example of his ancestors a lover of men of genius and learning his first transaction was his coronation which was performed with so pompous an appearance of his family and all the prelates and nobles from all parts and so great a concourse of the roman people that rome had never seen so proud a day since the inundations of the barbarians the standard of the church was carried by alfonzo d este that of the religious order of rhodes by giulio de medici all in armor and mounted on a noble courser for he was by nature inclined to arms though his destiny drew him to the church such magnificence confirmed the vulgar in their expectations of happiness from this pontificate which was likely to abound in liberality   0 and splendor as the expenses of that day amounted to a hundred thousand ducats but men of better judgment were of opinion that so much pomp neither became a pope nor was suitable to the times which required more gravity simplicity and moderation this exaltation of giovanni occasioned great rejoicings in florence for both the friends and enemies of the family were pleased though for different reasons the former from the hope of benefits and advantages and the latter from the expectation of security and the universal tranquillity of the city which they thought would succeed there remained however as may well be imagined a secret discontent in the hearts of the wise who could foresee at a distance that so much grandeur in one family who for sixty years had held in their hands the supreme authority of the government might in time be the means of their return and enable them to change the state from a republic to an absolute principality upon this glorious occasion valori folchi nicholas machiavel and all the others who on account of the late conspiracy had been hitherto imprisoned were liberated from the tower of volterra a conspiracy which if no further attempts had been made and the two who had been beheaded could have been restored to life would now have been wholly forgotten the soderini too were all set at liberty because the cardinal of that family had concurred with his vote in the creation of the pope cardinal soderini had been gained over to this election by a promise of the liberation of his relations and that lorenzo di piero de medici should marry his niece the daughter of his brother giovanvetterio but this alliance never took effect because alfonsina mother of lorenzo would never consent to it to compensate for this disappointment the pope proposed that the cardinals niece should be married to luigi ridolfi his nephew by a sister and the cardinal at first seemed satisfied with the exchange but it afterwards appeared that he took it very ill a splendid embassy of twelve honorable and noble citizens was now sent to the new pope from the city of florence in all this grandeur of the house giuliano lorenzo and giulio de     medici in a few days appeared at rome to consult with the pope concerning several of their affairs and the division of their greatness among them it was finally resolved that giuliano should remain at rome with the title of gonfalonier and captain of the holy see by means of an alliance which he made with a lady of the blood of savoy aunt of the king of france he secured to himself the duchy of nemours and thus voluntarily gave up all pretensions to the government of florence lorenzo contented himself with the state of florence and soon returned to govern it in the same manner and form as his father and his other ancestors had governed giulio was promoted to the archbishopric of florence vacant by the death of cosmo de pazzi with the prospect of being made a cardinal at the first subsequent creation which the pope should make in this manner in the beginning of the pontificate of leo did the medici divide among themselves the state and their own power and emoluments lorenzo returned to florence and consulted with the principal citizens about giving orders for reforming the government in all things to the state it was in before      according to the intentions of the pope resolved on in rome they were very attentive to hasten the general scrutiny because of the absence of so many citizens who for various reasons had gone to rome and after the creation of the pope were not in haste to return when it was finished imborsed and begun to be used a council of seventy was made by lorenzo for life in the form and with the authority of that in the time of his grandfather in      and orders were also given to constitute a council of a hundred which from six months to six months according to the ancient custom should be drawn into this council of a hundred all who had been gonfaloniers of justice might enter at their pleasure in it were debated and determined all provisions of money impositions of taxes and all laws and ordinances of most importance which had been previously approved in the council of seventy and to enlarge their system still more and make it more universally satisfactory they further ordained a drawing by lot from time to time of the ancient councils of the people and the commons which might determine on the petitions of private persons that should be first passed in the council of seventy in all cases which could occur and for the security of the state although they adopted these ordinary     councils they maintained firm the authority of their balia which was kept constantly in being until the revolution in the state that happened in      the scrutiny ended they created the seventy drew the other councils and began to make another change of the ten for war for the eight of their new plan in order to return every thing to the state it was in before      all these ordinances were thus renewed and perfected in december      pandolfo corbinelli being then gonfalonier and the seventy were elected for a term only but with such power of confirmation that they might be said to be for life notwithstanding all these precautions and the absolute power of the balia divisions among the principal citizens still continued some were for making the government more popular others more aristocratical and these divisions which lasted till      gave much trouble to the medici the affairs of the medici and of the state being thus settled giuliano began to think he had been mistaken in leaving florence to his nephew and lorenzo amidst such grandeur in his house began to be discontented at remaining without any princely title and at having no other than a civil rank in florence wherefore he shaped his course to rome and communicated his intention to the pope he returned in      determined to be made captaingeneral of the florentines and this dignity was solemnly assumed by him from the hands of the gonfalonier of justice who was at that time chimenti sernigi in the presence of the signori and of all the magistrates and a great part of the people assembled in the piazza with the staff of command and the other public ensigns usually given to a captaingeneral with the greatest demonstrations of joy and universal rejoicings in this manner lorenzo began to depart from the ancient manners of his family and to lay aside in all things that mode of proceeding popularly in his dress conversation and intercourse with the citizens which had ever been observed by his predecessors having assumed his title and magnificence he went to lombardy to make his court to the king of france who was come to italy to establish his authority in milan which he had lately recovered he became     a great favorite with his majesty from the desire he had of agreeing with the pope and because lorenzo in all his actions and conversation discovered an attachment to the faction of the guelphs and the politics of france soon afterwards an accommodation was made between the pope and the king and the pope set out on a journey to bologna to have an interview with him passing through florence he made his entry into the city with great pomp between the pope and the king many things were agreed on for their mutual defence and the maintenance of their power and lorenzo because he eagerly wished to increase his importance and obtain the title of duke solicited the pope under the auspices of france to undertake an enterprise against urbino as it was thought the king could not fail of success the pope having restored parma and placentia two cities which giulio had added to the state of the church when the french lost the state of milan but the project of an enterprise against urbino was very disagreeable to giuliano de medici and he warmly opposed it as infamous ingratitude considering the civilities and favors the family had received in their exile from that dukedom the pope was advised to recall the bentivogli to bologna and restore modena and reggio to the duke of ferrara but giulio de medici says guicciardini cardinal and legate of bologna whom the pope had sent to be a moderator and counsellor to the inexperienced youth of lorenzo moved at the infamy that would be cast on the memory of his legateship if bologna was given up to its old tyrants and so great a number of the nobility who had openly declared against them in favor of the apostolic see sacrificed to their revenge dissuaded it giulio though of illegitimate birth had been promoted to the cardinalship by leo in the first month of his pontificate by means of witnesses who preferring the favor of men before the truth deposed that his mother had obtained of his father giuliano a promise of marriage giuliano this year came to florence in ill health and resided sometimes in the city and sometimes out of it in the neighboring cities not without exciting great jealousy in lorenzo and alfonsina his mother who governed in the absence of her son the pope was in great     perplexity and could not determine whether to undertake the enterprise against urbino so much resisted by his brother and so ardently desired by his nephew and he hesitated the more because he discovered that the king of france had consented against his inclination giuliano was so ill that he could not censure the project to the pope excepting by his agents and letters and lorenzo by his assiduous solicitations held the king well disposed to his inclinations and was continually about the pope with persuasions to undertake it the interview between the pope and the king at bologna being finished the former returned to florence apparently resolved to give satisfaction to his nephew yet on account of giuliano he proceeded to take measures for the enterprise with some circumspection but the disorder of giuliano increasing he died in march      at badia de fiesole where he resided for the benefit of better air a few days afterwards the pope left florence and returned to rome lorenzo now remained without any contradiction in all things heir of the state the fortune and the grandeur of the house of medici and being now more than ever warm in his desire to be made duke of urbino he was invested by the pope in consistory lorenzo was put in command of an army composed of the soldiers and subjects of the church and the florentines and the pope deprived† francesco maria of these dominions by solemn sentence and gave the investiture of the duchy of urbino in a consistory to lorenzo his nephew all the cardinals setting their hands to the bull in the year      certain cardinals formed a conspiracy against the pope and the cardinal soderini was found among the guilty but upon confession of their error the pope excused them with great humanity  but upon this occasion in order to fill up the college he made a new promotion of cardinals among whom were his two nephews of the salviati and ridolfi families at this time the citizens of the state of florence     were in secret very discontented because the duke lorenzo desiring to reduce the government to the form of a principality appeared to disdain to consult any longer with the magistrates and his fellowcitizens as he used to do and gave audiences very seldom and with much impatience he attended less to the business of the city and caused all public affairs to be managed by messer goro da pistoia his secretary this person either following the inclination of his own nature or because the duke had given him orders what to do governed in such a manner and so conducted himself with the citizens that there appeared in him more grandeur and more of the qualities of a prince and he required more honor than any one of the house of medici ever had done in the sixty years that had passed between      and      the citizens who had borne so much envy against galeotto de medici found in the example of goro reason to acknowledge and repent of their error for galeotto who held from the duke lorenzo the same authority and the same employment before goro and was besides of the family of medici did the public business of the palace and went in person to confer with the citizens and was satisfied with civilly serving his patron and with being more in reality and less in appearance lorenzo now made a journey to france having made an alliance with the king in      he returned with his lady and the marriage was celebrated with much pomp rejoicings and festivity many citizens at this time having discovered the inclination of the duke and that he was determined to reduce the state to the form of a principality would not consent to it some withdrew themselves from public affairs despairing of the commonwealth others confined themselves to their houses under pretence of sickness but others having more courage and better support went to rome under the protection of the pope the duke to make the last effort to dispose the pope to reduce the state of florence to a principality went to finish his nuptials at rome and carried with him vettori and strozzi in whom he confided and with whom he often consulted and after many intrigues with the pope they returned to florence determined to reform the state but in      he died about ten days after his     wife who however had left him a daughter afterwards queen of france goro and the citizens in his confidence had secretly ordered the piazza to be fortified and the guards doubled and had caused to be assembled in florence from various places of the dominion a good number of their friends and confidential partisans to assist as occasion might happen in the preservation of the public security and in observing the conduct of those citizens who had given any cause of suspicion and antonio di bettino da ricosoli was imborsed gonfalonier the cardinal de medici who arrived two days before the death of the duke being sent by the pope to give orders regulated all things to general satisfaction after the funeral of the duke the cardinal entered into intimate consultations with the principal citizens and reëstablished the government according to the form and order which the pope had given to duke lorenzo the cardinal himself remained by order of the pope in the government to give further satisfaction to the citizens whom he knew to be disgusted with the proceedings of goro in the lifetime of the duke and the great authority he had assumed perhaps greater than the duke had given him he reduced the business of the magistrates elections customs of office and the mode of expenditure of the public money in such a manner that there appeared a very great and universal joy among the citizens and no other or greater difficulties remained to him than the usual divisions among the citizens of the state some of whom contended for enlarging and others for restraining the elections of magistrates wherefore those who wished the state more contracted at the head of whom was ridolfi opposed themselves to salviati who by order of the pope was returned to florence with the cardinal and he for contrary reasons was opposed to them and because the cardinal went on amusing sometimes one and sometimes the other party and supporting both their divisions were much more apparent at this time and the heads of each conducted themselves with less dissimulation than they had done in the lifetime of the duke indeed the dissensions of the citizens arose in all important affairs which the cardinal had to provide for or to think of in his government whereas in the other case in the most     important affairs they followed without any difficulty that which was ordered daily by the pope the cardinal seems to have diverted the factions from any effectual opposition to his government by playing them one against the other and fomenting their mutual animosities for his government was very successful and frugal and money was saved in it to pay off the public debts but the war soon followed of pope leo x and charles v who had lately succeeded maximilian in the empire against the french the cardinal was sent with his army as apostolical legate and went into lombardy leaving in his place in the government of florence the cardinal di cortona the affairs of the pope and emperor succeeded prosperously against the french who lost milan but the pope on the last of november      died and finished in the midst of so much grandeur the legitimate succession of the house of medici and the male line of the first cosimo who by a public decree was called the father of his country and who in      had given rise to the greatness of his family after the death of the pope the cardinal suddenly departed from milan and returned to florence where he found that the signori had given good orders for the conservation of the state and that francesco vettori who was gonfalonier of justice the cardinal di cortona and the principal citizens in the government had made every provision and taken every precaution for the benefit and safety of the state and he found too on so great an occasion as that of a sudden and unexpected death of the pope a ready inclination in all the principal citizens and a universal desire among the people to maintain the state in the hands of the cardinal de medici and all this felicity arose from his good government which since the death of the duke lorenzo had been universally agreeable consulting now with the principal citizens orders were given for defence in the war which renzo da ceri by the favor of the french had excited in siena with a view to change the government in florence this war was fomented by the cardinal soderini and occasioned a fresh declaration against his family that they were rebels and involved them in greater calamities than they had suffered in      during this war many citizens began to speak without reserve of a greater degree of liberty and a new reform of the government they reported publicly     that the cardinal for want of relations and a legitimate succession in his family would be willing in a measure to dispose of the authority of the balìa and leave the government freely in the people with a certain authority reserved to a senate for life to consist of the best citizens and to himself a balìa for some purposes during his life and when the principal and most suspected persons in this way were secured although an army was still in siena these discourses continued and increased many were so eager and so drawn away by their wishes and their love of novelty that they began too soon to descend to particulars concerning the manner of reforming the government which they believed and said ought to be undertaken and they proposed the mode of electing the gonfalonier of justice some of them would have him for life as he had been when soderini was elected in   0  and others desired he might be elected annually as ridolfi was in      such was the zeal of many deceived by their credulity and the ardent passions which transported them that they began to speak more freely of the person to be elected and acciaioli and vettori were named and gondi but all agreed at last the better to conciliate the cardinal to leave the election for the first time wholly to him these practices went so far that those citizens began to be publicly named and discriminated who were in favor of the reformation of the government and those who were against it that party of the citizens who had counselled the cardinal to a large and comprehensive distribution of honors and who had ever taken the protection of the generality appeared upon these conversations of a reform to give some attention to it and that party which desired to hold the public offices and honors in few families detested and censured those who talked of any reformation at all the generality of the citizens stood neutral expecting however with great desire that the reform would take place one class of young men and especially those who had concurred in the rise of rucellai solicited it and discovered themselves in this manner the whole city was divided and confounded the greater part of the citizens agitated some with hopes and others with fears and many ventured so far as to write various models for such a reformation even in the presence of the cardinal among these zanobi buondelmonti and nicholas machiavel sufficiently distinguished themselves nerli says he saw     these writings which were communicated to him by the authors at the time of these intrigues they were also communicated to the cardinal  who pretended to hold them in high esteem alexander de pazzi composed a most elegant and beautiful oration in the name of the people of florence in praise of the cardinal for the restoration of the commonwealth which nerli remembers to have heard recited before a large company at a supper where having obtained a copy he sent it to rome to the cardinal salviati these speculations proceeded so far and were so freely discoursed on and in so many ways that it began to appear to the cardinal that he had permitted them to run too far and he thought of means to restrain them but things had gone so much beyond his intentions he found some difficulty to resist their course fortune presented him a convenient opportunity which was this there had been formed at the time of the rise of rucellai a certain school of young men of letters and of elevated genius among whom was cosimo rucellai who died very young though he had excited great expectations among the literati this society was much frequented by nicholas machiavel and nerli says he was a most intimate friend of machiavel and had frequent conversations in this club these gentlemen not only amused themselves but made a business and duty of exercising themselves in the study of history and in making observations and reflections upon it at their request machiavel composed his discourses upon livy and his treatise of military matters these persons went on thinking by an imitation of the ancients to effect something that should be grand and noble and render them illustrious at length they wrought themselves up to the thoughts of a conspiracy against the cardinal and did not well consider what machiavel in his discourses had written to them on the subject of conspiracies had they done so they would either not have engaged in the design or if they had would have proceeded in it with greater caution the heads of this plot were zanobi buondelmonti and luigi alamanni their intention was to assassinate the cardinal de medici   0 and thus bring back the city to a free government and restore liberty to the people as they enjoyed it before      after the death of leo x they sent batista della palla who was in the conspiracy with them to cardinal soderini in order to inform him of their indignation against the cardinal and to persuade him as an exile and an enemy of the medici to make with renzo da ceri and the family of the soderini such provision as they should judge proper to conduct their designs and to obtain intelligence of the progress of this war but the enterprise not succeeding with signor renzo as was expected the plot was first suspected and at length by degrees discovered by the cardinal the principal persons engaged in it were obliged to fly and were declared rebels particularly buondelmonti alamanni palla bruccioli and others were apprehended and beheaded by which means the cardinal was again secured in the enjoyment of his government as well as his life and an end was put to all the vain designs and idle discourses of a free government in      the cardinal contrived an interview at leghorn and at florence with adrian the pope in consequence of which cardinal soderini was imprisoned in the castle at rome and prevented from fomenting further designs against the medici and the cardinal de medici became a great favorite with the pope and the emperor having adjusted with the pope all his affairs the cardinal gave orders that hippolito a natural son of the duke giuliano and alexander a natural son of the duke lorenzo should be committed to the care of roso ridolfi and giovanni corsi that he might avail himself of them in time to maintain the reputation and authority of the state in the house of medici in the succession of the first cosimo who was called the father of his country in the best manner that he could being determined to exclude the other branch in the descendants of his brother lorenzo he proceeded however in this deliberation with much caution and reserve pretending to doubt of the brains as well as heart of giovanni de medici of whom in truth he was jealous for instead of meriting the contempt of the cardinal he had a liberality and a greatness of soul that enabled him to acquire the highest fame in the military art which he had pursued from his tender years in short according to nerli who knew him he was possessed of every virtue and quality of a great prince     in september      pope adrian died and after a long contest in which the cardinals were two months in the conclave on the nineteenth of november the cardinal de medici was created pope taking the name of clement vii and thus united the sovereign authority which he held in florence to the extensive power of the church upon which happy election as it was called there were great external signs of joy in florence in the fervor of which an event happened remarkable enough to be related—in the vacancy of the pontificate many wagers had been laid concerning the new election among many who lost was peter orlandini and being too importunately solicited by the winner to pay he answered in great wrath that he would not pay until it was determined whether the election had been made canonically or not these words were reported to the magistrates and after the importance of them had been considered by the cabal peter was summoned by the eight of the balìa and upon his appearance was seized and beheaded in a few hours soon after the creation of the pope the soderini were restored to their country because although at first their cardinal in conclave had been zealous against the medici his friends and particularly the cardinal colonna had labored to reconcile him and succeeded so far that his nephews were restored and he remained afterwards in the good graces of his holiness palla rucellai with nine others were sent ambassadors to render the usual homage to the new pope with these ambassadors the pope intrigued as he could no longer govern in florence to have one of the two young natural sons sent to govern the city some among the ambassadors and other florentines then at rome were well inclined others were timorous in disclosing their opinions some having notice of the secret and of the will of the pope and all well knowing what the pope had determined in order to satisfy him and constrained by necessity rather than swayed by any reason or inclination requested of his holiness one of the young men the pope sent hippolito the son of the duke giuliano under the guardianship of the cardinal di cortona because he was yet too young for so great a government and ottaviano de medici had the care of the family affairs and the control of the house and family of the magnificent hippolito as he was called and as his father     had been entitled at the time of their exile when he had the title of duke of nemours ottaviano was also to take the care of alexander the son of the duke lorenzo in this manner were all things disposed relative to the state of florence and the house of medici and thus they remained for four years until      when a general scrutiny was made which was very extensive and therefore made with universal satisfaction in      a civil war broke out in pistoia between the parties called panciatichi and cancellieri and the panciatichi prevailing expelled and banished as usual their adversaries and every thing was there soon settled the pope did not much interfere in the war in lombardy between charles and francis which followed the memorable defeat of the french before pavia when the king was taken prisoner and conducted to spain by the emperor in this tranquillity of foreign affairs the cardinal di cortona had however enough to do to cement his government amidst all their discontents and his own ungrateful manner of treating the citizens for the best friends as well as others did not find in the government of the pope that which had been promised nor those conditions and qualities of profit and honor which they relished so much in his mode of proceeding and government while he was cardinal nor could the cardinal di cortona perceive until in      it became very manifest how much it imported to the benefit of the state and the house of medici that he should study the character of the citizens and the principles and motives of their divisions especially after the party the most decided in favor of the medici and of consequence the most odious to the generality had been uncommonly weakened by the death of alamanni corbinelli serristori and some others the most warm in their party and the most jealous of any opposition to the present government after them too ridolfi died but he before his death by an intermarriage with the strozzi had been somewhat cooled and dreaded a change less than formerly the other party on the contrary were much exalted in their hopes and confidence as they had increased in reputation with the strozzi capponi and guicciardini who by their great quality and riches drew after them a strong band of honorable citizens with these concurred vettori being a relation of capponi and an intimate friend of     philip strozzi and as to the salviati although jacopo was shut up in rome there remained in florence averardo and piero the sons of alamanni the cousins of capponi francesco guicciardini and the relations of matteo strozzi having accumulated so much favor so great abilities such credit and so many intimate connections this party began to be as bold as they were active and powerful and niccolò capponi went on with the greatest reputation increasing it as he had discovered upon all occasions such popular principles and feelings and had acquired so much popular benevolence that those who were desirous of innovation and a more liberal government appeared to have found a sufficient support whenever a proper opportunity should occur of making a change these causes however produced no effect while the affairs of the war between the grand princes stood in suspense and unaltered as they did during the time that the king was prisoner to the emperor in spain but after he had ransomed himself and recovered his liberty and his kingdom he was more determined than ever to pursue his desire of recovering the state of milan it appeared to him though he had left his sons as hostages in the hands of the emperor that the conditions of the convention for his liberation were too hard to be observed not able to compose his mind determined at all hazards to renew the war and having found the princes of italy in the same disposition he agreed with the pope and venetians in a league against the emperor in which the pope would have the florentines named and comprehended this league commenced the war in lombardy in the army of the church and for the pope in place of a legate and with the title of locum tenens of the holy see was francesco guicciardini the conte guido rangoni then governor of the people of the church had the general government of the ecclesiastical state and giovanni de medici had the command of the infantry of that part abroad which was commanded by conte guido there occurred in this war many dissensions between giovanni and guido with the king in his camp was the marquis de saluzzo the duke of urbino was for the venetians this war began about the year      the imperial generals to divert the pope from the war of     lombardy invaded rome itself took the bourg of st peter and plundered the palace of the pope himself who being besieged in the castle of st angelo was constrained to make a convention to his disadvantage and to send philip strozzi to naples as a hostage for the security of the treaty which among other conditions contained a definite suspension of arms but all this success of the imperialists could not move the pope from the war the league sent giovanni de medici to the relief of rome but he was killed in a skirmish which relieved the pope from his jealousy though it exposed his capital to ruin after the death of giovanni those citizens of florence who desired an alteration in the government began to take courage and discover their intentions they proceeded to sound all the citizens whom they thought proper encouraging them to the enterprise and at the same time the younger nobility began to desire the same with those citizens who had encouraged and counselled them and to demand arms of the signori and the public coloring their request with the wish by such means to be able to serve and defend their country in so great and imminent a danger as appeared in the approach of a large hostile army they desired to be armed on no other account and for no other end than merely for the benefit and defence of the city veiled under such colors these youths were countenanced by all that party of citizens who desired to enlarge the government and who had taken upon themselves the universal protection of the people but these young men entered principally into an intimate connection with nicholas capponi with whom all the other citizens who desired to enlarge the government concurred and therefore in the council in the magistracy and in all things these youths were the favorites of capponi strozzi and louis guicciardini and they took such courage as to consult with them in secret cardinal di cortona being as he commonly was very slow in resolving was ill qualified to put a stop to this secret intelligence especially as he was obliged to wait for instructions from rome for every measure of his conduct the divisions among the citizens made him still more timid which was the reason that the spirits of these youths grew bolder every day the pope sent gherardo corsini to florence to alter the fortifications of the city but this measure was very unpopular the news     of the death of giovanni de medici threw the city into the utmost consternation and all these circumstances aided the young men in their design the people universally the citizens and the young noblemen were become very licentious in speech very free and bold in expressing their conceits and very tumultuous and disorderly going in armed parties in the streets in the night affronting the guards and disturbing the citizens with impunity at this time the pope sent cardinal cibo and ridolfi to assist cardinal cortona but this had little effect in      when the french army turned their march towards tuscany the suspected in florence began to increase and the youth became more systematical and ardent than ever in their desire to be armed which they now demanded with greater confidence as louis guicciardini was appointed gonfalonier cortona assembled in council many citizens to consult upon things of such consequence nicholas capponi began with great eloquence and without reserve to say that in treating of things of this importance which concerned the safety of all it was reasonable to hold the consultations in the palace among a larger number of the citizens that every one might more freely express his sentiments gherardo corsini spoke in opposition to capponi with spirit in favor of the state and while the principal citizens were engaged in these altercations the two armies were approaching the city the cardinal and the magnificent hippolito intended to ride out to the heads of the league and to guicciardini the popes lieutenant to concert measures for securing the affairs of florence in their present critical situation there were in the piazza many circles of young men who anxiously waited for disturbances and in the house of peter salviati a great rabble was collected of those who a little time before had been concerned in the nocturnal tumults which had been excited with the servants of the guard of the lieutenant of police within with the gonfalonier were those chiefs who at first with more order and better council had always managed those intrigues which were called the petitions for arms and already in the palace were nicholas capponi mathew strozzi and francis vettori to countenance the youths and contrive that whatever might happen should follow in some order but fortune which had otherwise determined caused an idle     and false report to be spread that the cardinal and hippolito were gone and had abandoned the state as not knowing how to maintain it any longer as these reports prevailed there suddenly arose in the piazza a confused rumor men bawled out the name of liberty the people the palace on a sudden was filled with citizens youths arms and confusion many began as if they had already conquered to lay hands on the signori and those citizens were threatened who did not say and do as this disorderly multitude desired the more prudent sort of persons elder and younger endeavored to preserve some order and proposed various judicious plans but the uproar was too great and violence had got possession the detail of the errors and disorders is too long to be recited but nothing would content the people short of a declaration that the medici were rebels and the signori were compelled to this measure even niccolò capponi and his colleagues who were present amidst such disorders in the palace repented of the deceit they had practised that day and perceived that states which attempt to change the foundations of their government by means of popular tumults though they may sometimes easily effect the alteration will always find it difficult either to stop or to regulate the movements of the people of which important truth the history of florence is full of fatal examples the cardinal and hippolito receiving intelligence of the tumults in florence returned with francis guicciardini and some other respectable characters and a military force they entered into an accommodation with the rioters and restored the government of the medici they made a new imborsation of the signori and imborsed as gonfalonier in      francesco antonio nori changed some of the signori for persons less suspected and took every prudent measure to secure the peace of the city but such was the danger that many absented themselves through fear not believing that the pope would pardon their behavior the city was in great confusion suspicion and dissatisfaction at this time the army turned towards rome which on the sixth of may      was sacked by the french in their turn and the pope was again shut up a prisoner in the castle philip strozzi flew to florence with the news of the ruin of the pope and began to promote a change in the government and his     lady clarissa the daughter of peter de medici sister of the duke lorenzo very gravely and boldly said to the cardinal cortona and hippolito that they ought to fly from florence and leave the city and republic free to the citizens upon this return of strozzi and in this ruin of the pope nicholas capponi matthew strozzi and francis vettori and all that party of citizens who had been humbled by the disorders of the twentysixth of april and the other party who were in the confidence and league of the medici seeing the pope ruined and a prisoner and no hope of assistance gave way to fortune some through fear and others from hopes which were held out to them by those citizens who desired a change in the state and the ruin of the medici cardinal cortona finding himself in such affliction and without any assignment of money because philip strozzi who was at that time depositary of the signori sent out of florence francesco del nero his deputy with all the money which had been collected a movement which was the most artful check in the whole game made a certain capitulation between the city and the medici and went out of florence with cardinal cibo and the magnificent hippolito on the seventeenth of may      without being banished and having the signori still in their favor who stood firm to the government and the house of medici to the last after their departure the capitulation was not observed and cardinal ridolfi who remained in florence was constrained to depart in a short time a popular government was introduced so large and licentious that philip strozzi and all those citizens who had such an inclination to the change and who were the heads and chiefs of the plan of restoring the state to the people were soon treated in such an injurious manner and in so many ways insulted that those who incline to weep over the follies and vices of their fellowmen will have incitements enough for their tears in reading the story     chapter third florence the history of segni which was intended to record the transactions of the republic or popular state from      to    0 begins with the eighth book of nerli and contains a circumstantial relation of every particular this same segni has written the life of his uncle niccolò capponi varchi too begins his history about the same time so that this period is well described by a variety of historians after the resolution taken by the cardinal di cortona and the principal citizens in the government to resign the authority of the balia and to leave the state by agreement liberally in the hands of the people the balia assembled on the sixteenth of may      and the provision by which liberty was restored to the people and the government wholly conferred upon them by the total annihilation of the balìa was received with great joy but that in so great a revolution they might proceed without scandal and ordain a government free pacific and quiet as perhaps those citizens who were the principal authors of the change and had been so zealous for it had flattered themselves they might although very different effects followed as generally happens to those who place themselves at the head of the people and are the instruments of changing a government they began by giving order and form to the government that is by taking the power into their own hands instead of giving it up to the people they gave authority to the signori the colleges and the council of seventy and to the members of the balia to make as well as they could a deputation of thirty citizens for each quarter giving a convenient share to the minor arts according to the classes at that time in the city and they ordered that such deputation should be made by ballot among the signori council magistrates and the thirty for the quarters who were thus ballotted for by the greatest popular favor or in other words who had the most black votes should be understood to be elected to which number of one hundred and twenty citizens together with the said magistrates and counsellors should be given full     authority to elect all officers meaning such as had been usually made by the council of a hundred until the twentieth of june all other officers were to be drawn from the ordinary purses till the same day after which it was determined that the council of the people called the greater council should commence its authority this greater council was arranged to have the same authority modes orders and forms which it had before      but with certain limitations and corrections the new council of signori collegi were to be one hundred and twenty the supernumeraries seventy and the balia of twenty to whom was given authority concerning the mode of making the new gonfalonier and the council of eighty was revived in the same form as before      then in the abundance of their gratitude to the medici for permitting the popular government to be revived they passed an indemnity to them and all their agents and forgave hippolito alexander and the duchess daughter of lorenzo late duke of urbino at last the old balia was annulled but the new government had scarcely assembled before fresh dissensions arose† some were against observing at all the laws made as now related especially relative to the greater council many without waiting for the term prescribed favored the assembling this council and acting in it and some were even for beginning tumultuously and without waiting for any limitations or corrections and without regarding this law in any degree many others were for removing the signori by force before the time though by the law they were to continue the month of june and because the provision or law made by the balia for peaceably restoring the state to the people was not observed as indeed it was not and because the concession and promise made by the medici was not strictly regarded it was given out that they were returning with force to recover the state which they had voluntarily quitted and which was not taken from them by force as many had endeavored in vain to do shortly before and many false rumors were created propagated and exaggerated to terrify and confound the contending parties these at last divided themselves   0 into two principal factions the strozzi soderini c were the heads of one and niccolò capponi of the other they had a long struggle to make the gonfalonier resign and get possession of the palace the greater council was brought into being and action before the time and many other alterations were made about the choice of magistrates but a tumult in the palace backed by all the persuasions of capponi was at last effective to prevail upon the gonfalonier to resign a new gonfalonier was now to be chosen and new regulations contrived for the election and among a multitude of candidates niccolò capponi was chosen niccolò capponi had great qualities but these alone were not the cause of his elevation it was indeed the secret influence of the medici interest which decided the election in his favor this was a very memorable example of electioneering it resembles in so many of its outlines all other elections which enter into the essence of every government in one centre that it is very interesting to every free citizen to consider it attentively sixty electors were drawn out of the purse of the grand council each of whom was to nominate a citizen of fifty years of age and among these sixty were to be balloted for in the greater council six candidates for the office of gonfalonier the six who upon this occasion had the most votes were carducci soderini a strozzi nero bartolini and niccolò capponi each of these candidates had his distinct principles system and party in favor of carducci were all that part of the citizens who most dreaded and hated the medici who wished for a licentious government through which they could be revenged by beating down every citizen who under the government of the medici had any reputation influence or power in strozzi concurred a part of the same citizens for the same reasons but their ardor for him was cooled by the recollection of the part he had formerly acted against savonarola in      in soderini united all those citizens who loved a government both free and quiet such as that which prevailed from   0  to      when peter soderini was gonfalonier for life the party of medici were united to a man against him with all other parties he was upon tolerable terms and this is not only natural but it is universally found in experience that the monarchical party is most averse in such conjunctures to the aristocratical and generally     coalesces with the democratical as these did upon this occasion in the choice of capponi the partisans of nero and bartolini were those only who hated all men who had ever held any place in government and wished for such as were entirely new amidst so many competitors and such a variety of parties and views capponi was elected though he had held offices of high trust and confidence under the medici he had in the whole course of his life public and private been a wise liberal and irreproachable citizen the reputation of his father and his ancestors had early rendered him illustrious he had as much resolution as he had ambition and had maintained the character of an honest man with all that of a free republican with the popular party and that of a man of honor and fidelity with the medici themselves who unanimously fell in with his views in the election naturam expellas furcâ tamen usque recurret the dominant party will in general in this manner prevail though their leaders are in danishment and even though excluded by law capponi had married a daughter of philip strozzi and this union of their families and even the diversity of their characters had contributed to increase the influence of the former after the election of the gonfalonier they proceeded to the choice of the signori for three months thus the party of capponi carried their point and accomplished all this weighty business by the first of june against the regulation that the old signori should continue through the month one of the first steps taken under the new government was an appointment by a plurality of votes in the greater council of five citizens under the title of syndics of the commons to examine the accounts of all those who had handled the public money or other property from the year      this was an invention of revenge and jealousy to destroy all the friends and     instruments of the medici and many other schemes of persecution against the party of medici were contrived without the smallest discretion and in spite of all the endeavors of capponi and philip strozzi to prevent them among other schemes of persecution the most tyrannical imaginable which this dominant party now triumphant practised against the minor party was at a time when a sum of money thirty thousand crowns was wanted by the public to make a law that twenty citizens should be elected who should be compelled to lend the public fifteen thousand crowns each such is the sense of liberty and the sacred regard to property in a government in one centre this popular tyranny was carried to an excess so intolerable that philip strozzi the very father of the revolution was obliged to fly to naples though his brotherinlaw was gonfalonier but returning some time after with buondelmonti they were both imprisoned for four years in the tower of volterra for making opposition to the new iniquitous taxes and the administration of the syndics acciaioli too who was then returned from his embassy in france was imprisoned for being in arrear for part of a subsidy which they had imposed upon him not only without equity but beyond his ability the gonfalonier could make no resistance to this popular fury which had now got the ascendant the great council and their three months men the signori governed without control and because they could not glut their vengeance upon the persons of the medici they took the images in wax of the popes leo x and clement vii and scourged and destroyed them and the magistrates themselves were supposed to have excited the youths who were guilty of this outrage so indecent in a catholic city at least no measures were taken to suppress or to punish the rioters an order was given by the magistrates the eight of the balìa that the arms and ensigns of the medici should be taken down in every place in the city and country public and private even in the private houses of the family even from the monuments over their tombs all this was done and many other invasions of their private property committed in direct contempt of the capitulation made with cardinal cortona and the magnificent hippolito when they resigned the authority of their balìa and voluntarily left the     state to the people it is astonishing that the people themselves should not have recollected that this courage had come into their hearts only from the present calamity of the pope which might soon be at an end and themselves made to feel the consequences of their present folly but in such a tumult of popular passions there is never any reflection prudence or foresight all these things happened in the first months of the new government while the pope was in the power of the imperialists a prisoner in the castle of st angelo the plague was now in florence and it was difficult to assemble the councils especially the greater council a law was therefore made that for the creation of officers and the expedition of private petitions the number of the greater council necessary to be present should be only four hundred but for the creation of the signori the colleges the ten of war and the eight of the balìa the number of eight hundred must be full as well as at the passing of new laws and the imposition of new taxes in december the pope accommodated his affairs with the emperor obtained his liberty and retired to orvieto for his greater security this event increased the number of opponents to the present government in florence and again brought into reputation those who had enjoyed it under the medici two factions now broke out in the city the rivals of capponi began to raise their heads and endeavored to render unpopular not only the friends of the medici but capponi and all those who had endeavored to unite all parties for the general tranquillity carducci a strozzi and soderini now formed a triumvirate at the head of one faction against capponi and his adherents and the young men and more active partisans of each side armed themselves both under the pretence of defending the palace this guard thus composed of two parties could not be united and gave much trouble to the gonfalonier the pope at this time made hippolito a cardinal a satirical libel was composed printed at siena and scattered all over florence in which a picture was drawn of such a gonfalonier as would be suitable to the present conjuncture but it was in all things opposite to the character of capponi and very much resembled carducci this device excited much licentious conversation in the city against capponi and many projects of a new gonfalonier at the approaching election     these canvassings drove capponi to a curious expedient to obtain his election he had always maintained a good character with the friends of savonarola the prophet and in this time of the plague all men were seriously inclined and the superstitious began again to be frantic niccolò took an opportunity in the greater council to make an oration upon the times in which by the aid of a retentive memory he repeated almost word for word one of the most terrible sermons of savonarola which predicted so many scourges to italy and to florence and after so much destruction such felicity to the florentine people and endeavored to show that the times thus predicted were arrived in the course of his harangue he wrought himself up to a fervor of enthusiasm fell upon his knees before the whole assembly and cried with a loud voice to god almighty for mercy his enthusiasm spread like a contagion and the whole assembly fell upon their knees after his example and cried out with a voice like thunder misericordia as they had been used sometimes to do when attending some of the most dreadful of savonarolas lectures and to complete his artifice or his frenzy he persuaded the people in commemoration of the tribulations chastisements and judgments of god and the better to secure the felicity promised by savonarola that they ought to elect for the peculiar king of the people of florence jesus the redeemer and as savonarola had said in some of his sermons that they ought to bear the ensigns of christ and the glorious name of jesus over the gates of the palace the proposition was made in council as soon as the gonfalonier had finished his oration that christ should be their king because according to st paul god had constituted him heir of all things and nerli who says he was present among so many hundreds of citizens declares that there were not more than twenty white beans or votes against the proposition when it was determined by ballot capponi by this proceeding made such an impression upon all orders and gained so many partisans that notwithstanding all the combinations of     the families of his competitors he carried his election in june      in this year the popes profound projects hitherto concealed with great art began to be discovered an ardent desire of restoring to his family their grandeur in florence was deeply rankling in his mind yet by an hypocrisy too natural to that as well as every other kind of ambition he endeavored by public declarations in the most unequivocal terms to persuade the florentines that nothing was further from his thoughts that he only desired the republic to acknowledge him as pontiff as all other princes and sovereigns had done and that they would not persecute his connections in their private affairs nor take away the ensigns and ornaments which belonged to his family with a commission to this purpose he had sent a florentine prelate as his ambassador to florence but as he had not obtained an audience he solicited through the medium of the king of france that they would send an embassy to him earnestly endeavoring to remove all their suspicions and by all appearances of candor frankness and familiarity in his dealings with them to dispose them to fall in with his insidious designs as all these devices proved unsuccessful he exerted himself to persuade lautrec that as those who governed in siena were dependents on the emperor it would be useful to his affairs to restore fabio petrucci to that city but lautrec from the opposition of the florentines would not engage in it failing in this way he labored in secret with pirro who complained of grievances against the sienese that with eight hundred men and some exiles from chiusi he should seize upon that territory and endeavor by that means to govern siena but the florentines insinuating to the french ambassador the viscount de turenne that the pope aimed at nothing but disturbing florence by the means of siena the ambassador persuaded him to give up the movement to chiusi capponi the gonfalonier held at this time† a correspondence with the pope by means of jacopo salviati by which the pope intended in time and with patience to overcome all difficulties and obtain the restoration of his family but the gonfalonier intended only to amuse the pope and prevent him from undertaking     any enterprise against the city with force thus both parties hoped to gain the advantage of time capponi gave hopes to the pope that the city might be disposed to agree with him as they had been used to do with other pontiffs provided his holiness would content himself to leave it in the quiet enjoyment of its liberty this correspondence though conducted with secrecy to avoid suspicion was communicated however to several of the first citizens in the government jacopo alamanni though he knew the correspondence was conducted with the privity of the government and for the good of the state was excited by the competitors of the gonfalonier to seize with violence serragli who had been sent by salviati upon the business and a great clamor was excited against the gonfalonier fresh libels were published and old ones reprinted the young men were again excited tumultuously to demand arms ensigns and officers to be elected by themselves and the triumvirate prevailed so far as to have a new ordinance for the militia by which an imborsation should be made of the young soldiers and a number drawn from time to time to keep the guard of the palace this was no better than making the government prisoners to the opposition alamanni at length proceeded to such violence tumult and outrage against the gonfalonier that the signori who were authorized by the greater council to defend the palace were obliged in order to suppress this armed sedition to order him to be seized he attempted to fly but was made prisoner condemned and beheaded this punishment excited fresh clamors against the gonfalonier especially among the young soldiers who now reproached their own leaders the triumvirate although they had secretly stimulated the offence for having concurred in the sentence perhaps to remove carducci and strozzi out of the way of giving farther disturbance to the government the first was appointed ambassador to france and the second to venice both declined the employment as the laws would not permit any citizen to renounce an embassy without alleging just impediments to be approved by the signori and colleges they applied to be excused but their reasons were not admitted and they fell under the punishment of admonition and other heavy penalties their arguments before the signori and colleges only served still more to divide and distract the public councils at last carducci went to france much against his will but strozzi     was condemned and admonished and this again alienated many friends from the gonfalonier and still further weakened his party but many grew weary of the endless confusions and anxieties arising from this government in one centre and that centre the nation those who had been in reputation in the time of the medici began to recover credit and the faction of the triumvirate lost ground the young men too were divided some warmly attached to the gonfalonier and others as zealous against him especially those who resented the punishment of alamanni the gonfalonier trusting to a good conscience and upright intentions proceeded in his negotiations with the pope with the participation of his principal colleagues in government and this he thought the more necessary since the ruin of the french army near naples made him suspect that the pope would reconcile himself with the emperor and indeed the pope at this time under a countenance of exquisite dissimulation had all his thoughts taken up with the recovery of the government of florence still amusing the french ambassadors and the other confederates with various negotiations and specious hopes of his adhering to the league nevertheless moved partly by the dread of the grandeur of the emperor and the success of his enterprises and partly by the hopes of inducing him more easily than he could the king of france to assist him in the restoration of his family to florence he had a stronger inclination to the emperor than to the king to facilitate this design he moreover most earnestly desired to draw to his devotion the state of perugia to which end he was believed to have stimulated braccio baglioni who constantly attempted new disturbances in that neighborhood in this conjuncture a fresh altercation happened in florence to the great misfortune of the government† excited against capponi at the end of the second year of his magistracy principally by the envy of some of the principal citizens who availed themselves of the jealousies and ignorance of the multitude the gonfalonier in all his administration as well as in his correspondence had two principal points in view to defend against fresh attacks of envy or resentment those who had been placed in honor by the medici and even to communicate to them in common     with the other citizens the honors and councils of the public and in things of no moment to liberty not to exasperate the spirit of the pope these points were both of great utility to the republic because many of those who had been persecuted as enemies of the government finding themselves in safety would have joined heartily with the others to defend it and because the pontiff though he eagerly desired the return of his family would if no fresh provocations were given him have less incitements to precipitation and less grounds for those complaints he was continually making to other princes but the ambition of many was opposed to this policy who knowing that they should be farther from a share in the government or have less influence in it if the friends of the medici men undoubtedly of more experience and merit were in it minded no other business than that of filling the multitude with suspicions of the pope and his party and calumniating the gonfalonier as not having a sufficient hatred against the medici that he might not obtain the prolongation of his magistracy for the third year capponi unmoved at these slanders and thinking it very necessary that the pope should not be provoked entertained him with letters and private messages as before related a practice which was begun and continued with the knowledge and approbation of the principal citizens in administration and with no other end than to divert the pope from taking some violent measures as fortune would have it having dropped by accident and incautiously in the councilchamber a letter from rome in which were some words capable of exciting suspicion in such as were uninformed of the original and foundation of the correspondence it fell into the hands of jacopo gherardi one of those who had seats in the supreme council and were most bitter against the gonfalonier certain seditious young men rose in arms and seized the palace retaining the gonfalonier in custody and calling together the magistrates and a multitude of citizens tumultuously deliberated and resolved that he should be deprived of his office which decision was confirmed by the larger council capponi was rendered incapable and it was ordained that the gonfalonier should be for the future but for one year and that his salary should be reduced one half the opposition of the     triumvirate had so turned the brains of the people by their intrigues that a great change was made in the government and francesco carducci a man proved by his past life by his condition and his depraved views to be unworthy of so great an honor was chosen in his place capponi was brought to his trial and defended himself with such eloquence and ability and showed so clearly that his conduct instead of being criminal had been dictated by the principal persons in government and merely for the public good that he was acquitted with honor and accompanied home to his palace by almost all the nobility upon the privation of capponi the pope no longer entertaining any hopes but from force sent the archbishop of capua in great haste to the emperor and as capponi had foreseen agreed to almost any terms that were demanded of him in consideration of having his family restored to florence and a natural daughter of the emperor given in marriage to his nephew alexander de medici the son of lorenzo late duke of urbino him the pope intended to invest with the secular grandeur of his house because some time before when he was sick and in danger of death he had made hippolito the son of giuliano a cardinal the emperor stipulated to give twenty thousand ducats a year with his daughter and to reinstate the pope in the possession of cervia ravenna modena reggio and rubiera and thus by their continual factions and divisions the citizens of florence found they had disgusted both the king of france and the emperor thus it usually happens when small republics and petty princes intermeddle in the wars of great monarchs the one in alliance thinks himself ill served while the other who is in enmity is most grievously offended and vows revenge the particulars of the negotiations at cambray the contradictory representations of their two ambassadors carducci and cavalcanti who were of different parties the propositions of an accommodation with the emperor made by the prince doria through louis alamanni and the rejection of them by the influence of francesco carducci the new gonfalonier and those citizens who were most jealous of the medici and their party are too tedious to relate though they were rejected and consequently the republic ruined by the confused method of treating   0 of foreign affairs in a numerous and mixed assembly according to the new constitution the emperor now arrived in person from spain and all the states of italy sent ambassadors to pay him their respects except florence the triumvirate with their new gonfalonier were afraid that either some of the old friends of the medici or some of the friends of capponi who was at the head of the middle or neutral party as it was called would be sent and by this means come again into reputation to prevent which they not only risked the emperors resentment but deprived themselves of the means of obtaining intelligence of any intrigue that might be begun between the pope and him they set on foot however in order as it was pretended to unite the citizens a subscription and an oath to maintain the present popular government but although the subscription was publicly opened in a book in the greater council many respectable citizens would not subscribe as they knew it to be impossible to unite the citizens cordially in such a plan the animosities of party grew warmer and pazzi a friend of capponi of a very respectable character was accused of uttering seditious words the prosecution occasioned great heat pazzi was tried and acquitted and rinieri would have been imprisoned for his false accusation if the gonfalonier and his party had not screened him from justice in this manner did the gonfalonier to increase his authority and to make himself feared seek every opportunity and employ every means to depress his adversaries and if he had succeeded against pazzi he intended to have pursued others with still greater animosity about the middle of august the emperor arrived in genoa and all the rest of italy sending him ambassadors a fresh effort was made in florence and as it could not now be prevented the gonfalonier conceived another device to defeat it he prevailed to have the powers and instructions so confined especially against agreeing with the pope that they could obtain no other answer from the emperor than first accommodate your affairs with his holiness but this was not all the evil in such governments nothing can be done with any degree of satisfaction to the public but by gratifying every party if one clamorous faction is left to excite a cry all is confusion upon this occasion four ambassadors had been appointed strozzi capponi     soderini and girolami who could no more agree among themselves than with the emperor or the pope they could never agree in writing their despatches soderini and girolami to maintain their city in the french interest and in its obstinacy not to agree with the pope in any manner would not concur with strozzi and capponi in writing clearly and plainly what the emperor had said to them in september the united armies of the pope and the emperor resolved on taking possession of perugia and the pope gave notice to malatesta baglioni to depart from that city malatesta demanded of florence men and money to defend it in order to give the most pointed offence to the pope and to make their defiance the more conspicuous they affected to extend it not only to his person but to the pontifical see they resolved to send three thousand men to the aid of malatesta to prevent the church from recovering one of its principal territories but with all this assistance malatesta was driven out of perugia and marched to florence in consequence of an order from the gonfalonier without the knowledge of the signori or council of ten and against their judgments as well as the general sense of the citizens who almost unanimously desired an accommodation with the pope a clamor now arose against the gonfalonier and his friends which obliged them to call to council many citizens of the other parties whom they had long neglected who carried a resolution to send other ambassadors to the pope with more ample powers of accommodation but the gonfalonier by delaying the commission had subtlety enough to defeat this resolution although it had been taken with very general satisfaction and he proceeded to take measures for the defence of the city against the confederated army many of the principal citizens alarmed at these delays harangued freely in council in favor of an accommodation but these were insulted in the street by the youth of the gonfaloniers party for their freedom of speech in council this occasioned a public complaint and so much general indignation that the gonfalonier was obliged to give way and despatch the ambassadors with full powers but he had still the art to delay the deliberations in council upon the terms of accommodation the ambassadors met with some difficulty to find the pope and could not agree among themselves soderini went to lucca strozzi to     venice capponi resolved to return to florence and labor openly and decidedly to persuade his fellowcitizens into an accommodation and girolami returned to oppose him capponi was taken sick and died at garfagnana  girolami therefore had a larger field opened to his† ambition to be gonfalonier to which end he accommodated his discourse variously to different parties of the citizens from those whom he knew to be desirous of peace he disguised his sentiments and concealed his late conduct to the neutral party he proposed that the city should stand upon its defence and make the best preparations for it but be ready to receive or even to propose any reasonable terms of accommodation on the first favorable opportunity but with the faction of the gonfalonier knowing their resolution to be fixed to see the city perish rather than yield to any accommodation he opened himself in private without reserve and declared himself devoted to their system it is the general opinion of historians as well as of segni that the divisions of the citizens into parties under the triumvirate and afterwards of those persons of middle rank who by means of their discord came after them into power as carducci castiglione and others were the true cause of the loss of their liberties for these persons though few in number among a people jealous of their liberties and full of parties and various humors found it easy to agitate their fellowcitizens in so violent a manner as to make them resolve upon sustaining a siege and     to render the defence glorious and although it is not denied that the pope gave a provocation to this and would have tried every method to recover florence yet the difficulties were so great that it is not doubted he would have been contented with reasonable conditions rather than venture on so atrocious and so impious a war we pass over all the marches of armies and intrigues of negotiation between the king of france the emperor the pope the venetians c which occurred before the fifth of october      when the prince of orange advanced before florence and laid siege to the city which was now well fortified and contained a strong garrison valori was sent by the pope as his commissary to the army and with him went a large number of florentine exiles of whom there was always a multitude scattered and wandering about all italy and waiting for the motion of troubled waters who now joined the united army of the pope and emperor as these had relations and connections in the city an alarm was excited and to intimidate every one from the thoughts of an accommodation the signori resolved that fiveandtwenty citizens should be declared suspected of disaffection to the popular government and confined in the palace under a strong guard and to complete their plan of terror against any one who might speak of an accommodation they cut off the head of carlo cocchi for saying that it would be better to restore the medici than to hazard the war and for talking of a parliament there is not in the whole history a fact more curious than this as it lets us into the true character of this government it was always called the popular government but it was really an aristocracy and the members of it dreaded an assembly or convention of the people which they called a parliament as much as they did the medici and soon after the same sentence and execution was passed upon francesco rigogolo for daring to speak of an accommodation† and by these arts and means     did this aristocratical tyrant the gonfalonier spread such a terror among the citizens that no man dared oppose his will and he obtained and exercised more power than the magistrates the cabal pratiche the ordinary council or the laws and he used it accordingly in the most arbitrary manner in raising money by various illegal measures by discarding magistrates and dissolving councils at his pleasure and in doing all other things that an unbridled despot could do it would be tedious and it is unnecessary to relate all the particulars of his arbitrary conduct of the assaults and sallies in one of which the prince of orange was killed the hopes fears deliberations distresses and famine of a siege which does infinite dishonor to this pope who had no right to subject the city and of a defence which was made by the obstinacy of an aristocratical junto for purposes of ambition equally reprehensible though colored with a pretence of a popular government but which was by no means conducted by the spirit of liberty or upon any principle of a free people on the contrary it was conducted from first to last without regard to any law or constitution and against the sense of a great majority of the people the defence was sustained from october to august on the ninth day of which month    0 four ambassadors were deputed to treat with don fernando da gonzaga who since the death of orange had the chief command of the army and the next day a convention was concluded the principal articles were that the city should pay eight thousand ducats for removing the army that the pope and the city should give authority to the emperor to declare within three months what should be the form of government salva nondimeno la libertà with a reservation of liberty that a pardon should be understood for every one of all injuries done to the pope his friends and     servants and that malatesta should remain with two thousand foot for the guard of the city until the emperors declaration should arrive it is made a question whether the general who commanded in florence was or was not a traitor to his cause varchi is very sanguine in the affirmative and produces letters in evidence but the citizens and garrison were reduced to such extremities for provisions that they could not have held out three days longer the pope on his part was not very anxious to fulfil his treaty while the money was getting ready to pay off the army valori the apostolic commissary in concert with malatesta having called together the people in the piazza according to the ancient custom of the city to make a parliament the magistrates and others conniving at it through fear instituted a new government contrary to the treaty giving authority by this parliament to twelve citizens who adhered to the medici to ordain in their own manner the constitution of the city who reduced it to that form which prevailed before the year      the army received their money the italian officers defrauded their soldiers whom they dismissed to seek their fortunes without their pay the spaniards and germans marched into siena to newmodel the government of that city and malatesta returned to perugia without any further declaration from the emperor and left the city of florence at the arbitrary disposition of the pontiff now began the punishments of the citizens for those in whose hands the government was left partly for the security of the state and partly by the hatred conceived against the authors of so great calamities and the resentment of private injuries but principally because such was the intention of the pope brought the principal citizens concerned in the late government to a trial and they were sentenced to death and executed others were confined without much regret sympathy or pity from any party for the friends of capponi and all the real friends of liberty regarded them as the cause of preventing an accommodation and the ruin of their country while the medici considered them as their bitterest enemies the pope sent the archbishop of capua to take care of the government who by the popes orders and to give more general satisfaction to the citizens caused the balìa to be increased in number to one hundred     and thirtysix made a general scrutiny for offices regulated commerce made a new imborsation of the six magistrates renewed the purses and disposed all other things according to his inclinations a quarrel arose between the cardinal hippolito de medici and the duke alexander and a contention for the sovereignty of florence but the pope and the emperor determined it in favor of alexander in      the ordinance of the emperor arrived and was formally accepted many of the best citizens some of whom had been always friends of the medici with great reluctance gave up the idea of a free government they still solicited the pope not to reduce the republic to an absolute principality but they could not agree among themselves some were for a dukedom limited only by councils others for restoring the state to the form it was formerly in under the medici and others for a more rational distribution of power but the pope was determined if he could to make his family and friends secure in      the popes intentions were made known and twelve citizens were appointed to reform the state the signori and the gonfalonier were abolished a council of two hundred was created and a senate of fortyeight the senate of fortyeight was to have the whole legislative and executive power and the council of two hundred were merely to consider private petitions and such things as should be referred to them by the senate four persons members of the senate were to be high counsellors of the duke and alexander and his heirs were made dukes and heads of the state guicciardinis account is that the pope interpreted the article in the treaty which had stipulated pardon not according to the sense but the letter not to comprehend crimes committed against the state but only injuries to the pope and his friends six of the principal delinquents were adjudged by the magistrates to be beheaded others to be imprisoned and a great number banished by these proceedings the city was weakened and those who had been concerned in the late troubles reduced to great necessities and the power of the medici became more free more absolute and almost monarchical in florence which remained exhausted of money by so long and grievous a war deprived within and without of many of its     inhabitants its houses and property destroyed abroad and more than ever divided within itself and this poverty was rendered yet more distressing by the necessity of procuring for several years provisions from foreign countries since there had been no harvests nor seeds sown the emperor in declaring the form of government neglecting the salvo of liberty pronounced according to the very instructions the pope had sent him that the city should be governed by the same magistrates as in the times when the medici ruled it and that alexander who was the popes nephew and his own soninlaw should be the head of the government and be succeeded by the children descendants and nearest relations of the same family he restored to the city all the privileges granted by himself or his predecessors but on condition to be forfeited whenever the citizens should make any attempt against the grandeur of the family of medici inserting throughout the decree words which showed it to be founded not only in the power conceded to him by the people and the parties but also on the imperial dignity and authority the spirit of families and the ambition peculiar to it is when once thoroughly enkindled a raging flame extinguishable only by death every new gratification of it is only a fresh addition of fuel to the burnings the passion of hercules cæsar and mahomet had now full possession of clement vii and the domination so perfidiously acquired over that noble city where his ancestors had laid the foundation of their power in a popularity among the basest dregs of a mob was not sufficient to satiate it the pontiff had fixed in his heart an ardent appetite for an alliance with france his ambition and thirst for this kind of glory which instead of being a virtue is a detestable vice stimulated him the more that he being only of a private family he had obtained for one natural son a natural daughter of so powerful an emperor he now hoped to procure for his legitimate niece a legitimate son of a king of france and he was not discouraged from this pretension by the jealousy that the king of france might form claims for his son and daughterinlaw on the state of florence by various negotiations he at length accomplished an interview with the king of france at marseilles the pontiff exerted his usual dissimulation to persuade     all the world that he went to this interview chiefly to finish the peace to treat of an enterprise against the infidels to reduce henry viii king of england to his duty in short with a single view to the public good but he could not conceal his real motive when he sent his niece on board the galleys which the king of france had ordered with the duke of albany her uncle to nizza these galleys after having conducted the lady to nizza returned to pisa and on the fourth of october      took the pope with many of his cardinals and landed them in a few days at marseilles he made his entry in form the king did the same they lodged in the same palace and made mutual demonstrations of uncommon affection the king desirous of gaining the popes heart requested him to send for his niece to marseilles which the pope though he pretended to treat first of public affairs most cordially desired as soon as catherine de medici arrived the marriage was celebrated with henry the son of the king of france and consummated immediately to the infinite joy of the pope who negotiating with the king in person completely gained his confidence and affection the pope returned from marseilles and soon after in      he died alexander had taken effectual measures to disarm all the citizens of florence friends as well as enemies and thought himself now secure philip strozzi however was highly disgusted and provoked both with the duke and the pope because he had not been able to procure one of his sons to be made a cardinal as his lady clarissa had often promised him and because two of his sons had been taken up with some other young gentlemen in the license of a masquerade and committed to prison by the lieutenant of the police and because of some quarrel that had arisen between peter his eldest son and salviati a favorite of alexander in this disgust he went with his sons as soon as he could obtain their liberty to france after the death of the pope animosities increased between the duke alexander and the cardinal hippolito and philip strozzi went from france to rome and as great divisions arose in florence on account of the difference between the duke and the cardinal and their negotiations with the emperor as had existed under the former government hippolito on a journey to meet the     emperor though in high health and strength was taken violently ill on the road and died not without strong suspicions of poison the death of the cardinal relieved the duke from all apprehensions of his intrigues but philip strozzi and the exiles from florence began to think of negotiating with the emperor and went to naples to meet him alexander too went to naples and great disputes arose before the emperor about the form of government strozzi and the exiles endeavoring to obtain a restoration of that kind of freedom which had been enjoyed formerly under the medici but alexander married the duchess marguerita the emperors daughter and returned to florence leaving strozzi and the exiles disappointed lorenzo di pierfranco de medici had accompanied alexander to this interview with the emperor at naples and there had entered into intimate friendship with peter strozzi† and the other florentine exiles and conceived that design of assassinating his friend and patron which he afterwards executed with so many circumstances of cool deliberation insidious malice and execrable villany he was a young nobleman in greater favor with the duke than any other to him after their return from naples to florence were communicated all the dukes private amours as well as all the most important councils of the state and the more effectually to secure his confidence lorenzo had acted the part of so active an instrument as to have drawn upon himself a universal odium among all parties in florence but particularly among the grandees and nobles at the same time he held secret intrigues and intelligence with philip strozzi‡ and all the exiles abroad and at home so artfully affected an aversion to arms and public affairs and to be so wholly devoted to his studies and his pleasures that the duke and his courtiers called him the philosopher§ varchi informs us∥ that he received his information of this horrid action from the only persons who could be capable of relating the whole truth because they were the only witnesses of it and agents in it from lorenzo himself in the city of paluello eight miles from padua and from scoronconcolo his confidant in the house of the strozzi in venice   0 lorenzo was born in florence the twentythird of march      the son of pierfrancesco di lorenzo de medici grandnephew of lorenzo brother of cosimo and of maria the daughter of tommaso di paolantonio soderini a lady of uncommon prudence and benevolence by whom his father dying early he was educated with the utmost diligence and care but he had no sooner acquired the knowledge of the classics in which his genius enabled him to make a rapid progress than he was taken from the care of his mother and his tutor and began to discover a restless and insatiable disposition to plunge himself into vice and soon afterwards in imitation of philip strozzi he began to laugh at every thing divine and human and to associate himself with persons of base condition and character rather than with his equals these by continual flatteries and fomenting his passions led him into vice and folly of every kind particularly into all the extravagances of brutal appetite in his amours respecting neither sex age condition nor secrecy while he sought an intercourse with all he affected to esteem none yet he had an equally extravagant passion for glory and left no empirical artifice unattempted in his words or actions by which he thought he could acquire a name either of a gallant man or a shrewd one he was nimble and active rather thin than otherwise and for this reason he affected to call himself lorenzino he never laughed at most he only smiled his air and action were more remarkable for grace than elegance and his countenance was dark and melancholy in the flower of his youth although he was beloved beyond measure by the pope clement vii he had formed in his mind a project as he said himself after he had killed the duke alexander to assassinate his holiness he corrupted francesco di rafaello de medici the rival of the pope a youth of excellent erudition and the most promising hopes to such a degree of profligacy that he seemed to be in a manner out of his wits so that having become the derision of the whole court of rome to avoid a greater disgrace he was sent back as a madman to florence at this time lorenzo fell into disgrace with the pope and gave universal disgust to the roman people for another reason one morning in the arch of constantine and in other places of rome many ancient statues were found without their heads the pope was so exasperated that not thinking of lorenzo he     gave orders that whoever had done the mischief excepting only the cardinal de medici should without process trial or delay be hanged up by the neck the cardinal was obliged to go to the pope and intercede for lorenzo as a young man and passionately fond like all their ancestors of such antiquities but it was with difficulty he could appease the indignation of the pope who called him the infamy and reproach of the house of medici lorenzo however was obliged to depart from rome with two public proclamations after him one forbidding him to remain any longer in that city and the other promising not only impunity but rewards to any one who would kill him and francesco molza a man of great eloquence and celebrated for his knowledge of the grecian roman and tuscan literature made a public oration against him in the roman academy in which he covered him with all the reproaches possible with all this infamy he returned to florence and began to make his court to the duke alexander he understood so well the arts of hypocrisy and flattery and counterfeited so perfectly an absolute submission to him in all things that he made him believe he was a faithful spy upon the exiles abroad laying at the same time under this simulation secret plots with these fugitives and every day showing him letters received from one or another of them to remove every suspicion of daring enterprise he affected the character of a coward and would neither exercise in arms nor wear them about him so that the duke took a pleasure in rallying him upon his pusillanimity he affected to be wholly devoted to books and studies walked much alone and appeared to have no ambition for honors or desire of property in so remarkable a manner that they called him the philosopher he complied with the inclinations of the duke in all things and aided him in all occasions of need especially against signor cosimo his second cousin against whom he bore an unbounded hatred either because they were of different or rather contrary characters by nature or by reason of a lawsuit of very great importance which cosimo had instituted against him for the inheritance of their ancestors by all these artifices the duke was deluded into a confidence in lorenzo so perfectly secure that not contented with employing him as a pimp in his amours with all sorts of women religious as well as secular virgins wives or widows noble or ignoble young or old he now demanded of him to procure     a sister of his own mother on her fathers side a young lady of admirable beauty and equal modesty the wife of lionardo ginori who lived not far from the rear entrance of the palace of the medici lorenzo who waited only for a similar opportunity represented to him that the intrigue would be attended with difficulty though not from himself for in one word all women were alike and upon this occasion the prospect was the better because the husband was at naples where he had spent much of his fortune in dissipation although he had never dared to speak to the lady on the subject he affirmed to the duke that he had and that he had found her very obstinate but he promised that he would never cease to seduce her by bribes flatteries and every species of corruption until he brought her to condescend in all things to their will in the mean while he was engaging not less by actions than with words one michele del tovalaccino nicknamed scoronconcolo for whom he had procured a pardon for a murder he had committed though a reward had by proclamation been set upon his head to this ruffian he often complained of a certain intriguing personage at court who without the smallest provocation had bantered slandered and insulted him with his jokes upon all his words and actions but that in the name of god— at which words scoronconcolo rousing to resentment suddenly cried name him only and let me alone to manage him he shall never give you another ill word or look here the conversation ended for the present but scoronconcolo who found himself every day more and more caressed and loaded with favors by lorenzo at length pressed him earnestly to name his enemy and not to doubt of his being soon put out of his way lorenzo answered alas no the person be he who it may is a great favorite of the duke scoronconcolo replied in the language of a bully i will assassinate him if he were christ himself lorenzo then perceived that his design had succeeded having invited him one day to dinner as he often did notwithstanding the remonstrances of his mother and the reproaches of the world he said to him courage courage in that affair which you promised me so bravely i am sure you will not fail me as i will never fail you at any time in any thing in my power i am satisfied and resolved but in order that we may do the business with security i will see to getting him to a place where there may be no danger to you and i have no doubt i shall succeed     the same night appeared to him to be the most proper time because signor alexander vitelli was absent upon an excursion to the city of castello and he took the opportunity after supper to whisper in the ear of the duke and to say to him that at last by the promise of money he had disposed his aunt to comply and therefore he must watch his opportunity to come alone and very cautiously into his chamber taking particular care for the honor of the lady that no one should see him either enter or go out and that he himself would go immediately for her certain it is that the duke having put on a robe of satin lined with fur according to the neapolitan fashion went out to walk with four of his courtiers whom he soon dismissed saying he wished to be alone shortly after he went to the chamber of lorenzo where he found a good fire ungirded his sword and threw himself down on the couch lorenzo suddenly seized his sword and winding hastily the belt round the hilt so that it might not be casily unsheathed laid it at the head of the duke behind his pillow and advised him to repose himself he secured the door that no one might come in and went away to find scoronconcolo having done this he said to him in a transport of joy my dear brother now is the moment i have shut up in my chamber that enemy of mine and he is fast asleep let us go thither said scoronconcolo when they were on the landingplace of the stairs to the chamber lorenzo turned about and said dont mind whether it be a friend of the duke or not only mind you to secure his hands i will do it replied his friend even though it were the duke himself every thing is so prepared said lorenzo with a joyful countenance that he cannot escape from our hands let us make haste let us go said scoronconcolo lorenzo lifted up the latch and let it fall again at the second attempt he entered and cried out signor are you asleep the uttering these words and running him through and through with a short sword was the work of the same moment this stroke alone had been mortal for passing through the reins he had perforated the diaphragm which divides the upper ventricle where are the heart and the other vital members from the lower where are the liver and the other members of nutrition and of generation the duke who either was asleep or remained with his eyes shut as if he had slept receiving such a blow leaped up on the bed and threw himself backwards to fly towards the door making use of a stool     which he had seized on for a shield but scoronconcolo seizing an opportunity gave him a stroke with a knife upon the visage which laid open one of his temples and clove the greatest part of his left cheek lorenzo having dragged him upon the bed held him down upon his back and bore upon him with the whole weight of his body and that he might not cry out he attempted to stop his mouth with his fingers saying signor fear not then the duke assisting himself as well as he could seized the thumb between his teeth and bit it with such rage that lorenzo fallen on his back and not able to handle his sword was obliged to call out for help to scoronconcolo who ran to his aid and taking his aim sometimes on one side and then on the other could not strike alexander without first or at the same time striking lorenzo clasped tightly in his arms he then attempted to thrust at him with the point of his sword between the legs of lorenzo but making no other impression than to bore the bed he laid his hand on a knife which he had by accident about him and stuck it in the throat of the duke turning it like a wimble he was already however very near dead from the effects of the first blow by which he had lost so much blood as to have flooded almost the whole chamber it ought not to be forgotten that through the whole of this tragical scene while lorenzo held him under and he saw scoronconcolo fumbling about him with his sword and knife to murder him he never once complained or begged for mercy or let go his hold of that thumb which he held firmly between his teeth the duke as soon as he was dead slid off the bed upon the floor but they took him up besmeared all over with blood placed him again upon the bed and covered him with the same pavilion with which he had concealed himself before he first fell asleep or made a show of being asleep which in the opinion of some he designedly did because knowing himself unskilful in the ceremonies of politeness and the lady whom he expected a mistress in elegant conversation he wished in this manner to avoid the necessity of exchanging fine speeches with her lorenzo after he had disposed of the duke not so much to see whether they had been heard as to restore himself and recover his spirits much exhausted by fatigue placed himself at one of the windows which overlooked the broad street some persons in the house particularly madam maria the mother of cosimo had     heard a noise and a trampling of feet but no one had stirred because lorenzo with this view had for some time before been used to bring into this chamber companies of his comrades drinking rioting and making a show of quarrelling crying out murder treason you have killed me and other exclamations of that kind when lorenzo had restored himself he made scoronconcolo call one of his footmen named freccia and show him the dead body which he recognized with such astonishment and horror that he was with difficulty restrained from crying out to what purpose he did this he neither explained to the historian nor was he able to conjecture unless it was upon the same principle that nothing which lorenzo did from the moment of the death of alexander to the time of his own death many years afterwards in venice ever succeeded or appeared to be well judged he took from francis zeffi his maître dhotel a small sum of money all that he had by him in cash and taking with him the key of the chamber he left the house with scoronconcolo and freccia and having previously obtained from the bishop of marzi a license for posthorses under color of going to his country seat of cafaggiuolo to see giuliano his younger brother who as he pretended had written to him that he was at the point of death with the cholic went directly to bologna where he dressed his thumb which was found marked for life and there related to silvester aldobrandini the judge the whole transaction but the judge thinking it a romantic fiction would not believe and very imprudently neglected to take any notice of it until the arrival of the chevalier marsili who with some others went in pursuit of lorenzo the latter in great haste and fatigue arrived at venice on the monday night and with much ado convinced philip strozzi that under that key which he held out to him he had locked up the duke alexander with his throat cut and dead of many wounds philip at last believing him embraced him called him their brutus and promised him that he would marry his two sons peter and robert to his two sisters lorenzo excused himself for not having assembled the people after the death of the duke for three reasons one was that he had been to the houses of several of the popular citizens but some had not heard and others had not believed him another was that he     had left it in commission with zeffo to open the chamber early in the morning and go in quest of giuliano capponi and other citizens lovers of liberty and tell them what he had found there thirdly that scoronconcolo had not ceased to stimulate him to depart saying to him every minute let us save ourselves we have done but too much but thus much is certain that as no conspiracy was ever so deliberately meditated nor more completely executed before so none was ever so stupidly and vilely conducted after the fact nor was there ever any one from whence resulted effects more contrary or more hurtful to the perpetrator and more prosperous and profitable to his enemies the first of whom without all controversy was the signor cosimo i will not dispute says varchi whether this act was cruel or compassionate commendable or blameworthy since no man can resolve that question and give a true answer to it who does not know for what reason and to what end lorenzo was induced to commit it if he was urged to so great an enterprise not simply at the hazard of the government of florence which upon the death of the duke without legitimate descendants would have fallen to him but also of his own life in order purely to deliver his country from a tyrant and restore her liberty as he affirmed i should think that no praises that could be given him would be high enough and no rewards could be bestowed upon him which would not be below his merit is it not astonishing that such a historian should admit of a doubt whether the motives of lorenzo could be good ones is it possible to read his own history and not see that this struggle was merely between different branches of the same family of medici for the sovereignty and that there was not a ray of public virtue or love of liberty left in any of them strozzi the rival family of medici had married a medici and could not bear that alexander should rule his character was too vile to be redeemed from infamy by his hypocritical affectation of republican simplicity and his renouncing all titles but that of philip but he had great family connections and was countenanced by france and therefore might possibly recover his influence and power in florence this made it dangerous for the historian to mark the conduct of lorenzo with that decided indignation which it merited     some were of opinion that he was moved to this action merely by the malice of his nature and the depravity of his own heart others thought that he ventured on this danger to cancel the ignominy of the two roman proclamations and the oration made against him by molza others thought him agitated solely by desire to make his name immortal an ardent passion that with all his crimes and vices had always incredibly tormented him the right of a nation to depose a tyrant and to destroy him if he cannot be otherwise deposed is as clear as any of our ideas of right or wrong in the roman republic it was made an early and a fundamental law by the aristocratics however that it should be not only lawful but meritorious and glorious to kill a tyrant and brutus therefore acted the exalted part of the best citizen but if the right of single citizens when good and virtuous and intending only the public good to kill a tyrant was as clear as that of treading on the head of an adder or hunting down a devouring wolf it would by no means follow that one tyrant might claim a right to destroy another merely to take his place the people of florence were now so totally devoted to the medici family that there was no party among them but what was headed by some branch of it the blood of the medici must in all events govern them and the difference between them was worth very little strozzi and lorenzo were worse than alexander and the only tolerably good man among them was cosimo whom they all hated but whom providence was pleased to call to the government in this awful manner the silly tales of prognostics the enthusiasm of the disciples of savonarola and the confusions and terrors among the principal people upon the first suspicion and final discovery of the dukes destiny are not worth repeating the council of fortyeight were assembled but were not agreed in opinion canigiani proposed that in place of the deceased duke giulio his natural son should succeed but there was no other person present who did not either smile at his folly or express indignation for besides that the child was not five years old this was known to be the inclination and secret motion of cardinal cibo lorenzos brother who wished to be the tutor and therefore governor of the city after him the signor     cosimo de medici was proposed who knowing nothing of what had happened was at mugello fifteen miles from florence at his countryseat of trebbio at this nomination all appeared to be struck and looking at one another seemed ready to accept it every one knowing that cosimo was the next heir after lorenzo according to the declaration of the emperor but palla rucellai without doubt in favor of philip strozzi to whom he was attached warmly opposed this proposition and said that so many citizens and of such consequence were abroad that nothing of importance especially so great an affair ought to be determined on and notwithstanding all that was urged by francesco guicciardini and francesco vettori he persisted obstinately in his objections and occasioned some confusion in council at another day however cosimo was elected head of the commonwealth accepted the trust and behaved in it with so much wisdom that those who from his moderate and composed behavior before believed him to be possessed of but mean abilities were constrained to confess that god had granted him discretion with the dukedom intelligence was scattered throughout all italy with incredible celerity of the death of alexander and by all the florentine exiles the name of lorenzo di pierfrancesco de medici was exalted in praises to the skies not only as the parallel of brutus but greatly surpassing him varchi wonders that so many citizens of great prudence and especially guicciardini who conducted the whole of this election should have suffered themselves to be so far blinded and transported by their ambition or avarice or both as not to see what they were about indeed no man is ever to be praised perhaps never to be justified in consenting to the surrender of a free government and guicciardini appears much to blame for not endeavoring to newmodel the commonwealth upon this occasion but most probably he knew what varchi himself confesses that the florentines were at this time all either avaricious or ambitious and the major part of them proud envious and malicious and therefore that none of them could be trusted by him or by each other he probably believed that delay or any attempt to restore liberty or reform the constitution would only give an opportunity to     strozzi lorenzo and the exiles to assume the dukedom in reality under the alliance of france he moreover probably thought it impossible among an ignorant people and so many corrupt factions to amend the constitution and that a sovereignty in one was preferable to their old fluctuating aristocracy disguised under the name only of a popular state the exiles were still restless and endeavored to excite fresh wars against their country but cosimo by his abilities address and activity defended his authority and was afterwards confirmed not only as head of the state but as duke and sovereign and here ended the shadow of a free government let the reader now run over again in his own mind this whole story of florence and ask himself whether it does not appear like a satire written with the express and only purpose of exposing to contempt ridicule and indignation the idea of a government in one centre and the right constitution of a commonwealth if he suspect that this mean sketch is in any degree varied by prejudice from the truth let him read over any historian of florence as machiavel guicciardini nerli nardi varchi villani or ammirato and then say whether it is not a libel upon turgot and nedham from the beginning to the end it is one continued struggle between monarchy and aristocracy a continued succession of combinations of two or three parties of noble rich or conspicuous families to depress the people on the one hand and prevent an oligarchy or a monarchy from arising up among themselves on the other neither the first family nor any of the others their rivals made any account of the people excepting now and then for a moment for the purposes of violence sedition and rebellion instead of devising any regular method for calling the people together with a reasonable notification beforehand of the time place and subject of deliberation a little junto of principal citizens concert a plan in secret among themselves give notice previously to such as they please their own dependents and partisans order the bells to be rung and a little flock of their own creatures assemble in the piazza there the junto nominate a dozen or a score of persons for a balìa to reform the state at their pleasure no reasonable method of voting for them no instructions given them the people huzza and all is over   0 what ideas are here of the rights of mankind what equality is here among the citizens what principle of national liberty is here respected what method is this to obtain the national sense the public voice can this be called the voice of god when the balìa is appointed what is the question before them is there any inquiry how the government can be made a fair equal and constant representation of the nation and a sure instrument for collecting the public wisdom the imborsations are made and eight hundred names are put in the purses these alone are citizens all the rest are to have no vote these appoint the signori a small council for the ordinary administration and the gonfalonier who has no more power than a doge of venice nor so much dignity the great council is the centre in which all authority is collected and he who had most influence in it governed in reality whoever were the signori or the gonfalonier consequently the council and signori too were always divided into parties at the head of whom were always two of the most noted families and the only question really was which should be first as the waves and winds determined sometimes one and sometimes another prevailed and took vengeance of their opponents by banishments and confiscations the executive power was sometimes managed by the signori and sometimes by the grand council the judicial power was always the tool of the prevailing faction was there one year one moment in the whole history when the citizens could be truly said to enjoy the blessings of liberty equality safety and good order if you fix your eye upon any period from the beginning to the end of the republic and suppose the gonfalonier possessed of the whole executive power with a negative upon the legislature the signori and grand council made separate and independent branches of the legislature though elected periodically by the people and the judges made during good behavior would not those terrible disorders have been prevented the negative to the gonfalonier is not proposed because he is a wiser or a better man than others but merely as a constitutional instrument of selfdefence without it he cannot defend the legal authority which the constitution has given him but the executive power will be pared away or wrested out of his hands by the encroaching disposition of human nature in the two houses if he wantonly     uses his negative for other purposes a case that can rarely happen a new gonfalonier must be appointed but if his ministers are made responsible for the advice they give him the two houses will always have a remedy an honest representative of the commons will always have another remedy by withholding supplies as this account of florence was introduced by some reflections of a modern author it cannot be concluded with more propriety than by some others from the same able and liberal writer in his parallel of the italian republics of the middle ages with those of ancient italy he says whoever shall read in the annals of the cities of lombardy and in the chronicles of tuscany how the people passed so frequently both in external wars and in civil factions from battles to peace and from domestic life to arms and hostilities and that perpetual succession of accords rebellions and tumults will be apt to believe that he sees copied under different names the wars of the romans with the latins and the volsci the continual quarrels of the plebeians with the patricians and the animosities of the senate against the tribunes and sometimes it will happen to him that in reading for example the florentine history of scipione ammirato he will think he has in his hand a translation into his own language of livy the manner of proclaiming and prosecuting war and of concluding peace which was practised by the ancient italians in the time of camillus and of pyrrhus is not very different from that which we observe in the age of frederic ii and the manfreds and in the internal concerns of the cities both in the one and the other period the cruelty and the pride of the nobles towards the plebeians and the injustice of the people in their demands as soon as they had discovered their own strength and had begun to lay their hands on the government were equal the one and the other were animated with the same spirit agitated by the same humors and subject to the same revolutions that supreme love of their country which on occasions of public danger silenced and appeased their private quarrels and enmities reigned equally at all times in both the same simplicity of manners the same severity of life the same patience of poverty and fatigue to this is to be added     the use and exercise of arms by which every little nation if it cannot make extensive conquests at least may preserve its own liberty finally he will observe with pleasure how after the ancient italians and those people who in the middle ages arose from the ruins of the kingdom of the lombards and of the second western empire the cities which appear to have had the narrowest territory and the most modern original not only maintained their freedom for a long time but increased in power and dominion whereas the most able and the most ancient passed more easily under the yoke either of tyrants of their own or of foreign powers we shall see in like manner a great resemblance in the fortune of the tyrants of the ancient italian cities and those of the republics of tuscany and lombardy in the age of frederic ii and the following and may very well find reasons to compare ezzelino of romagna with tarquin the proud the marquis oberto pelavicino buosodadoara and martino della torre with porsenna king of chiusi and with other like princes or supreme magistrates of the ancient tuscans latins campanians and samnites from which we have shown that the free and independent cities passed sometimes under the yoke of some powerful citizen who made himself the master or under the dominion of a tyrant of some other neighboring city so that a signor of padua of milan or of verona obtained the government of many other cities of lombardy equally free and independent     chapter fourth machiavels plan of a perfect commonwealth machiavel from his long experience of the miseries of florence in his own times and his knowledge of their history perceived many of the defects in every plan of a constitution they had ever attempted his sagacity too perceived the necessity of three powers but he did not see an equal necessity for the separation of the executive power from the legislative the following project contains excellent observations but would not have remedied the evils the appointment of officers in the council of a thousand would have ruined all the good effects of the other divisions of power there is some doubt about the time when it was written nerli and nardi think it was addressed to clement vii but the english editor supposes it was leo x and his opinion is here followed about the year      leo x being informed of the discords that were ready to break out in florence gave a commission to machiavel to draw up a plan for the reformation of that state he executed this commission with great abilities and the most exquisite subtilty of his genius and produced a model in the opinion of some of a perfect commonwealth the sovereign power is lodged both of right and in fact in the citizens themselves there are three orders of men in every state and for that reason there should be also three ranks or degrees in a republic and no more nor can that be said to be a true and durable commonwealth where certain humors and inclinations are not gratified which otherwise must naturally end in its ruin those who model a commonwealth must take such provisions as may gratify three sorts of men of which all states are composed that is the high the middle sort and the low machiavel by these observations demonstrates that he was fully convinced of this great truth this eternal principle without the knowledge of which every speculation upon government must be imperfect and every scheme of a commonwealth essentially     defective taking this fundamental principle along with us let us give an abridgment of this valuable discourse the reason why florence has so often changed its form of government is because there never was yet either a commonwealth or monarchy established there upon true principles a monarchy cannot be stable where the business which should be directed by one  is submitted to the determination of many nor can a commonwealth be durable where humors are not gratified which must otherwise be the ruin of it maso moulded the republic into a sort of aristocracy in which there were so many defects that it did not continue above forty years nor would it have lasted so long but for wars which kept it united the defects were that power was continued too long in the same persons that the elections were subject to fraud and underhand practices there was no check upon the grandees to deter them from forming parties and factions which are the destruction of a state the signori had but little reputation while they had too much authority they had a power of taking away the life and property of any citizen without appeal and of calling the people together to a conference whenever they pleased so that instead of being a defence and protection to the state they were rather an instrument of its ruin when they were under the influence of any popular or ambitious man raw young men of little experience and abject condition were introduced into the signori but what was of the last consequence was that the people had no share at all in the government all these defects together occasioned infinite disorder and confusion and if wars had not kept the state united it must have been dissolved long before it was this form was succeeded by that of cosimo afterwards the city endeavored to resume the form of a republic but the measures taken were neither calculated to gratify the humors of all the citizens nor had sufficient force to correct them so far from being a true and perfect commonwealth a gonfalonier for life if an able and bad man might easily have made himself absolute lord if a weak and good man he might have been pulled from his seat and that establishment overturned there     was not strength in that government to support the standardbearer if a good man nor to check and control him if a bad one the reforms which were made were not with any view to the public good but to strengthen and support different factions in their turns even the ends of faction were not answered because there was always a discontented party which proved a very powerful instrument in the hands of those that were desirous to effect any change or innovation in the state no form of government can be devised that will be firm and lasting which is not either a true principality or a true commonwealth all intermediate forms between these two extremes will be defective for a principality can only be ruined one way and that is by descending into a commonwealth the same may be said of a commonwealth also for the only way by which it can be ruined is by ascending to a principality all intermediate forms may be ruined two ways that is either by ascending to a principality or descending into a commonwealth and this is the cause of their instability those who model a commonwealth must make such provisions as may gratify three sorts of men of which all states are composed that is the high the middle sort and the low and though there is a great equality among the citizens of florence yet there are some there who think so highly of themselves that they would expect to have the precedence of others and these people must be gratified in regulating the commonwealth these people then will never be satisfied if they have not the first rank and honors in the commonwealth which dignity they ought to support by their own personal weight and importance it is absolutely necessary to gratify the ambition of all the three several ranks of people which may be done by electing sixtyfive citizens of not less than fortyfive years of age in order to give dignity to the government fiftythree out of the highest class and twelve out of the next who should continue in the administration for life subject to the following restrictions—in the first place one of them should be appointed gonfalonier of justice for a term of two or three years if it is not thought proper to appoint one for life and in the next the other sixtyfour citizens already elected should be divided into two distinct bodies each consisting of thirtytwo one of which divisions in conjunction with the standardbearer should govern the first     year and the other the next so that they would be changed alternately every year and all together should be called the signoria after this let the thirtytwo be divided into four parts eight in each every one of which should reside three months in its turn with the standardbearer in the palace and not only assume the magistracy with the usual forms and ceremonies but transact all the business which before passed through the hands of the signori the council of eight and the other councils all which must be dissolved this should be the first member or rather the head of the state and by this provision the dignity of the signori will be restored for as none but men of gravity and authority will ever sit there it will be no longer necessary to employ private men in the affairs of state which is always of prejudice to any republic since the thirtytwo who are not in office that year may be advised with upon occasion sent upon embassies and made useful in other functions let us now come to the second order in the state since there are three orders of men in every state there should also be three ranks or degrees in a republic and no more upon which account it is necessary to prevent the confusion occasioned of late by the multiplicity of councils in our city which have been established not because they were conducive to good order but merely to create friends and dependents and to gratify the humor and ambition of numbers in a point which yet was of no service to liberty or the public because they might all be corrupted and biased by party the council of seventy that of a hundred and that of the people and commonalty should all be abolished and in the room of them i would appoint a council of two hundred every member of which should be not less than forty years of age a hundred and sixty of them to be taken out of the middle class and the other forty out of the lowest but not one out of the sixtyfive they should also continue for life and be called the council elect which council in conjunction with the sixtyfive should transact all the affairs that used to be transacted by the abovementioned councils now supposed to be abolished and vested with the same degree of authority and all the members of it appointed by your holiness for which purpose as well as to maintain and regulate these provisions and others that i shall mention hereafter it is necessary that a degree of authority equal     to that of the whole collective body of the people of florence should be vested by a balìa in your holiness and the cardinal de medici during the lives of both and that the magistracy of the eight di guardia as well as the balìa should be appointed from time to time by your holiness it is likewise expedient for the support of your authority that your holiness should divide the militia into distinct corps over which you may appoint two commissioners one for each by these provisions two out of the three classes may be thoroughly satisfied it remains now to satisfy the third and lowest rank of the citizens which constitutes the greater part of the people for this purpose it will be necessary also to revive the council of a thousand or at least one of six hundred citizens who should nominate all the magistrates and officers in the same manner they used to do formerly except the above sixtyfive the council of two hundred the eight di guardia and the balìa without satisfying the common people no republic ever yet stood upon a stable foundation the state being thus modelled no other provisions would be wanting if your holiness and the cardinal were to live for ever but as you are subject to mortality it is necessary if you would have the republic continue firm and strongly supported on every side in such manner that every one may see himself perfectly secure that there should be sixteen standardbearers appointed over the companies of the citizens which may be done either by your own authority or by leaving the appointment to the great council remembering only to increase the number of the divieri assistants to the gonfalonier and commanding detachments of the people under him that so they may be more spread over the city and that none of the gonfaloniers should be of the sixtyfive after their appointment four proposti should be drawn out of them by lot and continue in office one month so that at the end of four months they will all have been proposti out of these four one should be drawn to reside for a week only with the eight signors and the gonfaloniers in the palace by which rotation all the four will have kept their residence there at the end of the month without the presence of this officer the said resident signori should not be allowed to pass any act nor should he himself have any vote there but only be a witness and inspector of their proceedings to which he may be suffered to     put a stop till he has asked the opinion of all the thirtytwo together and had the matter fully discussed by them but even the thirtytwo when all together should not have power to resolve upon any thing except two of the said proposti were present who should have no further authority than to put a stop to their resolutions for a time and report them to the council elect nor should that council have a power of resolving upon any thing except six at least of the sixteen gonfaloniers and two proposti were there who should only have the liberty of taking the matter out of the hands of that council and referring it to the great council provided that any three of them should think it necessary so to do and as to the great council it should not be allowed to meet unless twelve of the gonfaloniers and three of the proposti at least were there who might give their votes in it like the other citizens this order should be observed after the death of your holiness and the cardinal for two reasons in the first place that if the signory or other council should either disagree in their resolutions or attempt any thing against the public good there might be somebody vested with a power to take the matter out of their hands and refer it to the people for it would be a great defect in the constitution that any one set of magistrates or single council should have a power to pass a law by its own authority alone and that too without any remedy or appeal upon which account it is highly necessary that the citizens should have some proper officers not only to inspect their proceedings but even to put a stop to them if they seem to be of pernicious tendency  besides this in order to give such a degree of stability and perfection to the commonwealth that no part of it may shrink or fail after the decease of your holiness and the cardinal it is necessary that a court should be erected upon occasion consisting of the eight di guardia and a balia of thirty citizens to be chosen by lot out of the council of two hundred and that of six hundred together which court should have a power in criminal cases     of summoning the accuser and accused to appear face to face before it in a certain time such a court is of great use in a commonwealth for a few citizens are afraid to call great and powerful delinquents to account and therefore it is necessary that many should concur for that purpose that so when their judgments are concealed as they may be by balloting every man may give his opinion freely and in security the highest honor that can be attained by any man is that which is voluntarily conferred on him by his countrymen and the greatest good he can do as well as the most acceptable to god is that which he does to his country none are to be compared to those who have reformed kingdoms and commonwealths by wholesome laws and constitutions but as there have been but few that have had an opportunity to do this the number is very small that have done it this kind of glory has always been so much coveted by such as made glory the sole end of their labors that when they have not had power either to found or reform a state they have left models and plans in writing to be executed by others who should have in future times as plato aristotle and many others who have shown that if they did not found free states themselves like solon and lycurgus it was not owing either to ignorance or want of goodwill to mankind but to want of power heaven then cannot bestow a nobler gift upon any man nor point out a fairer road to true glory if things continue as they are whenever any commotion or insurrection shall happen either some head will be appointed in a sudden and tumultuary manner who will rescue the state by violence and force of arms or one part of the citizens will open the council of a thousand again and sacrifice the other without mercy in case either of these events should happen your holiness will be pleased to consider how many executions how many banishments and confiscations must of necessity ensue a reflection which must surely shock the most hardhearted man alive much more a man of that remarkable humanity and tenderness which have always distinguished your holiness the only way then to prevent these evils is to establish the several classes and ordinances of the commonwealth in such a manner that they may support themselves and they will always be able   0 to do this when each rank has its due share in the administration when every one knows his proper sphere of action and whom he can confide in and lastly when no one has any occasion to wish for a change of government either because his ambition is not thoroughly gratified or that he does not think himself sufficiently secure under such an administration     chapter fifth siena the antiquity of the city of siena is proved by the notice of pliny tacitus and ptolemy if not by another circumstance mentioned by its historian namely—the splendor of certain families among its citizens nobility being only an ancient virtue accompanied with the splendor of riches the tradition that it was first planted by remus can hardly be supported by the single circumstance that the ensigns of the city are a wolf giving suck to two infants siena was built by the ancient tuscans whose province was anciently inhabited by the umbrians who were driven out by the pelasgians from arcadia who were afterwards driven out by the lydians from asia five hundred and sixty years before rome was built these from tirrhenus their king were called afterwards tirrhenians and because they used in their sacrifices great quantities of frankincense thus they were called thuscans and their country tuscany by others called etruria† livy represents the etrurians as abounding in wealth and filling the whole length of italy from the alps to the straits of sicily with their fame and in another place represents the tuscan empire as much more ancient than the roman‡ they inhabited twelve cities the form of their government was a confederacy like that of the modern swiss dutch and americans the twelve cities peoples or divisions of territory rather were called lucumoni from the magistrates annually chosen to govern the whole province of tuscany twelve annual magistrates were chosen one by each city to govern the whole province called lartes and lucumones the names of these cities were luna pisa populonia volterra roselle fiesole agillina     vulsino chiusi arezzo perugia and faleria the ruins of which are near to viterbo in the same manner was the republic of the achaians afterwards formed by the greeks the twelve cities of which are enumerated by polybius not unlike this republic of the tuscans was that of the latins who upon public occasions assembled in a certain place under mount albanus called the forest of ferentina where having deliberated in council upon their affairs they gave the charge of the execution of their resolutions to two prætors it is true that sometimes at the exchange of magistrates the tuscans varying the form of their government by agreement among themselves created a king and each one of the twelve peoples of the twelve principal cities concurred to give him a minister whom the romans afterwards denominated a lictor and of so much grandeur and so illustrious an example were the government the ceremonies the religion and the other qualities of the tuscans that romulus in imitation of them in giving laws to the romans ordained besides the habit of the robe and the cloak the curule chair and the same number of ministers determining a corresponding number of lictors this is told us by livy et hoc genus ab etruscis finitimis unde sella curulis unde toga prætexta sumpta est numerum quoque ipsum ductum placet et ita habuisse etruscos quod ex duodecim populis communiter creato rege singulos singuli populi lictores dederint with this mode of regimen and this form of government with their union and virtue the tuscans augmented their empire so greatly that it extended to the alps which separate italy from france and from one sea to the other one of which was named from them the tuscan and the other the adriatic from the city adria which was their colony and under their dominion having acquired all that part of italy which was afterwards called cisalpine gaul in order to hold it more securely and give room to their people by relieving tuscany of so great a number of inhabitants they sent into it twelve colonies in this manner they proceeded augmenting and amplifying their empire on every side for seven hundred and thirty years until in the reign of     tarquinius priscus the gauls took possession of that part of italy which they called cisalpine gaul one part of which was afterwards called lombardy and the other romagna then the empire of the tuscans began to decline because on one side they were combated by the gauls and on the other by the romans and having by the abundance of wealth become ambitious and avaricious discord following the train of those vices changed the form of their government and destroyed their prosperity and this empire which by its union and good order had grown up and computing from its beginning to its dissolution subsisted more than a thousand years easily ruined itself by means of contentions occasioned by habits adverse to the virtues by which it had been gained dispossessed by the gauls of all their territory beyond the apennines and continually molested in tuscany by the romans they were no longer united in the defence of each other by reason of the variety creeping into the form of government in the separate cities occasioned by ambition avarice and luxury vices opposed to each other but powerful to ruin a great empire when they saw the most manifest danger of the ruin of the whole they exerted all their force but were no longer able to defend themselves the other tuscans from an indignation against the veientes for having separately elected a king looked on with indifference while the romans subjected that people livy says the veientes to avoid the tedious contentions of ambition which was sometimes the cause of dissensions created a king and thus gave great offence to the other peoples of etruria not more by their hatred of that form of government than from their detestation of the man tuscany after long wars many victories and defeats and the destruction of a great number of citizens was finally subjected to the dominion of the romans by q fabius maximus rutilianus they to secure the province against rebellions and tumults sent a colony into it and finding siena in the centre of the twelve cities and the situation strong they sent thither their colony and garrison under the first consulate of curius dentatus two hundred and ninety years before christ the tuscans remained quietly under the government of the     romans until the invasion of italy by asdrubal when they were accused of having held a secret correspondence and given assistance to the carthaginians after that great victory of the romans in which asdrubal with fiftysix thousand of his men was slain marcus livius was sent to tuscany to inquire which of the twelve cities had assisted the carthaginians who reported that he found nothing against siena tranquillity thus restored continued under the roman government till the social war when the inhabitants of almost all italy waged war with the romans for the privileges of roman citizens this war cost the lives of a very great number of men and ended with the ruin of arezzo and chiusi two of the principal cities of tuscany from whence many families removed to siena as a place of more security both on account of its being a roman colony and as it had ever discovered more fidelity to the romans than any other tuscan city we may pass over the conversion of constantine in a dream of a standard gonfalone with the motto ἐν τούτῳ νίϰα his division of the empire by retiring to byzantium into two the grecian and roman or eastern and western the decline of the western empire the capture of rome by alaric king of the goths in     the sacking of rome by odoacer king of the herulians and thuringians in     the first of the barbarous kings who drove out augustulus annihilated the empire made himself king of italy and so established his power that the western empire remained vacant for three hundred years till the time of charlemagne though justin after the victories of belisarius and narses over the goths sent longinus into italy with the title of exarch a kind of first magistracy which continued one hundred and seventy years through a succession of thirteen longinus having found that the several cities had undertaken to govern themselves each one having created its own magistrates sent a governor not to rule generally in the province but to each city of any considerable consequence to these governors he gave a new name that of dukes the first that he sent to rome was called a president but those who succeeded him were called dukes like the rest this title of duke from the name of a military office was reduced to the name of a dignity which at this day is the principal one in europe after the royal dignity and thus all the time that narses remained in rome after the     expulsion of the ostrogoths the cities of tuscany governed themselves by their own magistrates acknowledging no superior until the arrival of longinus in     he with his new governors or dukes debilitated the forces and destroyed the reputation of the empire and the confidence of the people in their own militia to such a degree that the lombards under albinus their king found it easy to ruin tuscany which they conquered plundered and oppressed sometimes under the general power of their kings and sometimes under an officer sent to command in particular cities these lombards from their proud hatred of the romans endeavored everywhere to change the laws customs manners and especially the language in their time the latin language in italy was corrupted into that speech now called the italian which is no other than the latin corrupted by a mixture of the barbarous speech of those very lombards and some other nations who governed in italy after them as the french and spanish are similar corruptions of the latin the first by a mixture with the language of the franks and the last with that of the visigoths and other barbarians the lombards held the domination of the major part of italy more than two hundred years when they were totally subdued desiderius who from a duke of tuscany had made himself king of italy was the last lombard king and was totally defeated and sent prisoner to lyons in france by charlemagne in     this great monarch having taken pavia which was the principal city and royal residence of the kings of the lombards proceeded to many other strong places which were held by governors of castles and garrisons in the service of the king or of particular lords of these places those which surrendered and swore obedience were left under the command of their lords but those which resisted and were reduced by force were given by charlemagne to some of his barons or nobles in reward of the services and merits they had shown in the course of the war more of the cities of tuscany defended themselves than of any other parts of italy because they were better fortified and therefore more french noblemen were left here these married with original families in siena and from those matches have issued the greatest part of the noble families which have been and still are in that city they continued afterwards many hundreds of years to be lords of the same castles until by continual discords     many families not only lost their estates and commands but became extinct as will be shown in the sequel charles for the greatness of his soul and the multitude of his victories received the surname of magnus and was made roman emperor as longinus had brought into italy the title of dukes the lombards those of marquises and castaldi or bailiffs the french now imported that of counts charlemagne having arranged all things to his mind in italy set out on his journey to return and passing through siena and being moved with the relation which he heard from those noblemen whom he had left there of the fidelity and other good qualities of that people and being touched also by their petitions he made them free and determined that they should not be subjected to the king or any other power this is the reason that in the division of tuscany afterwards made between louis the pious and pascal the pope in which it was declared that arezzo chiusi volterra florence pistoia lucca pisa and luna should be reserved to the emperor and orvieto bagnarea viterbo sovana populonia roselle perugia sutri and nepi should belong to the ecclesiastical state siena is not found among the former or the latter being free and independent it was left in the enjoyment of its liberty and as the nobles had procured from charlemagne so great a favor the people in gratitude to them and ignorant no doubt of any better form left the government to them and suffered an optimacy  to be established siena was a long time governed by these noblemen and as long as the signori consisted of these successors of charlemagne in italy and the empire all remained quiet in this city as well as in the rest of italy this tranquillity continued to the time of arnulphus the last emperor of the house of france who was approved by the pope at this time ambition discontent and ill humor began to arise in italy from the weakness of the successors of charlemagne berengarius duke of friuli and guido duke of spoleto aspiring to the empire and the kingdom of italy took arms against the emperor berengarius succeeded declared himself emperor and by the favor of the roman people was made king of italy in which dignities he was succeeded by berengarius ii and iii a contest however arose between the princes of italy france and     germany for the empire and the kingdom of italy which continued sixty years and a saracen invasion having been defeated by albericus he was declared duke of tuscany by the pope and acknowledged no superior in the emperor or others contentions soon arose between him and the pope and the hungarians taking advantage of them made inroads into italy plundered tuscany and ruined volterra the romans judging this calamity to proceed from the discords between the pope and albericus assassinated both such was the malignity of these times and christian princes had deviated so far from a virtuous conduct and had become a prey to ambition avarice and pleasure powerful ministers to every kind of wickedness that they determined through these means and without scruple to occupy those dignities which their ancestors had acquired by religion charity and every christian virtue they lived in continual discords and bloody wars among themselves and the people after their example having adopted their follies and vices and embroiled themselves in the same dissensions found themselves ruined having neither forces nor courage to defend their country the hungarians committed in a short space of time greater ravages in tuscany than the other barbarous nations had been able to do in three hundred years the saracens too or moors broke in and destroyed the seacoast of siena and took jerusalem and spain until at last they were defeated by charles martel in italy in   0 and by ferdinand iii in spain in      the city of roselle was ruined by them and its inhabitants fled to siena which made it necessary to enlarge the bounds of the city and take in the ancient castle montone built at the time of the king porsenna of chiusi who desirous of assisting tarquin the proud in his restoration to rome sent to his aid two hundred infantry and fifty cavalry the former taken from the castle montone were commanded by bacco piccolomo and the latter taken from the old castle by perinto cacciaconte from these two captains are descended the two most ancient families in siena those of the piccolomini and those of the cacciaconti otho the first emperor of the german nation but the second of that name expelled the last of the saracens and left an officer in tuscany who governed it in his name with the title of vicar of the empire the successors of otho followed the same practice     but siena by the indulgence of otho maintained its independence under the government of its nobles and its liberty was afterwards confirmed with ample privileges by otho iii of the german nation who had been served in his enterprise by a company of gentlemen from siena and to it was presented a new ensign of the white lion both the first and the third otho left many of their gentlemen in siena from whom are descended several of the noble and powerful families in that city where they continued a long time behaving virtuously and honorably in the service of their country all the inhabitants of the city and territory living then in union and harmony were comprehended under the name of the people which has since from a general denomination become a particular and peculiar name of a faction called popolo the citizens being divided into parties although the body of the city increased on every side both in numbers and riches it was nevertheless unable to enlarge its boundaries or extend its jurisdiction for having on one hand the lands of the church and on the other the territories of the emperor it could not go beyond its own limits at this time much industry and many artificers were introduced by means of an extensive commerce besides other noblemen the count bandinello de bandinelli having agents and correspondents in many parts of the levant imported large merchandises to his own great profit as well as the public utility employing and maintaining a multitude of people in every kind of labor he was in a great measure the instrument of directing this people to merchandise the same count bandinello moreover being consul and desirous of displaying the consular dignity and authority gave orders that two commanders or officers on all occasions of solemnity or ceremony should go before the consuls with rods in their hands and fringes at their breasts after the similitude of the lictors who walked with their bundles of rods and with their axes before the consuls of rome he also ordered that to the trumpets should be fixed those streamers of white and black taffety which have been ever since used by all the supreme magistrates who have succeeded in the place of the consuls and that the fifers and trumpeters with the rest of the family and servants of the magistrate down to modern times in the public palace should be clothed in blue and green about the year  0   contentions arose between the emperor     henry iii and the pope who decreed him an enemy to the church and interdicted him his empire and kingdom which quarrel was the reason that the cities of tuscany began to be agitated with seditions some of them declared in favor of the emperor and others rebelling against him adopted republican governments and attached themselves to the pope by whose assistance they hoped to defend themselves against the emperor who would have oppressed them from this division originated the desire in the minds of the people to increase their forces that they might the more easily resist the emperor if he should invade tuscany with a design of reducing them to his obedience to this end every city and castle endeavored to make itself master of those in its neighborhood or at least to draw them to its alliance which involved them in frequent wars and was the original of those discords and enmities with which many cities of tuscany were long agitated and which proved the ruin of some though it augmented the greatness of others the italians having long remained under the obedience of the german emperors and having very rarely been employed in their wars either by them or their captains neglected in so long and inactive a kind of servitude the regulations of their militia but now in danger of oppression from conrad i the cities in order to defend themselves ordered a kind of chariot to be built and called it il carrocio it was covered with rosecolored cloth with a large pole in the centre on which was displayed a white standard with two scarlet stripes in a cross at the middle of it and on every side of the carriage stood a man who held in his hand a cord fastened to the top of the pole that neither the force of the wind nor the weight of the standard might incline it one way or another the chariot was drawn by oxen covered with white although they varied the colors according to the prevalence of factions in the city the care and command of this chariot was given to one of the most experience and ability in war who became the captain and to him for the purpose of increasing his authority a shield and a sword were given by the public but in the times which followed after the emperor frederick i this was the office of the podestà and he was accompanied with eight trumpets and one priest in this manner the cities of  00 lombardy as well as tuscany sent out their people to war without entertaining any soldiers in pay for those who were ordered out to war in those times in italy went at their own expense so great was their affection to their country as in the beginning the romans did wherever the triumphal chariot was found there were the headquarters of the captain like the prætors among the ancients with this manner of making war confiding in the power of the faction it followed and living by plunder each city was ambitious to increase its dominion and declined no opportunity which occurred of opposing itself obstinately to the most powerful princes and veteran armies for the defence of its own dignity and that of the party to which it was devoted deriving from these motives and from successful enterprises great courage and ardor when henry iii with his antipope besieged gregory vii in his castle and for fear of robert guiscard on his march to succor the pope retired to siena florence took the part of the pope and siena that of the emperor and from this principle arose that irreconcilable hatred and enmity between these cities which lasted so long and produced so much war and bloodshed upon this occasion a memorable battle was fought and a signal victory obtained by the army of siena over that of florence certain persons in this engagement had been the first to begin the action and behaved themselves so bravely in it that it was adjudged that their conduct had been the principal cause of putting the florentines to flight the republic in reward of their merit and to incite and inflame by this example the minds of others to act nobly in the service of their country erected by a public decree a very high tower by the sides of their houses the greeks and romans by decreeing statues to them used to honor those who performed similar achievements in the service of the republic by this means rendering their memories immortal and they were more or less honored according to the position in which the statue was placed and the height and grandeur of the statue itself wherefore they made some larger and others smaller some on horseback others on the ground and to make the glory of others still more illustrious they sought the most eminent artists and placed the statues on columns  0  knowing that columns anciently dedicated to men were marks of honor and conspicuous tokens of immortal glory moved by these old examples they who governed the city of siena having by the long domination of the barbarians in italy lost the arts of sculpture and painting which were held in so high estimation by the ancients as well as by the modern civilized nations and not being able for want of artists to make statues or columns to honor these brave and virtuous citizens ordered those towers to be built after which precedent for similar merits and services many others were afterwards erected among which that of the malavolti was built by the public in memory of the virtue of philip malavolti captain of siena in the christian army of clement iii this like many others which had been raised before was habitable and although they were erected only as memorials of the honor due to greatness of soul they were afterwards employed very often as fortifications for offence and defence by the several parties in their civil wars permission was granted by the public to many gentlemen to build towers at their own expense as testimonials of the nobility and splendor of their families and until long afterwards they were taken down by order of charles v and the materials employed in a castle which that tyrant built for himself they were so large and so high as to be seen from a great distance and made a most beautiful appearance in the union of the christian princes in  0   against the saracens and in the army engaged in the enterprise against jerusalem the city of siena had a thousand men under the command of dominick and boniface gricci noblemen of siena henry iv after the death of henry iii coming to rome for the crown in    0 renewing the discords with the pope pascal ii and gelasius his successor and marching to rome with his armies excited afresh the ill humors in tuscany but these not having much energy did not at that time produce effects of moment yet stirred up from time to time by the discord among the great princes and other accidents though they seemed at times to be quieted they broke out again and were never wholly extinguished they rather went on increasing and at last discovering themselves with greater malignity they grew from particular disputes between one city and another to the most general and sanguinary  0  factions of all or the greatest part of the territory of tuscany and all the rest of italy making alliance among one another of those who were of the same faction against other leagues among the factions who were their enemies one party having taken the name of guelphs and the other of ghibellines these parties and divisions were not only between one people and another but to complete the ruin and destruction they spread into the same city and sometimes into the same family till there was not a spot of earth to be found whose inhabitants were not divided and on which the citizens did not frequently meet in arms against each other as it happened in      and in      between the noble houses in siena in which private interests and party passions had infinitely more energy than the interest of the public although the nobles had so long governed and preserved this republic in peace they now most imprudently suffered themselves to be blindly led on by ambition this civil discord having entered and been increased and artificially fomented by the heads of those plebeians who had attached themselves some to one nobleman and some to another in the city they began to endeavor in turn to expel one another by violence from the city by this means coming frequently to blows and meeting often in arms they gave occasion to the plebeians who wished nothing better to study the means of taking the government by little and little out of their hands in the firm hope of being able to obtain it if not entirely at least in part to themselves for the gentlemen being in arms and each party afraid of being overcome by the other strove to acquire friends and adherents among the plebeians whom they now called by a more decent appellation of the people that they might be able with stronger forces to conquer their enemies or at least secure themselves from being conquered by them neither party was willing by refusing the people a share in the government to make them their enemies they agreed therefore to give them a third part wherefore when they first appointed two consuls of noble houses who should annually govern the republic it was ordained that for the future they should appoint three two of them to be noblemen taken from each faction and the third from the  0  people and sometimes they made the number six observing the same distribution and this is the reason why many persons have believed that certain families which at this day are of the order of the nine finding that their ancestors were made consuls in those times were originally noble not knowing that the people from whom the order of nine had their original participated at that time by a third part in the government and that from some of those popular families who at that time held the consulate are descended those of the nine the nobles who at this day are denominated in siena gentlemen and who anciently being very powerful were sometimes called grandees are sprung from a part of those ancient families who in the first institution and ordination of the republic took upon them the government which with large additions to the city and its dominions they held till the year      when the plebeians or more properly the people first began to enter into a share of the government of the state and police of the city by this means although those who had been in public offices and dignities had acquired nobility to their descendants they had not yet assumed the name of nobles or of gentlemen although in siena as in all the other cities of tuscany the popular faction long prevailed over the nobles they followed as the most favorable and least invidious the name of the people and thus leaving uncorrupted the ancient nobility perhaps to avoid the distinction of greater and lesser like that of nobles and patricians among the romans they busied themselves in those factions through which at different times they began to ennoble themselves the people in process of time divided into three parties one of which was called the people of the smaller number who were those of the order of the nine the second the people of the middle number who were called the order of the twelve and the third the people of the greater number called the order of reformers including all the lesser people† combined with some of the ancient houses under this denomination were the most numerous as will be largely shown in its proper place subsequently to these three popular factions out of those who were afterwards accepted into the government and acquired civil rights together with those  0  few houses who would not follow the abovenamed factions another order was created which was called the order of the people and these however they may since have been ennobled have taken no other name than that of the popular faction so of old in rome it happened that the patricians and ancient nobles had always the name of nobles and the plebeians so called by the romans although they had been consuls and dictators and had enjoyed triumphs were ever called plebeians until some families were added to the number of patricians by the emperors julius cæsar augustus and claudius the greater part of the families of nobles who were denominated by romulus the greater race and of those who were added by tarquinius priscus and were afterwards called by lucius brutus the lesser race being already extinguished this distinction was preserved in the roman senate where the fathers were understood to be those who were of patrician houses and fathers conscript those who had been added and recorded in the number of senators and thus plebeians sometimes by concessions of princes acquired the name of nobles these orders were in all respects contrary to those which were used at this time in the cities of tuscany which being governed by the multitude did not admit the nobles to honors nor to the administration of the republic if they did not first renouncing their nobility acquire the privilege of being of the people such was in that age the odium against the name of nobles among those who governed the republics of tuscany from the jealousy and terror that were entertained of their greatness and this we may well suppose was the main reason why those first popular characters and the others who followed after them did not care to acquire the name of noblemen or gentlemen on the contrary they exerted themselves with all diligence by the laws and by all their actions by extermination and destruction of one family after another totally to destroy the memory of all the noble houses of the gentlemen in such manner that the greatest part of them are extinguished among the few that remain are the bisdomini the tegolei the floridi who were original inhabitants of the city and lived in that third of it which was called the old castle with many other noble families enumerated in another third of the city named the third of saint martin the noble families of jazzani trombetti guastelloni sansedonii  0  and others dwelt in the remaining third called the third of camullia lived the gallerani scricciuoli arzochii mignanelli c there was another distinction of five families who were counts and lived indifferently in any part of the town which were called the greater houses as the counts ardenghesci guiglieschi scialenghi cacciaconti and valcortese there were other families who because very numerous had the privilege of having two members from each family in the magistracy while the rest could have but one as the piccolomini tolommei malavolti salimbeni and saraceni and in the same proportion they might have seats in the council of a hundred gentlemen to whom in this reform of the state fifty popular members were added this council was renewed once in two years and sometimes every year and was elected by the general council one member from each family with ample authority in this council which was to assemble at least once a month they consulted upon all affairs of the most serious nature and the greatest importance under this form of government siena continued for some time and following the imperial party they had a mind to possess themselves of the castle of radicofani then held by the church pretending that it had been given to the bishop and people of siena by the count manente de visconti di campiglia before      but this expedition failed in this year the inhabitants of siena and the aretini united with the conti guidi whose castle of monte alla croce they relieved from a siege of the florentines the conti guidi were lords of many castles in casentino and one part of valdarno and had been decorated with the title of counts by otho the emperor after he had liberated italy from the lordship of berengarius iii when one of the family who came with him from germany married a lady of florence from which marriage descended the house of guidi we may pass over the bloody wars and variety of victories and defeats between these two cities of siena and florence but when frederick barbarossa came into italy they made a truce and new laws and confederations were made between the people of tuscany the florentines lucchese pratensians and lords of carfagna entered into one league and the inhabitants of siena  0  pisa pistoia aretina and the conti guidi into another and because the sienese had shown themselves in the dissensions which had happened in times past between the popes and the emperors favorable to the empire the pope adrian attentive to the arrival of frederick with much solicitude completed the fortress and part of the walls of the territory of radicofani in      frederick was crowned at rome after long disputes with the romans and returned to germany in      the sienese by sympathy being of the same faction acquired a jurisdiction over poggibonzi an eighth part of which castle had been given them by the count guido guerra this castle was afterwards in      taken by charles king of naples and given to the florentines and by them demolished as always friendly or subject to the sienese and a receptacle of ghibellines in      frederick came a second time into italy the sienese being at variance with the counts of orgia and other lords their neighbors who held many strong castles very near to siena some of which were demolished by the sienese the lords of these castles were desirous of rebuilding them but frederick granted to the sienese the privilege that neither those counts nor any other lords nor their successors should rebuild any castle or fortress within twelve miles of their city as it is a sketch of the laws their vicissitudes and variations that we are attempting we have nothing to do with wars or disputes between popes and antipopes the church and the empire nor with the accessions of staggia or orgia to siena in      frederick returned to italy and confirmed all the privileges and donations which had been before made to siena the fourth fifth and sixth journey to italy and all the wars and truces and peaces between florence and siena may likewise be omitted though in the last which was in      he found enemies in the sienese his old friends according to some writers this strange revolution was in      and the causes of it deserve to be examined and explained charlemagne as has been before related left the government of siena in a single assembly of hereditary nobles who no doubt as they had procured the independence of the city by their interest  0  and intercession thought it their own and entailed on their posterity forever while the people considered these rulers as their benefactors to whom they owed so much while the nobles were united and the city continued with constancy faithful to the emperors all went smoothly on at least no history appears to the contrary but in a course of time when the nobles became divided into parties each of which courted the people not so much from humanity patriotism or love of liberty and equality as because their bones and sinews were wanted in the civil wars the people with very good reason began to demand a share and to take a hand in the game but how not in any proportion which could give them a control or a power of selfdefence or even much influence but by claiming one in three consuls and fifty in one hundred and fifty senators absolute power was still in the noble hundred and the people by their members only became nearer witnesses of their own insignificance and of the arbitrary disposition of their noble masters this therefore of course irritated the people and gave them able leaders while it increased the motives of the factions in each party of the nobles to caress them still more in consequence of this the public councils and conduct in      began to be unsteady and a strong faction appeared for the pope against the emperor philippo malavolti palmerio malagalla and guido maizi were this year consuls the guelphs had acquired so much influence as to shut the gates against the emperor desirous of passing through the town and even to attack and defeat his army but as soon as he was prepared to punish them for this offence certain orators were sent to him by those in the government to excuse the fault and to beg his pardon they said the resistance to his majesty had been occasioned by the fury of the people who arose in a tumult very much against the will of their governors who had always been faithfully devoted to him the emperor received them graciously and confirmed their privileges under some severe conditions moved however to this grace according to the custom of great princes more by his own interest than by any confidence he had in their professions but as he was now intent upon an enterprise into the levant against the turks and saracens he wished to leave all things in tranquillity in italy intending on his return to make himself master of the kingdom of sicily and naples he was desirous  0  of preserving peace in the cities of italy already friendly to him and by reconciling the others to acquire more friends and followers who might assist him and remove all obstacles to his enterprise with this view he sent henry his son already elected king of the romans into italy with great pomp and authority who pretended to be favorable to the sienese and granted them the power under the imperial authority to elect consuls as they had been long used to do but those who should be elected were obliged to accept the investiture of their consulate without expense from the king himself or the emperor or their successors if in italy if not from their legate or vicar in tuscany and if there should be no imperial legate in tuscany the consuls elect were obliged to go in a body or a part of them or send an ambassador to demand the investiture of the emperor or whoever should be king of the romans in      jerusalem was besieged by saladin and siena sent five hundred of her young men under the command of philip malavolti in the christian army raised for its relief henry on his return from this expedition was declared by the pope emperor and invested with the kingdom of naples and sicily upon condition that he would recover it from tancred the son of roger iv of the house of normandy heir of william king of england who died in this crusade while the pope and the emperor were occupied in this enterprise and all italy was filled with arms and rumors and so many gentlemen of siena were absent in the wars the people of siena thought they had a favorable opportunity to endeavor with safety to take the government of the republic out of the hands of the consuls and by a reformation of the state introduce a new form of popular government the plebeians tumultuously rising with great impetuosity flew to arms but the gentlemen who had foreseen the insurrection assembled in the public walks provided with attendants and arms that they might be able to oppose the people and defend the dignity of the government the heads of the popular faction perceiving that their design could not succeed by force put a stop to the tumult but stood armed in several parts of the city the most respectable citizens of each party meeting half way between the two bodies effected a reconciliation so far that both sides agreed to lay down their arms and it was agreed that if any one would  0  demand or request that any thing should be corrected or reformed for the public service he should propose it civilly without the din of arms and if it should be judged an error or a grievance by the council there should be no difficulty in obtaining its amendment or redress and with copious reasoning they demonstrated the disorders which must arise from exciting the mob with arms in their hands to demand new laws because always naturally desirous of seeing new things they are never contented with what they possess and having obtained one object of pursuit they suddenly look for another setting neither bounds nor laws to their appetites upon every little accident which is always in the power of any one to excite they fly according to their present passions prejudices necessities or inclinations to robberies and conflagrations many examples of which have been seen in siena as well as other cities and no method of suppressing an unbridled populace has been hitherto invented without manifest and universal danger they moreover took into consideration that from the vicinity of florence in times so agitated both parties ought to be sensible into what ruin they might fall while they were engaged at home in contending with each other and had it not been for this danger the nobles were at that time so superior in power to the plebeians that they would not have submitted to this insolence nor let escape this opportunity of putting an end to such seditions by chastising the authors of this they only advised the consuls to call together the council the next day when together they deliberated and debated upon a variety of subjects but after many contests they concluded upon nothing but this in order to satisfy the ambition of two or three persons who aspired to be consuls it was determined that instead of three consuls there should in future be six observing the same distribution of two thirds noblemen one third of whom were to be of the ghibelline faction and one third popular members by this measure they quieted the minds of the ambitious and envious for this year but the year following at the new election of consuls fresh innovations would have been attempted if at that time those sienese gentlemen who had been to asia at their own expense had not returned in triumph to the universal joy of the whole city this event quieted the minds of those who were inclined to civil discord as the creation   0 of six consuls had produced no other effect than to increase the difficulty of assembling them together and of concluding deliberations by deciding questions it was now resolved to have only three and in this way they went on varying the number according to the times and the business in      and      the commerce of the city was much increased by emigrants from milan the manufactures in wool were introduced the great fountain and aqueduct was built as well as the palace in      the conti scialenghi were made to submit and swear allegiance to siena for all the lands and castles as il monte sante marie montebello monte martino monte bernardo monte franco c and the cacciaconti cacciaguerra tancredi guido ranieri bernardino aldobrandino renaldo counts of scialenghi were admitted citizens of siena the inhabitants of asciano also submitted the count napoleone de visconti di campiglia the counts guiglieschi and the counts ardengheschi also capitulated the inhabitants of montalcino who had frequently excited quarrels between siena and these counts now discovered much animosity and preparations were made for war to bring them to submission and that civil dissensions might not interrupt the enterprise and to quiet the minds of many who desired that military matters should be separated from the civil and political and that the consuls should have nothing to do but attend to affairs of state and government of the city they made an election of a foreign nobleman who with imperial authority should have the care of all civil and criminal causes having judges assessors and other officers in his family convenient for such an office this magistrate they called podestà from the power and authority granted to the cities of italy to create such an officer by the emperor frederick i at the peace of constance in      and to the sienese in particular by henry vi in      when he came into italy as vicar to his father frederick and besides the judicial authority in civil and criminal causes the podestà had the government and command of the army in case of war the first who was elected podestà of siena was m orlando malapresa of lucca for one year and he entered on his office the first of january      according to the order of the city the sienese were desirous of an accommodation with the florentines     that they might not be molested by them in the enterprise they meditated against montalcino the discords among the princes of germany upon the election of an emperor and the revolution of empire in constantinople are not much to our present purpose in   0  a perpetual alliance offensive and defensive was concluded between florence and siena philip malavolti being podestà by which the inhabitants of montalcino were declared enemies of both in   0  the army of siena made themselves masters of their fortress and territory the counts ardenghesci refused to furnish their quota to this expedition which excited the resentment of the city against them and at length a war the cities of tuscany that lived and were governed as republics remained long without any palace or other public place in which they could assemble their magistrates and councils they were therefore summoned to meet sometimes in one church and sometimes in another varying with the changes of the chief consul until the establishment of the office of the nine at which time a palace was built for the first magistrate usually collected the rest in his own parish church as the romans long congregated their senate sometimes in one temple sometimes in another according to the nature of the business on which they were to deliberate another quarrel soon arose between florence and siena at the conclusion of which the latter were obliged to relinquish poggibonzi whose inhabitants praised the florentines very highly while they reproached the sienese with bitterness the arbitrators or agents who settled this dispute were very ill received on their return and the praises of florence which they heard repeated displeased them as much as the reproaches of themselves these excited great heats resentments and personal altercations not only among the common people but among all the noble houses which had given their opinions against making the cession of poggibonzi the disputes upon this occasion went so far that many personal enmities grew out of them and parties frequently came to blows and bloody combats in arms by which many factions were generated who frequently fighting with each other produced a number of atrocious actions and scandalous crimes the wisest men those     who consider more the end than the beginning of things a character peculiar to prudent men were hardly able to invent a remedy or by the interposition of the public authority to preserve the peace the city remained a long time wonderfully agitated the citizens having no confidence in one another standing in continual suspicion and daily expectation of further disorders tumults and seditions these distractions delayed the expedition against monte pulciano which however was at length in   0  undertaken when dissensions arose among all the cities of tuscany upon the question whether monte pulciano was within the dominion or country of siena it was customary to settle such disputes by a congress or parliament of rectors from all the cities of the league or company of tuscany and such deputies were now appointed who after hearing the parties and examining witnesses determined in favor of siena it was a custom of the emperors to maintain a vicar in tuscany who lived and held a court in san miniato altedesco who gave an account of the causes where an appeal was had to the emperor and received the rents taxes tolls customs tributes and other gifts all which the jurists call by one word regalia and when it happened that the emperor sent no vicar to the province he sent nuncios to particular cities and called them counts of those places to which he sent them with the same authority this method of collecting together and making a congress which was used in those times by the cities of tuscany was generally very useful to the whole province because the rettori so they called the representatives who composed the congress as soon as they understood that a difference had arisen between one city and another although they were sometimes of different and contrary factions exerted themselves according to the obligations of their magistracy with extreme diligence to bring them to an accommodation and if sometimes their endeavors to adjust the difference did not succeed and the war was prosecuted the congress nevertheless stood firm and the rectors did not fail to do every thing in their power for the universal benefit and at all times appeared together in parliament for the public business which occurred and to make their elections at the stated periods of new rectors for they had no authority when alone in their respective cities but only while     they were assembled in one body as it was their duty to be always attentive to the common interests if so many people for their private ends excited by the ambition of dominion or by avarice two qualities very unfriendly to peace had not left off this federal order the ruin of so many republics had not perhaps been effected but as the men of that age were little accustomed to reflection and had less prudence in providing for futurity they were still less solicitous to leave by the means of letters the memory and history of their times so that only a confused notion of a few particulars remains at this day not only of this confederation but of an infinite number of other great events and institutions in   0  the discords followed between philip of suabia and otho of saxony and their contention for the empire in which philip was superior which were followed by wars with the saracens and between siena and florence in which the army of the former was defeated at montalto in   0  the king of the romans came into italy and confirmed the privileges of siena particularly those of electing consuls coining money and administering justice reserving appeals and other conditions expressed in the grant of henry but declaring that neither jacomo aldobrando and henry sons of aldobrandino giuseppi and other nobles who held signories in the county of siena nor their subjects should be under the podestà of the city the consuls endeavored to divert the minds of the people now at peace with florence by employing them in rebuilding the castles and restoring the strong places belonging to the republic but they found it impossible to suppress or divert the ambition of the popular multitude who feeling themselves relieved from foreign wars would be employed in domestic seditions as they were at liberty to choose the podestà either from foreigners or from the nobility of siena the choice was generally made from among the latter the people thought that the introduction of this office had rather been a loss than an acquisition to them and that the nobles by means of it had aggrandized themselves they insisted that this should be corrected in the order of choosing the podestà and to remove all occasion of dissensions and maintain the public tranquillity the gentlemen concurred in      in a new law that the podestà should for the future always be a foreigner     it is easy to see that the pride of most of the nobles concurred with if it did not excite this popular humor for the jealousy and envy of the nobles can never bear to see one of themselves elevated much above the rest regardless of equality among the people and irreconcilable enemies to any appearance of it between the people and themselves they must always be peers or equals among one another and when a king or any other first magistrate must be placed over them they always prefer the introduction of a foreigner to the elevation of one of their own body but it does not always happen in these cases that by taking away the cause the effect is removed those who are grown inveterate in the habits of dissension without having any regard to the public good and without the least cause of complaint will find means of interrupting and disturbing good order the people had obtained whatever they demanded yet they would not lay down their arms and the multitude appearing in continual insurrections some terrible catastrophe was apprehended and would have occurred if the nobles had not likewise resorted to arms and with a great concourse of those who wished for peace and order had not marched through the city this procession spread a terror among the seditious who from fear laid down their arms and returned to their houses upon this the government was reassumed and confirmed by the punishment of many of those who had been the heads of this commotion the first who was created podestà according to the new law was m guido di ranuccio da orvieto in      frederick ii after his coronation having granted many favors to several lords and cities of the ghibelline party renewed and enlarged the privileges of siena of administering justice of paying the gabelle or imposts only at the gates of the city of coining money and of exemption from all customs and tributes in the country these exemptions and privileges perhaps occasioned a demand of similar favors which was at this time made by the territories tributary to siena such as chiusi montelatrone montepinzuto potentino luriano vico the lands of the abbey of st antimo and other places but as this demand occasioned a civil war and siena raised a force both of horse and foot which they were ill provided to resist they capitulated     in      the count ranieri da travale originally of the morea in the peloponnesus was made a citizen of siena and annexed the lands and castles he had purchased to their dominion from him are descended the counts of elci montingegnoli and fuosini but the city when it was not at war with florence nor against the pope nor engaged in crusades nor in rebellion against the emperor was almost continually engaged in disputes and wars with the mountains castles and lords in its neighborhood though in alliance with it or under its dominion and whenever a moment of perfect peace occurred seditions and tumults broke out with the conquest of grosetto and an increase of jurisdiction siena had excited much envy in a part of those cities of the guelphs in tuscany florence lucca orvieto and perugia which were in a league against the other confederation of the ghibellines which were siena pisa arezzo and pistoia the former took measures to oppose the sienese in their favorite enterprise against monte pulciano and this occasioned a series of altercations and wars not only among these cities but with the lords of the mountains too long to be related but at last monte pulciano was taken and peace concluded the cities of tuscany now in profound peace and all apprehensions of its interruption removed by the presence of the emperor in italy with a powerful army the sienese thought themselves secure from the stratagems as well as invasions of their enemies this sense of security awakened in the minds of the multitude in the city of siena the same desire of making themselves masters of the internal government of the republic which at former times they had entertained the principal heads of this faction in their consultations on the project and discoursing on the means of carrying it into execution found among themselves a great variety of opinions from whence arose violent dissensions from this two circumstances occured which prevented the scandalous disorders that usually happen in such cases the first was a delay of the conclusions and resolutions the second was that in this interval it was not possible to keep the plot so secret and concealed that no intimations should be given to the nobility of what was meditated to their disadvantage and the manifest danger of the whole city if to such an end the people should recur to arms when the     nobles had discovered and considered the situation and the danger they were in not only from these commotions but from the hatred which in the wars of so many years with florence and orvieto they had provoked in the minds of the inhabitants from such prudent considerations it was determined to treat civilly with the popular party without the din of arms lest they should be involved at once in a war both at home and abroad and as the popular party from the same motives concurred with the nobles that the innovation should be made when in their civil robes rather than in armor it was agreed that the council should be assembled here they deliberated and debated on the mode of reforming the government of the city as the popular party saw no possibility of obtaining to themselves the government exclusively as they had at first projected and reasoned among themselves they demanded that in addition to their third part in the council and magistracy it should be left to the discretion of the council themselves to choose the other part of the magistrates and fifty more members at least of the council out of the nobles or people at their pleasure to this the nobles would not agree and many of them opposed it with such efficacious reasons as made it appear unreasonable to the popular party themselves and the petition was neither granted nor countenanced by many votes tolommei malavolti buonsignori and gallerani were the principal speakers among the nobles and their eloquence was employed to persuade the popular party that they ought to be contented with the share they already enjoyed in the republic and esteem themselves under obligations to the memory of their grandfathers who had so benevolently embraced them and taken them into their society and having received so great a favor from the nobility who had received them into an equality with themselves it would have been a more rational and becoming conduct to have demonstrated their gratitude by acknowledging the benefaction and coöperating harmoniously in the public service in the imminent danger which they saw over the commonwealth rather than excite every day fresh seditions they might well know that those who had held the government hitherto were not men of so poor capacities as to have occasion in the administration of the republic for the assistance of so great a number of new men for the most part useless or more properly pernicious by their     contracted understandings and small experience that their project was the more alarming as they proposed to make the magistrates so very numerous because it had been seen in numberless examples and experience had found it an infallible observation that states had been seldom well governed by the multitude in whose deliberations besides other imperfections the opinion of the most ignorant and incapable weighs as much as that of the most prudent and experienced those cities which had rashly committed the government to the multitude had to their misfortune more frequently experienced revolutions in the state than those which restricted the government to a few for although to a superficial view the equality of the citizens in the public deliberations where the votes are numbered but neither weighed nor measured might appear a just and reasonable thing yet to any man who maturely reflected on the subject it must appear in a very different light as to the mode of making the elections of magistrates if it were possible to concede to the people the share they demanded these orators demonstrated that it must prove pernicious to the commonwealth the method proposed was a way to take from the council the free power of creating the magistrates the proposed law imposing the necessity of creating one third of them from one faction exclusively and taking away the discretionary right of electing those who according to the occasions and times of war or of peace might be the best qualified to discharge the duties of their office it was affirmed that in a very little time it would be seen that not only the nobles who had from the beginning ruled and with so much virtue and dignity aggrandized their country but even that those popular families which for a space of a hundred years had honorably governed and prospered with them would by this innovation be thrown out of the government that this invention as now proposed it was easy to be perceived had no other end in view than to introduce a government of new men by pulling down those who had hitherto maintained it because as the council in the election of officers was bound by necessity always to elect a third portion from the popular order it might and would soon happen that of the other portion either all or at least a part would be popular members new persons and unexperienced in administration and the nobles and those accustomed to government would be     deposed to the grievous loss and misfortune of the public when it was admitted that every citizen without distinction might be admitted to honors and to government is it not better that the council should have the free faculty of making their elections of persons apt for their offices that men may be excited by this motive to habituate themselves to honorable exercises and virtuous courses that to impose the necessity of electing another who knows that he must be elected at all events is to take away from him every incentive to virtuous behavior this would be precisely the way of bestowing honors on sloth instead of virtue and to give the establishment of magistrates to the laws not the appointment to the council who will be for the most part forced to make the election contrary to their judgments and inclinations an indignity too great to be offered to that senate this harangue was answered on the part of the popular faction by william gollucci who said that the nobles ought not to disdain to have the people associated with them in the government of the commonwealth among many other reasons because they very well knew they had it not now in their power to say what had been affirmed by their grandfathers when in the beginning they refused to admit the people to any share that popular men are not fit to exercise magistracies nor to rule in the councils of the city for having since      governed in concert with them participating only in a third part they had given such assistance that the city was greatly increased in dominion riches and population as was evident to all men so that their society might be said to have been of the greatest public utility and the same benefits and still greater might be expected in future when instead of a limitation to a third part there should be no bounds prescribed it very rarely had happened that any city had arisen to grandeur if it had not admitted the people and the other subjects to the administration of the commonwealth and to the magistracies this said he was the ruin of the lacedæmonians and the athenians who although they were most valiant in arms would have found their republics of little energy and short duration if they had excluded their subjects from the hopes of rising by their arms and other virtues to honors and public magistracies what was it that elevated rome to its superlative greatness more than their having given     the rights of citizens to privileges and honors to all in italy who submitted to their empire what can stimulate your own citizens to greater alacrity in the service of the public than the hope of arriving by their good behavior to the highest honors of the republic and the knowledge that if in war they place themselves in the post of danger they are sure to do it for their own proper utility as well as for that of others what interest can you believe will make them more ardent animated and intrepid in any public enterprise we know moreover that no government can be properly styled a republic which does not comprehend all the people of the city by these reasons he endeavored to persuade the senate that is to say the council that the demand made by the people was as much for the public service in general as their own in particular and as to that which had been said by the grandees against receiving new men into the government he replied that as all other things how ancient soever they might be had a beginning so it was with nobility as for example we may say as you know very well that next to the original nobility of our city with charlemagne when he delivered italy from the domination of the lombards the malavolti and the french gentlemen who since have called themselves bandinelli came who were received not only into the number of the citizens but into the ranks of the nobles and patricians of siena after that with otho i when he expelled the berengarii from italy the salimbeni the tolommei came who in like manner were enumerated among the nobles and grandees of this city and in times more modern many others who were lords of several castles of this state as the scorcialupi who since have called themselves squarcialupi those of tornano of valcortese of berardenga scialengha and many others who all enjoy the title of nobility finally our grandfathers were admitted to the government in      and if we their descendants have retained the name of popular it does not follow that we have not acquired nobility for what reason then if your ancestors have accepted foreigners and ultramontanes and even conquered lords and landholders into their peerage should not you receive your own proper fellowcitizens those who are born free within the same walls with yourselves and run the same fortunes with all others you will say because they are not noble we however say that all those others in this kind of   0 nobility were not more noble than at this hour these are who by means of public dignities have acquired nobility or than they will be who shall come into the government after us and as we shall be an example for them so will they be to those who may come after them and the city will be able by this means to preserve for a longer time the nobility of her citizens and as it is natural that whatever has a beginning must have an end new noblemen will succeed from time to time to those who may fail and the land will be better peopled and more powerful a short replication to these arguments was made by rinaldo alessi who said that if the people since they had participated in the government had remained more quiet it was possible the city might have made some notable acquisition but as every one knew the continual seditions which the popular party had excited had raised their inordinate desires and disposed them more to civil wars than to wars with their hostile neighbors and that those acquisitions which they had made had been obtained rather by the incidents of the times than by any other reason that the ancient gentlemen who came formerly with charlemagne and the first otho when they were invited many centuries ago to inhabit this city had the signories of many castles given them in reward of the illustrious actions which they performed for the service of the empire by charles and otho and that more splendor and nobility had accrued to the republic than to them by their coming to inhabit it and the same thing was true of the other lords of this dominion who according to the accidents which have occurred have been made gentlemen of siena the city being aggrandized and ennobled by the acquisition of their families castles and signories by these speeches we see that neither the aristocratical nor the democratical orators aimed at any thing more than a government of all authority in one centre but the legislative and executive power were to be lodged in one assembly the nobles wished to have the whole house to themselves and the commons wished the same thing though each party temporized and modified their language with some regard to the other the loaves and fishes the honors and emoluments were what they all sought more than liberty safety or good order more than the commerce arts or peace more than the prosperity grandeur and glory of their country not one of them thinks of giving all the executive     power to the podestà with a weapon to defend it not one thinks of dividing the sovereign legislature into two assemblies giving to the nobles and people an equal share yet without these arrangements every intelligent reader of their history at this day perceives that all the projects of either party for amendment would only increase the evil by inflaming the ill humor after many discourses made by several persons of both parties the grandees became sensible that if they should recur to arms and defend the dignity of their stations they might in the war which they expected with florence and orvieto and from the difficulty of obtaining money put all in danger by refusing to concede something to accommodate their civil discords they therefore concurred in the opinion that prevailed that the council should make the election of thirty citizens fifteen of each party who should have authority to propose a new form of government since it appeared that the magistrates called the consuls after the introduction of the office of the podestà that of the four purveyors and the chamberlain of biccherna were no longer of any authority at all and that there was a necessity to think of making a magistracy of a greater number of men and of more authority concerning the affairs of the state and the administration of the republic the thirty persons who were invested with this full power or as the florentines called it this balia having discoursed and deliberated some time upon the subject of their commission and wishing to give satisfaction to the public as well as gratify the ambition of many individuals by constituting a numerous magistracy proposed to the council to institute a magistracy of twentyfour to be elected by the council out of the whole body of the people or the citizens at large on condition that a greater number should not be nominated or voted for from one faction than from the other and as it was understood that the emperor frederick was soon to leave italy and it was expected the florentines would soon attack them or some of their dependencies the measure soon obtained the fourandtwenty magistrates were immediately created and they entered on their offices with great spirit by making preparations for war against the florentines and the other guelphs this revolution if a bare change of the number of first magistrates without any change in the sovereignty can be called one was in      while the emperor was at ravenna     the sienese were now involved in constant wars with their neighbors till      when the discord between the pope and the emperor revived the animosities of the ancient factions of guelphs and ghibellines in tuscany as well as in many other parts of italy and with greater hatred and animosity than ever nor was there any people who were not infected with this destructive contagion by which without having any other cause of quarrel they fought with each other with mortal enmity not only one city against another but the same city divided into these factions combated itself each party had not only different ensigns under which they marched out to war but they distinguished themselves by the color and wearing of their clothes by their gait and air and gestures of the body and by every other the smallest circumstance so that at the first aspect a guelph might be known by a glance of the eye from a ghibelline these were not the only divisions among the sienese but since the introduction of the magistracy of twentyfour a new diversity arose among the citizens and a new distinction of party names this government did not please all and those who approved it assumed the name of the twentyfour and those who were dissatisfied took the name of the twentyseven hatred and resentment increased among them to such a degree that in    0 they flew again to arms with most violent commotions of the whole city the slaughter of multitudes on each side with innumerable robberies burglaries plunderings and conflagrations of houses and palaces and other crimes committed by the plebeians but as the rabble in favor of the twentyfour appeared to be the strongest this magistracy survived the lawless attempts to destroy it and preserved authority enough to elect m aldobrandino di guido cacciaconti podestà who by his prudence and the public authority reduced the city to some degree of obedience to the laws the secret was that the pope and the emperor were to the republics of italy what sparta and athens had been to those of the peloponnesus each must have a party in every city if the nobles were on one side the people would be on the other and vice versa and every art of seduction was employed by one power or the other on both the sienese were now plunged in new wars which continued almost without interruption till      the cities of tuscany     which in the discord between the pontiffs and emperors had followed the imperial party and were denominated ghibellines after the death of frederick ii were greatly oppressed by the other cities which having followed the ecclesiastical party were then superior and were distinguished by the name of guelphs but since manfred overcoming the forces of the pope had made himself master of the kingdom of naples and sicily he took the ghibellines in the province of tuscany into his more immediate protection and placed siena at the head of that party as florence was the head of the guelph party each city in its turn was an asylum for the exiles of the other which in addition to the jealousy envy emulation and selfish views common between neighboring nations as well as cities proved a continual provocative to war these wars and rebellions of their mountain castles which it would fill volumes to describe will be passed over yet it may be proper to mention the rebellion of monteano and montemassi when the count giordano demanded in the senate that one third of the city should be armed and sent out because a form of their constitution is upon this occasion explained although the sienese were zealously inclined to comply with the request of giordano and thought the expedition very interesting to their country they would not depart from the ancient order when any expedition was proposed for the subject to be maturely considered it must have been proposed in the council of the credenza and consulted on three times on three several days in the general council before any thing could be determined upon this occasion a deputation was appointed to attend the army consisting of the podestà the captain of the people the first three members of the office of twentyfour and twelve good men buoni huomini deputed by the commons the soldiers and officers in these expeditions served without pay in imitation of the romans who for three hundred and fortynine years continued to go out to war every one at his own expense this is universally alleged by historians as a proof of their love of their country but it may as well be considered as a proof of their poverty and their ignorance for there is no example of it among rich and wellinformed people it would be indeed unjust and unequal as the provisions and apparatus were found by the public and plunder was made wherever they went it is very     probable that the most of their armies were better fed and more profitably employed abroad than at home as manufactures were little known and commerce and navigation in their infancy in the year      ambassadors were sent to the king manfred by the council of the credenza who from the council general or the senate which signified the same thing had the authority deputed to them to give commissions and instructions to ambassadors the council of credenza was a secret council as its name imports in which were secretly treated those things which were to be proposed to the general council which representing the whole city had greater authority but no proposition could be made if it had not first obtained in the council of credenza this is very remarkable the sovereignty was in one single assembly the general council the leading members however had influence enough to get themselves separated from the body by its own act all secret affairs committed to them and nothing permitted to be brought into the general council without their previous approbation this arrangement was afterwards imitated by the grand dukes in the council of the people nothing could be treated which had not previously been treated in the consistory and by them proposed another council obtained in siena which has been mentioned before called the council of assembly of fifty members for each third which at stated periods was changed by the general council and limited by them in authority so that the whole sovereignty the whole legislative judicial and executive authority was literally in one centre that of the general council and all other assemblies councils magistrates and officers were only committees and deputies of that body in this council of credenza the secret treaty was made with the count giordano and ambassadors sent with his to manfred in the year    0 the memorable battle of monteaperto was fought between the florentines and sienese in which the latter obtained a complete victory and reduced florence to the brink of destruction at this glorious period when their great rival florence was reduced to such extremities as to be obliged to submit to the emperor and the ghibellines and make peace     with siena upon her own terms when so many other people and territories were daily submitting to their jurisdiction and ambassadors of congratulation were arriving from all parts is it not surprising that union and harmony at home should not accompany such transports of joy as appeared in every part of their dominions yet in a government so constituted a dispute among a few young gentlemen at a bath of petriuolo was sufficient to divide the whole city in this rencounter one baroccino di bencivenne barocci a youth of the popular order was killed by m robba renaldini of this homicide m bennucio salimbeni was also accused who besides being banished together with m robba and both having their palaces demolished by the fury of the people because bencivenne father of baroccino was of the magistracy of the twentyfour then governing the city and through the hatred which the people bore to the nobles was condemned in a fine of twelve thousand pounds and rigorously held in prison in irons till his father salimbeni was obliged to pay it so rigid a punishment transgressing as they thought all bounds of justice provoked some of the nobles who would not remain exposed to the discretion and insolence of the multitude daily excited in commotions against them so they left the city and retired for safety to radicofani a place by its situation sufficiently strong upon this the magistrates declared them of the party of the guelphs which provoked them to overrun with some troops of horse and their followers the dominions of the republic in the country and plunder the lands of their enemies for it was by their instigation they believed the magistrates had been induced to pass a decree so pernicious and prejudicial not only to them but to the whole city by the divisions which must arise from it among the citizens reviving the hatred of factions both of guelphs and ghibellines nobles and people which through the fear of foreign wars all parties had united unanimously to bury in oblivion to their infinite advantage in the late war against their national enemies from this disorder arising out of that leisure idleness and insolence which after the overthrow of their external enemies had taken the place of fear factions and parties took occasion to revive their enmities and to study to offend provoke and injure one another having learned in siena the mischief which had been done in the country by the fugitives now become exiles     a strong force of german troops as well as the militia was sent out both cavalry and infantry after an obstinate engagement and many slain on both sides among whom were several persons of consequence the exiles were defeated by superior numbers and the discipline of the german troops this was in      the history proceeds with accounts of rebellions and submissions of one and another of their mountains castles signories and other little dependencies and of the persecutions of their exiles and the guelphs and all things in this period are done in the name of the commons of siena till the year      when many ill humors began to appear again in the city and by the accidents which had occurred so great a change had been produced in the minds of the multitude that it appeared to the major part of those concerned in the administration that for the universal satisfaction it was become necessary to remodel the government in a better form to this end sixty citizens were elected but by whom not by the people or citizens at large nor by a convention of their deputies the only legitimate expedient for framing a new constitution but by the general council into this number of sixty were elected indiscriminately both grandees for so the nobles were now called and popular men with authority to reform the city by new regulations by which they were to introduce universal peace and tranquillity among the citizens but a contrary effect was produced for it seeming to the popular party as if the sixty in the many months spent since they assembled had been making provisions favorable to the nobles they assumed that these had been made to their prejudice and damage and rose with astonishing noise and tumult and rushing impetuously in arms to the palace of the bishopric where the sixty were congregated and setting fire to the gate they constrained them to renounce the magistracy many of them both of the popular citizens and of the nobles returning privately to their houses through fear went out of the city others taking arms endeavored to defend the public honor and their own among whom were many of the houses of tolommei salimbeni piccolomini accarigi and other families who combating in a variety of places after having done and suffered much injury causing the death of many persons of every party and not longer able to resist so great a multitude were forced     to depart from siena together with m inghirano captain of the people who in this contest had shown himself favorable to the magistracy of the sixty as soon as they had departed they were declared rebels and enemies of their country their estates were confiscated and the palace of the tolommei demolished as well as another of the piccolomini and the tower of the sons of salimbeni and the houses of accarigi the instrument of all this ruin was one master lutterio who is named without a surname and another named ferrucio was sent as a commissary to campriano to demolish the palace of ranuccio tolommei c in this new sedition excited by the multitude against the magistrates of the sixty though it was not properly a quarrel between guelphs and ghibellines nor entirely between the nobles and the people those who had before been driven from the city took it up and united with the exiles of the guelph party who incited by the favoring victory of king charles and uniting with the orvietans and the counts aldobrandeschi did infinite damage in the dominions of siena and in a few days made themselves masters of the lands of monte pulciano of torrita menzano cerreto and many other places which rebelling against the city surrendered to its exiles the greater part of tuscany by these and similar divisions stood in constant trouble and danger moved by this consideration the citizens of siena who held the government desirous of reuniting and reconciling their exiles that they might preserve the state from still greater confusions sent ambassadors of the ghibelline party one of whom was the bishop of siena to rome to the pope clement iv praying his interposition to conclude a peace between them and their exiles and confederates the pope accepted the office of mediator and a peace was concluded august        and confirmed by all parties with promises of mutual forgiveness new connections were formed with charles of anjou king of naples and fresh wars engaged in which kept the minds of the citizens employed though the sienese and the ghibelline cause met with defeats and disasters which reduced it so low that siena was left alone to support it this adversity however had one good effect on the fifteenth of august    0 it produced a peace between the guelphs and ghibellines in siena and the twentyfour magistrates with twelve buoni homini of the     commons meeting in one assembly agreed that in future the government should be administered by thirtysix magistrates of nobles and commons in equal portions with the title of the thirtysix governors of the city and community of siena this was followed by a league with florence under the auspices of charles king of naples the party of the guelphs was now so powerful and the ghibellines so depressed that the sienese who like all other people under governments so constituted with parties nearly equal in numbers wealth and merit without any mediator between them always stood on the brink of sedition turned the scale rather in favor of the guelphs and these as soon as they felt their power rose upon the ghibellines and drove them out of the city understanding that king charles was at viterbo they sent ambassadors to congratulate him on the happy success of affairs in tuscany who presented him with four thousand five hundred golden florins in behalf of the republic the guelphs being desirous upon this their first appearance in power to show their gratitude and a diet of guelph ambassadors was soon held in the castle of florence the sienese ghibellines in exile were nevertheless troublesome appearing in many places in arms and ravaging the country till the guelphs marched out fought and routed them when this was done they in their turn took vengeance by demolishing the castles and towers of the ghibellines both in the city and country in      the pope gregory x again interposed his mediation and obtained the restoration of the ghibellines both in siena and florence and the stipulation promising them protection was ratified by the college of thirtysix governors of the city and commons of siena but the minority is never happy indeed they are always oppressed by the majority where there is not a separate executive and an independent judicial whose interest as well as duty it is to be impartial between them in a little time the ghibellines who were returned to siena found by experience the truth of this observation they found that they had not the same privileges with others nor the same chance for honors nor the same security of their reputations as when formerly they had shared the government with the guelphs living in little credit     having small hopes of any change in their favor and knowing that they had no security for their property liberty or lives but in the mercy of the major party they returned into the country of siena and joining with the ghibelline exiles from bologna renewed the old troubles and the usual party rage they raised forces excited rebellions and formed alliances with little territories and signories till they were able to meet a party of the army sent out against them in      these they defeated at pari and took many prisoners among whom was ridolfo the captain whom they beheaded the news of this skirmish and defeat threw the sienese army into such a sudden panic that they betook themselves to flight without having seen their enemy and without any military order returned to the city such an excess of timidity such an infamous cowardice though it is not unprecedented nor uncommon even among the bravest troops could not fail to occasion great indignation in siena when the multitude considered how easily the enemy might if they should have the resolution to follow their advantage enter the city itself and join their partisans there they rose in a tumult and ran with great fury to the defence of the gates and stood in arms all the rest of that day and the following night in the morning finding that the enemy had less ardor to follow than their own army to fly they laid down their arms but went about the streets of the city discoursing in much ill humor that the divisions of the nobles might very easily prove the ruin of their country if some remedy was not discovered and they declared that they would no longer be disturbed by exiles nor compelled by the discords among the gentlemen to be forever in war and in danger of losing their lives and their property it appeared to them that for the common tranquillity a peace ought to be concluded as proposed by the popes legate who had been sent to recommend a reconciliation between the people of tuscany the sienese of the guelph party who governed the city influenced by these murmurs the legates exhortations and a weariness of civil war which held them in continual agitation and danger both in their public and private affairs agreed at last in      to a peace with their exiles who without any further noise of arms and to the universal satisfaction of all parties were restored to their country and their honors under the   0 podesterate or as they chose to call it the signory of matthew de maggi of brescia in the next year    0 in the podesterate of alberigo signoregi of bologna the palaces of the incontri were burnt and demolished by the fury of the people instigated by the guelphs a convulsion which originated in the usual source the divisions and enmities among the gentlemen and produced the usual effect an idle and useless attempt to reform the government by restraining the power to fewer hands without dividing and separating it into its natural departments the thirtysix magistrates were now reduced to fifteen as if the number of members not the nature of their power had done the mischief and it was ordained that no gentleman could be of the number of fifteen but all must be popular men as if noble demagogues and popular demagogues were not all equally absurd ambitious proud and tyrannical when they have no necessity to be wise modest humble and equitable this decree was as tyrannical as any that can be conceived for if it were admitted that a descent from a line of benefactors to their country was no merit nor any argument for employing a citizen in public offices surely it is no demerit nor any argument for excluding him the reason assigned for it was that the pride of the nobility increased and accumulated by their bearing the public authority and that they ought not to have the power to make their pride and arbitrary dispositions more intolerable nor by their divisions among themselves to disturb so frequently the public peace and quiet of the other citizens as they had done in times past as if the pride of new men were not equally or even more exalted by power their dispositions apt to become more arbitrary and their divisions even more intractable and furious which is the certain truth of fact these fifteen new magistrates were called the governors and defenders of the commons and people of siena but by this arbitrary institution they neither quieted themselves nor reunited to them the exasperated minds of the nobles without considering the damage which in the divided situation of their principles opinions and affections would result not only to themselves but to the whole city weakened to such a degree by its divisions that malignant humors and irreparable animosities must be generated from fresh hatreds and revenge and without seeing     that the exaltation of the popular faction patronized as it was by the supreme magistrates would prove their depression the guelphs and ghibellines in a few months after again flew to arms and part of the multitude taking side with the guelphs many of the faction of ghibellines were driven out of the city at the head of whom was m niccolò buonsignori a man of great reputation and in great credit for his valor with the soldiers and princes of those times his fame had procured him many followers of the ghibelline faction and having received information that the ghibellines who after his departure had remained in siena were grievously oppressed by orsini the podestà of that city he wished to deliver them from such injustice and vindicate their cause by the aid of the counts of santa fiore from whom he had no small number of men he approached one night to the gate to which the ghibellines in siena with whom he had an understanding rushed and having suddenly made a breach he entered the city guided by several citizens with their assistance he fought all night and the next day but was finally driven out again the battle upon this occasion between the parties was general for the bells of the commons which were upon the tower of mignanelli had rung to arms and the people had very generally risen danger was affronted on all sides and the struggle was furious although the ghibellines had by force of arms made their way to the market the guelphs put them to flight massacring some and making many prisoners leaving among the dead m jacomo forteguerri who was one of the heads of the faction niccolò found himself surrounded with a host of his enemies but although on horseback he retreated defending himself with that fierce intrepidity that so commonly appears in civil wars and went out of the city through the same gate accompanied by great numbers of the nobles of ghibelline houses as the forteguerri paliaresi salvani ugurgieri ragnoni and others who would not remain in the power of an enraged enemy and retired to the territory of rigomagno this was on the fifteenth of july      matthew orsini the roman being podestà was afterwards sent by the magistrates of siena the fifteen governors and defenders of the commons and people of siena with an army composed of the men of the third of san martino and other people summoned from the other thirds to attack the ghibellines in rigomagno     here the exiles had fortified themselves and when attacked as they had expected defended their stronghold with great bravery but at length they were forced to evacuate it and leave the ground to the guelphs who having at the expense of much slaughter on both sides got possession of it razed the walls and cut off the head of neri di belmonte a captain of the ghibellines whom they had taken prisoner in retaliation for a similar severity committed by them on ridolfo della treguena a few years before when they defeated the guelphs at pari in      the count silvatico de conti guidi was podestà and the sienese the other castles of their state being intimidated by the examples made at rigomagno sent them orders not to receive the exiles nor any other ghibellines but to resist them in arms to demolish the walls of monte fallonica those of st agnolo in colle and those of monticiano in which territories m niccolò buonsignori had attempted to make a stand and from which he made a predatory war upon siena for some months with several exiles from that city and other places martin iv a frenchman succeeded to the pontificate and by his favor king charles regained his former credit in the cities of tuscany and was restored to the dignity of senator of rome to the infinite dissatisfaction of the ghibelline party who upon this occasion were wholly deprived of any share in the government by the triumphant guelphs both in siena and in many other cities and this is ever the object of a prevalent faction or a decided majority to monopolize the whole government to themselves by the total exclusion of the minority and when possessed of the whole legislative executive and judicial power they drive into exile confiscate behead and oppress in every way without control the sicilians broke out in rebellion against charles and while his forces were employed in attempting to reduce them the sienese of the guelph party who governed the republic to prevent their ghibelline exiles and rebels from attempting some innovation under favor of the revolution in sicily against king charles the head and protector of the guelphs sent a new army into the country to persecute and plunder the ghibellines and this year the fifteen governors and defenders of the people and commons of siena the consuls of the merchants     the consuls of the manufacturers in wool the signors of the other arts the signors gonfaloniers of the companies and the captains of the country were all congregated together with the podestà in the general council and a treaty made with ranieri de conti d elci and several other lords a war continued between charles and peter king of aragon and in      charles died which again raised the hopes of the ghibellines and excited them to arms in romagna and in the territories of siena where they did infinite mischief sometimes approaching and entering the city itself at last an army was raised and they were put to flight if this vigorous exertion had not prevented them they were in a fair way of regaining the ascendency in the city where great discontents prevailed for the government in    0 having been placed entirely in the hands of the popular party as has been related the gentlemen could not with quiet minds submit to it and although by the divisions among them into guelphs and ghibellines they were disunited among themselves it was much feared by the ruling party that when the enemy should approach the city they would endeavor with the assistance of some of the popular men for these too were divided to make themselves masters of some part of the state with their arms although they had not been able to obtain it by their beans the sienese in determining all questions in their councils and among their magistrates made use of beans as votes white ones for the affirmative and black for the negative the governing party knowing that by the death of charles and the other mishaps which followed it the party of the guelphs was much debilitated thought it necessary in this year      to make many new provisions for the security of the state among which as they could not confide in the multitude they thought to réstrain the government to a smaller number of persons it appearing to them that they could more securely confide in a few whose abilities being more united would have greater energy than those of many and that they might more easily agree among themselves treat with greater secrecy form their resolutions and decide upon execution for the defence of the state after long and angry controversies they gained the concurrence of the nobles in one opinion though little satisfactory to them that the fifteen magistrates should be reduced to nine and this was the original of the order of the     nine in siena and that they might with more convenience attend upon the public without being interrupted by their private affairs it was ordained that they should continue for two months continually assembled in the same palace and live at the expense of the republic and it was declared that in this office denominated the nine governors and defenders of the commons and people of siena although the nobles were to have a part in all the other magistracies no noblemen could be elected the statute says de numero dominorum novem vel ipsius officii officialis non possit aliquis de aliquo casato civitatis senensis nec aliquis nobilis de civitate vel jurisdictione senensi domini novem qui sunt et esse debent defensores communis et populi civitatis senensis et districtus ac jurisdictionis ejusdem sint et esse debeant de mercatoribus et de numero mercatorum civitatis prædictæ vel de media gente  the nature of the animal is nowhere revealed in stronger characters than in this curious record where a government in one centre and that centre a group of merchants with unblushing heads exclude not only all the plebeians and lowest class of laborers but all the artists mechanics and men of the three liberal professions and all the landholders of the country and monopolize every thing to themselves as they would monopolize a merchandise or forestall a market there appears a ridiculous variation of the numbers of this magistracy for many years together as if they thought the faults of the government which every one felt were owing to this circumstance and the same fickleness appeared in all the other cities of italy particularly florence where the number of priori was once three then six afterwards twelve presently eight this form of government was as detestable to the plebeians as to the nobles and the wars between genoa and pisa and the expeditions against rebellious lords and the death of four princes in this year      charles philip peter and martin the pope could not prevent the ghibellines and the common people il popolo minuto of siena from uniting against the nine     for on the succession of honorius iv to the papacy in the place of martin and after the death of charles his son being a prisoner to the aragonese weakness appeared among the guelphs and the ghibelline exiles of siena assisted by the people of arezzo were encouraged to take by surprise a sienese castle named poggio a santa cicilia which they fortified from hence with troops of horse they made continual incursions and depredations not only upon the country of siena but other confederated cities of the guelph party until the sienese after a siege of six months unable to take it by force had reduced it by famine in      a great number of prisoners were made and after demolishing the walls delivered to the podestà to be punished the people however were so oppressed by their popular mercantile government and so much preferred that of the nobles that they took their part rose in convulsion joined the ghibellines in arms with great impetuosity rushed to the palace and compelled the nine governors and defenders of the commons and people of siena and their podestà bartolomeo de maggi of brescia to deliver the prisoners into their hands to be conducted to the house of the bishopric to save their lives but no sooner had they come out of the palace than the guelphs who by order of the magistrates had been summoned and united with the soldiers of the guards and garrisons a kind of standing army maintained for the defence of the state proceeded to oppose and affront the ghibellines who with the popolo minuto had excited this sedition and finding that these thinking the prisoners safe had begun to disperse they attacked them with great fury slew many put the rest to flight recovered the prisoners and cut off their heads to the number of sixtyfive among whom were several principal characters the union of the plebeians the popolo minuto with the nobles and ghibellines against the government of the commons and guelphs is not less remarkable than the distinction established by their very title between the commons and people both are perfectly natural for the popolo grasso can never bear to be mixed with the popolo minuto any more than nobles to be confounded with commons and the union of the laborers and mechanics with the nobles against a government of dogmatical merchants by whom they were oppressed was as natural as that which has so often happened of the people with a monarch against the     tyranny of nobles and patricians the general sense of the city upon this occasion appears to have been in favor of the nobles and their opportunity was lost merely by the weakness of the human understanding which seldom knows how to seize with promptitude and decision the critical moment that decides so many great events the ghibellines were not however suppressed they continued to assemble in the country and unite in bodies from various cities and commit frequent depredations laying waste the country both of florence and siena these civil wars continued without interruption between the cities and their exiles with various fortune till      when siena became so weak and the government so tyrannical as to force the nobles to sell their lands houses and castles to bear the expense of defending that government from which they were so arbitrarily excluded prosecuting the war abroad against the ghibellines and plundering the nobles at home they suppressed both at last and began to entertain lofty thoughts at the public expense they built magnificent palaces for the signori of the commons of siena to give the government more authority majesty and strength and the more effectually to trample down the pride of the nobility to this end as the ambitious desires of men are insatiable although siena was at full peace and without the least suspicion or apprehension of the ghibellines the nine magistrates who had the absolute power of the city taking occasion of the many private enmities and personal hatreds which had grown up and were habitual and even hereditary between many noble families ordered that four hundred men should always stand in arms in each third of the city on the pretence of obviating any scandalous rencounter that might suddenly arise between one family and another to these standing guards they gave arms and ensigns with orders that at the ringing of the bells they should all march to the piazza and a complete arrangement of orders was given that at the call of the magistrates they should be ready to quell the scandals and quarrels which to the great danger of the public as well as private persons they said arose from the discord of the gentlemen and to prevent the gentlemen in such cases from moving on horseback or otherwise they placed at the head of every street and even at every corner an enormous iron chain to be drawn upon occasion across the street and prevent their     passage under this color of preventing disorders and tumults to be occasioned by the discords among the noble houses the popular party were thus armed without opposition not so much to prevent the pretended disorders as to secure themselves from any attempt of the nobles if ever they should unite to reinstate themselves in their dignities and obtain a restoration to that share in the government which was their undoubted right for the consciences of these mercantile demagogues must have taught them that if the nobles had no more they had at least an equal right with themselves or any others to participate in government and thus those public arms which had been provided by their ancestors for the conservation of their country and their liberties were now most insolently converted into the weapons of civil war and turned by the cunning of one party against the rights of another and whether this plague of the city of siena and all the other republics of italy was produced by the natural pride of the nobility impatiently borne by the people or by the immoderate jealousy and envy of the people or whether by both together it was not the less fatal to all the tuscan republics by conducting them to that destruction to which all republics have been devoted when subjected to any government in one centre whether that centre be the unbridled licentiousness of the multitude or the ambitious and avaricious discords of the few the nobles were at this period persecuted not only in siena but in all the other cities of tuscany and deprived of all share in government and those who were in power held in such detestation the very name of nobility that thinking the judgments of others would keep pace with their own passions they ordained by public laws that such as would formally and solemnly renounce their nobility and declare that they were no gentlemen should become qualified to be in the government and to be admitted into the supreme magistracy in such contempt were held at this time and by these men those advantages and that character which in other places have ever been most ardently desired and sought at every hazard of life and fortune and which the sons and descendants of these very merchants have with so much avidity since claimed insisting on being entitled to the rank and title of nobles and gentlemen merely because descended from magistrates holding the power of the state     having thus excluded all gentlemen from the administration of the republic and extinguished all their hopes of ever recovering it these tyrants the nine magistrates had the assurance to constitute a new regimen which under the name of a popular government tended more to give the power to a few than to distribute it generally and this restriction to a few although it was injurious and oppressive to some is said to have been more useful to the state and of longer duration than if it had been relaxed in favor of the many perhaps it is universally true that if the whole government must reside in a single assembly it is more safe peaceful and durable in a few hands than in many an aristocracy than a democracy having modelled the government according to their own passions interest and convenience they proceeded to subdue the rebellious mountains and castles in the country it was in this year      the house of austria had its origin in the elevation of albert to the empire the wars against the turks and in sicily and flanders occupied the spirits in some degree till   0  when the many enmities among the noble houses in siena were renewed with as much boldness and violence as ever which occasioned frequent tumults and continual agitation in the city parties meeting in arms sometimes upon one incident and sometimes on another and many of all sides falling victims to their fury and from the number of clients and adherents to these families all the orders of government for maintaining in each third of the city an armed guard were not sufficient to preserve the peace and the magistrates feared they would not long be able to keep the nobles out of the government they therefore thought it prudent to try another method when any quarrel broke out the nine magistrates sent for the heads of those families which were engaged in the brawl and endeavored to reconcile them and in this way they succeeded in some degree to reconcile the malavolti and salimbeni the gigli and squarcialupi the piccolomini and pelacani the tegolei and malavolti and many others the major part of the guelph cities of tuscany in   0  were delivered from the discords and dangers which they had with the ghibellines in consequence of the victory obtained over them at campaldino but having nobody to fight with as     if they were incapable of quiet and impatient of rest the guelphs divided themselves into two factions the one called bianchi and the other neri this pernicious distinction had its beginning in pistoia in the family of the cancellieri whence spreading through many other cities it infected the whole province of tuscany and part of romagna the city of siena though naturally inclined to divisions preserved itself some time from this venomous contagion chiefly by the constant occupation it already had in the quarrels between the people and the gentlemen which would not allow time for new contests this division however broke out in florence very near them in neighborhood where after many skirmishes in arms the bianchi were overcome by the neri and expelled from the city and all the influence of the pope with his spiritual armor could not reconcile them the bianchi now in exile though guelphs united with the ghibellines and assisted by the aretines and bolonese of the same faction made an attempt in   0  upon florence but some cavalry sent from siena put them to flight the detail of altercations and civil wars within and without between these complicated and contradictory mixtures of neri and bianchi guelphs and ghibellines nobles and commons from this time to   0  is too minute to be related although there was no pause no interval of quiet in this year the quarrels between the nobles particularly the families of tolommei and salimbeni arising merely from their envy of each other and their emulation in feasting and entertainments broke out anew though excluded from government though plundered in property these families had still admirers followers and adherents among the people who made them formidable to the magistrates and gave them influence to weaken the government more than they possibly could have had with their whole share in a wellconstituted state all the nobles with their followers who were very numerous as well as the multitude of people their friends and adherents in the counties or signories in the country became divided by this private quarrel into two parties wonderful was the jealousy of those in government and their apprehensions for the safety of the state and to secure it as they pretended from all danger that might arise to repress the temerity and pride of the seditious they ordained that for every company in town or country which consisted in all of fortytwo   0 since the nobility were excluded there should be appointed one captain and one gonfalonier as there used to be anciently when the city raised an army for the field that this militia whenever any tumult was to be apprehended and in all other emergencies should hold their men in arms but none of the nobility were to be admitted among them as they were in former times when the companies were of fiftynine and together under the command of the gonfalonier of the third should march in all haste to the palace with their public ensigns and there execute the orders which should be given them by the magistracy of the nine for the same purpose they organized three centurions three commanders of brigades and eleven vicariates each of whom had his own distinct ensigns and colors but by this whole system of fortytwo armed companies their captains gonfaloniers and centurions formed in appearance for the common service and under color of suppressing the feuds of the grandees the principals of the party who governed the city thought to pursue their own inordinate desire of reducing the government to a smaller number of persons by means of the public arms of which through this artifice they made themselves masters they therefore prohibited not only the noblemen but many of those popular persons who had many years before ennobled themselves and acquired the name of families to enjoy the benefit of the law which in the beginning of the present form of government had been made that those who would renounce their nobility and reduce themselves to the popular order should be capable of being magistrates taking advantage of a little tumult on the twentysixth of may    0 which they themselves excited they sounded the alarm and called together at the palace their whole military force and instead of proceeding to suppress riots or punish criminals it was there declared by those citizens who had arrogated to themselves the whole government that those families which were named in writing should never be of the number of popular families but they and their descendants forever should be understood to be grandees and incapable of serving in the office of the nine then the supreme magistracy as all of the ghibelline party had been rendered incapable before and this practice was common at this period in all the other cities of tuscany as well as in siena whenever the governing party had a mind to exclude any     man from the magistracy to make him a grandee which is the same thing as a noble ninety families were admonished as the phrase was that is rendered incapable of the magistracy for being noble or for being made and declared so—a number that comprehended all the families of any distinction or consideration having thus reduced the government to a small number by excluding everybody but themselves they became very assiduous in attending the magistracy in order to make the most of it and in a short time they acquired so great an authority so much wealth and power that they became formidable not only to the nobles but to that part of the people which was not admitted by them into the government holding down all others they established their own power in the state so oligarchically that like other despots they were obeyed by every one from fear the ghibelline exiles however made frequent inroads upon their territories and the disqualified families had so many friends that these nine magistrates were kept in continual alarms in      some of the nobles appeared to have so much influence that the government thought it necessary to reënact and republish their militia law and the law of exclusion of all the nobles and grandees depriving them of all the honors offices and privileges of the commons they sometimes thought themselves so secure that they might recall their exiles then would suddenly seize and imprison them and were generally employed in foreign or domestic wars or in quelling some rebellion till      when a fresh quarrel broke out between the tolommei and salimbeni two noble families and produced tumults and battles in the streets in which much blood was shed and the city thrown into such confusion that the militia when called out would not or could not obey the orders either of the magistrates or their own officers the whole people took arms and sided with one party and another some for government some for the tolommei some for the salimbeni till the nine issued a proclamation that upon penalty of life and fortune both parties should appear in their presence before a candle which they had burning should be consumed wars and tumults occupied the citizens till      when upon the disbanding the army at the peace with the city of massa the troops and the people in general who expected to have plundered     it were very discontented and two classes of tradesmen the smiths and the butchers began a riot in the city against their captain calling him traitor and collecting tumultuous bodies of the multitude the captain finding himself in great danger contrived to escape their fury in which he was favored by some noblemen who by entertaining the people with soft words composed their anger and as they had neither any head nor guide they were easily persuaded to go home although this tumult was quieted in appearance the minds of the citizens were much altered and there was danger of fresh commotions to avoid greater inconvenience seeing that the greater part of the plebeians stood in arms through fear with their shops shut to defend themselves from punishment the magistrates absolved them from all penalties incurred by those who had been in arms in the late tumult and commanded under grievous penalties that every one laying down his arms should return to his business it would have been a remarkable thing if in a factious city like siena quieted as it was from foreign wars new seditions and civil wars had not been fomented within but discontents with the government were now universal the nobility the plebeians and the middling people being all excluded from the government excepting the nine were all oppressed and all provoked the doctors as they called the judges and notaries were of a rank and character as nearly in the middle between the nobles and plebeians as any these excited as much by the persuasions of the other persons as moved by their own interest came forward and demanded or petitioned the nine to be admitted into the government of the city and to be declared capable of serving in the supreme magistracy of the republic reasons the most solid and cogent as they thought were urged by them to show that their pretensions were but just and reasonable it appeared to the nine signori that this petition was impertinent and an offence that merited not only correction but a severe chastisement and having rejected it with much bitterness they decreed the punishment of which those should be adjudged worthy who from such interested motives should seek to disturb the civil orders and interrupt the common quiet of the city the doctors and notaries they dismissed from their offices and declared them incapable of holding any office in the city or country this highspirited     edict excited the indignation and despair of the doctors and notaries and they entered into a conspiracy with the butchers smiths and other plebeians to assassinate the whole nine with all their adherents take possession of the palace make themselves masters of the state and appoint one of the tolommei who favored the enterprise podestà another nobleman captain a third proconsul and thus to distribute all the offices of state among their leaders in the conspiracy with this intention on the twentysixth of october      the conspirators arose in a tumult raised a loud cry against the nine and demanded with arms in their hands a participation in the government but they were soon met by a large body of cavalry and three hundred infantry who were then kept in pay to be sent to genoa in the service of king robert and whom the nine magistrates having some intimation of this enterprise not willing to trust their own guards alone had ordered out for their security a furious battle ensued and much bravery was displayed on both sides but as the commotion had been excited by the plebeians themselves and was encouraged but faintly by the nobility chiefly with a view to try their strength the forces of government prevailed yet the plebeians sustained the shock with more firmness than was expected and if they had been judicious enough to wait till the regular troops were gone to genoa would have carried their point the greater part of the gonfaloniers centurions and captains concurred with the multitude in desiring to acquire the benefits of civil life and the rights of citizens but the magistrates were favored by one part of the gentlemen who were not well pleased that the government of the city should be reduced totally into the hands of the plebeians and thus obtained from florence some forces under the command of one bingeri rucellai by whose assistance the multitude being first disheartened by the nonappearance of their leaders were finally dispersed some of the leaders of the butchers c were beheaded and rucellai rewarded with the ensign of the white lion the arms of the people of siena when the tumult was quieted and the city purged by the punishment of the principal delinquents the nine sent succors to king robert at genoa and to the guelphs at brescia cremona and perugia and thus they became employed in all the wars abroad but even this was not enough in      to prevent     the feuds between the two noble families the tolommei and salimbeni whose hatred produced many murders and assassinations many other single combats besides general and more sanguinary actions between parties of their followers in the streets both by night and by day in      the guelphs were defeated by castruccio castracani signor of lucca near the castle of altopascio where he made a great slaughter and many prisoners and brought both florence and siena into imminent danger but this was not sufficient to prevent another tumult in which the podestà took one part and the captain another many were insulted some slain nor was the disorder suppressed without grievous fines and capital punishments in      walter duke of athens vicar of the duke of calabria in florence came to siena and demanded the signory of that city in the same manner as he had obtained that of florence the demand appeared to the citizens very strange though they treated him with great magnificence they thought it proceeded from a very bad principle and worse intention considering the sincere and affectionate attachment which they and their ancestors had ever with the utmost veneration demonstrated for his house and the great and many tokens of fidelity which might be known from their actions towards king robert kings charles i and ii and towards all their connections on all occasions and as it appeared to them that they were outrageously insulted and by him from whom they least expected it they suddenly rose in a great tumult in arms and drawing the chains across the streets shut up their gates lest the florentines should send a reinforcement they not only prepared for defence but their suspicions increasing also to attack with all their forces the lodgings of the duke himself at the bishops palace and give battle to his people such a commotion and concourse of so numerous an armed multitude under so many standards of their companies and vicariates demonstrating that in this the city was united and not divided as had been represented to the duke upon the supposition of which division he had founded his demand spread a terror among his followers and demanding to speak with the magistrates it was agreed that the requisition of the duke should be referred to a senate such an assembly was accordingly congregated to the number of four hundred and eighty senators who after long debates having regard both to     the liberty of the republic and the honor of the duke determined that charles duke of calabria should have for five years and no longer power to elect the podestà of siena from the number of three who should be proposed to him by the people of siena that he should not however be called podestà but vicar of the duke on condition that every vicar before he should take upon him the office should take an oath to observe the laws and statutes of the city of siena and the citizens well knowing of how much detriment to cities are divisions and animosities the duke easily persuaded the salimbeni and tolommei to make a truce for five years in      the nine magistrates made a census or description of the families of the city third by third and there were found eleven thousand seven hundred and eleven heads of families in the whole nobles grandees substantial people and lesser people all together the calamities of famine and pestilence as well as war and sedition which happened in      and    0 though the magistracy of nine discovered too much insensibility and too little activity to relieve the people we pass over as evils not proceeding immediately from the form of government and too afflicting to humanity to be related in      a fresh affray happened between the two great families of salimbeni and tolommei the inveteracy with which ancient and honored families take hold of a nation and become interwoven with each other and the whole people so that it is impossible to get rid of their influence appears very strongly on this occasion though excluded and robbed they could not dispute without setting the whole city to disputing the rencounter between two noblemen in which one was killed produced the assassination of another and the whole city took the part of the one or the other and tumults and commotions in arms threatened universal ruin till the government issued a proclamation against the two principal actors offered rewards for their lives as assassins and raised a force to confirm it which obliged them to fly to ferrara where they and the other tolommei their descendants were long afterwards known by the nickname of the assassins but this could not prevent fresh tumults and homicides in siena between the same families in      nor others between the malavolti and piccolomini in      which were renewed in      notwithstanding the employment     the city had through this whole period in foreign affairs in      the league was renewed between the guelph cities and particularly between siena and florence in      an accommodation was attempted between the quarrelsome nobles but without much effect but in      their ungovernable passions broke out again in homicides and general tumults in      the duke of athens attempted to promote his own ambitious views of obtaining the sovereignty of siena by pretending to mediate between the nobles and the nine and to reconcile them with each other but his dissimulation was not profound enough to deceive either party in this year there were three conspiracies at once against the duke of athens at florence and the government of siena sent ambassadors to his assistance but the people in their fury had committed great disorders and many homicides and finally besieged the duke in his palace for a time and then drove him out of the city after which by the advice of the sienese ambassadors they reformed their government instituting eight priori four of them noble and four popular but this form was soon demolished and the government became as popular as that of siena itself the nobles were excluded and tempted to renounce their nobility in the same manner and with the same whimsical odious and vicious effects in      the counts of santa fiore and the visconti de campiglia were made citizens of siena and subjected their lands to the republic in the year      another memorable commotion happened such is the nature of the people that ever desirous of seeing new things they frequently hold in contempt those that are present governed more by their wills than their prudence and excited by vain hopes and immoderate desires they are too often easily stimulated to enterprises which if regarded with an eye of reason would be found impracticable the government of the nine by the length of time by their arbitrary exclusions and by their more arbitrary restriction to so small a number were grown so odious not only to the nobles but to a great part of the multitude that neither could patiently bear that a few popular men should enjoy every thing and be masters of all men when it appeared to them that others had more merit from conversations and consultations they proceeded to action and many popular men having associated     under spinelloccio tolommei they rose in a mighty tumult there is no room to doubt that they would have risen long before and not have suffered such a government to stand a month nor indeed to be erected at all if the tolommei and salimbeni the malavolti and piccolomini could have agreed who should be the leader the divisions of the nobles among themselves had alone lost them the government and prevented their recovering it the people in those days and in that city were utterly incapable of planning or executing any enterprise whatever a noisy uproar of down with the nine ran through the city but the insurgents not having been able to force the palace and having in vain attempted to enter several houses of the nine magistrates which were well guarded some of them entered the house of berto di lotto where there happened to be an entertainment and found john foscherani one of the principal men in the government him with his son who exerted himself nobly in defence of his father they slew the perpetrators of this murder intimidated with the apprehension of punishment for what they had done and perhaps made cowards by remorse of conscience rushed out of the house and committed themselves to flight for safety the rest retired to the houses of the heads of the conspiracy thinking to assemble a great number of their partisans and again to try their fortune this attempt however illdigested and unsuccessful excited a terror in the magistrates perceiving that a part of the nobility had concurred in it and fearing they had not force sufficient to suppress it they found means however to defend themselves by a strong guard in the palace till they received assistance from florence and other places in alliance with them which enabled them by means of the captain of war to apprehend the conspirators many of whom were beheaded and others declared rebels after which they entered into a new league with the popular government of florence for mutual support against such insurrections this convention was concluded between the syndics of the commons of florence and the syndics of the commons of siena each party obliging itself to aid favor and support with their councils and arms the other and in every way to operate for the conservation and maintenance of the     peace between them and the internal tranquillity of each under the office of the signori priori of the arts and the gonfalonier of justice in florence and that of the signori of the nine governors and defenders of the commons and people of siena declaring that whatever conspiracy or insurrection should be made against the magistrates or government of either city should be understood to be made against the other and its whole force exerted for the destruction of the conspirators in      another confederation was formed in siena between the cities of florence siena arezzo and perugia and a large army raised by them and in      another against the visconti in      being at peace and without much apprehension of any foreign war there did not fail to arise in siena persons who spent their time in exciting new discontents as well as fomenting old humors which they hoped would soon arise to seditions and civil war for those who with the authority of the nine had so long governed the city had acquired together with great power and immense riches much envy among their fellowcitizens this envy and resentment had upon many occasions given birth to conspiracies and various enterprises for wresting the authority out of their hands and although they had defended themselves and punished the principal delinquents they had never been able to eradicate the seeds of sedition so effectually but that many remains of it were left in the minds of their adherents which went on continually increasing by time till the magistrates were seriously apprehensive that the common people would attach themselves to charles the emperor and by his assistance depose them desirous of possessing themselves first of his favor and moved by the persuasions of one of the salimbeni whom on account of his enmity to many of the noble houses they had taken into their confidence they sent ambassadors to charles to offer him the obedience of the city and so ill a counsellor is fear the majority much against the judgment of many of their colleagues were for submitting freely without any exception or making any conditions hoping by his assistance or at least without offence to him or opposition from him to reëstablish their authority not considering that having always been guelphs and by so many offences provoked the past emperors particularly henry vii his grandfather it would be impossible for him to judge whether they submitted from any     motive other than fear or necessity or to confide in their fidelity but the hour was come when this form of government must be changed into another charles having in all appearance benignly accepted the offer dissimulating his intentions came to siena and soon after his arrival the little people il popolo minuto by charless orders and guided by the tolommei malavolti piccolomini saraceni and even some of the salimbeni with a great and universal commotion of the whole city rose and drove out of the public palace the nine magistrates not without robberies and murders committed by the rabble who burnt the caskets and boxes in which were kept the ballots of the nine magistrates which every two months were drawn one by each magistrate for two months to come charles by whose consent and orders this novelty had been committed gave a commission to twenty citizens twelve popular and eight noble to think of a new plan of government the twenty elected for this purpose in three days ordained that a new magistracy should be instituted of twelve popular members and entitled the twelve signori governors and administrators of the commonwealth of siena to be elected four from each third of the city and as the nine had done to reside in the palace at the public expense and to be changed every two months with full authority in every respect to administer the government of the republic in company in all their deliberations with twelve noblemen four for each third who might inhabit the city in their own houses without being obliged to live in the palace except when they should be summoned to assemble with the twelve signori for the public service and despatch of business as it should occur and this number of noblemen were called the college without whom the signori could not come to any resolution or enter on any deliberation relative to the government of the city a council moreover of four hundred citizens was ordained one hundred and fifty of whom were to be nobles and two hundred and fifty populars of those however who had not been of the office of the nine who were to be elected and changed every six months and this was called the general council the emperor charles iv after he had taken the crown returned from rome and remained some days at siena where finding little good understanding between the people and the nobility he took occasion from their discord to attempt to make himself master of the city and the state and   0 to invest it in the patriarch of aquilea his natural brother to this end he courted the people making many demonstrations of benevolence with many favors which he did them in public and private and he so operated upon them that they were content to give him the sovereignty and put him in possession of the fortresses and the patriarch having in this manner taken the government of the city the twelve signori and the noble college finished their office the emperor felicitating himself that he had provided his brother with a beautiful dominion took leave of siena and went to pisa there entering into negotiations to make himself master as he had done at siena he met with some difficulties which soon multiplied upon him in consequence of the novelties which sprung up in siena where one party of the citizens not able to support the sovereignty of the patriarch which trampled down the nobles and first populars and studiously strove to aggrandize the common people and the multitude upon whom he justly thought his greatness depended arose in arms closed the gates of the city and demanded that the magistrates of the signori of the twelve governors and administrators should return and reside in the palace and together with the college reassume the government of the republic and that the chains which used to be drawn across the streets but on the entrance of the emperor had been taken away should be replaced three days the city stood under arms before they obtained of the patriarch their demand at length the magistrates were reinstated and the chains replaced a new rumor was then spread in the city about certain strangers who had been taken up because they said that they had come for the service of some noblemen the common people from jealousy and suspicion of plots and machinations would have had them hanged but the nobility with many of the greater people defended them upon these occasions there was no adequate mode of deciding such questions but by arms to these they accordingly resorted and the twelve signori sent to pisa to demand aid from the emperor who was found in great perplexity and fearing that by the inconstancy of the people the patriarch might meet with some fatal accident he answered that upon condition they would consult his brothers safety they     might model their government as they should think proper that he would not take any part as he had no particular knowledge of their disputes the prisoners were therefore only confined and the patriarch voluntarily renounced the sovereignty to the twelve magistrates who were already returned to the palace and the day following restored the fortresses and joined the emperor in pisa leaving the city and state free and the government which he had held for a few days in the hands of those magistrates from whom he received it in this manner the government of the nine came to an end who had governed with so much boldness from      when this form had its beginning under the protection of the king of naples and the union of the guelph cities in tuscany and it must be owned aggrandized the republic  and those very men of the popular side who had been of the nine were not only deprived with all their descendants of the capacity of being in the government of the twelve but it was by a law enacted that in the volume of the statutes the word nine should be erased and the word twelve written in its place in such abhorrence were they now held by all men these decrees of the new government it is true were as arbitrary as any of the former but the whole history of this republic is but a series of changes from one unbalanced party to another the citizens who had held the last government were nicknamed the nine and this name descended by inheritance to their posterity and gave rise to the order of the nine and became the principle of those divisions which went on increasing among the people of this city and became so sanguinary as to make them forget the distinctions of guelphs and ghibellines nobles and populars for after the government of the republic became again entirely vested in the hands of the populars and then again restricted to a few the desire constantly increased in the multitude first to participate then to monopolize the whole as happened in the creation of the twelve who became eligible exclusively from the popolo minuto     the emperor returned to germany and the sienese soon found their new system as defective as the former  the whole government was still in one assembly and though the nobles were less than half of it they appeared to have the whole power as they always will when mixed with the commons the noblemen proceeded in their offices too arbitrarily the splendor of their birth and riches accompanied with the public authority acquired them too much credit too imposing an influence and in their usual strain according to the lofty pride of their natures they must needs govern all things in order to carry into effect their desire to reduce them as well as to establish their own authority the popular party would forthwith have gone to arms had not an unexpected accident compelled them to change their purpose in the expulsion of the nine the dependencies of the state seeing so great an alteration in the city and that those who had been used to command were deprived of all power and persecuted with so much cruelty and rancor by the other citizens thought that by such divisions the public must be too much weakened to defend the city much less the state embracing this opportunity grosetto massa montalcino monte pulciano casole and other lands in the jurisdiction of siena refused obedience to the magistrates of the city and to the patriarch during the few days that he held the sovereignty the new government and especially the nobles were very zealous to send out forces to suppress these rebellions and succeeded against massa but the inhabitants of monte pulciano attempted to practise a deceit they sent a false letter to the twelve promising submission in order to amuse them while they were in reality carrying on their military operations this letter was delivered to the twelve signori who without calling in the twelve of the college  as according to the constitution they ought to have done opened and read it and perceiving by many manifest circumstances the imposition they hanged up in the piazza him who had brought the letter the multitude were collected together by this execution and the nobles were much exasperated that the     letter had been opened and such business done without their knowledge and contrary to order the popular leaders of the day took occasion of this commotion to accomplish their own desires sallied out with a great noise of arms put themselves at the head of the mob went to the houses of many noblemen and of the nine with intention to put all to pillage and force the noblemen to renounce the magistracy of the college and would have proceeded to infamous lengths if the gravest and most moderate citizens had not appeared and persuaded the nobles to obviate all inconveniences by renouncing the government in which they had discovered the best and sincerest intentions towards their country and not more arbitrary dispositions than the popular men the council next day ordered that three noblemen only one for each third should be admitted into the government with the title of the three defenders but these in a few days were deposed that similar tumults might not happen every hour and throw all things into confusion they concluded to give a head to the twelve magistrates and the public arms by whose orders alone the gonfaloniers captains of companies and centurions were to move instead of a captain of the people whom they used to elect among foreigners every six months they ordained that some citizen of siena should be elected every two months that he should be of the popular party and one of the twelve administrators and governors at whose deliberations he should be present as a member the captain was afterwards commonly elected in addition to the number of twelve the government thus organized they proceeded against the rebels before the end of the same year      the plot of gano di benedetto macellaro and his friends was discovered these were the principal heads of the plebeians the little people  that very faction that governed the city considering that by the inconstancy of their own multitude it might happen to their government of twelve as it had happened to the nine they determined for greater security and firmness to the state to reduce the government into the hands of one man who from his wisdom virtues and the public authority might by crushing     all seditions consolidate and maintain it signor meio di m jacomo tolommei who they knew had been always favorable to the plebeians and desirous of making himself powerful by this means to defend their liberty was selected by them as the man of the people to him they communicated their intentions and found him very well disposed to conform other writers have said that the first motion came from meio who persuaded the heads of the plebeians to confer with their friends however this might be they were all seen frequently together in the house of meio to consult upon measures for the execution of their plan the visits so often made by so many plebeians to this house were observed and the twelve magistrates conceiving a suspicion gave orders to the conservator who had been introduced instead of the captain of war in criminal matters to imprison gano and the others who were heads of the conspiracy upon examination they confessed that it was their intention for the public good to take the government from the twelve and give it to meio tolommei who might more easily preserve the city free from seditions and civil wars ganos head was struck off and the others who enjoyed the favor of some grandee a thing that in illconstituted cities is eternally superior to justice were confined but meio and many others who had fled from siena were declared rebels and his palace was demolished in the year      the emperor charles iv confirmed all the privileges of this popular government and made the magistrate who governed the city of siena vicar of the emperor in      giovanni de salimbeni upon receiving some injury or at least taking some offence at the government made himself the head of a conspiracy of many noblemen and many of those popular men who as of the magistracy of the nine had been admonished and rendered incapable of office to take the government out of the hands of the twelve and restore it to the nine but the secret was revealed to so many that one at last informed the government the plot was ordered by the twelve to be inquired into and a very great number of considerable people were seized some beheaded others banished and others imprisoned and all this without any regular process of law or formality of trial in      a new magistracy was created and called the regulators     who had the care of revising the accounts of those who had the management of the public money to see that the commons were not defrauded in      fresh quarrels arose between the malavolti and tolommei and a plot was discovered of the piccolomini against the government of the twelve and these families were subjected to heavy fines for their punishment probably because the government had not strength to inflict a severer chastisement and this timidity appeared to be well founded in another instance the same year when their ambassadors returned from rome one of whom being attached to the nobles had given offence to the twelve by speaking freely against them in his absence he was cast into prison but the government were not able to punish him with death as they intended for the noblemen appeared in arms to defend him these instances with many others show that however arbitrarily or severely the nobles and most revered families are excluded they will ever have a controlling influence over the government when in one assembly of commons only sometimes by secret practices at others by open force indeed such families are always in reality the heads of the factions that tear the state though in appearance they have no share in it as was seen more plainly the next year when those twelve who had the government in their hands were afflicted beyond measure with fears of new animosities and insurrections against them they found themselves divided into two factions one called the caneschi and the other grasselli the former the favorites of the salimbeni and the other of the tolommei knowing that the nobility were irritated by the late imprisonment of their friend the ambassador and by the design which the twelve had discovered by means of false testimony to take his life and confiscate his estate if he had not been defended by the nobles they looked out for foreign aid and sent to the pope to obtain it they sent also ambassadors some noble and some popular to the emperor to sound his disposition towards the republic among these was john salimbeni a man of prudence very useful to the state and in high reputation abroad his death at this time was a public calamity for the twelve dreading the union of the noble houses artfully introduced and excited among them every provocation to arms to keep them divided     and excite one family against another the nobles at last perceiving the malicious artifice secretly united among themselves and simulating a greater hatred to one another than ever on the second of september      they with their friends and adherents armed themselves as if they intended to come to a decisive battle against each other they then with one impulse turned their arms against the magistracy of the twelve drove them out of the palace taking possession of the arms and without putting any to death made themselves masters of the city and the state at once they newmodelled the government ordaining a magistracy of ten noblemen and three of those popular men who had been of the nine took possession of the fortresses and sent ambassadors to the emperor to obtain his confirmation of their new authority but they found that ambassadors from the twelve and those plebeians who still adhered to them had arrived before them to solicit charless aid to recover their power and had filled the court with slanders to such a degree as to move the emperors compassion in their own favor and his indignation against their antagonists he therefore amused the ambassadors of the latter with false promises while he sent malatesta di rimini to reinstate the former a design in which by the treachery and ambition of the salimbeni he succeeded as soon as it was known in siena that malatesta with his forces was approaching in the neighborhood the little people in the interest of the twelve arose suddenly and tumultuously in arms and with the assistance of the salimbeni forced open the gates to admit the imperial army not without an obstinate battle however which continued the whole day september         and great slaughter the government was thus again taken from the nobles their houses plundered and themselves driven out of the city to their castles in the country the multitude of plebeians having tasted the sweets of public honors power and riches combated furiously upon this occasion and having by the aid of malatesta and the salimbeni been victorious they reformed the system excluding the nobles they instituted a council of one hundred and twentyfour popular men whom they called the council of reformers because to them was given authority to reform the constitution sixtyone of these were of the plebeians or little     people thirtyfive of those popular men who had been in the office of the twelve and twentyeight of those who had been in the office of the nine or of their descendants or associates these governed with the participation of malatesta who was in siena the lieutenant or vicar of the emperor after the expulsion of the nobles this party having held the government of the state and inhabited the palace of the signori twentytwo days reorganized the magistracy of the twelve adding five of the little people and four of the twelve to three of the nine who had been in the magistracy of the consuls together with ten gentlemen and determined that these should be called the twelve lords defenders of the people of siena they made a new box of magistrates in which they put fiftyone ballots in each of which was contained a magistracy of twelve citizens with the distribution before mentioned of five four and three by this we see that a complete aristocracy was established and a very narrow one too such as may well be called an oligarchy by this faction of the little people or plebeians the choice of magistrates was confined to fifty persons only they created also a general council of six hundred and fifty popular men preserving the same proportion of five four and three to continue till january next to this council they joined another called the council of the companies to the number of two hundred and forty and this is the first time that in the public books was written and preserved the memory of the divisions among the people and thus by creating magistrates expressly and avowedly by distributions of factions of orders and of mountains as they did afterwards they made their discords immortal animosities kept alive by these records not only cost the lives of an infinite number of individuals in the frequent and bloody innovations which followed but finally proved the destruction of the whole commonwealth and the establishment of the domination of one man so says the historian but whether these records had existed or not the calamities and the issue of them would have been the same provided they had not changed their government from one assembly to two and separated the executive authority from both scrambling for loaves and fishes in an assembly of people or representatives or nobles or in a mixture or union of both will forever have the same effects     these reformers annulled all the deliberations and decrees made by the late magistracy of the nobles except those which contained the liberation of the banished and condemned wishing to reward the noble house of salimbeni for the benefit received from them they gave them in honor and recompense of their perfidy against the other nobles five castles and moreover with privileges proportioned to their merit they made them popular citizens that they might be capable of being in the magistracy the salimbeni were the first who followed the example of manlius the first of the romans who from a patrician made himself a plebeian and from a similar caprice renounced his nobility that by the aid of the plebeians he might make himself master of the liberties of his country so says the historian and it is true there is a remarkable resemblance between the rivalry of manlius and camillus and that of the salimbeni and tolommei and both examples are equally demonstrative of the dangers and evils of a sovereignty in one assembly there will ever be two rival families to tear the vitals of the state and one or the other perhaps both will sacrifice truth right honor and liberty to obtain the ascendency the nobles now chased from the city met at cerreto ciampoli to consult what they ought to do to regain their situations in the city the magistrates of the twelve having intelligence of this assembly declared six noblemen of the house of cerretani rebels which obliged them with the others to look out for some strong place to make the seat of war as they were to be treated as enemies one part of the tolommei took possession of the castle of montieri another that of traguanda the malavolti occupied castiglione the piccolomini batignano and others other castles from whence they began to make war upon all the country of siena to intercept the supplies of provisions to demolish the mills and to carry their depredations to the very walls holding the people in continual alarm and terror and the city in a manner besieged so that few had the courage to go in or out the twelve defenders in order to disunite the nobles pardoned all the others and banished only the tolommei malavolti piccolomini cerretani saraceni and forteguerri to the distance of twenty miles in the country in lands subject to the emperor upon penalty of life and fortune for disobedience this proclamation was not obeyed and an army was sent under command     of the podestà simone da spoleto selected by malatesta to recover from the noblemen the lands they held of the commons of siena but they returned without success to wait a better opportunity it appeared by this time to the order of the twelve that they had been immense losers by the change of government for whereas prior to their deprivation through the nobles they had enjoyed it all sharing with no one at present they only shared a third part and being stimulated by ambition which oftener measures things by its will than its prudence they did not consider those dangers concealed under their immoderate desires they persuaded the little people that by joining with them they could easily exclude by force the order of the nine from the regency the people joining them in arms soon put the plot in execution but these finding success so easy were incited before laying down the arms in their hands in their turn to think more of their own convenience profit pleasure and utility than of their honor integrity or the public good so that without ceremony they deprived the twelve of their share in administration and burning the gate of the palace and the major part of the public books with a great noise and universal convulsion of the city they dragged out of the palace the three of the nine and the four of the twelve who occupied the office of the lords defenders of the people of siena to avoid more scandalous excesses and to put an end to the tumult of the people who would not be satisfied nor quieted without a new order to reform the government of the city by transferring it to the little people or to distinguish them more clearly from those other popular men who had been of the party of the nine and of the party of the twelve to those who were truly the plebeians and altogether new men because as the plebeians said in rome when in high wrath against the nobles they created terentius varro consul those plebeians who had already been ennobled by serving in the government despised the lower plebeians la plebe bassa more and showed themselves more inimical to them than the ancient nobility malatesta entered the palace and selected eighteen of the little people who together with the five of the same sort who remained in the palace of the twelve defenders and three gonfaloniers of the thirds of the city and four of the house of salimbeni were to   0 reform anew the government of the republic these meeting without loss of time in the consistory which is the apartment where the signori usually assembled with malatesta adopting the advice of m reame di m notto salimbeni made an election of ten of the little people who with the five who had remained in the palace were to exercise the office now augmented from twelve to fifteen of defenders of the people of siena until the beginning of january next with the same authority those had had who exercised the office of the twelve governors and administrators of the republic of siena before the second day of september last thus the new magistrates were all made of popular men who had not been of the nine or of the twelve and to the eighteen reformers and the others ordered by malatesta they added a certain number by the distribution of the companies who with the fifteen lords defenders made the number of one hundred and fifty reformers all of the lesser people who with ample authority given them by malatesta as imperial vicar were to reform the government the twelve now perceiving their error and that by attempting to usurp power from others they had lost their own sent with the privity of the salimbeni to negotiate with the emperor yet remaining at rome to the end that when passing on his return through siena he might effect their restoration to their former state the popular men of the greater number still denominated in the public books the little people having information of that effort of the twelve and considering that if the twelve should unite with the nobles and the nine and be assisted by the arms of charles they might easily make themselves masters of the city and seize the government thought it more prudent to yield a part by consent than run the risk of losing the whole by force moved by this consideration such is the inconstancy of the multitude the reformers ordained that the party which had been dragged from the palace should return and occupy their offices with the fifteen defenders till the first of january at which time they were to join in the ballot and draw from the boxes already made by the other reformers three popular men of whom the one who should have the most votes in the council of the reformers was to be captain of the people this person proved to be matteino di ser ventura menzani so that the magistracy consisted of the number of fifteen of whom eight     were of the little people four of the twelve and three of the nine they declared moreover that the gonfaloniers of the thirds of the city different from the gonfaloniers of the companies whom they were to command should be called master gonfaloniers and should always be of the little people like the captain of the people and the three counsellors of the same captain should be taken one from each sort of people this captain with his counsellors and master gonfaloniers had full authority in fact though not according to the orders in the statutes and a discretionary power in all criminal cases but not in civil from this reform the order of reformers had its first original for this name of reformers remained afterwards in those popular men who were of the council of the last reformers and descended to their posterity as it happened before to the nine and the twelve all of whom had their origin from the people this tripartite division appeared to the reformers to be a most powerful cause of divisions and discords which they wished to prevent therefore they ordered these distinctions to be annulled and the whole people to be united in one body and when in any writing there should be occasion to mention the little people it should be called the people of the greater number that the party of the twelve should be called the people of the middle number and the nine the people of the lesser number but although the names of the factions were changed the substance of things was not united as these distinctions arise from that constitution of human nature and course of its passions which legislation is not yet perfect enough to alter or to remedy but by making the distinctions themselves legal and assigning to each its share whatever it may be hereafter the same discords remained among the popular men and preserved always the same distinctions in the public books     they ordained further that of the officers of merchandise or chamber of commerce there should be two of the people of the greater number one of those of the middle number and the other of the lesser number while the nobles should remain out of the city but in case they should return instead of one of the two of the greater number a nobleman should be elected and this rule they followed in after times electing one nobleman and three popular men and by this order it became a declared point that the nobles were not comprehended in the people but were distinct from them they further ordained correcting the order given concerning the mode of electing the three popular members who were to be joined to the twelve of the ballot to be drawn every two months to make the number of fifteen defenders that a hundred for each third should be put into the boxes by the council of reformers and that in drawing for magistrates eight should be drawn for each third and they made many other provisions to consolidate as they said the popular state which were very displeasing to the twelve who could not endure that the nine should be restored and the greater part of the government should be taken out of their hands they could not sit easy under this mortification but with the favor of the salimbeni they frequently stirred up fresh tumults which malatesta with his soldiers had trouble enough to suppress the twelve with the salimbeni at their head still restless applied to the emperor and made him great offers to assist them in newmodelling the government the emperor would not agree without the consent of the senate or general council which was sometimes upon great occasions called together being assembled at this time to the number of eight hundred and sixtynine they refused their consent but by a vote of seven hundred and twentyone confirmed the present form imposing grievous penalties upon all such as should speak or act any thing against it or attempt any alteration in it the twelve perceiving that they could not succeed in this way to obtain their unconquerable desire of mastering the government deliberated upon the means of securing by arms what by intrigue and fraud they had not been able to acquire they flattered themselves that by the interest of the family of salimbeni they could procure the aid of cæsars arms while through the discord thus excited the public in siena remained in this     fluctuating state the nobles in exile made frequent inroads into its territory with their cavalry plundering and burning at their pleasure and holding the city in a manner besieged the emperor taking advantage of this labored with both parties to lay aside their animosities a truce was agreed on and arbitrators or mediators to settle the pretensions of all parties the mediators assembled in a church but the twelve and the salimbeni studied to prevent their determination the people and the nine were willing the nobles should return the twelve and the salimbeni persuaded the emperor to negotiate with the pope to send a legate because seeing the people and the nine concur in the return of the nobility it appeared to them they should be too inferior in force and influence to their enemies without the aid of foreign arms parties remaining in suspense and suspicion of one another neither dared to lay down their arms at last it appeared to the twelve that by favor of the imperialists and the popes legate they had acquired enough to be superior and not willing to lose the opportunity they made niccolò salimbeni their head and with many foreign troops they began the uproar with a great show and noise of arms crying down with the traitors of the nine who wish to restore the nobles they ran through the third of the city and having met scotto di minuccio who was captain of his company they killed him because he had given his opinion for confirming the boxes of ballots and the government and proceeded to the houses of several families of the nine to assassinate them not finding them because they had fled for safety the twelve with their mob ran through the whole city plundered the houses of the nine and then marched to the palace with the connivance of malatesta who appeared in the piazza with his armed men they drove out the three of the nine who were of the fifteen lords defenders and aspiring at a complete victory they made the emperor move from the house of salimbeni where he was lodged by giving him hopes that if he went in person to the palace he would have the city at his devotion on the other hand the remaining magistrates seeing three of their colleagues dragged out of the palace excited to indignation at the insult and at the danger they were in of losing the government suddenly caused the bell to be rung sounding to arms and so great a multitude of people assembled in arms in the piazza and in     such a fury that the captain of the people taking courage to turn with his colleagues upon the twelve the salimbeni and podestà drove them out of the palace the battles which ensued in the city were obstinate and bloody splendid feats of valor were displayed on all sides but they are unnecessary to be related the government was finally triumphant at least their military commander had all the power of a dictator negotiations were soon opened between the principal men and the emperor and it was concluded that the same government should stand under the emperor as its sovereign lord and the city should be considered as a vicarage of the holy empire but of what avail are treaties or decrees or agreements when the government remains in one assembly the emperor was scarcely gone out of the city before fresh plots and treasons of the twelve and the salimbeni were discovered and new tumults against the nine the lords defenders together with the council of reformers to put a stop to these disorders were obliged to create a new office which they called the executor and they gave him great authority in criminal matters even to proceed discretionally and without observing the orders of the statutes but with all this there was no security in town or country and justice was so corrupted that an infinite number of assassinations and robberies were committed with impunity certain travellers at last were robbed and murdered in the neighborhood of the castle of monteriggioni and several men from the castle ran out with their arms took four of the men who had committed the robbery and without sending them to the city or waiting for any trial hanged them on the spot and as this example was followed by the people in the country the roads began to be more secure but in the city the insurrections still continued the executor having caused all the popular men who had not been banished or declared rebels to return into the city it happened that one niccolò di guelfo of the order of the nine killed paolo di legacci and wounded two others of the order of the twelve who happening to be present attempted to defend him at the rumor of this a great disturbance arose and numbers of people collected and fell into skirmishes in which many were killed to quiet this commotion the lords defenders placed guards of soldiers in the palace in the piazza at the gates and many other places confined eight of the principals of the     order of the nine and sixteen of the order of the twelve and the delinquents having fled the tumult subsided propositions of an accommodation between the nobles and populars had been made by the mediation of the marquis of monferrato but as little progress was made in it and the nobles were impatient they took the castle of batignano and approached to monte pulciano with the exiles from that territory for every village had its disputes between the great and the little and its revolutions triumphs and banishments who had intelligence with the popular party within by whose aid they entered and made prisoner of jacomo de cavalieri who had made himself lord of the place intending to save his life they threw him into prison but the plebeians not satisfied with deposing him and plundering his property and in order to satiate their revenge for the injuries they thought they had received from him went the next day to the prison and breaking it open cut him to bits and every one took a piece as is customary with meat at market the nobles were so enraged with the people for this that they fell upon them killed many and drove others off the territory when they had done this they set up another government and that a popular one which is remarkable enough and departed the marquis of monferrato who had undertaken the mediation at the request of both parties but saw that all his pains to restore harmony between the nobles and populars would be in vain departed from siena and went to florence whence he communicated his award to malavolti who represented the nobles and to guerrieri who was ambassador for the popular men who governed the city the decree however as he had foreseen was accepted by neither party one article was that the salimbeni should release to the republic the castles which had been given them and that they should no longer keep the standard with the arms of the people nor the infantry which the magistrates had given them for the guard of their persons by reason of this a part of the people who followed the faction of the twelve made a tumult declaring that they would not degrade the honor nor lessen the grandeur of the salimbeni and several persons of consequence were killed in this riot at this time the castle and land of pian castagnaio was taken by the count di nola captain of some men of the church and it was said that     the salimbeni contrary to their compact with the commons of siena when it was given to them had sold it this report produced tokens of great dissatisfaction among the citizens in general and especially when the same count within a few days reduced the lands of san salvadore to his obedience and held it as if he had been its sovereign moved at this loss the fifteen lords defenders sent an ample force and recovered it it now appeared to the salimbeni that the popular men by the loss of pian castagnaio were disgusted with them and had not the same confidence and affection for them as they usually had before this accident happened wherefore considering what might occur being enemies of the other nobles and not very acceptable to the popular men they solicited the florentine ambassadors who were in siena to treat of peace between the nobles and those who governed the state and of a reconciliation between them and the other nobles and in a short time both points were accomplished with little satisfaction however to those who governed the state though in appearance they pretended the contrary while the florentines were treating of a peace between the nobles and commons of siena odoardo di mariscotti thinking the proceedings too slow and desirous to hasten them began from a castle of his to infest the roads with his highwaymen robbing and assassinating the merchants and others who travelled that way which incited the magistrates to send out an army and take and demolish his castle destroying many of his people and bringing him prisoner to siena the same army the day after marched to campriano where they subdued another band of the nobles employed in intercepting provisions in their way to siena campriano they took by assault and destroyed the fortress after having slain in the action three of the house of tolommei three of the piccolomini two of the scotti and one of the mariscotti with many others the castle of cotone was obliged to capitulate castiglione fought nine hours incessantly and in the battle lost some of the tolommei and some of the malavolti and many others of the nobles but the place was taken plundered and burnt after which the army returned to siena with a great number of prisoners there did not remain many of the nobles united together capable of doing much damage to the dominions of the republic     on the other hand the popular men the more to consolidate their power having seen the unanimity of the nobles through the order of the last reformers erected a company whom they called the grand family of the people which should endure to perpetuity among those popular men who should be elected by the reformers for the conservation of the popular state of the city and of the company itself into which no nobleman could be received every member was to take an oath to observe the rules ordained for the maintenance of both the state and the society and many exemptions and immunities were granted them every one whose name was subscribed to the association was to hold the arms of the people painted upon some conspicuous place of his house from which institution the white lion is seen at this day over the doors of many houses they had also the privilege of bearing the white lion in their own proper arms and many persons availed themselves of it as is seen in the arms of many families still remaining all who were not of the association of the people were forbid to bear it in any manner these and other regulations being made desirous of preventing the incursions and repairing the damages done by the nobles in the country they collected a numerous force went to their castles and seized sometimes upon one and sometimes upon another not meeting any power that could resist them till the republic of florence to whom on the thirteenth of may      the difference between the people and the nobles had been referred made their report to the great satisfaction of both parties this award was dated the last of june      and among the other articles of the peace the nobles were to be restored to their country and be made capable of all the magistracies of the commonwealth except those of lords defenders gonfaloniers and counsellors and this was ratified by the popular men in a general council the nobles in ten days ratified it on their part to the wonderful satisfaction of the city and the state as they hoped to put an end to so many miseries the reformers afterwards for the maintenance of the peace as they said ordained grievous penalties for any one of the nobles who should offend any of the people and it was made capital to strike or draw blood from any one of the council of reformers and to show that affairs which interest many ought to be made known to     and managed by many wishing to increase the number of that council which was not at that time more than one hundred and fifty on the twentysecond of august      they added to it those of the little people who had been of the first reformers after the expulsion of the nobles and those of the same people who had been of the lords defenders since january      or should be in future and the master gonfaloniers whilst this box lasted and wishing to reform the council of the people it was ordained by the general council that all the people of whatever number who shall have been of the lords defenders or of the twelve governors after the twentythird september      should be understood to be of the council of the people and from this the practice began which continued as long as the republic that those who had been of the signori should be of this council it was likewise ordained that when any thing should obtain in the council of the people which ought to be proposed to the general council and the bell was ordered to ring for a general council the council of the people being in session the members of the council of the people should be members of the general council and by this order the general council was converted into the council of the people and was no more assembled during the commonwealth the public was very much in debt and had not the means of satisfying its creditors it was therefore ordained that all those who had lent money to the commons and ought to be reimbursed should be arranged in three different books according to the distinction of the thirds of the city and made creditors each one in the sum total of his credit with orders that the chamberlain should pay at the rate of ten per cent every year to each creditor and this union or consolidation of the public debt was called il monte the mountain or the lump and this practice was afterwards repeated upon various occasions and these were the provisions which were punctually paid off by the chamberlain in the time of the republic but were imitated afterwards merely to abate the debt of every one who had lent money in the ordinary loans we see by this that in those days republicans had some regard to honesty and the public faith and the infamy of defrauding creditors was left to the absolute monarchy the number of the reformers being increased their authority increased every day and with it the desire of reducing the office     of lords defenders wholly to the little people called the people of the greater number to this end in    0 they excited certain tumults among the journeymen and laborers in the woollen manufacture inhabiting the coast of ovile the very lowest of the people who meeting frequently together called themselves the company del bruco because such was the ensign of that country  many of these having taken the occasion of some quarrels with their masters in the woollen trade and guided by one dominico a dealer in old clothes raised a great uproar beating some and threatening others being armed and in great numbers as it was a year of scarcity they turned to the houses which had the reputation of having some grain and through fear it was given out to them this quieted them until three of their leaders were taken up by the authority of a senator and upon examination confessed crimes enough to condemn them to death upon this all those of the company del bruco arose again in arms with a very great noise ran to the palace of the senator and with menaces of burning him in his house insolently demanded the three prisoners they then began furiously to fight with the officers of justice and to collect materials for applying fire to the gate the captain of the people who was francesco naddo perceiving the danger in which the senator was and that the city was all in arms took the resolution in order by the public authority to prevent the disorder from increasing to go in person and endeavor to suppress it with his standard and trumpets before him he arrived at the palace of the senator but finding it impossible to allay the fury of the plebeians otherwise he made the senator set at liberty the three prisoners and returned to his palace believing that the company would lay down their arms as they had promised but having come off conquerors in this warfare and forced justice herself they acquired so much presumption that running with great violence to the gate of the palace of the signory and finding it locked they attempted in several ways to force it they raised a loud clamor that the four lords of the order of the twelve and the three of the order of the nine should be banished but finding them well defended they ran to the palace of the salimbeni to avail themselves of their assistance and   0 authority having in the way encountered nannuccio di francesco who had been a few months before captain of the people because he had upon that occasion favored the order of the twelve they slew him the salimbeni would not move nor intermeddle in this sedition they therefore took from them the colors with the ensign of the people which as associates of that faction they still held at their window although they had made a peace with the other nobles from the gonfaloniers of camullia and san martino they likewise took their standards and having given them to others they returned to make a fresh attack upon the palace and being repulsed from thence they sent a party towards camullia to attack the house of the salimbeni against whom they were bitterly enraged because they would not concur in this revolution meeting a company of noblemen of the houses of salimbeni malavolti tolommei renaldini and others in considerable numbers who had made a great exertion and taken arms to quell this tumult of the plebeians the parties went to action immediately the noblemen were many of them killed and the rest routed and although many men were appointed to endeavor to quiet the disturbance they not only found no means of suppressing it but they found it impossible to prevent it from increasing every moment in violence until one morning in the month of july the company of the people arose in arms with the company del bruco and dragged from the palace the four lords who resided there of the order of the twelve and three of the order of the nine instead of whom seven others of the larger number were elected by the people to reside with the eight who remained in the palace and fill up the number of fifteen signori but suspecting that by having thus brought into their own hands the whole government of the city the other citizens would be provoked to make an alteration the council of reformers to whom full power had been given by the general council resolved that the names of those of the twelve and the nine who had been pulled out of the palace should be returned into the box of the freemen so that they might be drawn another time to occupy the same office and enjoy the same privileges as if they had remained in the palace two months entire the order of the twelve however not being satisfied with this regulation conspired with some of the nine aided by the captain of     the people who although he was himself of the popular order of the greater number was of an elevated spirit and could not bear that the state should be reduced in his time with such indignity into the hands of men of such base condition entered into the conspiracy sent them the master gonfaloniers with their arms who united with the conspirators and on a sudden attacked those of the company del bruco in their own houses on the coast of ovile and before they had time to get their arms and make a stand slew a great part of them and they were exasperated into such rage and fury as to have no consideration of age or sex but to murder without distinction all who came in their way at the same time the company of the people having risen fought in the piazza and in several places of the city with great ferocity and the twelve with their conspirators remained in many places superior but a stone cast from the tower of the palace fell upon the gonfalonier of san martino who with his company returned from the coast of ovile was fighting in the piazza and struck him to the ground and every one who saw him believed him to be dead by this accident his party was seized with a panic and fled and gave an opportunity to the popular party to gain the superiority and break and rout the conspirators a part of the principal leaders of the conspiracy were taken prisoners together with francino captain of the people and magio calzolaio gonfalonier of the third of the city and on the first of august      without letting them finish the term of their magistracy a most miserable and horrible example was set by cutting off their heads publicly in the piazza at the same time they beheaded many others but the two other gonfaloniers having saved themselves by flight were declared rebels with many others and a new reformation of the state was resolved on the reformers made a new box of magistrates for five years continuing the office of the fifteen defenders of whom twelve were popular men of the greater number who were afterwards called reformers and three popular men of the smaller number who were those of the order of the nine and in place of francino as captain of the people landino fabro was substituted confirming the usual order they resolved that the president of the council of reformers who was changed every third day     should act with the lords defenders and with his counsellors although they had joined in the magistracy four of the little people in place of those whom they took away of the twelve to give a more decisive superiority to their faction they admonished and disqualified all those of the people of the middle number who had been of the twelve and twelve families of the people of the lesser number who had been of the nine and some of the people of the greater number who had been numbered among the reformers and had agreed with the twelve two hundred and twentyeight were condemned in pecuniary penalties and all those who were condemned were called without distinction fini a number of men both horse and foot sent by the salimbeni for the service of the twelve arrived at torrenieri but learning the turn of affairs returned back almost all the lesser artificers afterwards joined themselves to the number of the reformers and for the security of the state they had from florence a hundred cavalry the public by great expenses and little government being without any appropriation of money that they could avail themselves of the reformers introduced the practice of selling the public revenue besides the confiscations and penalties for three years which did not obtain more than three hundred and eighteen thousand golden florins this commencement of the usage of selling the public revenues which was continued from this time was the reason why the public was always in debt selling for a small price which was not sufficient for the necessary expenses illegal practices were the consequence and from thence new seditions which finally accomplished the ruin of the republic the twelve did not cease to stir matters to the prejudice of the reformers because the capacity of being in the magistracy was now taken from them for security their arms were taken from them and placed in the chamber of the commons and the captain of the people seized many of them on suspicion who were in great danger of losing their heads the year following the conduct of the twelve occasioned the same suspicions the nobles themselves were never more impatient of exclusion nor more eager to try every expedient to recover their share in the state the nobles indeed were not only injured but had a right to complain the twelve were injured but they had only that wrong done to them which     they had set against the nobles and they ought to have recollected   nec lex est justior ulla   quam necis artifices arte perire suâ but if the rule of doing as you would be done by were the rule of life and observed by all men there would perhaps be no need of government at all the twelve to be sure did not think their own case and that of the nobles parallel but were indefatigable in insinuating sometimes into one and sometimes into another of the little people that it was neither profitable to them nor honorable to the public to suffer those reformers to tyrannize over the city and they frequently succeeded in drawing over to their side partisans with whom they proceeded to consult of the means of carrying their intentions to take the government out of the hands of the reformers into effect they opened themselves to so many that at length the machination was discovered and numbers taken up among whom was ser cecco dandrea the man of the highest reputation with the twelve who was beheaded and of the others some were imprisoned others fined and those who had escaped by flight were banished and ser agnolo dandrea was condemned because having made a dinner for some of his friends at his countryhouse no reformer was invited other instances of the grossest prostitution of the judicial power were attempted by the vulgar tyrants who now had the sway giovanni calzettaio who was one of the council of reformers prosecuted one of the twelve for striking him niccolò rosso da terano the podestà upon examination of the parties face to face found evidence of the malicious fraud of the reformer who to give a color to his false accusation that the other had broke the law by which it was made capital to strike or draw blood of a reformer had struck and drawn blood from himself he had the integrity to imprison the complainant and finding him to be so abandoned a fellow and many charges brought against him of atrocious crimes he adjudged him to have his head cut off under the gallows since it was not lawful to hang him being one of the reformers justice it seems though attempted was not yet so prostituted but that many others were chastised for enormous crimes but the most of the criminals being of the people of the greater     number who were the dominant faction and held the great part in the government tumults were generated in no small numbers among the multitude but when antonio di orso and deo malavolti were imprisoned and beheaded for having carried off a young woman though with her own consent and half a dozen other noblemen executed for other crimes the plebeians were pacified and softened by the blood of so many nobles and that insurrection which had been raised to save the lives of the condemned plebeians was quelled when all were returned to their habitations and their arms laid aside the senator louis della marca ordered four of the heads of the late sedition to obstruct the course of justice to be seized and sentenced them to be hanged others he imprisoned and some were fined the senator among so many controversies rumors and tumults as occurred during his administration although ex debito justitiæ he had been obliged to order so many executions ran a great risk of being murdered in those popular seditions of multitudes who were offended by him and both himself and his family were under no small apprehensions in such a state of society the human heart pours forth all its turpitude and all parties appear to be equally abandoned the signor of perolla a castle of the maremma of siena died and left an only daughter heir to the estate and the lordship andrea salimbeni who was a relation went to visit the young lady by some fraudulent stratagem which is not explained he put her to death made himself patron or tyrant of the place and with a gang of people under his command committing robberies on the highways and all the neighboring places rendered it unsafe to pass in that quarter the report of this was soon carried to the sienese who sent out a body of men under the command of the senator and the twentythird of april      took the place and carried salimbeni with twentyeight others prisoners to the city sixteen of these in a few days were beheaded by order of the senator but either from respect to the family or from fear of their power he did not proceed against salimbeni upon this the company del bruco again arose in arms with the other plebeians and running to the palace with threats demanded of the lords defenders that justice should be done upon andrea salimbeni the captain of the     people the two priori and their colleagues of the lords defenders found themselves so mean in spirit so infertile in council so unskilful at their own game that not knowing any better way to prevent the evil from increasing they gave authority to noccio sellaio to do in that emergency whatever he should judge useful to the commonwealth noccio snatching eagerly at this opportunity by which he thought to gain the hearts of the plebeians and by their favor raise himself to power and superiority above his fellowcitizens entered into the palace of the senator and sitting down in the midst of an immense crowd on the bench from whence sentence was usually given condemned andrea salimbeni to death and ordered his head to be struck off before the public intending to dispatch pietro da massa in the same manner he was prohibited by the major part of the reformers who began to perceive his design and to see the error which the lords defenders had committed in giving him such an authority and although he had at his heels the company del bruco and the other lowest plebeians they revoked the power that had been given him this measure excited a great tumult in the city but the reformers being united were able to quiet it niccolò and cione salimbeni with others of the same family and their associates moved with indignation and grief at the outrage which had been committed upon andrea took from the commons of siena the castles of montemassi and boccheggiano and with large companies went about committing depredations in the country the reformers to make preparations for recovering their lands and for making head against the salimbeni and their followers created a new magistracy of ten citizens to superintend the conduct of the war the first provision made by this new council of war was to imprison twentysix citizens of the order of the twelve and condemn them in twelve thousand golden florins which were immediately paid was the robbery of salimbeni worse than this they next sent to demand aid of florence and lucca and obtained it but ambassadors were sent from florence perugia and other places at the same time to make peace if possible knowing that their own discontented and distracted factions were ready to break out but the salimbeni would not listen to any thing because the ten had sent an army in force to the castle of boccheggiano     with instruments for destroying the walls cranes mortarpieces and other things which in those days were used in war to fortify estates on the other hand the salimbeni having collected together many of their friends and adherents watched a convenient opportunity sallied out from their lands and attacking their enemies without the least expectation broke their order put them to flight took many prisoners plundered their camp and burnt all the frames bastions buildings and instruments they found there as soon as this defeat was well known in siena the relations of those many citizens who remained prisoners ran in arms to the houses of the salimbeni and seized all they could find of those families that they might hold them as hostages to redeem their own relations neither the plague nor famine both of which raged this year      could prevent continual plots of the salimbeni and the twelve to recover the government of the city and constant skirmishes and wars between them and the reformers and lords defenders throughout all the territories of the republic in the year following ambassadors were sent from several friendly cities to persuade peace between the reformers and the salimbeni the reformers desirous of lessening the number of their enemies in      restored all the rebels who had been denominated fini and banished in the time of those seditions which were made by the gonfaloniers and the twelve the nobles however were employed in forming parties in the country and in negotiations with their friends in the neighboring cities till in      they were able to meet the reformers in the field and give them a complete overthrow and if they had pursued their victory such was the astonishment and panic of the reformers in the city they might have made themselves masters but in this their fortune befriended them finding they were not pursued by their enemies they assumed some vigor and courage gave orders to guard the gates and suppress the seditions which were moved in the city against them and sent abroad for foreign aid florence pisa bologna and perugia hearing of so great a change and fearing greater civil discords sent ambassadors to siena to endeavor to reunite the nobles in exile and the popular men who governed the city but after trying every mode of negotiation and every proposition of accommodation with both     parties they found they could make no impression upon either and returned home it was the opinion of the reformers that the florentine ambassadors from some interest of their republic in their secret negotiations with one party and the other had been the cause that the peace had not been effected as from both sides appearing to be weary of the war was generally hoped and expected the time was come when the magistrates the lords defenders for the months of march and april were to be drawn and the council being assembled and the ballots drawn giovanni minucci one of the lords defenders proved to be captain of the people when the council dissolved they perceived no small tumult made by the citizens of the order of the twelve who said they did not know for what reason the power of participating in the honors and cares of government was taken from them rather than from other popular men and that they no longer would tolerate the abuse and although the disturbance appeared to subside for the present the twelve fomented by the gentlemen who were very active and had made themselves masters of a great part of the dominion and who promised the twelve in all events to assist them with men arms and provisions to the utmost of their power for the common service against the reformers did not cease to demand with great animosity and many threats that a place should be given them in the magistracy these motions of the twelve favored by the nobles gave much molestation to the heads of the government and therefore that they might not have to defend themselves against too many enemies on the twentythird of march      in the morning they assembled the council and obtained that the twelve in the new draught should have a part in that magistracy by increasing the number from fifteen to eighteen but as experience has ever proved gratitude shown and remedies applied out of season have little effect when the council was finished at noonday cestelli a seditious man of the order of the twelve was taken up by the ministers of justice he refused to obey and calling with a loud voice for assistance multitudes of the twelve and the nine hastened at his cry to his relief and took the prisoner by force from the officer who had already drawn him from the hill to the piazza upon this riot materazza and nerini accompanied by a great number of reformers interposed     partly by their authority and partly by their arms to recover the prisoner they fell with great impetuosity upon those who had rescued him and denouncing vengeance and death on the twelve and the nine as obstructers of justice cried long live the reformers at this cry the whole city rose at once in arms and with those of the twelve and the nine went to the few noblemen who remained in siena having taken the entrance of the piazza they prevented the plebeians from passing in to the aid of the reformers and from the houses of the scotti and saraceni annoyed the multitude of reformers who were fighting in the piazza against their friends the contest had become general in various parts of the city and it appearing to the nobles the twelve and the nine as the major part of the plebeians ran to the service of the reformers that they had the disadvantage they began at the instigation of a jew to cry peace peace at the hearing of this word industriously echoed in various parts of the city a great number of the little people distinguished from the plebeians or the rabble wearied out with so many seditions and united with the nobles and their adherents ran with great fury to the prisons broke them open and set at liberty all the prisoners among whom were m uguccione and niccoluccio malavolti these taking the lead of the multitude attacked the army of reformers and urged on by the keen desire of vengeance for the injuries received combated with such intrepidity as to drive them out of the piazza after having made a great carnage and many prisoners they instantly entered the palace and although the people within made a gallant defence took possession of it and drove out the lords defenders and reformers not only from the palace but the piazza and took from them the administration of the republic both in the city and the country this revolution was followed by the usual train more than four thousand men of the faction of reformers chiefly artificers in a few days were sent into exile and what is worse when in the course of a few years their affairs were accommodated not the tenth part of them returned to their country thus ended the government of the faction of reformers and this new species of sovereignty in one assembly but only to be exchanged for another consisting of nobles twelves and nine the exiles of all these three parties now returned in great numbers from all the neighboring cities provinces and countries     and brought with them a strong body both of cavalry and infantry we may now expect to see the government shining with the splendid names of salimbeni malavolti piccolomini tolommei and all the rest but we have no reason to expect justice liberty order peace or common decency the new government was instituted in a new magistracy of ten citizens to be changed every two months and entitled the lords priors governors of the city of siena into which number were to be admitted four popular men of those who had been of the twelve four of those who had been of the nine and two of the people of the greater number of those however who had not been of the council of reformers nor of the lords defenders and thus the people were divided into four factions the nine the twelve the reformers and the people and of these discordant materials in one assembly were the legislative executive and judicial powers to be composed and this mode continued till      the order passed in a general council establishing the new regimen in      and the scrutiny for magistrates was made for eight years and the names put into the boxes a practice which was analogous to that in florence which they called imborsation which was putting the names into purses to be drawn out upon occasion those who had now the most votes in the general council were assorted together in fortyeight ballots one of which was to be drawn every two months the first draught was now made and the lot produced a ballot in which were the names of andrea cicerchia and eight others these took upon them the magistracy of lords priors governors on the twentyeighth of march      the tumults were quieted the soldiers disbanded the fortresses of the dominion rendered to public commissaries many remunerated for their services fireworks played off and many feasts made and incredible manifestations of joy and ambassadors sent to all confederated cities to inform them that the city was delivered from the tyranny of the rabble and the palace cleansed which had been once thought an augean stable twelve of the principals of the conquered faction were put to death by the course of justice and thirty sent out to the frontiers and the major part of those who had fled declared rebels and enemies pro more revolutionum and by order of the council of petitions under authority given them by the general council their castles were restored to the salimbeni   0 but the envy of fortune according to the historian and the malice of their constitution according to truth would not suffer this felicity to be enjoyed for one year the tolommei were now returned and living in the same city with the salimbeni and this fact alone under such a plan of government would be enough to give the reader an anticipation of what would be the consequences conspiracies were formed in the country among the friends of the exiles and by companies of depredators who began to be troublesome and to do mischief in the dominion the florentines too began to set up claims upon parcels of territory and while this dispute was in negotiation between the ambassadors of the two people a plot was discovered to the great terror of those who governed the city commenced by a part of the family of tolommei who in concert with some popular men who intended to restore the reformers had drawn towards the city certain foreign troops in an irregular manner from different places and entertained them secretly in several of their fortresses these troops hearing that their destination was discovered and the plan impossible to be executed as many citizens were already imprisoned on account of it retreated and the prisoners confessing the truth were condemned to death yet the lords priors with the rest of their faction for the government was never any more than a faction were in trouble enough knowing the danger they were in from the divided minds of their fellowcitizens and from the hatred and immortal enmity which the florentines appeared to bear them this storm was averted by submitting the dispute with florence to the mediation of bologna and by the cession of many lands one conspiracy was scarcely suppressed and a foreign war declined from fear of themselves before another was discovered of greater moment and a more pernicious nature than the first excited by m spinello tolommei and a great number of reformers and others who had such intelligence in siena that it seemed to them easy to effect a revolution and make themselves masters of the state but as many examples both ancient and modern demonstrate conspiracies made by a multitude through the variety of interests of those who are comprehended in it have seldom attained their intended end and the greater part of conspirators have lost their lives and their fortunes because the     design has been revealed by such as had rather be rewarded with security than stand in danger of their lives when a suspicion has gone forth in the public so conspiracies of lesser numbers have been equally unfortunate through the want of power to carry them into execution the reformers excited by spinello tolommei were betrayed by one of their associates and one of their chiefs nanni di dota was beheaded but tolommei was too powerful a man for such a government to dare to make an example of he was therefore admitted to a treaty with the magistrates soon afterwards the count guido di santa fiora submitted to the commonwealth and after him monaldo di visconti di campiglia another conspiracy was discovered in siena among the reformers under the conduct of the same spinello tolommei a spy whom he sent with a letter to his correspondents in the city was intercepted threw himself out of a window in despair and was killed in the fall and a few of the conspirators were beheaded the city by these continual plots so often discovered was kept in constant terror as was every village and castle of the whole dominion for example in the castle of casole a violent sedition was awakened the casolans were divided into two parties and coming to arms among themselves skirmishes happened every day and many were killed and more wounded the same mischievous divisions were suffered too in the city of massa monte pulciano likewise was governed by a single assembly of signori who by their divisions occasioned similar seditions and civil wars among themselves and their different parties excited a long war between florence and siena at the conclusion of which the florentines by their intrigues laid the sienese under many disadvantages and these would have been greater if at this time it had not been known that the sienese were in intimate correspondence with giovan galeazzo visconti lord of milan who after having taken the city of verona had with a great increase of his power taken the city of padua and made prisoner of francesco da carrara who was lord of it on the twentysixth of november      to give some satisfaction to the people who began again to show signs of discontent it was determined in siena that to the number of the ten lords priors there should be added one of those popular men who had been reformers and it was declared that when mention     should be made of those persons who were of the reformers and who might be admitted to occupy the office of the signori and who called themselves of the people of the larger number it should be understood to apply to their fathers sons brothers by the masculine line and those who had been admonished between      and      should be comprehended in the number of the other popular men who had not been of the reformers nor signori and if any of the monte of the nine for this was now the name of distinction or of the monte of the twelve had been of the said reformers they might be signori for the monte of the people of the greater number but he alone should be considered as of the reformers and not any of his ancestors descendants or connections as these should all remain in the monte heap lump or collection of which they had been before they ordained moreover that of the chamberlains and notaries who were eleven in number four should be of the nine four of the twelve and three of the other popular men and whereas in the other magistracies there used to be in each two nobles one of the twelve and one of the nine there should now be added one popular man who had not been either of the nine or of the twelve and thus in each of those magistracies there should be two nobles and three populars that is to say as it is expressed in the record of the deliberation of the council one of the nine one of the twelve and one of the other populars and of these other populars one at one time was to be of those who had been reformers and of the signori for the monte of the people of the greater number and one other at another time of those of the same monte who were not of the reformers nor the lords defenders and by these provisions those who held the government in their hands studied to conciliate the friendship of the little people and take away in some degree the occasions of conspiracies and that they might not alienate from their government the minds of the nobles they resolved that all the podestaries and ordinary captainships such as the captainship of maremma montagna valdichiana and others should be given to the nobles and to no others and when occurrences should oblige them to send abroad extraordinary captains they might send part of them from the nobles and part from the populars and this order in favor of the nobles was made perpetual these and other regulations were not sufficient to satisfy all     nor yet the hostile designs of florence nor the victory obtained by niccolò piccolomini over the brettoni to divert the people of siena from their discontents so that on the eleventh of may      another amendment of their constitution was attempted the apprehensions of foreign war as well as domestic broils increased and to facilitate the public deliberations that they might not upon every occasion have to call a general council they introduced a council of substitutes and called them the simiglianti with the same forms and the same authority which the council formerly had in the times of the twelve and the nine this council comprehended all those who had been of the lords priors governors and those who had their names in the boxes of the same magistracy to whom that they might not appear to be diffident of them they afterwards added twelve noblemen elected from the nobility in general and to gratify and oblige those of their citizens who were abroad and prevent them from joining their enemies within and without they gave a pardon to those rebels who had been confined for six months and had observed their limits and although their time was not expired gave them leave to return to the city those who were confined for a year might return in two months and those who were confined for more than a year in six months at this time batista piccolomini returned from milan who had been sent as ambassador there and with him was sent m giovanni della porta treasurer of the lord giovan galeazzo with orders to raise and take into pay as large a number of soldiers as possible and to this end the treasurer sent his paymasters with the count ugolotti bianchiardi who having been sent with the ambassador by giovan galeazzo for the service of the city of siena went to marca and engaged in the pay of visconti m brogliole and brandolino each with a hundred cavalry and ordered that boldrino da panicale should form another company the florentines carried on their intrigues with so many factions in the state and discovered a disposition so hostile and designs or at least desires of making themselves masters not only of monte pulciano and the other dependencies but of siena itself that the government thought it advisable to hasten their deliberations upon a subject they had in contemplation for several months a league and confederation with giovan galeazzo visconti lord of milan and conte di virtù this prince since he     possessed verona and padua had intended to take possession of bologna which had been sometimes under the dominion of the house of visconti and because the florentines as confederates of the bolognese had sent them assistance and favored them as much as they could with their armed men took upon him the protection of the city of siena and promised her ambassador to assist her and sent the signor paolo savelli with three hundred lances upon whose arrival uncommon rejoicings were shown in the city galeazzo engaged in this warfare not so much for the service of siena as to have an opportunity of maintaining the war in conjunction with them upon that side against the florentines that they having employment enough to defend their own houses might not be able to send succor to bologna and by this means to endeavor to make himself master of several places in tuscany from whence he might hope by maintaining the divisions and most ardent hatred which went on every day increasing on account of monte pulciano and the injuries the florentines and sienese committed against each other to make himself master of the province and at length king of italy an ambition he had long entertained to this end he entered into negotiation with the ambassadors of siena and on the twentysecond of september      the treaty was signed the articles were that the league should continue ten years that common cause should be made in a war against florence that galeazzo should maintain during the war which was to be declared in fifteen days seven hundred lancemen with three horses to each lance in his pay in tuscany for the service of the commons of siena and the sienese were to have three hundred in their pay in the same manner with two hundred crossbowmen that if their enemies should send forces from tuscany into lombardy it should be lawful for the count to avail himself of these his forces but that siena should not be obliged to send her forces out of tuscany that the count should not be obliged to make war or defend the sienese against any other enemies than the florentines that any other community of tuscany might be admitted into this league that all the cities lands fortresses and places which by the league might be acquired in this war should belong to the republic of siena if it had any previous pretensions to the dominion of it otherwise every one should be left to its liberty upon condition of holding the league and their allies for     friends and their opposers for enemies and of giving hospitality passage and provisions on paying for them to the people of the league galeazzo might make peace truce or armistice with the people of florence including the commons and people of siena with all their lands cities and subjects but the sienese could not make either without his consent and the ratification was to be on both sides exchanged in three months a war ensued which lasted till      and was then concluded by a peace and a confederation between many republics and princes the conte di virtù florence bologna perugia the marquis of ferrara siena the lord of mantua the lords de malatesti lucca the count di montefeltro pisa c this confederation however was not well observed and the inhabitants of monte pulciano particularly violated it as was supposed at the instigation of florence this occasioned not only a ratification of the former treaty but the formation of a new one between the republic of siena and the signor giovan galeazzo visconti conte di virtù lord and imperial vicar of milan the county or earldom of virtù is a state in france in the province of champagne which was given by king john in dower to isabella his daughter married to this prince giovan galeazzo visconti which acquired him the title of conte di virtù and of which marriage was born madame valentina wife of louis duke of orleans brother of charles vi king of france who had in dower the same conte di virtù and the city of asti in piedmont of charles their firstborn duke of orleans was born the king louis xii of giovanni their second son count of angoulême was born charles of angoulême father of the king francis i these successors of valentina pretended after the death without issue of giovan maria and filippo maria their brothers sons of giovan galeazzo that the state of milan belonged to them and for this reason the king louis xii and the king francis i afterwards made that celebrated war in lombardy and recovered and lost several times over the duchy of milan to return from this digression—on the ninth of november      the treaty was ratified and exchanged between siena and the count yet a fresh conspiracy was discovered in the city excited by spinello tolommei in banishment and the reformers in conjunction with foreigners and monte pulciano again rebelled but the arms of siena aided by the count and his captain charles     malatesta were triumphant at home and abroad and this year the first bombardment ever seen in tuscany was practised upon some little reverse of fortune when the count lost the fortress of padua and when to the calamities of war those of pestilence and famine were added in    0 the noble families of salimbeni tolommei and malavolti unable to bear one another and some of them still less willing to submit to a superior resumed their old employment of exciting seditions florence wanted peace and the pope exhorted it the families of tolommei and malavolti still jealous of the salimbeni and their superior influence and favor with the count began to stir up discontents in their opinion it was neither profitable nor glorious nor even honorable for the republic to waste itself on all sides for the service of the count galeazzo who in the greatest exigency of the war had by withdrawing his forces left it a prey to the enemy from this specimen of his conduct the sienese could only expect if he had been or should be victorious a servitude which they would find very bitter and irksome every one who was not blinded by an immeasurable hatred which the vulgar had conceived against the florentines for the injuries they had done the republic must already see the disposition of the count and especially since the arrival from milan of the marquis andreasso cavalcabò of his privy council to take upon him the office of senator of siena to which he had been elected the marquis had demanded with great ceremony in the name of his master and on his behalf that for the common utility the dominion of the city of siena should be given to him this embassy caused a wonderful change in the minds of all those who desired that their country should remain independent and free and the more as they knew that the generality of the citizens without listening to any arguments against it and without any consideration of futurity or of the nature of princes never content with a middle flight and never long to be depended on were not only inclined to it but had prepared a petition to the general council that an answer should be given to the counts ambassador in these words we are content and as a singular favor we supplicate his lordship that from his benignity he will be pleased to take upon him and accept the dominion and government of the city of siena its country and district and of us his devoted children and servants and that he rule and govern us as to his excellency shall     seem convenient and descending to particulars they added and affirmed we are ready to give and confer upon him the city of siena its country and district with its simple and mixed empire and to transfer to him liberally the lordship and government of it so that he may freely dispose of it in all things as of the city of milan or padua or any other the most submissive to him the contents of this petition although at first prepared in secret had reached the ears of those who endeavored to promote peace with florence and the public tranquillity wonderfully irritated their minds and incited them to show to their fellowcitizens the incredible damage to the city which must arise from such an unlimited submission and to foretell that in a little time when they should begin to experience the bitterness of servitude to such as are born and bred to liberty they would in vain repent of their levity rashness and error they recalled to the recollection of the citizens the great virtues of their fathers and other ancestors which had defended their country preserved their liberties and transmitted both to them and with how much generosity bravery and magnanimity they themselves had defended it in arms against charles iv when present in siena in      with a powerful army that they were under the most tender obligation to transmit the sacred trust to their posterity and this they might easily do to the inestimable benefit of the city by a peace which they had the power and opportunity to make that when they should be delivered from the calamities of foreign war and the yoke of tyranny which hung over their necks they should be at leisure to make provisions of grain against the famine and to find alleviations of their distresses from the plague to these reasonings of the tolommei and malavolti were opposed those of the salimbeni who having been long favorites of the ghibelline party were mortal enemies of the others who were guelphs moved by the interests of faction more than those of the public service having procured the petition to be heard and the decree passed and proclaimed by the council in order to oppress the opposite party by arms when they had not been able to answer their reasons they drew over to their side m giovan tedesco head of the ghibellines in arezzo with his cavalry and marched through the city accompanied with a     great multitude of people of their faction and proclaimed the name of giovan galeazzo visconti conte di vertù and lord of milan protector and chief of the ghibelline faction in lombardy and slew in this sedition twenty men of the followers of the adverse party and made many prisoners among whom was niccolò malavolti who though he had often honorably acted for the service of the republic was with many others beheaded the other members of the families of tolommei and malavolti with many of their followers left the city and retired to their castles the people of siena wearied out of patience by being the dupes and tools of two or three ambitious families were easily led by one of them to rejoice in placing a master over all they were now so inclined and disposed to servitude to one in preference to a few that blinded with anger they would not see the evident ruin which must come with the destruction of public liberty and neither themselves nor their leaders knowing the true cause of their divisions and misfortunes nor any remedy by which union and liberty might be reconciled by law they humbly solicited the subjugation of their country and the privilege—of passive obedience on the fifteenth day of march in the same year the record was approved in the general council and authority was given to the lords priors to appoint a syndic and a deputy of the commons of siena to execute all that was contained in the resolution and to deliver the keys of the city to the commissaries of the count galeazzo with its absolute dominion without pact or convention of any kind the example is here complete and although the tyranny of the visconti was afterwards overturned various forms of a republic attempted exiles sent out and recalled as usual yet as the executive power was always left in an assembly and inveterate factions were not legally separated from each other nor empowered to control each other the same divisions seditions and civil wars were perpetual till the same weariness induced the people again to confer the sovereignty on the grandduke of etruria where it remains to this time it is not easy to conceive what further experiments can be made of a sovereignty in one assembly or how the consequences to be drawn from them can be more decisive whether the assembly consists of a larger or a smaller number of nobles or commons of great people or little of rich     or poor of substantial men or the rabble the effects are all the same—no order no safety no liberty because no government of law it is often said that the republics of greece rome and tuscany produced in the minds of their citizens great virtues an ardent love for their country undaunted bravery the love of poverty the love of science c but if a little attention is bestowed upon the subject these will be found to be very feeble arguments in their favor it was not the love of their country but of their faction there were in every city three factions at least every citizen loved one third of his fellowcitizens and hated the other two thirds it is true that in such a state of things affection for friends strengthens in proportion to the fear and hatred of enemies and the desire of revenge becomes as strong a passion and demands gratification as imperiously as friendship and perhaps even more how was it possible when men were always in war and danger that they should not be brave courage is a quality to be acquired by all men by habit and practice when scenes of death and carnage are every day before his eyes how is it possible that a man should not acquire a contempt of death from his familiarity with it especially if life is made a burden by continual exertion and mortification the love of poverty is a fictitious virtue that never existed a preference of merit to wealth has sometimes existed under all governments but most of all under aristocracies this is wisdom and virtue in all but can much of this be found in the histories of any country that was not poor and obliged to be so can we see much of it in florence and siena the love of science and literature always grows where there is much public deliberation and debate and in such governments where every faculty as well as passion is always on the stretch great energy of mind appears but there is a form of government which produces a love of law liberty and country instead of disorder irregularity and a faction which produces as much and more independence of spirit and as undaunted bravery as much esteem of merit in preference to wealth and as great simplicity sincerity and generosity to all the community as others do to a faction which produces as great a desire of knowledge and infinitely better faculties to pursue it which besides produces security of property and the desire and opportunities for commerce which the others obstruct   0 shall any one hesitate then to prefer such a government as this to all others a constitution in which the people reserve to themselves the absolute control of their purses one essential branch of the legislature and the inquest of grievances and state crimes will always produce patriotism bravery simplicity and science and that infinitely better for the order security and tranquillity they will enjoy by putting the executive power into one hand which it becomes their interest as well as that of the nobles to watch and control     chapter sixth bologna the tuscans were an ancient and original people of italy whose power was so considerable that they extended their dominion from one sea to the other these people some ages before the foundation of rome built twelve cities and among them bologna which was made the capital of the kingdom some years afterwards when constantine from his reverence for the holy see had transported the throne of the empire to byzantium and the majesty of the emperors was become from its distance little respected by the italians many cities and bologna among the rest in     instituted a republic claterna a neighboring city at the distance of twelve miles which had been built also by the tuscans likewise erected an independent republic but first an emulation arose and afterwards a war in which the claternates were subdued and they being as discontented with their obedience to the citizens of bologna as they had formerly been with that to their king they were received according to the custom of the romans into the country of the conquerors this city was afterwards ruined by the barbarians so entirely that no vestige of it remains but in history in     otho† emperor of the germans came into italy delivered it from the yoke of the berengarii obtained of the pope the crown imperial and with general applause the title of otho the great this prince perceiving that the cities of italy from their natural generosity of sentiment and their distance from the emperor could not be held in subjection conceded to many of them their liberty reserving a light tribute ‡bologna obtained with a sort of preëminence and with a smaller tribute her usual liberty with the privilege of electing     her magistrates with a mixed authority and conformably to the institution of otho gave a form to her republic with three councils with the title of a community the one was the council of the credenza which was that of the consuls and the other magistrates the other was called the special council and comprehended the nobility the third was called the general council and was that of the people which without the power of suffrage was assembled in order to be present at the administration of the oaths to the magistrates and other similar public appearances in this constitution there is a shadow and no more of three branches the people who ought to constitute an essential part were excluded from all influence and only called out occasionally to look at their rulers and gratify their senses with shouts of acclamation the credenza and the nobility formed an aristocracy in which the magistrates were appointed and the administration conducted it seems to have been an imitation of the roman consuls and senate without even the poor expedient of a tribune to control them in      the cities of italy began to elect pretors whom they named podestà or bailiffs and excited by their example the citizens of bologna elected guido sassi to that magistracy and invested him publicly with the sceptre and the sword of justice this was a reduction of the divisions of the republic to that union which is the effect of the government of a single person against the corruption of which they endeavored to provide by the college of consuls and by the brevity of annual magistrates felsinus king of tuscany was the founder of the royal city of bologna the mother of arts sciences and studies and the nurse of laws and after his own name called it felsina this city which the italian authors delight to describe is situated at the foot of the apennines in the middle of the emilian way in the fortyfourth degree of latitude between mountains and plains equally beautiful and fertile in the north a fruitful plain in the east the river savena in the west the rhine not far from the sea and in the neighborhood of lakes and rivers     abounding with fish the air is temperate and the country plentiful of every thing necessary and useful to human life this glorious city was made by the kings of tuscany the metropolis of their dominion and the seat of their residence their empire indeed extended only over the twelve cities of which this was the first the others were veii chiusi cortona populonia tarquini vetulonia volterra volsena roselle perugia arezzo and fiesole in the year      the form of the republic of bologna the state of the city and the customs of the citizens were as follows those who shall read their history will easily perceive that this republic did not in those ancient and rude times administer the city scientifically nor conduct skilfully the affairs of war they elected three councils a special council a general council and a council of credenza in the authority of which with their magistrates and judges the supreme government consisted the special council was elected annually in this manner in the beginning of december the special and the general council were convoked either by the consuls or by the pretor according as one or the other of those officers happened to be in the government of the republic in presence of whom every one of the council observing the order of his tribe made his election and his drawing by lot for this purpose there stood before a tribunal two urns in one of which were placed to be drawn as many tickets as there were men of that tribe present in council and on them their names were written in the other were as many blanks except ten written upon by the hands of two brothers hermits of st augustin deputed by the council for that purpose when the drawing was to be made of the first tribe a boy of the age of twelve years or less drew a ticket from the principal urn and the person whose name came out presented himself at the tribunal the boy at the second urn drew another ticket and if by chance it was blank that person was excluded from the election of the council but if the ticket was written upon he became an elector and this method was followed until the ten black or written tickets declared the ten electors of that tribe this being done the same was repeated by the men of the other tribes one by one until forty men that is to say ten for     each tribe were electors then the forty electors retired to a secret place and elected six hundred men that is to say one hundred and fifty for each tribe excluding however the mean and poor artisans occupied in low and base works and minors of eighteen years neither was any one obliged to accept of this office and these six hundred men then presented themselves as the special council in the same manner and order in substance in three days the council of credenza was elected but all the doctors of laws without other qualification or appointment might enter this council and that of the six hundred after three days more the general council were elected exactly in the same mode but he who had been an elector in one council could not be an elector in another these councils assembled sometimes all together and at other times separately according to the nature of their business and they assembled at the sound of a bell or trumpet there were provided by these councils three bells the lesser the middle and the greater for the special council the smaller bell was rung for the council of credenza the middle and for the council general the greater it was forbidden to the consul or the pretor to convoke the councils if he had not previously ordered the business which was to be treated by the chancellor to be written in a book provided for that purpose when the council was collected the chancellor publicly proposed the subject that was to be considered and this done the orators who were four and stood near the tribunal of the magistrates reasoned in public a like privilege was granted to the orators of the magistrates who were also four but this only touching the business of the magistrates and their opinions in answer to the question separately put to them were written down and called the resolution or division it was sometimes tolerated when it appeared to be necessary that private or individual magistrates should harangue in council who mounted in a pulpit with a loud voice delivered their opinions and upon the questions proposed by them a division was made or a resolution taken these divisions were made in various ways sometimes the opinion of every one was taken in secret and written down by a notary successively at other times every one gave his vote openly and audibly and frequently the decision was made by white and black beans now those of one opinion went to one side and those of a different judgment to the other     then one party stood up and another sat down and in these cases the voices were counted by the ministers publicly the will and resolution of the council being determined the decree was published and recorded in a book and another council could not be convoked till this decree was made a number of notaries were employed some to write the speeches and opinions others to publish the decrees and others to receive the laws such were the usages of the councils of this republic which was honored with the name of commons or community of the magistrates some were ordinary others extraordinary the ordinary were created and deputed every year in the republic and were called the magistrates of the court the extraordinary were those who were deputed for some extraordinary business the principal ordinary magistrates were the consuls of the community or the pretor instead of them the consuls of justice the judges of the community the attorneygeneral the judges of appeals the judges of new crimes the judges of the office of exiles or outlaws the judges of new causes a judge who was the executioner of sentences and the questor and they all had their soldiers and notaries the extraordinary were the legates curators and syndics the same mode was observed in the choice of consuls as of counsellors the election of pretor was in this manner in the month of september the councils general and special were called together at the pleasure of the magistrate but before they convened the day and hour that each tribe was to go out to the choice by lot was published and in the manner already described in the election of counsellors the forty men were drawn from one and the other council assembled excluding however the magistrates these forty suddenly retired to a secret chamber where they were locked up from the consuls of the state and the merchants and bankers that no one might by word or letter corrupt them and if through the whole night and the next day by consent at least of twentyseven of them they had not created a pretor they lost the authority to elect and the next day the pretor convoked the general council and the council of credenza and from one and the other were deputed forty men as before and if these to the number of twentyseven could not agree the election and deputation of the pretor was     referred to a suffrage or joint ballot of the general council and council of credenza the pretor might be elected from any city at the pleasure of the council provided he was not a relation of any of the electors as far as the third degree nor possessed a real estate in bologna or its territory nor was less than sixandthirty years of age and it was an injunction always to elect a man of reputation virtuous noble and wise of right according to the statute a pretor could not be elected from the place of the antecedent pretor yet this was sometimes practised but he must not be his relation the election ended and published to the councils public letters were written to the pretor elect requesting his acceptance of the honor that was offered him and upon the day when he made his entry into the city he was met and honored by all the people the pretor had the same prerogatives and authorities which the consuls had and therefore according to the times the republic was governed sometimes by consuls and sometimes by pretors and sometimes there were at once both consuls and a pretor as appears by instruments signed both by the consuls and a pretor in the years      and      it appears that instead of consuls the citizens sometimes turned to an election of a foreigner for a pretor to compose the discord which arose between those of the citizens who abused their liberty to the end that they might call delinquents to account and punish with more severity and not fluctuate so easily from love or hatred fear or favor but because for the most part the pretors were not skilled in the laws at first two and afterwards four judges of the law were called to aid them and the pretors were decorated with high hats long swords and a sceptre to denote their power potestà and from this they were afterwards vulgarly called podestà besides the consuls or the pretor in whom resided the sum total of the republic in peace and war certain other magistrates as has been mentioned governed and the mode of electing them was the same two tribes were called out to the lot one day and the two others the next and the deputed electors were prohibited to choose a father son brother or any other relation and moreover such as were inept unskilful or incapable of such government and according as any one was elected he was proclaimed with a loud voice in council to obviate all frauds which might be attempted the ten written tickets being drawn all     the rest were examined in presence of the council to see that there were no more than the law allowed it was provided by law that no one could elect or proclaim a magistrate who did not pay twenty pence into the purses of the treasury which were exacted by the pretor and it was forbidden to any one to accept of the office if he had not been out of it one year none could be elected but by that tribe in which he had his domicil and every one who entered on a magistracy took an oath to exercise his office with integrity and fidelity besides the magistrates already mentioned there were those of the soldiery the mode of electing whom was the same but the government different the command in chief was given to the consuls or to the pretor the officers of the army among the cavalry in the infantry of the people and lastly of the carroccio  were different the officers or prefects of the foot of the horse and of the people because they carried a standard gonfalone were called gonfaloniers and each one in his tribe was elected by his fellows in the manner before described moreover some citizens served on foot and some others on horseback and those who performed the service of their own accord did it more willingly than when deputed by commission of the magistrates to that purpose wherefore when any enterprise was undertaken by the military order every one whether of the foot or the horse according to the necessity went out under his own standard or ensign and if the service required a greater appearance each gonfalonier of the people led out his own tribe and then it was said that the people were gone out it rarely happened that all the tribes went out at once but at one time the infantry of one tribe at another the cavalry of another now one whole tribe and then another all the men were enrolled in the militia from eighteen years of age to seventy at which age men were released from all public offices so as to be even rejected from the council and if by accident any old man who exceeded that age inconsiderately entered the council the election was annulled in every parish those who kept horses for war were described or registered in companies by deputed mustermasters these companies some of which were registered by tens and some by twentyfives according to the number     of the soldiers described by the mustermasters at certain periods conducted their horses to officers deputed for the service to be reviewed and approved and notaries took down their names with their furniture and the quality of the horses military expeditions were of two sorts one with squadrons or legions of light horse the other with regular armies and great was the difference between being ordered out upon an excursion of troopers and an expedition with the army because of the frequent excursions of the cavalry it was ordained that in every tribe there should be public marshals or blacksmiths and every master of a burgh should have ready and in order all the instruments for shoeing horses to the end that the cavalry passing that way and having occasion might be always served the treasurer paid a certain stipend to every magistrate and kept an account of the public revenues and all expenses the revenues consisted in tributes gifts and tolls or customs the gifts were upon the gates bankers lands mills oxen c and if the revenue was not sufficient for the expenses of the war a tax was imposed by order of the council upon polls and estates according to every mans possessions and incomes thus much concerning the ordinary magistrates the extraordinary were always elected by the pretor as the ambassadors directors of public works and the syndics no magistrate could go upon an embassy and to any one who was sent out of the territory upon an embassy they assigned three horses two notaries and one cook if the embassy was to the pope or the emperor the expense attendants and servants were ordered at the discretion of the council a commission was given the ambassador in writing and the whole legation was governed by instructions it was ordained in general terms that no one should petition or seek to be created of the number of magistrates and if any one was known to seek it his conduct was publicly related in council and it was reproached to him as the greatest infamy the officers of state with the title of podestà with their judges and notaries were elected partly from the mountains and partly from the plains or low lands the castles which were subject to the bolognese elected also their own consuls and when they were commanded went to war with them and carried various standards all the burdens and tributes were much heavier upon them than upon     the citizens excepting only some persons who for particular merit had been exempted by the council there were many colleges or companies in the city as that of the merchants the goldsmiths and the artificers the merchants and goldsmiths created their own consuls and the companies of artificers appointed their own treasurers and those who were able to do it assembled together in associations for the promotion of commerce and improvement in the arts the people and the city afterwards increasing there were elected certain colleges of arms one called that of the lombards another della branca and another del griffone and these had the care of the arms of the republic and were decorated by the city with many privileges and the foreigners who were of these companies were made citizens of bologna if they had been householders in the city ten years and might be of the council of the commons stewards of companies and magistrates equally with other citizens the greatest part of the laborers in the country were slaves of the nobles from which servitude however they were afterwards liberated the community paying a certain sum of money to their masters all these particulars of their constitution were found in the ancient customs or the privileges granted or confirmed by the emperors or in the decrees of the councils or in the laws of the city the former were called reformationi the latter statuti the decrees were those ordinances which at the prayer of the pretor were adopted by the councils or made by him and approved by them the laws were no other than the ordinances made by the legislators who were called statutieri no ordinary magistrate was of these legislators but they were deputed according to the wants of the city from time to time and after the example of the athenians reviewed the old laws and altered amended accommodated and reformed them according to their judgment the laws which these legislators made were reported to the council by them recited publicly to the people and written in the volumes of civil law which to this day are called the statuto this constitution was preserved till after the year    0 the houses were of wood without much ornament or skill in architecture and from this cause they were frequently exposed to terrible fires among all the buildings the most noble objects were the steeples built upon the churches and the towers built  00 by all the principal citizens the frequent fires and the common calamities of italy the deluges of water and the frequent exiles of the citizens are supposed to have destroyed many objects and buried in oblivion many facts worthy of eternal remembrance there are greater traces of an artificial and scientific legislation in this constitution than in either that of florence or siena nevertheless all authority legislative executive and judicial was in one council for when the special and general council met together they acted as one and when one met alone it acted as sovereign the podestà and his judges and notaries were only deputies of the council although so much pains was taken by mixing lot with choice by rotations and other prudent precautions to prevent ambition faction and sedition from entering all was ineffectual omitting most of the wars foreign and domestic we may select a few instances from whence the operation of this form of government may be evinced henry v as he was called but of germany the sixth  after his succession to his father frederick passing through bologna with constantia his wife in his way to rome to receive the imperial crown was magnificently received by the people and entertained by gerardo bishop of bologna in the bishops palace in acknowledgment of his kind reception he gave to gerardo the title of prince which was afterwards retained by the bishops of bologna henry was not only crowned as emperor but with much ceremony invested with the kingdom of the two sicilies as the inheritance of his wife constantia in the next year gerardo bishop of bologna by his favor with the emperor and the pope and the privileges he had obtained for the city was grown into such reputation for justice and virtue with all men that he was constituted pretor with great popularity and in the beginning of his dignity he contracted a friendship with albert the count of prato and made a treaty for mutual defence gerardo having the first year administered in such a manner as to be thought a bright example of a good and moderate ruler seemed a little afterwards to be changed in his whole nature began to desire innovation and openly to favor the plebeians oppressing the nobles and first men of the city this  0  gave occasion to grave disorders and seditions for the patricians who had conferred the office upon him and were accustomed and habituated to the command of others could not easily tolerate this injury and the evident partiality of the pretor so they assembled in the palace and created twelve consuls men of great authority in bologna gerardo hearing of the election of consuls was in high wrath and began to threaten them with his frown but they quickly published to the people that he was deposed from the office of pretor giacomo orsi a powerful citizen and a favorer of gerardo collected a company of armed men and attempted to oppose the resolution of the consuls and patricians whereupon specialino griffoni not less celebrated in letters than in arms and one who was studious and intent upon maintaining the republic turned round to the nobles and harangued them as follows is it consistent with our duty or our honor fellowcitizens to suffer that authority which for three hundred years and more we have enjoyed of directing this our republic to be wrested from us by a private person placed by us alone in the government of it for the general safety of the city shall we submit to become like the vilest populace esteemed of no importance or authority and subjected to that gerardo to whom we are and forever shall be objects of jealousy and terror so long as our republic shall remain safe and sound rouse up your spirits at once never think of bearing this insupportable tyranny and let the object itself and the opportunity of the moment stir you to this enterprise infinitely more than my words and accept of me according to your pleasure either as a soldier or a captain in the service to which i am willing to devote my soul and body  amidst all this aristocratical thunder the still voice of reason and experience whispers to a candid reader the probability that the nobles were more tyrannical than gerardo that the people were impatient under it gerardo disposed to alleviate their burdens and the nobles thence alarmed with the apprehension of a master over themselves rather than over the people   0  the speech being ended he seized his arms and accompanied by the consuls and the greater part of the nobles marched to the bishops palace giacomo orsi with those devoted to him opposing them in arms they came to action but giacomo not being able to resist the impetuosity of the assailants with great difficulty saved himself with gerardo by flying from the city the consuls disappointed by their flight were the more exasperated and seeing orsi out of their power they declared him a rebel against the republic confiscated all his property and ordered his house and tower to be razed to the ground such decision delivered the city for the present from this violent sedition and with as much virtue as that which delivered the roman patricians from mælius or manlius but the next year under new consuls although it appeared that the sedition of gerardo was quieted and that no disposition remained for innovation yet all on a sudden on the first of july some of his abettors proceeded from words to blows with some of the adverse party in which affray pietro scannabecchi lost his right hand and scannabecco ramponi lay mortally wounded among many others both killed and wounded the day after both parties prepared their arms and came to battle again in the palace of the community when giuseppe occelletti and tomaso toschi da i gieremei supporters of gerardo were slain whereupon the consuls were again obliged to take arms against gerardo who having taken possession of a castle called sorresano had there fortified himself they sent out guglielmo malavolti a consul with a chosen band of soldiers who conducted himself with so much skill and bravery that he drove gerardo from his fortress and burnt his castle in a short time the emperor henry by a decree liberated the bishop gerardo whom he called his prencipe from the oath of calumny  and permitted him to exercise his functions in all his causes and those of the bishopric by an administrator or other legitimate person the next year      it seems they tried the experiment of a pretor again that is to say as we may conjecture the family of gieremei and their party prevailed in the public councils to carry this point and guido cino was elected but as he followed in his administration the steps of gerardo after having done  0  intolerable things against many persons he was dishonorably deposed from his office and accused of an infinite number of iniquities and attempting to fly he was made prisoner by those whom he had offended all his teeth were drawn out of his head for his punishment and then he was set at liberty in his place guido da vilmercato of milan was appointed in   0  civil discords arose in the city by which bologna was not a little troubled and afflicted the first disorder that occurred arose from an ancient enmity between the asinelli and the scannabecchi these two factions meeting in the high street with a sudden and impetuous onset engaged in arms and many were killed and wounded on both sides this quarrel was composed by the interposition of the pretor and the other nobles but another soon arose from some private offence for giovanni tettalasini had killed guido pepoli this enmity between these two families continued forty years before it was pacified in      upon some public occasion among a great concourse of nobility on horseback gieremia malavolti falling from his horse was killed to the grief of the people and the emperor and probably to the equal joy of the nobility in the year      there were in the city of bologna ten thousand scholars at the academy for the study of the law in such reputation was that university  the quarrel between frederick the emperor and gregory the pope revived in bologna the party distinctions of guelphs and ghibellines drawn from germany in the time of henry iv not only some cities favored the emperor and others the pontiff but in the city of bologna the citizens arrived at that degree of extreme madness that in hatred of each other they strove to deprive each other of their lives and fortunes together sons became enemies to their fathers and brothers to brothers and as if it was not enough to shed their own blood like mad dogs they proceeded to demolish houses and to burning the cities the trees and the corn this diabolical pestilence produced such an aversion to each other that they studied to distinguish themselves in all things in their clothes in the colors they wore in  0  their actions their speech their walk their food their salutations their drink their manner of cutting bread in folding their napkins in the cut of their hair and innumerable other extravagances equally whimsical a plague truly horrible a flame wholly inextinguishable which proved the extinction of many noble families and the ruin of many miserable cities the next year under the pretorship of uberto visconti a cruel war arose out of a violent sedition godfrey count of romagna favorite of frederick took manzolino a castle of romagna and drove out from it the prefect of bologna this officers return stimulated the people to a violent revolt because every one lamented that the castle had been lost by the neglect or misconduct of the pretor and that of those who governed in the city and in such manner did this indignation conceived in the hearts of all increase that seizing their arms against the will of the republic they collected together in the piazza immediately made one giuseppe toschi their leader a man not only bold but rash and with the loudest cries ran tumultuously to the palace of the pretor where giuseppe demanded the standard of the people and the armed guards of the palace declaring that he would go out and meet the enemy and prevent his committing further depredations on the territory of bologna the pretor refused his demand but giuseppe consulting only his own temerity broke open the gates of the palace forced his entry into it ransacked every thing and burned all the papers of the pretor in order to acquire more favor with the people he turned out all the public tables rung the bell contrary to the will of the pretor and the guards and having thus collected all the people armed in the piazza he had the carroccio brought out and ordered all things for a war he then arranged four thousand infantry under bornio gieremei whose tool he probably was eight hundred cavalry under orso caccianemici and prendiparte prendiparti and four hundred men at arms under alberto galluzzi and lodovico ariosti in this curious manner a foundation was laid for a change in the commonwealth and an institution of the people they called by this name the people the new republic placed in the hands of the people whose superintendents were the prefect of the people the antiani the consuls of the merchants and the masters of colleges according to thomas aquinas the antiani  0  were instituted in the cities of italy as the tribunes were in rome that they might take the part of the plebeians but after this giuseppe whom they created prefect of the people no other prefect is mentioned till      the florentines and the genoese having ordained a republic of the people about the same time introduced also the prefect of the people and the antiani and this popular government was sustained with its proper councils to whom the prefect and the antiani were governors the pretors and judges of the pretors remaining as they had been before that time six antiani were created from all the fourandtwenty tribes and the use and creation of these antiani continued as long as the republic their number only being increased as well as that of the consuls of merchants and masters of colleges by this change of government the republic became involved in two wars at once with imola and modena and the people of bologna finding their affairs not succeed to their wishes rose in a tumult and killed rolando formaglini superintendent of piumazzo because his fortress was taken by the enemy they having suspicions that he had betrayed it for money the animosities of the guelphs and ghibellines mixing with the disputes between the nobles and commons produced such convulsions in all the cities especially in those adhering to frederick that in modena reggio parma cremona bergamo and pavia those who favored the church were finally expelled by the power of their adversaries and driven into exile and bologna still continued to be agitated with seditions as well as with disputes with the bishop and the pope by whom the people were excommunicated in       was settled the controversy with the bishop but a greater tumult than had ever been known arose on account of alberto lambertazzi who being in the piazza and seeing gabriel sanzio his enemy killed him this homicide put arms into the hands of a multitude of citizens although the pretor not having the criminal in his power declared him an outlaw the relations and friends of the deceased did not the less greedily watch for a severe revenge as they saw that the party of the lambertazzi were upon their guard and went about prepared  0  with a great retinue of armed men they consulted upon modes of getting into action meeting one day with alphonso the brother of albert they came to a rude scuffle together in which much blood was shed and more mischief would have been done if the interposition of the pretor had not interrupted it but this broil was the beginning of discords and seditions which lasted a long time the hatred between the most considerable families had grown so inveterate—having continued with few interruptions for forty years namely from the death of guido peppoli—that much bloodshed was apprehended but john of bologna a famous preacher coming into the city preached peace charity and benevolence to his immortal honor with so much success that a kind of reconciliation was made between the families of delfini and malataschi torelli and andalò griffoni artenisii and castel de britti galluzzi and carbonesi lambertini and scannabecchi pepoli and tettalasini who had been constant enemies and several intermarriages were contracted among them in the year      is found the next mention of the antiani of the people who presided in the instituted republic of the people and moderated in two councils one called the little council which they with the consuls of the merchants and goldsmiths masters of the arts and of arms the gonfaloniers of the people and of the collegi and their counsellors composed and the other called the grand council in which they were again found with the other larger number of counsellors and all that was by these ordained was perpetually to be observed so that all laws were made executed and judged by the majority of this single council or by persons deputed by them the same original and essential fault that had occasioned their miseries and continued to increase them in      secretly making great preparations for war and calling to their assistance the march romagna and azzo da este they created eight noblemen to conduct the war against the modenese these were alberto galluzzi lambertazzi prendiparti samaritani scannabecchi ariosti guido gieremei and cattellani for captaingeneral they elected the marquis azzo da este but he being infirm to show his gratitude to the senate sent them three thousand cavalry and two thousand  0  foot gieremei had command of half the men at arms and lambertazzi of the infantry it appears from this that though the government was called popular and the people that the people was no more than an aristocracy and that the nobles were not excluded the two families of gieremei and lambertazzi were very near the head of the republic and as we shall soon see most eagerly contending for the foremost station an obstinate battle was fought in which great exertions both of skill and bravery were shown and a complete victory obtained by the bolognese and king hentio  taken prisoner in      the treaties with the marquis da este and the commons of ferrara were confirmed in the council general and special of the commons of bologna the next year the republic adorned itself with a new magistrate ricardo villa being made pretor but because the pretor was the superintendent of the republic of nobles which was called the commons it was now their pleasure that there should be a prefect or captain of the people who should govern the popular republic called the people this dignity had been laid aside a long time though it had been the original title of the first magistrate but was now revived and giordano lucino was elected to it separating the functions it was ordained that the pretor should have the authority and jurisdiction of the city and be superintendent of the councils of the commons and that the captain should administer in war abroad that within the city the councils of the people should govern and confer in the public business with the antiani in the year      a transaction was completed which alone ought to be sufficient to immortalize the republic of bologna there is among the records of that city a book entitled the paradise of pleasure which contains the decree of the third of june      by which all the slaves and villains were manumitted and annually taxed in a certain quantity of corn which was consigned to the care of an officer already instituted and called the pretor of the sack who was appointed in the same manner with the pretors of the castles this law at first prepared by legislators was recited and approved by the councils  0  of the people assembled according to the usage by the ringing of bells the record is in substance—in the beginning god almighty planted a paradise of pleasure in which he placed man whom he had created and clothed with a white robe of innocence giving him a perfect and perpetual liberty but the wretch unmindful of his own dignity and the divine munificence tasted of the apple forbidden him by the commandment of heaven and thereby dragged himself and all his posterity down into this valley of misery poisoned the human race and most miserably bound it in the chains of diabolical servitude and thus from incorruptible it was made corruptible from immortal mortal subjected to continual vicissitudes and most grievous slavery god however beholding that the whole world had perished had compassion on the human race and sent his only begotten son born of the virgin mary who coöperating with the grace of the holy ghost to the glory of his own dignity breaking the bonds with which we were held captive restored us to our primitive liberty and therefore it is very justly questioned whether men whom nature from the beginning produced and created free and the law of nations only subjected to the yoke of servitude ought not to be restored to the blessing of manumission  these men have been a shame to the cause of liberty in consideration of which the noble city of bologna which has always fought for liberty recollecting the past and providing for the future in honor of jesus christ our lord and redeemer has redeemed with a price in money all those who in the city of bologna and its bishopric were found confined in a servile condition and after a diligent examination decreed them to be free ordaining that no one constrained in any kind of slavery in the city or episcopacy shall dare to remain or be detained in it to the end that so great a mass of natural liberty redeemed by a price should not be liable to be corrupted by any remaining mixture of slavery as a moderate fermentation corrupts the whole mass and the society of one evil depraves many that are good in the time of that noble man and podestà d accursius of sorixana whose reputation spreading far and wide shines like a star and under the examination of d jacob grataceli his judge and assessor whose skill wisdom constancy and temperance recommend him to all men the present memorial is made which  0  by its proper name ought justly to be called paradise containing the names of all the masters and all the slaves both male and female that it may appear by what servants and maids liberty is acquired and at what price to wit ten pounds for those of more than fourteen years of age whether men or women and eight pounds for all under that age to every master for every one whom he holds in servitude this memorial was written by me conrad sclariti a notary deputed to the office of servants and maids and may it remain to posterity a monument of this transaction amidst the melancholy gloom of factions and licentiousness of injustice and cruelty of fraud and violence such a gleam of humanity equity and magnanimity is refreshing it shall be left to our own reflections the first of which will undoubtedly be a wish to see a paradise of pleasure in each of the united states of america  the temporary reconciliation of the nobles had produced prosperity and success to the republic but as the constitution remained the same and war alone had preserved the benevolent impressions of john the preacher as soon as that was over the seditions of the citizens again disturbed all their quiet and felicity the galluzzi lambertazzi artenisi britti carbonesi scannabecchi all noble families and greatly esteemed in bologna could no longer restrain their passions and as the historian very justly observes god knows how they could have restrained them so long the lambertazzi were the first to set fire to the train of jealousy and indignation hatred and revenge and to begin the ruin of their country provoked by some words reported to them by their flatterers and perhaps invented or exaggerated they took arms and coming fiercely to action with the gieremei a great quantity of blood was shed on both sides they would have proceeded to greater extremities if ramponi a man in high esteem had not dexterously interposed and by his wisdom and courage brought them to an accommodation yet the quarrel continued to break out at times and prevailed even among   0 the scholars one of the tribunes of the city was dangerously wounded and raimondo a genoese was beheaded but this did not end the disorder the galluzzi and carbonesi took up the dispute and several horrid murders were committed and several of the dependencies of the republic taking advantage of the opportunity or excited by partisans rebelled the disorder lurked however in some degree of secrecy till    0 when it broke out again and the parties began to collect together companies of idle vagabonds and on a thousand occasions endeavored to come to action finally the gieremei went out in arms against the lambertazzi the galluzzi against the carbonesi the lambertini against the scannabecchi and the artinesi against the britti they continued engaged a long space of time each party assisted by the families of its adherents the pretor with all his court and forces was obliged to turn out and partly by his menaces and partly by some small remains of reverence for authority he put a stop to this most sanguinary and horrible rencounter and obliged those who remained alive to return to their houses in      these intestine broils were renewed particularly between the families of lambertazzi and gieremei and while many were anxious to make peace between them and were occupied in contriving the means of it the lambertazzi little inclined to any accommodation by exerting all their influence and intrigues on purpose to offend the gieremei procured that peter pagani a powerful citizen of imola should be made lord of it to the end that he might expel from thence all the friends of the gieremei and demolish all their houses a commission which he fully executed imola thus revolted from the obedience of bologna drove out giacopino prendiparte of bologna or as others say killed him who was commissary and governor in the name of the city of bologna this action so displeased the senate that they suddenly sent out a powerful army with the carroccio under the pretor and obliged the usurper and his men to evacuate the post but before this enterprise was finished another tumult happened against the judges one of whom uguccione was assaulted and killed and the parties were again upon the point of coming to a bloody decision and it required the whole court in arms to disperse the tumult before the end of the year another tumult arose in imola     where the bricij principal leaders of that city favorers of cujano and saffatello had secretly introduced many men and drove out of the city the imindoli their enemies or rivals but the people were so displeased with this violence that they rose upon the bricij and their followers drove them out of the city at the point of the sword and recalled the imindoli the senate on the news of this fidelity bestowed the highest praises on the people and to reward them by removing the cause of such inconveniences ordered that for the future they should have no pretor at all and that all their differences should be brought before the pretor of bologna to be adjudged with equity and celerity upon condition that they should pay the auditors or judges who should hear their controversies five hundred pounds a year all this was cheerfully accepted by the people of imola as much preferable to continual quarrels in arms to determine whether the gieremei or lambertazzi should have the appointment of one of their instruments to be a pretor among them clement vi among the first acts of his pontificate invited into italy charles of anjou brother of st louis king of france and uberto count of flanders general of charless army passed into italy with forty thousand men bologna with milan bergamo verona mantua and ferrara joined the church and france four thousand men under guido antonio lambertini a noble bolognese joined the crusade proclaimed by the pope against manfred the lambertini indulging their enmity against the bocchetti laid a plot one day to kill one of them and thinking to find him in a certain place where their spies had informed them he was they went to seek him but he was gone in their return they met one of the scannabecchi letting loose their malice against him they killed him and fled the pretor informed of their crime and flight issued a proclamation against them rifled their houses and to intimidate other malefactors burnt them to the ground finding by these continual homicides that the government was too weak to restrain the parties a new magistracy was created in the city of three men who were to hear and prudently examine the differences among the nobles and endeavor to appease them andalò malavolti and ramponi all men of great candor and singular prudence were chosen andalò was of great authority with the ghibellines malavolti with the     guelphs and so was ramponi these without respect of persons judging with impartiality had a wonderful effect in the city and by great mildness composed many discords and long enmities particularly between the asinelli and scannabecchi among whom a great deal of blood had been spilled and who had been a long time enemies and in a word brought the city to a degree of tranquillity it was this year that hearing of the defeat and death of manfred the ghibellines in florence began to tremble and the guelphs to triumph that city chose two pretors from bologna the same malavolti and andalò and erected their council of thirtysix guelphs and ghibellines divided the city into seven greater arts and gave every art its gonfalonier and this year dante the poet was born in      charles calzolaio finding a young man in bologna in bed with his wife killed him to maintain his own honor but was taken into custody and sentenced to death by the pretor as one who contrary to the laws had taken justice into his own hands this sentence appeared to be unjust to the other calzolai who tenderly loved their brother charles and they united together mutually pledged their faith to each other to rescue him and taking arms went to the palace of the pretor and forcibly delivered charles from his prison this excited in the city a mighty tumult and so intimidated the pretor that he concealed himself in a place of safety the commotion subsided by the exertions of the consuls and the fury of the calzolai subsided so far that the senate ventured to inquire who were the authors of the tumult but the heads of it were by this time escaped from the city so that the company of the calzolai were only fined in a sum of money to this uproar succeeded another still greater between the lambertini and scannabecchi in which many were left wounded and many slain among whom was bartolomeo guidozagni a friend of the lambertini this tincture of blood enkindled the minds of the two parties to vengeance to such a degree that like mad dogs they thought of nothing but persecution murder and extermination and they collected their friends both within and without the city together to this effect the consuls in office     to whom information was given of the danger published a proclamation that no man should be introduced or let into the city if he were not previously known to the deputies appointed to superintend who might know by that means the reason of his coming and oblige him to lay down his arms this prudent precaution in a few days quieted the factions and the consuls thinking the late disorder too light to be very severely punished only made an example or two in each of the families by confining one of the lambertini in mantua and one of the scannabecchi in florence and because the consuls saw the violent enmities which prevailed among many noble families which were in danger of increasing every day to mortal rancor they availed themselves of the resolution and prudence of andalò and malavolti lately returned from florence by electing them to compose the peace of the city giving them ample powers for that end and this measure succeeded so far that the lambertini and scannabecchi the gozzadini and arienti guidozagni and orsi calamatoni and sangiorgi bianchetti and pizzigotti and many other noble families were reconciled in the presence of the consuls in the palace with much satisfaction to the whole city but as no measure of the executive could be taken without offence to some part of such a divided executive authority the consuls by annulling all the condemnations in the late disturbances excited the indignation of the pretor dandolo so that he resigned his office the consuls who were not sorry for it appointed aurelio rocca dalla torre of milan in his stead in this instance as in many others before and after being obliged to appoint a foreigner for their first magistrate to avoid the certain seditions and rebellions that would have been excited by the adverse party if any natural born citizen however distinguished by merit had been raised to this eminence among his jealous peers in      alberto caccianemici for some offensive words of his nephew guido son of his brother gruamonte which were reported to him without examining the truth of the information in a fit of impatience for vengeance called his two sons to him and ordered them to go and put their cousin to death his orders were executed with great inhumanity but in such a state of government and parties the laws are overborne by     popular and powerful individuals and there is no justice to be had against them in a regular prosecution so thought the people in this case and therefore took upon themselves the punishment of so atrocious a cruelty by rising in arms and demolishing their houses in      another instance of a similar but more important nature happened the captain of the people governed severely in his office and did not do justice to the people as they said and this provoked the wrath of the people so far that they deposed him the pretor took this deposition in ill part and thought that the principal authors of it ought to be punished at least in some small degree to discountenance such irregularity but this irritated the people so highly that perceiving his danger he thought it prudent to fly and a new pretor as well as captain were appointed thus the discontented nobles although they could not from their opposition to each other obtain the first offices in the state had it always in their power by secret machinations with the people to excite tumults and distress embarrass and depose the foreigners who held them there is an example of generosity in the gentlemen of bologna in the year    0 too much to their honor amidst all their quarrels to be omitted a great scarcity prevailed in all the cities of tuscany and lombardy and the people of bologna were reduced to extreme misery by famine upon this occasion all the noblemen and other rich men of the city had the charity to open their stores and expose all their corn and grain to the people and not satisfied with this they united together collected all the money they had or by their credit could borrow and offered it to the senate that it might be sent to romagna and other distant provinces to procure a supply of bread for the city this benevolent effort however produced an accidental ill effect it occasioned a rivalry in the markets for grain between bologna and venice which produced resentments retaliating imposts and duties and at last a war in which the venetians were conquered but the city of bologna could not enjoy its triumphs in peace malignant spirits in secret scattered reports and calumnies to disturb the public tranquillity sometimes against one illustrious citizen and sometimes another these rumors coming to the ears of the senate they exerted all their skill to discover     whether the crimes alleged had been committed or not but after all their diligence found no evidence but idle suspicions nevertheless the senators and people taking the hint from these endeavors to excite disorders judged it would be useful to create a new magistracy of three men of the best lives and most wisdom to preserve the quiet of the city and to administer justice by rewarding the good and chastising the insolent disturbers of the peace of others to this end ample authority was given them to bear arms and to take with them armed men to imprison delinquents and accommodate all disputes which should arise and these were called the magistrates of peace the three chiefs divided their people into three military classes one was called that of the lombardi and to this was committed the red standard with the figure of justice holding a drawn sword in her hand the second was called the griffin and to this was consigned the white standard with a red griffin the last was called della branca to which was allotted the white standard with a red lion holding a sword in his right paw these companies were greatly esteemed in the city and much honored by the senate who granted them signal privileges registering the magistrates as true and noble citizens while this new magistracy was wholly employed in the preservation of the honor and peace of the city and daily reconciled the minds of the citizens the rancor of private animosity broke out again in the murder of philip called il bologna one of the company della branca by soldano de galluzzi who fled which beyond measure displeased the senate not having the murderer in their power in order to give complete satisfaction to the company they published a capital proclamation against him and demolished to their foundations all the houses he had both in town and country by this exemplary punishment alone would the irritated minds of the company who had arms in their hands be pacified the next year it appears by the records that besides the pretor and captain of the people four and twenty wise men sapienti were elected six for each tribe out of all the tribes of the city by the antiani to preserve the companies of the city they elected also four citizens to oversee the plentiful supply of the city and five and twenty other wise men to superintend the fortresses and castles in the country as well as some things relative     to the government in the city all these inventions dictated by distress and the feeling as well as fear of the evils of discord were only aggravations of the evil as they only divided the executive power still more without dividing the legislative whereas the direct contrary ought to have been the remedy namely they ought to have united the executive power and divided the legislative and by that means have produced that trinity in unity which is neither a contradiction nor a mystery but is alone efficacious to curb the audacity of individuals and the daring turbulence of parties the judicial power independent of all is able to encounter any man or combination of men without recurring to such rigorous measures inconsistent with liberty as these new magistrates in bologna were obliged to adopt in order to purge the city of its many popular disorders they were obliged to forbid a great number of persons under grievous penalties to enter the palace nor was it permitted them to go about the city nor to bear arms all this they were obliged to do to prevent collections of people in the streets afterwards some of the first people of the city were banished and confined to certain places abroad and upon pain of death sentenced to depart the city in three hours it is provoking to read the perpetual cant of these historians such as that in this year      bologna having compelled the venetians to peace and ruling over imola faenza forli and the castles of romagna in peace and by fear might have become great and glorious by the valor of its citizens if civil discords had not begun again to commit their cruel ravages these dissensions on the contrary proved the ruin of the city and were the cause that by little and little she lost her ancient authority and grandeur and from a patron she became a client from a mistress a subject a miserable fall which began in this manner there were in bologna two most noble families the gieremei and the lambertazzi between whom not only the party prejudices of guelphs and ghibellines but a rivalry for power and preëminence in the state had long subsisted but neither party animosities nor family jealousies were able to prevent imelda a daughter of orlando lambertazzi a most beautiful young lady from entertaining a partiality for boniface a son of gieremia de gieremei a very handsome young man who was desperately in love with her this mutual passion thus increasing     in their hearts from day to day the two lovers at last found an opportunity to meet the ladys brothers being engaged in some amusement at the house of the caccianemici having information of this interview went to their sisters chamber and finding boniface there fell upon him with poisoned weapons and in an instant pierced his breast and his heart their miserable sister flying in despair from their fury having committed the murder they concealed the body in a sink which ran under some apartment in the house and fled from the city the murderers having departed imelda full of apprehensions and terrible presages of what she should discover ventured to return to her chamber and seeing upon the floor a rivulet of blood she followed its direction and opening the place where her lover lay she threw herself on the delicate body still warm and bleeding and distracted with tenderness and grief applied her lips to his wounds and drew in the poison with his blood and whilst sorrowfully lamenting the loss of her lover the poison spread over her whole frame to her heart and imelda fell dead in his arms a catastrophe so tragical could not be recited on a stage without affecting in the most sensible manner the most unfeeling audience the discovery of it to the public in bologna could not one would think but melt the most obdurate heart of faction and soften the savage monster to humanity but the effect of it was so contrary to this that it wrought up the hatred between the two factions to a mortal contagion which increased and spread till it ruined and enslaved the republic whilst the unfortunate fate of boniface and imelda depressed the spirits of the two noble families the senate understanding that the city of forli had rebelled and that the aigoni according to the stipulation were not restored to their country called the council together and the question was proposed whether they ought first to march against the rebels of forli or merely to restore the aigoni to modena the lambertazzi advised that the first attention should be given to the cause of the aigoni and on the contrary the gieremei advised that they should first endeavor to subjugate forli the parties not agreeing in opinion they began to fall into confusion finally the council of the gieremei prevailing the army was sent out and laid close siege to forli     the following year the senate having much at heart the reduction of forli resolved in order to chastise so great a disobedience to order out the carroccio and all their army the pretor entered the senate to take leave for his departure to the war and there found antonio lambertazzi laboring to convince them that the enterprise against forli would not succeed after having urged many arguments he began to speak slightingly of the honor of the gieremei who had carried this point against him gieremeo gieremei who was present provoked at his insolence gave him the lie and by mutual agreement they went out of the palace into the piazza where they drew their swords and began to combat a great crowd of the two factions soon gathered about them and fell to fighting all together so that much blood was shed and the battle grew more hot and greater numbers collected when gozzadini and cavaliere with many others interfered parted the combatants and the lambertazzi returned to their houses the pretor who went with the people to the tumult wishing to put some restraint of fear upon both parties ordered four of the houses of each party to be demolished but this severity had little or no effect for having grown more bitter than ever against each other they were almost every day in arms and action together as this revolt was already divulged to the circumjacent cities the companies della branca of the griffin and of the lombardi understanding that the guelphs of modena and the ghibellines of forli intended to come in to the aid of the two parties took arms and together with the people posted themselves to guard the passages of the city receiving intelligence that the guelphs of modena were on their march they went out to meet them and put them to flight at the point of the sword the count da panigo who had armed himself in favor of the lambertazzi hearing of this defeat of his friends made his escape from the city but his people were put to the sword by the company della branca who afterwards razed to the ground all the houses not only of the count but of his followers the ghibellines from forli friends of the lambertazzi hearing of the slaughter of the modenese and the followers of the count made by the soldiers della branca suddenly retreated these civil wars in bologna were scarcely divulged abroad when all romagna taking advantage of the occasion rebelled and for this reason the senate together with     the pretor and the companies posted themselves at all the ways to make peace between these two factions in which enterprise they fortunately at length succeeded and after much reasoning and persuasion they obtained hostages from both sides and thus the city was quieted while this peace was in treaty the principal heads of the rebellion of imola of faenza and of salarolo dreading the resentment of the bolognese at forli saved themselves by flight the bolognese were indeed formidable for they were collecting a powerful army to march into romagna when it was embodied and the pretor of bologna attempted to go out upon the campaign antonio lambertazzi forgetting his plighted faith and disregarding the fate of the hostages delivered flew out again in arms to prevent the carroccio from going out and recommenced a plentiful effusion of blood this sedition was the most terrible of any that had ever yet happened it lasted forty days without intermission so that bologna became a haunt of murderers and the streets ran down with human blood the property of all men was subjected to depredation the edifices were ruined and the grandeur and glory of the city trodden under foot the lambertazzi at last overcome fled the city with all their accomplices and went to faenza leaving their houses and palaces a prey to the people which shortly were all levelled with the ground and because the pretor and captain of the people had always held a good understanding with the lambertazzi they were now deposed from the magistracy although it is universally agreed that the judgment and decrees of the former were unexceptionably impartial and upright fifteen thousand citizens were banished whose names are distinctly written in a book among the records in the chamber of bologna these persons scattered in various places planted new families as the guerrini in forli the bazzani and sacchi in parma the malpighi in lucca the carrari in ravenna the buoninsegni in terni the maffei in rome the bagarotti in placentia and padua from which families have arisen men famous both in arms and letters the lambertazzi sought an asylum in faenza and in forli and fortified themselves in both those cities but the gieremei not content with having driven them out of the city endeavored to chase them from the places where they were received wherefore that they might not be taken by surprise   0 they sent to their friends in every place particularly to the count di montefeltro the counts of modiana and to others of their faction for succor the banished citizens of ravenna being united with those of forli ariminum and other places went to forli and from thence to faenza and there fortified themselves and a little afterwards drove out the manfredi and passing afterwards to castel san piero and from thence to salarolo where the manfredi had resorted and having taken the castle many of their enemies were put to death and many made prisoners and sent to forli among whom was alberico manfredi at bologna many of the faction of lambertazzi were imprisoned and as a report was spread that a powerful succor was arrived to the gieremei the lambertazzi with their wives and children fled to the mountains and from thence to faenza where with the assistance of their friends they began to collect forces the gieremei receiving information that the lambertazzi were preparing to return to bologna consulted in council upon the project of going out first in search of them the resolution was taken with great precipitation and they marched out with the carroccio with great spirit to romagna the ghibellines who were apprized of their approach went out suddenly to meet them in arms and the guelph party were defeated leaving three of the gieremei dead upon the field and alberghetto manfredi mortally wounded and a prisoner this reverse of fortune spread a terror in bologna but dreading a total loss of their city they exerted themselves to the utmost to fortify it and had recourse again to their confederates and friends and in a short time assembled a strong army it is unnecessary to enumerate all the places and parties from whence each side drew its aids but the carroccio again went forth and was again met by the lambertazzi and their allies when another terrible engagement ensued and again the lambertazzi remained victorious two thousand men were slain among whom were a great number of the principal nobles the lambertazzi pursued their victory into the territory of bologna where they put every thing to fire and sword destroying vines trees corn and houses and took a great number of castles and it is supposed might have made themselves masters of the city such was the panic in it without striking another blow but thinking they had done enough for the present they returned to faenza     the bolognese finding their affairs unfortunate both at home and abroad deliberated on sending to king charles for assistance and two ambassadors accordingly went passaggieri and prendiparti many citizens displayed their public spirit in defence of the city and senate and subscribed large sums to defend their liberty passaggieri for example was so attached to the gieremei that he gave six thousand pounds for the common good the senate by proclamation ordered that every citizen possessed of a horse should have him recorded in a book that they might know what assistance the militia might have in case of extremity and the name of every man who then owned a horse is very carefully preserved as a family distinction the lambertazzi  after their victory over the gieremei did not fail to make incursions into the country of bologna every day disturbing now one place and then another in such a manner that there was not a castle village or city of that party that was not infested or threatened with their arms the bolognese apprehensive that the evil might extend itself too far and that the people wearied with so many calamities might revolt and having before their eyes what rodolph the emperor had done they began to meditate a surrender of the city to the pope ambassadors were appointed who were courteously received and their petition attended to at viterbo the pope was vastly pleased with the submission of bologna and she acknowledged the church and the pontiff for her patron the instrument is dated twentyninth july      by which the ambassadors in the name of god and of the podestà captain council and commons recognize the dominion diction law jurisdiction power and principality of the city territory and district in st peter the keeper of the key of the kingdom of heaven and in nicolas iii and his successors roman pontiffs reserving the laws and rights of the city territory and district although the gieremei discovered an obstinate aversion to any kind of peace or reconciliation with the lambertazzi the pope conceived a great desire of uniting romagna and bologna in his interest and after long negotiations to that purpose he succeeded in persuading both parties to listen to his proposals     and submit to his decision the constitution of the pope nicolas iii upon the reformation of the peace of the bolognese to wit the gieremei and lambertazzi was made and the prisoners on both sides set at liberty and in      the two factions of gieremei and lambertazzi were assembled once more in the piazza of bologna in presence of the cardinal legates of the pope appearing in great pomp and splendor the families of the party of the lambertazzi and of that of the gieremei were all recorded by name and after long orations made by the cardinals the instruments were signed and the oaths of perpetual peace and friendship taken by them all the proceedings as they remain on record are very voluminous and it is not possible a peace should be made with more solemnity or less reserve but of what avail are pious exhortations charitable resolutions or solemn oaths against inveterate passions in unbalanced governments in    0 the lambertazzi who could not live under the operation of the secret venom of their personal hatreds which daily corroded their hearts making little account of the peace made or the penalties imposed burning with desire to imbrue their hands in the blood of the gieremei having taken their arms flew to the piazza and finding there a great number of their enemies fell upon them with a sudden fury after a long combat they pushed the gieremei out of the piazza and made themselves masters of it and would have easily possessed the palace if the captain with two thousand men had not rushed into the midst of the danger and with the caccianemici lambertini ariosti prendiparti and other friends opposed them and at the point of the sword driven them back and pursued them out of the city the battle on both sides was bloody and many principal men were killed in it after performing prodigies of valor the lambertazzi thus again driven from the city with their arms retired to the mountains with great loss and the gieremei proceeded to the old work of ruining their houses within and without the city and having issued a proclamation against a great number they sent others into confinement according to the usage in such cases in those times bërthold the count of romagna the popes nephew immediately summoned all parties to appear before him and give an account who were the aggressors in the late revolution     and prevailed upon the gieremei and lambertazzi to give hostages to perform the award for settling their differences but before the affair could be finished the pope died and berthold restored the hostages to the guelphs but the lambertazzi not acting to his satisfaction he carried theirs to rome bologna now remaining in the hands of the gieremei four officers were immediately created whose duty it was to preserve the peace of the city and to them was given the highest possible authority and they began their operations with so much prudence and firmness that their proceedings gave great satisfaction to the citizens and with whatever they ordered or desired the people complied with affection and confidence excepting some of the followers of the lambertazzi who not being able to bear the sight of the city at peace while their party were driven out of it began by slow degrees and secret practices to consult of measures to make themselves masters of it and restore their banished party for many days they discoursed together in secret upon this project and hoping that fortune might for once favor and assist them they determined finally to assault the piazza and because all the city was in security and lived in peace they readily persuaded themselves that by surprise their design would succeed one day at the hour of dinner issuing out in arms and crying with a lively accent the people and the church they seized on the two mouths of the piazza the gieremei as soon as they were alarmed ran out with the people in general with arms in their hands and coming to a fierce engagement with their enemies after a plentiful effusion of blood drove them out of the city to the mountains to go from thence to faenza and dwell with their friends the city of bologna now purified of all tumults the senate attended to the fortification of all the fortresses and castles in the country placed strong garrisons and furnished plenty of provisions and all things necessary and the commanders placed in them we may well suppose were all good guelphs and gieremeites the lambertazzi having taken refuge in faenza and partly in forli those who were in faenza following the activity ardor and boldness of their genius began to live with so much liberty that it appeared as if faenza was their own this conduct was observed and excited not only much censure but the greatest malevolence in the citizens and among others in tibaldello     zambrasio one of the most noble in faenza this nobleman seeing himself exposed to the ridicule of the town on account of a pig which the lambertazzi had made so free as to take from him and because they had threatened his life for demanding the restoration of it grew into such a rage that he swore he would lose his life or have satisfaction after talking much of various projects he at last determined upon one which he had never talked of at all he pretended to be seized with a melancholy humor went strangely out of his house sometimes flying the company of his friends and relations appearing in the streets uncommonly thoughtful sometimes talking to himself of a variety of things and muttering imperfect sentences having held this course of life for some days his infirmity became divulged through the whole city in a few days more without confiding his secret to his father or any other he counterfeited the part of a complete idiot and his behavior was so wild whimsical and extravagant that he appeared both to his father and brother to be wholly bereaved of his understanding it threw his family into distress and the whole city into the utmost astonishment to see a nobleman who had ever shown so much prudence as to be held in high esteem fallen suddenly into such misfortune and disgrace though so worthy of compassion in a few days more he took from his own farm an old mare wholly worn out and reduced to a mere skeleton and having shaved her with a pair of scissors transformed her into such an object as excited the laughter of every one who saw her in this condition he led her into the city and there turned her loose the boys soon collected about the animal and beat and terrified her till she ran with all the strength and spirit that remained in her throughout the whole city and occasioned a general hubbub wherever she went the lambertazzi knowing nothing of the notorious fact any more than of the secret motive were alarmed with suspicions that their enemies were rising seized their arms and ran about to every place where they heard the loudest shouts and noises finding it was only an idle populace insulting tibaldellos mare they joined with others in the laugh and returned to their houses the same pageantry having been repeated more than once afterwards the ghibellines became so secure that when they heard a similar cry they said it was only tibaldellos     mare rising at length to the third stage of counterfeited madness tibaldello ran about the streets in the night and cried out to arms to arms and taking in his hands the padlocks and bars of the city gates which were sometimes carelessly left he raised a very great multitude and a mighty rumor so as again to alarm the lambertazzi and drive them to their arms but finding it another freak of tibaldello they threatened him severely if he should make any more such disturbance and returned by these whimsical movements frequently repeated he so effectually quieted the suspicions of the lambertazzi and ghibellines that upon any such uproar they laughed with the rest and made themselves merry with the crazy whimsies of tibaldello with so much art and perseverance was the folly simulated that all suspicions were quieted not only in the ghibellines but in the whole city and the belief of his irrecoverable folly was universal having pursued his plan thus far with success he opened himself in perfect confidence to a very faithful friend made him acquainted with his design and desired him to prepare with secrecy two habits of monks in a sack and meet him the next day in a forest in the neighborhood of faenza this was done and at the hour prescribed they met tibaldello having gone out of town with all the appearance of a madman disguised like a falconer with two dogs attending him and a hawk in his hand to the high diversion of every one that met him arrived at a lonely place in the forest he set his dogs and his hawk at liberty and with his faithful companion putting on the habits of friars that they might not be known by any whom they might meet on the road and travelling all night at the opening of the gates in the morning they arrived at bologna and took lodgings at the house of alberto battagliucci to guido ramponi he related all that had passed explained his intentions and by his favor obtained an introduction to the council of secrecy here he opened his whole design and the desire he had to chastise the lambertazzi and showed them of how much importance it was to them to embrace the present opportunity to remove from their sight and their apprehensions those enemies of their city and people who were constantly employed in schemes of mischief against both this counsel was received with pleasure by the whole body and the business was referred to the four superintendents of peace under oath to keep it secret to these     tibaldello methodically communicated his plan and demanded only for himself and all the family of the zambrasi and ghirardone his faithful friend and his family to be made citizens of bologna and engaged to send hostages as security for what was to be done the offers of tibaldello were very satisfactory to the pretor and guidottino prendiparte pledged himself for the family of zambrasi the four superintendents made him relate the method and means by which every thing was to be conducted and the stratagem appearing to be practicable they again took an oath to keep the whole a secret the business concluded on they dismissed tibaldello who was to procure the hostages so setting out the same evening he reached faenza at the opening of the gates and entered the city without being known by any one arrived at his house he found his whole family in great affliction to his aged father alone he related in order the progress he had made by means of a feigned madness in his plan against those who had taken little account of the honor of his family and blood the father with joy beyond expression and a thousand embraces of his son caused to be assembled in his house all their relations to whom in an eloquent and prudent harangue tibaldello related his actions and designs all with one voice and one heart offered to devote themselves to vengeance on the lambertazzi tibaldello to whom an hour appeared a thousand years till he could see an end of his enterprise the next day secretly sent his three brothers—namely zambraso guido and fiorino to bologna conducted by ghirardone informing the four superintendents of what they were to do and of the hour when their soldiers ought to appear at faenza the hostages received the council assembled digested every particular and secretly gave orders that all the passes should be secured that no one might be able to send intelligence of any thing that happened on the twentythird of august      the army of bologna was formed and marched out of the city in order with all the guelph party by a forced march the whole night they were early in the morning at the gate appointed finding it open they freely entered the city and were conducted to the place intended for action the zambrasi had embarrassed and stopped up the streets where they thought proper and tibaldello as usual feigning to make a noise with the padlocks at the gates of the     houses of the lambertazzi in truth fastened many of them within so that they could not go out the whole apparatus being ready he set up a cry of long live the church and down with all the traitors and while he was terrifying the city with this horrid outcry the bolognese with the utmost security made themselves masters of the piazza of the city the ghibellines followers of the lambertazzi hearing the noise of voices and the sound of arms rang the bells assembled a great number and hastened to the piazza there to fortify themselves but finding the guelphs already in possession they began the conflict the particulars of this engagement the danger of one and intrepidity of another individual are not now material the action was sharp and bloody and after mighty feats of valor on both sides and many killed and wounded the lambertazzi were defeated and such as could obliged to fly into the country all who could not were put to the sword nine of the principals fled to a church or monastery for sanctuary but were there miserably put to death besides five hundred prisoners a multitude of others wretchedly perished in the sinks and ditches the bolognese having obtained the victory and by means of it the complete dominion of faenza pardoned the faentines but confiscated all the property of the lambertazzi and their adherents both within and without the city finally they appointed a new pretor and a sufficient guard and triumphantly conducted tibaldello zambrasi his father and with them zambraso guido and fiorino the hostages and their sister and other relations to bologna who were all made by the senate not only citizens but nobles the same honors and immunities were conferred on ghirardone and his relations to all of whom the senate gave houses and possessions and they enjoyed the most respectable offices in the state as the victory was the twentyfourth of august the senate ordained an annual festival of st bartholomews day in perpetual commemoration of tibaldello in which his pig his mare his hawks dogs friars dress and city keys were all transmitted in sculpture and marble to the amusement and astonishment of posterity the nobles of the party of lambertazzi who were still remaining in forli sent ambassadors to the pope to obtain peace but they could accomplish nothing the pope not only refused to receive them but ordered them to return the gieremei sent     ambassadors and they were admitted to an audience and received with dignity and by their persuasions the pope sent giovanni appia a french gentleman a counsellor of king charles with eight hundred cavalry to recover forli the pope made him count of romagna and he went with the ambassadors to bologna where he was received with great honor where he remained however but a short time for having in      despatched what belonged to his office he took with him two of the tribes of the city and marched into the territory of ravenna from thence he wrote to the republic of forli commanding them to send out of their city the count guido da feltrio and all the foreigners but he was not obeyed because neither the count nor the lambertazzi to whom he wrote at the same time were willing to go their refusal gave occasion to another long war and to all the fire and sword stratagems and massacres as well as carnage in battle that usually attended all their wars but though these evils also originated in the same source the imperfect constitution of bologna they may be passed over it seems there were still some persons left in bologna of the name of lambertazzi one of whom in      came to blows with one of the scannabecchi under the piazza which occasioned another rising of the people in arms they were both put to flight but overtaken in the country and beheaded and all the party of the lambertazzi were again declared rebels and all their families banished to a certain distance in the city and confined to places assigned them the wise men sapienti afterwards made a provision that all those of the party of the lambertazzi who had taken an oath of fidelity to the church and the party of the gieremei according to a general regulation made in the council of the commons and people of bologna should be cancelled from the book of the exiles excepting those who since taking the oath had gone to live in faenza forli and other places and united themselves with the enemies of the people of bologna and with this reservation that none who had been of the party of the lambertazzi at the time of the first commotion should be of the council or hold any office this regulation gave great satisfaction to the city and a general tranquillity but the government had not strength to preserve the peace in      a private quarrel however happened probably from the     general state of parties in which gualradi of the company della branca was killed the government was neither able to punish the murderer nor to prevent the people from taking it upon themselves in their own way they took arms for revenge and ruined all the houses towers trees and other property of the persons guilty or suspected both in the city and out of it and of all their relations but the new government could not long remain quiet the council of eight hundred and the people having their eyes fixed upon the general utility of the city and its district that all things might be governed with consummate prudence gave orders to the sapienti to examine how a new council might be established of two thousand persons of sufficient wisdom charity and property to support the weight of the commonwealth the sapienti elected by the antiani and consuls having maturely deliberated and debated ordained that the new council of two thousand should be elected by ballot in that council that is to say that a hundred electors for each tribe should be appointed each of whom should have the election of five members of the new council that each one should be not less than eighteen nor more than seventy years of age and should be truly of the party of the church and of the gieremei of the city of bologna and so held and reputed in the time of the first commotion which happened in the city that he should not be a servant a puppetshowman a porter nor a foreigner c nor a constant inhabitant of the country of bologna and should have been a constant resident in the city for twenty years should be rated to the public taxes and have paid his share of the public collections should be known in the lists of the public factions but should not be a clergyman or ecclesiastical person nor of any other city castle or land which has favored the ghibellines or the party of the lambertazzi if there were any one at present in the council in any of the cases enumerated in this order he could not be chosen by any elector whatsoever and if he obtained a ticket as an elector he could not vote himself in any manner no one could be elected contrary to the preceding form under penalty of banishment and a fine of twenty pounds for every one that should violate   0 it and for every offence and any one who should be elected contrary to this order should not take the oath of a counsellor nor proceed to choose another under the same penalty every election made against it should be null and any one might inform secretly or openly of a breach of this law and obtain the penalty the antiani consuls and doctors of laws and their notaries should be of this council ex officio in addition to the number of two thousand but no one was to be a member who was not a native of the city the senate then caused to be distinctly recorded in three books the names of the banished lambertazzi repaired the carroccio and its standard and painted it with the portraits of six saints and laid out upon it no less than thirty pounds and ten pence many other regulations and precautions were taken by the triumphant faction of the gieremei to fortify themselves in the government and exclude in the most decided manner every man who had any tincture of or connection with the opposite party but still there were not wanting many seditious persons insidiously meditating to undermine their tranquillity and to favor those who were held to be rebels against them so that the senate were frequently alarmed and full of apprehensions of the total ruin of the city they saw that almost the whole country was one continued tavern of the banished banditti and to put some restraint upon their temerity purge both the city and country of such a dangerous plague and quiet the seditions of the nobles they assembled the antiani consuls and all the sapienti made many ordinances against the banished rebels to the end that no fresh revolution might be attempted and made it a capital crime to attempt or propose or even to speak or reason about their restoration or pardon     in the beginning of the year      all their prudence appeared to be ineffectual for in their own faction and in the new government were two parties still the nobles and plebeians and a tumult arose between them the senate the pretor of the preceding year and the people became involved in the dispute till the pretor thought his life in danger and secretly went away from the city with many of his friends the want and the necessity of representatives of the people was felt at this time and whether it was to obtain information or to throw off a burden of care and labor or to gratify some aspiring individuals or to please the people or to extend their influence or whether all these motives concurred the antiani assembled in the chamber of the pretor considered among themselves what ought chiefly to be done relative to the war at this time to be carried on in conjunction with their confederates and they ordained that two wise men of exemplary lives should be elected from each tribe who should examine and in concert with them the antiani inquire in what state were the stipendiaries of the commons of bologna and see whether the soldiers had their horses according to law and whether provision was made of money to pay salaries wages c but who was to elect these wise men not the people not the tribes themselves this would have made two centres and all authority must be in one the antiani themselves therefore elected them and in the afternoon the antiani and the wise men assembled together and consulted generally     about the soldiers and it was concluded that the number in pay ought not to be diminished but rather increased and that particular attention should be given to the collection of the revenue upon several articles as grain salt mills c that money might be had in season to pay the soldiers their stipends c but there is not time nor room to pursue this relation it must be sufficient to add that affairs went on in this curious manner to the final catastrophe of all such governments an establishment of absolute power in a single man there were in italy in the middle ages a hundred or two of cities all independent republics and all constituted nearly in the same manner the history of one is under different names and various circumstances the history of all and all excepting two or three that are still decided aristocracies had the same destiny an exit in monarchy there are extant a multitude of particular histories of these cities full of excellent warning for the people of america let me recommend it to you my young readers who have time enough before you to make yourselves masters of the italian language and avail your country of all the instruction contained in them as well as of all the art science and literature which we owe to greece italy and palestine countries which have been and are our masters in all things     a defence of the constitutions of government of the

improvements might be made in the system of the universe by a different arrangement of the orbs of heaven and politicians equally ignorant and equally presumptuous may easily be led to suppose that the happiness of our world would be promoted by a different tendency of the human mind johnsons adventurer no    in three volumes vol iii         a defence of the constitutions of government of the united states of america volume iii chapter seventh italian republics pistoia the roman republic according to its custom of putting judges in all places under its dominion sent to pistoia a pretor who had the whole jurisdiction civil and criminal over the city reserving always according to the tenor of the roman laws obedience to the magistrates of that commonwealth this jurisdiction acquired by the roman republic over the city of pistoia passed to the roman emperors and from these into the power of the goths and the lombards and successively of those who from time to time were lords signore of tuscany and it has continued down to our times under the same tie and obligation of dependence it is very true that the province being     liberated from the government of foreign nations and its governors dominatori having permitted the people to make laws and create magistrates the authority became divided hence when the concession was made to the pistoians to create magistrates to take the name of consuls and to form the general council of the people they were permitted to expedite by the authority of these many things in their city reserving always nevertheless the sovereignty to their lords this concession of governing themselves by their own laws obtained by the provinces of italy was the pure liberality of charlemagne at a time when having delivered them entirely from the government of the barbarians he placed them under the command of one of his royal ministers with the title of marquis or of duke under this system of government tuscany was comprehended which had its dukes and marquises who governed it but as it was the custom of charlemagne and long after him of his successors to send to the cities of this province two subaltern ministers one with the name of castaldo or governor and the other with that of count which is as much as to say judge of the city who held his courts of justice either alone or in conjunction with the castaldo and very often with the bishop of the place as the bishops were assessors and officers deputed as vassals of the king or the emperor so the city of pistoia was a long time ruled and governed by this order of castaldi and counts otho ii having ascended the imperial throne and having conducted the affairs of italy with little good fortune the people began to think it lawful to lose their respect and to fail in their veneration for the imperial commands and the cities advancing in their inclination for liberty many of them began to reassume the title of consuls which had been extinct under the lombards and if these had somewhat of a greater authority nevertheless they were not exempt from the jurisdiction of the dukes and marquises or from the sovereignty of the kings and emperors a greater spirit of independence arising in the minds of the italians in the time of those great discords between the empire and the church diminished to such a degree the esteem of the     people towards the emperors solemnly excommunicated by the pontiffs that a great part of the cities of italy estranging themselves by little and little from their obedience began to conduct themselves like independent states in entire freedom this happened in the time of henry iv and v and the disobedience increased still more when all the german forces were engaged to sustain in germany the competition between lothario ii and conrad the suabian for the throne of cæsar then the cities taking advantage of the distance of those who had power to bridle their arrogance began to be insolent then they began to lift up their heads and to do whatever seemed good in their own eyes then they thought it lawful to appropriate to themselves many of the rights of royalty due to their sovereign and believing themselves able to shake off the yoke of superiority they attended to nothing but to their present advantage and to extend the limits of their usurped liberty but with all this they were never able to extinguish the nature of their subjection nor the obligation of dependence for frederick i passed over to establish and regulate their privileges in the convention of constance and the rights of royalty which had been then usurped and the people were held to an annual census† and obliged to perform certain royal and personal services in the twelfth century the cities after the similitude of ancient rome all reassumed the title of consuls and began some sooner and others later to make their proper statutes and establish their popular government though it is not possible to ascertain the precise time when the institution of consuls was first made in pistoia they are nevertheless found named in the statutes of   0  and of these there were two called the consul of the soldiers and the consul of justice taken from the nobility of the place and were called the greater consuls to distinguish them from the plebeian consuls of the second class called the lesser consuls or consuls of the merchants taken from the common people their authority and sometimes their number varied but there was ever to be one more of the popular than of the greater consuls‡ the election of these magistrates     was made every year by the people with the intervention of all the governors rettori of the arts of the city and they governed with a council of a hundred of the better sort of citizens administering justice both to the laity and the ecclesiastics this council besides its extraordinary assemblies was obliged to meet in the months of march may july and september after a previous intimation given by the consuls of the business to be done and for the result of this assembly all determinations upon things of most importance must wait and all laws resolutions and deliberations first proposed and digested in the smaller council by the few must be here confirmed or rejected here again is a constitution of all authority in one assembly the council of a hundred was sovereign the consuls though they had the command of the army and the judgment of causes could do nothing in administration by themselves or with advice of their little council they had no negative upon any deliberation or resolution of the great council and on the other hand the people had no negative not even the poor protection of a tribunitian veto accordingly we read in the next paragraph that the power of the people having greatly increased by means of their usurped liberty  the factions had become numerous and so much the more intractable and seditious as the incentive of power was become the greater in      the emperor frederick i after having reduced milan to his obedience and received the oaths of fidelity from all the other cities of italy and among the rest from those of tuscany in order to obviate the continual tumults which arose judged it necessary to institute the office and dignity of podestà and to send to the government of those cities gentlemen from among the foreign nobility with that title this commission of podestà operated to the damage and diminution of the influence of the consuls because in this magistrate was vested the whole judicial power both in private and civil causes and in those which were public and criminal and therefore the podestà was the ordinary judge in the city with full power dominion and authority to govern command and     chastise granted to him by the emperor to whom as their legitimate sovereign the people had recourse in cases of appeal and in all denials of justice from its subjection to this minister in the earliest times of the institution of his office the city of pistoia was again oppressed and as the nomination was reserved directly to the sovereign so the officer was changed as often as the times seemed to him to require the discords and dissensions having become softened by length of time pistoia acquired the right of election of this minister who obliged himself in many things to follow the various ordinances and resolutions of the consuls this election of the podestà was made by the pistoians in virtue of a municipal law consented to by the sovereign the person elected remained in office only six months and was chosen by the council of the people as it was called that is the council of a hundred with the intervention of all the rettori of the chapels and of the arts the podestà was bound to carry with him judges skilful in the laws notaries two companies of militia horses and servants and other followers and these officers were obliged in all things to render their accounts it was customary to confer this dignity of podestà upon the chief citizens the consuls or the podestà jointly or severally had no authority to impose taxes to consent to war peace truce or alliance without the council of the people which consisted of a hundred citizens elected in the proportion of five and twenty for each of the four gates or quarters of the city with the addition of all the rettori of the chapels and of the arts in other words the podestà consuls council of a hundred and rectors of the chapels and arts were all collected in one assembly to determine on grants for money peace war truce alliance c and all questions were determined by the vote of the majority which necessarily made that tempestuous and capricious government in one centre against which we contend and to the podestà for his regulation in the exercise of his office were given by the city fourteen counsellors and two judges one de lege that is to say doctor of laws the other ex usu or de usu which they interpreted a protector of the commons and two advocates for arguing each cause with the opinion of all these he decided upon those things which affected the honor or utility of the public as after having made his election of these   0 attendants he was obliged to stand by their advice this podestà in early times superintended not only the secular but the ecclesiastical government but in process of time the city became governed by three namely—the consuls the podestà and the bishop for the bishop had profited of the violent dissensions that prevailed in the city to draw to himself various rights and jurisdictions as has happened in other nations the lordship of the podestà therefore having preponderated over the authority of the consuls these were gone when the office of captain of the people was created this institution happened in pistoia when the guelph party by an increase of their numbers and strength acquired the superiority of the ghibellines at which time the lordship was taken from the podestà with a great concourse and tumult of the people and nothing was left him but the charge of hearing and determining civil causes twelve anziani of the people were then instituted and the authority of the consuls was transferred to them the last appearance of the consuls in the records of pistoia is in      and the first of the captain of the people in      when it is said in the statute that the captain of the people was the first ruler of the city and the primary defender of its rights and that he ought chiefly to watch over the conservation of the peace that he was the judge of appeals and of all causes in the second instance that he had cognizance of crimes that he governed with supreme authority united with that of the anziani that he kept a court of the same kind as that of the podestà but more numerous and that the city gave him for ornament and defence three hundred of the best and ablest men who taking an oath of fidelity to him stood continually in his service† the election of this ruler was to be made by the anziani in the person of some foreigner and not of any citizen of pistoia notwithstanding some of the primary citizens did in fact obtain this office as appears by the records yet the anziani were sworn not to elect any man of tuscany or of the city of pistoia of its district or other place adjoining to the city or its     bishopric the words of the law in the twelfth rubric of      are nos anthiani populi pistoriensis juramus sine aliquo intellectu nobis dato vel dando eligi vel eligi facere nobis et pist unum bonum et virum prudentem majorem xxx ann in nostrum capitaneum populi devotum et fidelem ecclesiæ qui non sit de civitate pistorii vel districtu et qui non sit de tuscia    vel de aliqua terra quæ confinet cum civitate vel episcopatu vel districtu pistorii and this dignity of captain of the people was in such reputation that in some places princes were chosen and sometimes even the pontiffs and such personages by means of their vicars often exercised it the captain of the people therefore being the conservator of the peace and the defender of the rights of the city the pistoians to give him a strong arm to bridle those who had unquiet and restless brains thought it necessary to create certain companies of armed men who at the sound of a bell should be obliged to assemble in the piazza in order to execute the orders which should be given them by this officer and the anziani without whose permission they were not allowed to depart these companies were called by the name of the equestrian and pedestrian orders because they were composed of both horse and footmen they were afterwards augmented to twelve in the proportion of three for each quarter which embraced an infinite number of people and every company had two captains one gonfalonier whose office was to carry the standard of his company and four counsellors and it was the duty of the captain of the people to procure the election of these officers as is asserted in the statute of      rubric    teneatur capitaneus del popolo primo mense sui regiminis eligi facere duos capitaneos unum gonfalonerium et quatuor consiliarios pro qualibet compagnia civit pist pro factis ipsius compagniæ and in the additional laws of      eight priors were added to these companies two for each quarter and other orders were made for the good regulation of this militia the twelve anziani were created with the same authority and full power which the consuls had held but the precise year cannot be ascertained the number of members of which the new magistrature was composed appears by a law of      ordinamus quod duodecim anthiani populi civit pist sint et esse debeant in civitate pistoria these twelve magistrates were     renewed every two months and afterwards as appears by a law of      it was established that the anzianate should not continue longer than one month and this magistracy of the anziani was elected by a council of the people of two hundred by the rettori of the arts and their counsellors and by the captains gonfaloniers and counsellors of the companies of the people and by the anziani pro tempore the head of the anziani was in the primitive times called prior and not gonfalonier the prior being the first dignity among the anziani each member enjoyed it in rotation for an equal number of days as the presidents chair of the states general is filled by all the members in turn for one week at the hague this prior had great authority as appears by a law of      written in the thirtyseventh rubric anthiani teneantur facere et faciant inter se unum priorem de ipsis anthianis adjectum ipsis sicut eis videbitur de tempore cui cæteri anthiani pareant et parere debeant et obedire et qui contrafecerit puniatur a priore anthianorum although the name of gonfalonier appears in the records of some of these years yet certainly he was not the head of the anziani but of the arts thus in the law of      item capitaneus debeat spendere et assignare gonfalonem gonfaloneriis electis vel eligendis ab unaquaque arte et populo    ita quod unaquæque ars suos gonfalonerios et officiales habeat from this it clearly appears that these gonfaloniers were the heads of the arts and not of the supreme magistrature of the anziani which gonfaloniers were elected by the council of the people of two hundred by the rettori of the arts and their counsellors and by the captains gonfaloniers and counsellors of the companies of the people and by the anziani for the time being these anziani sitting together with the captain of the people and the general council of the people promulgated laws and statutes gave execution to all the laws civil and criminal performed and conducted all the most important affairs relating to the government and restrained the nobles and plebeians with the fear of punishment within the limits of respect and obedience that is to say all authority legislative executive and judicial was collected together in one single assembly but how they restrained the nobles and plebeians to obedience we shall soon see in the year      these anziani are called in the records     imperial counsellors consiglieri imperiali a remarkable title obtained probably from the emperor louis of bavaria when after the death of castruccio he placed one of his imperial vicars over the custody of the city of pistoia the dignity of gonfalonier of justice was probably instituted in the year      because in the next year      in the acts of council it is recorded de consilio et consensu et auctoritate dominorum anthianorum et vexilliferi justitiæ populi et auctoritate ducentorum consiliarorum the new law of    0 names a gonfalonier of justice and eight anziani it is resolved that the anziani of the commons and people of the city of pistoia be and ought to be eight only namely—two for each gate or quarter and one gonfalonier or justice for the whole city     the said lords the anziani and the gonfalonier of justice and their notaries shall be and ought to be of the best popular men and artificers of the city and not of any house of the grandees and the authority of the gonfalonier of justice was placed upon an equality with that of the anziani the law ordained that wherever in the statutes of the commons and people mention is made of the anziani the same shall be understood of the gonfalonier of justice although it be not written and in all things and everywhere he shall have the same authority and full power balìa as has one of the anziani besides his proper office and to show that the gonfalonier of justice was not in the beginning superior to the anziani it appears that after the introduction of that office they continued to appoint in the usual manner a prior of the anziani with the same authority and preëminence before described the law of    0 says and the anziani and gonfalonier of justice after they shall be congregated in their palace and shall have taken their usual oaths shall constitute one prior from among themselves for such time as they please to whom all the others shall obey under the penalty c so that each of the anziani and gonfaloniers of justice shall be prior according to the proportion of time they shall be in office the gonfalonier by the duty of his office was bound to send out with the consent and participation of the anziani the standard     of justice to assemble the armed militia and go out to execute process against any of the grandees magnati which gonfalonier of justice says the law shall be bound by the obligation of an oath and under the penalty of five hundred pounds upon the commission of any homicide to draw forth the standard of justice and together with the captain of the people to go to the house of the grandee committing such homicide or causing it to be committed and to cause his goods to be destroyed and not to suffer the said standard to repose until all the property of such delinquent shall be totally destroyed and laid waste both in the city and the country and to cause the bell of the people to be rung if it shall seem expedient to the lords the anziani and the gonfalonier of justice or the major part of them and all the shops stores and warehouses shall be shut immediately upon the commission of such homicide and shall not be opened till execution shall be done as aforesaid but in all other offences perpetrated against the person of any man of the people by any grandee it shall be in the discretion of the said lords the anziani and the gonfalonier of justice or the major part of them to draw out the said standard or not such a rigorous kind of justice as it regarded the grandees who gave themselves a license to commit excessive disorders against those of the commonalty was thought to be best adapted to their insolence and to undeceive those who may imagine that in pistoia at that time the title of grandee was a respectable title and distinctive of the true nobility of the place it is necessary to have recourse to the common municipal law which says that the magnati grandees were all those of whatever condition who abandoned to an ill life offended the commonalty and held the city and country in inquietude they for this reason were called magnates became separated from public affairs and excluded entirely from all magistracies and offices and subjected to very rigorous penalties by the laws of the years    0 and      to be declared a grandee was rather an infamy than an honor the words of the law are these but if it shall happen that men of any race or noble house or any one of them from such a a noble house or stock born of the male line or any others live wickedly and flagitiously against the people hurt the men of the people and terrify and disturb their peaceful state or shall endeavor to do so by themselves or by others and this shall be     made known by public fame to the captain of the people and the anziani and gonfalonier of justice for the time being these magistrates at the petition of any of the people of pistoia shall be obliged to propose to the council of the people that such a noble house or progeny such a man or number of men thus defamed be written and placed in the number of grandees and be accounted as such and as the pistoians were driven to great perplexities to maintain in peace and quiet their popular government and in order to punish severely all those who should take the license to disturb the pacific state of their city they proclaimed this penalty on all delinquents by a law of the year      rubric   but if it shall happen that any one of any noble house or race or any one of any other condition shall live wickedly and profligately or shall commit or attempt to commit any such crime or misdemeanor against the people and the pacific state of the people of the city of pistoia they shall be recorded in the number of grandees and accounted as such   to such extremes of caprice and violence destructive of all liberty and safety are such governments naturally and necessarily reduced† the city of pistoia had also in its regimen a syndic this was an officer who was called an elder or syndicgeneral     who must be forty years of age and live forty miles from the city his duty was to look over the accounts of the podestà the captain of the people the anziani and all the magistrates and officers of the city and its district when they resigned or were dismissed from their charges there were moreover according to the law of   0  judges of appeals in all causes civil criminal and mixed and to them belonged the cognizance of all disputes and regulations concerning provisions they also superintended the sumptuary laws against all luxurious excesses in the dress and ornaments of the ladies and they entertained a number of notaries and a numerous family and court for the execution of all services appertaining to their offices the city of pistoia being in this state of government in      the emperor charles iv arrived at pisa and the citizens appeared before his imperial majesty and gave him the demonstrations of vassalage and obedience due to the sovereignty which he held over their city the emperor confirmed to them all the privileges granted by his august predecessors and desirous of fixing the reputation and reverence for the dignity of the gonfaloniers of justice he enlarged their authority as well as that of the anziani and wishing to make the pistoians enjoy quietly a sort of liberty he gave them by a diploma of the twentysixth of may the faculty of living and governing themselves according to their laws and laudable customs in a free popular state under the regency of the anziani and the gonfaloniers of justice declaring both the anziani and the gonfaloniers for the affairs of pistoia and its dominion his vicars and vicars of the empire for the whole term of his own life the anziani says the diploma and the gonfalonier of justice of the people and commons of pistoia who now are and for the time to come shall be in office and no others we constitute our general and irrevocable vicars for the whole term of our life with the full administration in the city country and district of pistoia and in all its lands castles and places pistoia maintained itself in this state of a republic as long as charles iv lived and taking advantage of the distance and negligence of his successors it persevered in the same government until the year   0  when the emperor robert by his charter declared the gonfalonier and priors of the arts of the city of florence his vicars and vicars of the empire and gave them the government     of arezzo volterra pistoia and the other places of tuscany but in the interval between these periods the pistoians were never quiet for governing themselves in what they called a free popular state they were for reducing all to a level and thought or pretended to make all the citizens enjoy equally the public honors and offices of their city in this state of things the rebellion of sambuca was fomented by some of the citizens of pistoia at the head of whom was riccardo cancellieri who had made himself master of several castles in the mountains from whence he made inroads on the whole territory of pistoia and kept the inhabitants in continual alarms with the design of delivering his country into the hands of john galeazzo visconti duke of milan upon this occasion the imperial vicars in florence sent for the protection of pistoia two thousand infantry some cavalry and three commissaries who calling together the general council imposed upon the counsellors the necessity of doing whatever was required of them that they might not incur still greater miseries in the first place they required that every resolution and statute of liberty and every condition article and confederation which the city had should be annulled and then by another resolution that they should subject themselves to the people of florence with liberal authority to govern pistoia at their discretion this proposition of the florentines was ill relished by the pistoians and while the council was debating on it the soldiery took possession of the piazza and palace of the anziani and having understood that no resolution had passed they began with drawn swords in their hands to cry florence for ever viva firenze and to threaten the counsellors thus intimidated they by an ample resolution suddenly surrendered the liberty of their city to the florentines from that day the tenth of september   0  to the calends of january   0  to the end that they might apply a summary remedy to the evils with which they were agitated and oppressed thus say the books of reformations in florence and then were painted the lions the ensigns of florence upon the palace of the syndic of the city of pistoia it was not long before these imperial vicars availing themselves of the authority given them by the emperor and of that     given them by the pistoians themselves sent to pistoia four commissaries to reform the public offices these desirous as they said of smoothing the passions of the chiefs which had disturbed the quiet of the city of pistoia proposed that the forms and orders of the city of florence should as much as possible be imitated and that the twelve buoni homini should be called the twelve of the college and that the supreme magistracy of the anziani should be no longer denominated the anziani of the people but the priors of the people and not making any innovation in the gonfalonier of justice that he should retain the same name the prior of the anziani was to be called proposto or president of the priori according to the words of the reform and the priors shall have among themselves one president continually who shall continue three days in this manner after the oaths of office shall be taken they shall cause nine votes with their names to be put into a purse by a notary one of which shall be drawn out for a president and so successively during the term of their office the florentines having thus limited and restrained the privileges of the pistoians or made the election of the anziani and given them the name of priors they made eight purses in the proportion of two for each gate and regulated themselves according to the plan in      in which year to take away the scandalous names of the two factions of bianchi and neri whites and blacks two companies were instituted one called the company of st john and the other of st paul and one prior was drawn for the gate of one company and another for the other and the gonfalonier of justice was drawn at one time from the company of st john and at another from that of st paul this manner of drawing the magistracy of the priori was changed in      when they began to be drawn from two different purses the first and the second in      the pistoians considering that in so great a change of affairs they ought to make some advancement of the dignity of the gonfalonier of justice ordained that the first place in rank should no longer be held by the president and rector of the city but by the gonfalonier thus says the law that the gonfalonier of justice shall always hold the more dignified place and after him the president and in like manner in going out with the rector and other officers of the city of pistoia this     law was ratified by the law of      and from this it followed that in      they began to make for the president who was to continue in that office a purse by itself as it was determined in      that for the future two should be drawn from that purse and the oldest man of them should be the first to occupy the presidents place unless the younger were a doctor of laws and this was called the purse of the president the first of whom had the power of speaking and answering first in all meetings which power however ceased in the first president in the year      when it was determined that the right of sitting and speaking first should in all occurrences be enjoyed by the gonfalonier of justice and thus this office of gonfalonier of justice rising continually in dignity began by little and little to be desired by the nobles and by common consent and a public decree it became confined to the nobles alone the supreme magistracy of the priori becoming a little civilized the purse of the president got to be considered as the first after that of the gonfalonier of justice and that of the priors which was the first became the second but because four subjects were drawn from this it was called the purse of four and the other which was called the second of the priori became the third and was called from this time the common purse in which all citizens qualified for offices should remain at least for the period of one renewal although by his condition of birth merit and age he might be qualified for a purse of higher rank when it was afterwards established that the descendants by the male line of men of rank and of presidents should no longer enter upon the office of prior through that purse but through that of four the same was called no longer the common purse but the third whence by virtue of this new order of magistrature we read in      of one gonfalonier of justice two presidents four of the first and two of the second purse and one notary with the preference to the gonfalonier of sitting first given him by the law of      which says the gonfalonier shall obtain the first and most dignified place by the few memorials that remain in the archives of pistoia it appears that there have been many and various councils of citizens for the regulation of the public affairs of the city in which councils the supreme authority of government resided and before the construction of the public palace all these councils   0 were assembled in a church at the election of the head of the supreme magistracy of the anziani the council of the people from the year in which the anziani were instituted until      had the privilege to make the renewals of the magistrates and public officers of the city in which year it was ordained that such renewal should be made by those who had been drawn gonfaloniers of justice and workmen of st james these riformatori began to be called men of rank graduati for being arrived at the first two grades and honors of the city which at that time were the offices of gonfalonier of justice and of a workman of st james and for the first time they are found thus named in the reform of      from which time it was established by law that two of each family should assist to make the renewal of public offices and that the number of thirtythree should be sufficient to make the renewal with validity and this order of the graduati or men of distinction is that by which at this day the nobility of the city of pistoia is most clearly distinguished in the year      the assigned number of the graduati to make the renewal of the public officers failing there were elected certain citizens of the other noble and popular families to whom was given the name of arruoti and it was established as the duty of these to assist in making the renewal and this lasted till    0 in the times of the consuls we read that there was a council of a hundred citizens who were chosen by four men of good fame twentyfive for each of the four gates of the city without this council neither the consuls nor the podestà could determine any thing and when there arose a question of peace war or taxes besides the council of a hundred all the rettori of the chapels and arts assisted and as upon these occasions the consuls podestà counsellors of the hundred and rectors of chapels and arts all met in one assembly and determined all things by a majority of votes which as has been before observed made it a government in one centre an aristocracy in reality though a popular state in name and consequently some two or three families must always be at the head of it and constantly contending for the superiority this kept the people in perpetual contention there was another council as appears by the records formed of fourteen citizens and of all the doctors and advocates which     was destined to counsel the podestà as he himself after having made his election of them was obliged to regulate himself by their advice such was his oath and i will consult my counsellors through the whole time of my government in things which shall appear to me to regard the common honor and utility of our city of pistoia  as neither the podestà nor this council had any negative on the legislative council of a hundred yet since the podestà had the choice of the members of the smaller body that was no doubt composed of his friends in the council of a hundred in which case it is plain that the same persons and families must have had the chief influence and direction of affairs in both so that this executive council had the same centre with the legislative council it is further found that in the first times of the government of the twelve anziani namely in      there were two councils one of forty counsellors of the captain of the people and of the anziani who were required to be of an age above forty years and their office continued six months and they resolved upon all propositions which were proposed to them by the captain of the people and the anziani provided they were not contrary to the laws and regulations of the commons and people the other council was called the council of two hundred counsellors of the people and in the assemblies of this council assisted all the aforesaid forty and moreover all the captains gonfaloniers and counsellors of the companies of the people and all the rettori and counsellors of the arts and all those who had been anziani the fabric of this government and its spirit was the same with the former only the name of captain of the people was substituted for that of podestà and a council of forty was substituted to that of fourteen and a council of two hundred to that of one the alteration therefore was not at all for the better after    0 there was one council called the general council this was formed of a hundred citizens namely fifty popular  men and fifty grandees magnati in this council assisted all the members of the council of the people all the gentry all the doctors of laws and all the physicians of pistoia matriculated     in the college of physicians but this council had of itself no authority and could do nothing without the council of the people in like manner after the same year    0 the principal council of pistoia was that of the people in which assisted all the anziani gonfaloniers of justice and their notaries and two hundred popular citizens and none of the grandees could be of this council they were elected fifty for each gate the authority of this council was supreme and sovereign to make and repeal laws impose and take off taxes c in more ancient times as appears by the rubric    of the law of      the council of the people had consisted of six hundred citizens but because such a multitude generated confusion it was reduced to two hundred in    0 but the government of longest duration in pistoia was that of the eight priors of the people and one gonfalonier of justice and this body was called the supreme magistracy of the city and was renewed every two months from the four purses in the palace of its residence when they proceeded to draw these magistrates with solemn pomp the box was taken from the treasury of st james within which were locked up with four keys all the votes of the magistrates of the city and it was carried in procession accompanied by the magistrates of all the colleges with trumpets sounding into the public palace here the gonfalonier of justice was drawn from the first purse who was the head of this magistracy and not only enjoyed the supreme dignity and the preëminence in place robes habitation and in all other respects but answered in the name of the public and although in public affairs he could not rule alone there was always allowed him a right of freely entering when he would into the greater council and into all other councils and colleges where any matters of importance were under deliberation and there give his opinion his reasons and his vote this gonfalonier was a man of gravity from his age and that he might be respectable in all points it was required that he should be of an ancient family and he who enjoyed this supreme post enjoyed a jewel held in veneration by the people and in great esteem by the nobility there were then drawn from the other purse two persons who were called presidents and these were sometimes     of a middle age and sometimes old men and for the most part after giving proofs of their wisdom in this station they ascended either by means of their birth or their merit to the rank of gonfalonier from the other purse called the purse of four were successively drawn four subjects of the prime nobility or at least of middling condition who for the most part were in younger age and from this purse some by their birth and some by their merit and their age passed up to the more dignified purse of the presidents and sometimes to the rank of graduati or men of distinction in the last place were drawn two persons from the third purse in which were contained the names of all the citizens who had not made any advancement in the other purses or had been of families worthy only of the purse of four and among these were found those who exercised civil and liberal arts and these did not diminish the dignity of the magistracy but rather gave occasion to maintain the union between the plebeians and the nobility for with this compensation the former remained long quiet without any insurrection this magistracy had in the service of its ministry a chancellor who was a notary public and was drawn from a purse destined for that purpose this magistracy began their offices on the morning of the first day of the month in their senatorial robes each of the priors wore a robe of scarlet lined with red damask vulgarly called a gown lucco with a hat or bonnet lined with a cloth of black silk with its ribbon and tassel of black crape and upon the left shoulder a large knot of crimson satin which was commonly called becca and the chancellor wore a gown of black cloth lined with red cloth without the knot upon the shoulder but with a hat similar to those of the priori whose duty it is to draw up and sign the acts of this magistracy but the gonfalonier of justice was clothed with a robe of red velvet with a similar shoulderknot and his head was covered with a broad hat of a noble appearance the name of which is tocco  this magistracy thus clothed and ornamented after the discharge of the old magistracy took the oaths of office in the public view of the people in the larger piazza and under the ample covering of it built in      with the revenues of the excise     or gabelles of the four quarters of the city and after having taken the oaths they went in procession with the standard of justice to the chapel of st james the apostle protector of the city and thence to the palace of their residence which was spacious enough to receive in the year      the emperor charles v in all the forms of majesty none of the component members of that magistracy could go out privately but only when in some determined function was it permitted to the whole body of the magistracy to go out of their palace with solemn pomp this magistracy resided with its chancellor night and day in the palace to the end that all public business might be despatched with the greater vigilance for the good government of the city and they drew from the commons a sufficient appointment both for the maintenance of their tables and of six and twenty persons destined to their service and for the honorable management of the furniture of their palace the linen for their persons and households and of their plate and all other things necessary for their use in the time of the government this magistracy also entertained a chaplain with a handsome salary we may pass over the tedious description of feasts and public processions and say— that the gonfalonier of justice was the head not only of the supreme magistracy but also of all other subaltern magistracies which were in the commonwealth and without him there could not be convened any council of the citizens to engage in any public deliberation this magistrate while the public residence continued was attended whenever he went out of the palace by a retinue consisting of one person who with the title of fiscal resided in pistoia of one assessor versed in the profession of the law of the captain of infantry of two architects of the palace of the steward of provisions of the chancellor del danno dato of the master of the house and of six and twenty servants and in the performance of religious ceremonies and in some of the principal assemblies this magistrate had a retinue of magistrates and nobility which gave him more splendor than a crown the magistrates upon whom depended the right government of the city of pistoia are besides those already named all these which follow some determine upon public affairs others     preside in judicature others superintend the common others private interests these watch over health those over plenty some attend to the preservation of the peace and others to politics  these magistrates are the twelve collegi six for petitions two for the works in the palace of the supreme magistrates the two companions the captain of infantry who in ancient times was called by the name of captain of the families of the anziani and who in primitive times was called by the name of votalarche the institution of which office was most ancient the six laborers of st james besides other commissions held the care of the markets and were exclusively of all other magistrates and lawgivers of pistoia the judges and overseers of all offences touching provisions and constituted the first magistracy of the nobles because he who is denominated a laborer of st james enjoys the noble rank of the graduati a dignity and charge of equal nobility although of different function and command with that of gonfalonier of justice as this office confers the character and distinction of nobility both upon the person and the family there are also the four officers of the pious house of wisdom the four operai of the holy virgin of humility the magistrate over the rivers and roads the laborers of st john and st zeno the magistracy of buoni homini over the prisons the ministers of the monte di pietà the ministers of salt the ministers of pledges deposited the approvers of the excises the purveyor for the commons the four over civil suits the two over the restitution of taxes the two over the public schools the deputies superintending the poor the deputies for the assessment of taxes the magistrates of abundance the magistrates of health the judges of controversies relative to beasts the four peacemakers the ministers of the trumpet the eight reformers the ministers of the commons the ministers of the customhouse the syndics of the rettori the deputies over the workhouse of the poor the auditors the college of judges the notaries the rettori of the arts the tribunal of damages done the clerks who assist in civil suits the magistracy of three judges who are foreigners but at present as the public revenues are farmed out these are suspended and in their place the treasurer of the city is introduced to decide the controversies of the people with the     liberty of appeal to the grand ducal chamber at florence in cases of denial of justice the appeal from civil causes determined by these magistrates is sometimes to the supreme magistracy of the priori and the gonfalonier of justice of the city in the name of whom and under the impression of whose seal the public decrees are despatched there is moreover a council general of the people formed of sixty citizens and their office continues six months at this council the priors of the people the gonfalonier of justice the twelve collegi and the six for petitions assist this council holds the supreme authority of the city and has jurisdiction over all the magistrates who transgress their offices and has the faculty to treat and despatch the most important affairs of the state of pistoia to make and repeal laws name ambassadors dispense offices lay on and take off taxes and to give all assistance to the other magistrates who have their peculiar duties and each member may oppose a decision on any question under deliberation that it may be referred to another session to be approved or rejected on mature consideration for the most weighty business of the government there is a council composed of the old and new council of the people the priors of the people the gonfalonier of justice the twelve of the college the six of petitions all the graduati the resident officers of the pious house of wisdom and all the resident gonfaloniers who decide as to the majority appears most useful and advantageous for the public good here all the most momentous affairs and causes most interesting to the public are digested there is also a council of graduati which had its beginning in      and is composed of two persons for each family of those persons however who actually enjoy the dignity of the graduati which is the first of the honors of the city and three and thirty members are sufficient to form a valid council to which it belongs to promote persons and families to the citizenship of pistoia and to public offices and honors every five years this council together with the gonfalonier of justice and the eight reformers put to a secret vote all the persons who enjoy the citizenship of pistoia and reward or condemn them as justice requires they renew the imborsations of public offices and honors and give or take away from all as they please     examining well the grades of citizenship of nobility of antiquity merits and demerits in all persons and families over whom they keep a watchful eye in order to prevent all occasion of confusion disorder and disturbance which might happen through the discordant pretensions of the citizens and thus guarded and established they come from time to time to the distribution of those offices for which there is occasion pistoia has also its dispenser of laws giusdicente the duty of whom is to take care of the peace and tranquillity of the citizens and to distribute justice both according to the municipal laws and conformably to the will of the sovereign and from ancient times his post was occupied by the podestà introduced by the emperors into all the cities of italy and because that in the league that was called the confederation of tuscany concluded in      between many places and cities of that province for their common defence against the rights or at least claims of the emperor in order to stretch the limits of their liberty  pistoia had her place and elected according to the tenor of the association her head with the title of captain to whom were confided as the law required all her affairs and pretensions therefore in   00 it is said that pistoia had for her captain one by the name of gualdaccio from which year until      there was always elected by the pistoians and by those who had the government of pistoia a governor rettore together with the podestà for the good direction of the affairs of that city afterwards it happened that in the great tumults between the factions of the panchiatici and the cancellieri there were elected by the florentines thirteen commissaries to establish the peace between them and among the multitude of things which they did in   0  they annulled the office of captain and created that of commissary and thus in some years the officer was called commissary and in others captain commissary and in others they returned to the old name of captain in      the pistoians finding themselves in great difficulties doubtful whether they should be able to govern themselves and dreading the devastations of the army of the emperor charles v which was near their confines sent ambassadors to bologna to supplicate clement vii who was then in that city that he would condescend     to defend their city from the imminent danger and take it under his protection and they delivered him the keys of it which the pontiff in his own name and in the name of the emperor who fought for the obedience of the florentines and the other cities of tuscany with great alacrity accepted and immediately sent alexander di gerardo corsini for the government and custody of pistoia with the title of commissary and therefore it followed that a podestà or captain was not elected afterwards with the exception of three years but one magistrate alone with the title of commissarygeneral as was ever after the custom the emperor charles v having in    0 reduced the florentines and their confederates by force to submission to the empire and restored in florence the house of medici who had been banished by their fellowcitizens consigned to them the government and dominion of tuscany pistoia did not hesitate a moment in its obedience to the new regent of the province by which ready submission they obtained from him the privilege of continuing to govern themselves according to their own laws and laudable customs and they continued to receive in place of a podestà and captain a commissarygeneral for their defender and governor for all the time that the government of the house of medici lasted in order to maintain the charge with suitable dignity it was their custom always to confer it on some senator of florence the government of the house of medici terminating in the year      by failure of the succession it was conferred by the emperor charles vi on francis iii duke of lorraine and bar this new lord of tuscany pursuing the same system of government of the house of medici has continued to furnish the city of pistoia with a commissarygeneral if not a senator respectable at least for his nobility who regulating the government by the laws of the city has always enabled it to enjoy a perfect tranquillity francis ii grand duke of tuscany in      conceiving a good opinion of pistoia as a city of merit and in all things respectable and wishing to raise its dignity and honor annulled the office of commissarygeneral and confided the government to a minister with the title of governor     in a city where every interest seemed to be guarded by particular magistrates where so many changes were made in their form of government in order to find one which would please and satisfy the people one might expect to find happiness if it were possible that it should exist where legislative and executive powers were confounded together in one assembly but if we go over again the several periods of the history of pistoia we shall find that similar causes had the same effects at the end of the eleventh and beginning of the twelfth century  civil discords in pistoia generated much misery and many families fearing that they should have still greater evils to suffer determined to abandon their country and as a lesson to their mad and cruel fellowcitizens whom they left behind them they caused an inscription to be engraved on the inside on the gates habbi pazienzia have patience a motto that ought to be written over the door and engraven on the heart of every citizen in such a government and went to inhabit other countries italy beginning in      to be infected with the contagious disease of the factions of the guelphs and ghibellines destructive insurrections and tumults were raised in pistoia and the citizens infected with a spirit of cruelty against each other without fear of human or divine chastisement attended to nothing but party quarrels and mutual slaughter and murder and these contests involved the city in continual wars foreign and domestic till the year      when the podestà a wise man and a nobleman of high rank exerted all his prudence vigilance and solicitude to repress and compose the tumults of the nobles and popular party who on account of the government were grown unusually fierce and insolent but not being able to reconcile differences so inveterate nor prevent the cruelties which both parties regardless of his menaces and punishments daily committed the city was thought to be in evident danger of total desolation as some of the citizens had given assistance to the conte guido de conti guidi who was become odious to other citizens as a supporter of ghibellines tumults were multiplied till the city was at length divided in two and they came to a fierce battle as one party would not mix with or depend upon   0 the other each one elected its podestà and consuls as if they had been separate cities and a war was maintained between them for years with such fury as set all laws human and divine at defiance till exhausted and humbled on both sides they were forced to have recourse to rubaconte podestà of florence under whose mediation a peace between them was concluded with a detail of articles to the performance of which florence became guarantee in consequence of this mediation and peace pistoia returned for a short time to her flourishing condition so that not only the greater powers admired her felicity but the most formidable of the other cities stood in awe of her but oh miserable vicissitudes of ill constituted governments to the confusion of the citizens of pistoia the other cities by some intervals of peace and union grew powerful pistoia alone by the continuance of quarrels factions and civil wars was reduced to weakness in command honor and fortune it was not long before the old disputes revived and continued till      when the pope was obliged to interpose and negotiate a new peace between the parties in pistoia but this peace could not be effected till long wars a great destruction of lives and a general desolation of the lands and cities by the various leagues and alternate confiscations of the rich and the poor the nobles and commons guelphs and ghibellines had fatigued and exhausted all parties in    0 the ghibellines of pistoia florence volterra and prato could no longer bear the insolence and impertinence of the contrary faction they therefore formed a union with their friends in the other cities raised armies and renewed the wars and after many sharp conflicts and at length the sanguinary battle of monteaperto they turned the tide of fortune and the torrent of popular passions in their favor till all tuscany became ghibelline excepting lucca and the florentine exiles at the instigation of the conte novello vicar of king manfred pistoia florence siena pisa volterra saminiato colle prato and poggibonzi raised a standing army to make war upon lucca because this city was the asylum of their fugitives this army was maintained only by the imposition of general and very heavy taxes did infinite damage in the country and at     last in      obtained a peace between pistoia and lucca upon conditions one of which was that each city should pardon the other all the injuries molestations discords offences damages rapines homicides devastations and conflagrations that had been committed in       the guelphs in pistoia were much displeased that the heads of the ghibellines banished and driven out from their city should under astancollo panciatichi have fortified themselves at lucciano a castle under the eyes of pistoia therefore they ordered cialdo cancellieri their podestà to go out with an armed force and dislodge them panciatichi having penetrated the designs of the guelphs in pistoia fearing that he could not resist the assault of his enemies because he was inferior in force and without hopes of succor abandoned the post and went to pisa where he united himself with his confederates so that cancellieri finding the castle empty of inhabitants plundered and demolished it and caused the panciatichi to be banished as the heads of that faction whose estates were all confiscated the party spirit of the citizens of pistoia having in    0 in some measure subsided by means of the government of the universal pacificator of tuscany  they set about a reformation of their magistrates and considering that a multitude always generate confusion they reduced to two hundred their general council which had been composed before of six hundred members and created many new magistrates and jurisdictions to bring into order the affairs of their government but in      there arose again most grievous disorders by reason of the ill administration of justice and the general council elected the wisest citizens to make another reformation and new laws and to bring about a reconciliation among the principal citizens who disturbed the public tranquillity but all their regulations were ineffectual for in the next year      fresh disturbances were perceived in the city of pistoia occasioned by certain families who by means of copious wealth and the adherence of numerous friends followers and relations aspired to govern the city at pleasure but as the wisest men exerted themselves that their public affairs should depend only on law and justice     not upon the passions and caprice of individuals they called together the general council these endeavored to render those families odious and unpopular as well as the title by which they were distinguished and to this end ordered that they should be declared grandees magnati who by their influence and power disturbed the public tranquillity and to be declared a grandee became equivalent to being declared a seditious person impertinent and separated from the public government of the city the dominant party ruled the guelphs so arbitrarily committed so many robberies upon them and burned and destroyed so much of their property that these became desperate and joining the exiles from many cities raised an army which obliged the pistoians and the governors of other cities to raise another to oppose it at an expense of a general imposition of taxes upon all the necessaries of life the two armies met in the plain of campaldino and a memorable victory was gained by the guelphs and fire and sword were again scattered wide in consequence of this in    0 another fierce tumult arose in pistoia between the most illustrious families occasioned by a sword cut given by mone sinibaldi upon the face of gio vergiolesi upon this signal there was a general insurrection and it cost all the art and resolution of the government to do justice to prevent another general battle for civil discords were beyond measure increased and the people without any bridle were in the utmost danger of desolating the city and leaving it empty of inhabitants the exiles in the mean time took their stations among the mountains where they fortified themselves and made incursions from time to time robbing plundering burning and murdering without control another insurrection in      came very near accomplishing the final ruin of pistoia it ended in a bloody battle in which many persons lost their lives and the parties remained as inveterate and cruel after as they had been before it insurrections and tumults continued so frequent that the bishop fled for fear the merchants could do no business and revolutions insolence robberies assassinations daily happened and such distrust     was fixed in the minds of all men that all lived in continual fear and suspicion these apprehensions were carried to such a length that each one shut himself up in his house with the friends he could collect where he fortified himself and those who had not towers to their habitations erected them sixty towers were erected in this single city some of which still remain elevated above the houses some are now covered with roofs others since included in the buildings as they have been enlarged and others from time to time have been ruined and destroyed in the subsequent wars it is to be noted that by law or by custom towers might not be erected but by the nobility and these had their measure so that to avoid envy they could not exceed a limited height but at this time the insurrections of the citizens and of the people of the castles in the high lands increasing seditious and perverse people were found everywhere which gave occasion and motives to all the citizens to think of their houses and they began through the whole state to proceed to exemplary punishments without regard to the age condition or sex of the persons and thus in a short time they remedied so many evils and tumults and besides the quiet that resulted to the city the stimulus had an effect on the castles in the mountains—namely cavinano lizzano popillio piteglio s marcello mammiano and others—to make that universal peace which is mentioned in the archives of the city but the disorder was not confined to the common citizens in town and country it originated in the divisions among the men of birth fortune and abilities in the government the contests for superiority among the anziani themselves in      arose to such a degree that from argument intrigue and oratory they proceeded to blows and after a rude encounter the weaker party fled to the public archives and shut and secured the door in the faces of their pursuers those without finding it impossible to pursue the affray determined to take their vengeance by fire accordingly setting fire to the archives those within remained together with all the papers files and records a prey and a triumph to devouring flames this terrible event as may well be believed produced still greater tumults and confusions which were terminated at last     by a calamity of another kind more terrible if not more destructive a continuance of earthquakes for eight days together which shook down houses and towers more effectually than the inhabitants were able to do this event which was believed by some to be a judgment of heaven for the animosities of the citizens it was hoped would promote peace and benevolence among them but they soon revived with more wickedness than ever their ancient dissensions  the family of cancellieri at this time having most influence both by the riches they possessed and by their great numbers amounting to a hundred men in arms as brave as they were haughty were become formidable to all the other families in pistoia to such a degree that all both in the city and country stood in fear of them it happened that carlino di gualfredi and dore or amadore the son of william cancellieri being together in a cellar where they had drank too freely fell into a squabble in which dore was beaten and insulted with outrageous language which offended him so highly that he meditated a cruel revenge going out of the wine cellar in this temper of mind dore went late as it was at night and laid himself down in a corner of the street by which carlino was used to pass and there happening to see vanni the brother of carlino on horseback without thinking of his innocence gashed him in the face by a blow with a target and by another stroke cut off part of his left hand in this deplorable condition vanni was carried to his father who seeing his son thus barbarously treated     was so inflamed with resentment that disregarding all laws divine and human he began to meditate his revenge at this moment the extravagance of his son was reported to william and affected him with such grief and disgust that he thought of averting any unfortunate consequences by an act of submission and he sent his guilty son to the father and brothers of the man he had injured to ask their pardon in his own name and in that of his afflicted father but all in vain for scarcely had gualfredi cast his eyes on dore when he seized him and without regard to the goodness of his father cut off one of his hands upon a horse manger and gashed him in the face in the same manner as had been done to vanni his son by this atrocious deed done in cool blood and a sober hour the father and brothers of dore were so exasperated that in order to obtain some signal revenge they united the force of their friends and relations filled the city with brawls discord and murder and divided not only the family of cancellieri but the whole city into two parties the cancellieri were at that time very numerous very rich and in near degrees of blood related and allied some of them were derived from the lady nera and others from the lady bianca both of them wives of m cancelliero the first author of the surname of this family but now no longer regarding their consanguinity they became so perverse as to attend to nothing but the destruction of each other and reviving the memory of the ladies from whom the ancestors of carlino and dore had their original the followers of carlino took the name of bianchi and the followers of dore that of neri and the people being already infected with diabolical passions the ghibellines took the part of the bianchi and the guelphs that of the neri and from this time the two factions of the city began to be called bianchi and neri and frequent bloody battles were fought in the city between them the whole people in the city and country became divided into bianchi and neri and the mutual slaughters of men and burnings of houses came very near to ruin the country there was not a person who was not obliged to assume one of these     names and side with one of the parties recourse at last was had to florence to assist the magistrates in controlling these parties and the heads of the parties were banished all except bertacca far advanced in age and one of the knights of st mary an order which had been instituted by urban iv to pacify the factions it was confined to the nobility invested with white robes with a red cross and two red stars in a white field but with all its pomp and sanctity had very little influence to correct the errors of an imperfect government the cancellieri took refuge in florence those of the neri in the house of the donati and those of the bianchi in that of the cerchi and thus infected florence at last to such a degree that those party distinctions became as common and as mischievous in that city as in pistoia at this time the tuscans holding themselves free from all subjection to the empire  and regulating all things according to the caprice of parties unbalanced in their governments the pestiferous venom of faction spread wider every day in the minds of the people each side aiming at nothing less than the others total destruction  had for its object the ambition of domineering without control with this maxim which is characteristic of the seditious these factions joined in the city of florence to trample on the laws and the bianchi party succeeded in driving out by force the neri and assumed the mastery of the city but before the end of the year another revolution was effected both in florence and pistoia and the houses of many of the principal people levelled with the ground     the florentines among whom the neri governed in   0  suspecting that the bianchi now banished from their city would with the assistance of the bianchi who ruled in pistoia rise again with new force entered into a combination with lucca for the total destruction of pistoia and a war succeeded which lasted many years and extended to all the cities of tuscany introducing the distinctions of neri and bianchi and several revolutions in all of them but the war against pistoia was maintained by florence and lucca in concert till pistoia was taken its country divided and its people persecuted and oppressed until finally they refused to receive a podestà from lucca and florence this occasioned another army to be sent against them the  pistoians then called in the mediation of siena by whose decision it was ordained that the podestà and captain of the people for pistoia should not be chosen by the lucchese and florentines but by the pistoians themselves provided that the election should always fall upon some citizen of florence or lucca this award was supported by the tedici ricciardi rossi lazzari and sinibaldi and others their followers against the will of the taviani ughi and cancellieri and their adherents both among the grandees and people this difference of opinion occasioned quarrels and dissensions the three families could not bear that the five families should lord it over the city each of these parties therefore striving to drive out the other without regarding the expense or inconvenience assembled their friends and forces marched through the country laid waste combated and assassinated in defiance of all government but in the end the taviani having fallen into an ambuscade in the midst of their enemies near a river some were killed others made prisoners and the rest dispersed as fugitives and their fortress della pieve di montecuccoli now called valdibura and the church of st simon where they had been used to retreat were sacked and burnt in      the pistoians conceived a jealousy of the prosperous fortune of uguccione not only on account of a signal victory he had obtained against the guelphs but because he had been made lord of pisa and lucca and had it in contemplation to     reduce pistoia to his power but dissimulating their fears and to make him friendly and benevolent to their city the pistoians chose him for their podestà coming to pistoia he restored the cancellieri the taviani the ughi and sinibaldi in      the pistoians by reason of the turbulence in tuscany put themselves under the protection of robert king of naples castruccio antelminelli captaingeneral of the wars of the lucchese having conducted to a happy issue many enterprises for that community thought of reducing to its dominion the city of pistoia by the means of its bianchi exiles but after many skirmishes and mutual ravages of each others territory a battle fought between him and giulione who commanded the pistoian forces against him in which a decisive victory was obtained by the latter produced a treaty of peace between them one article of which was that the exiles should be restored the neri consenting to this rather than risk a renewal of the war in      uberto cancellieri executed the office of podestà in the city of padua to the greatest satisfaction of that people and the same year matteo panciatichi gave clear proofs of fidelity and courage in the office of commissary of romagna under clement v and the people of florence from      to    0 the history of this republic is filled with wars seditions and intrigues all set on foot by the different contending parties in order to elevate some individual a favorite or a tool of their own for the sovereign of the state the simple heads of the story must suffice castruccio commences a destructive war upon the frontiers to obtain the sovereignty of pistoia for himself the people of pitteccio betray their castle into his hands to favor his designs being probably inclined to that party the leaders however were beheaded for treason by the pistoians amidst these calamities ormanno tedici conceives the design of making himself the sovereign of pistoia the want of rain for eight months and the devastations of war had occasioned a famine in pisa lucca and pistoia upon this occasion tedici and vanni lazzari both rich and powerful as well as proud and ambitious men and consequently jealous of each other as rivals appear upon the stage their intrigues are full of all that duplicity and hypocrisy which is universal on such occasions tedici persuades the pistoians     to a truce with castruccio and seizes the piazza and palace of the anziani with his partisans is made lord of pistoia reforms the magistrates of the city and concludes the truce with castruccio much against the will of the other party having gone through all the ceremonies of a revolution that is to say reversed every thing recalled exiles c and governed the city fourteen months his nephew philip di fortebraccio tedici a youth full of ambition conspired to take away the sovereignty from his uncle and assume it to himself to this end he began by corresponding with the guelphs in exile and by infusing into them a belief that his uncle entertained a secret correspondence with castruccio to deliver pistoia into his hands the nephew by other artificial discourses and simulated manners exerted himself with the guelphs to depose his uncle and restore all the banished and scattered members of the guelph party his fictions were credited the resolution was taken with alacrity they united themselves with the impostor and the better to obtain their desires communicated their intentions to neruccio conte de sarteano a guelph gentleman of prudence and sagacity and requested his counsel and assistance who deceived by the relation of facts so well invented and colored by philip acknowledged that if remedy was not immediately provided pistoia would fall into the hands of castruccio and offered them his cavalry and promised to exert all his force to obtain the ends they desired the uncle discovering the conspiracy complained to his nephew who roundly asserted it to be a fiction of malice and went immediately to the heads of the plot told them that the abbé his uncle was informed of all held a short consultation with them in which it was resolved to rise at once and carry into execution what they had intended the conspirators assembling in the morning and taking arms in season rushed with philip to the piazza scattered the guards by putting to death all who resisted took the place ran through the city assaulted the palace of the anziani occupied the gates and garnished the walls with their people and philip remained lord and sovereign of pistoia this done philip called together the council of the people obtained the title of captain and taking the sovereignty of the city on himself reformed it with new anziani and magistrates and governing severely made himself feared by all men   0 the abbé tedici having lost the lordship of pistoia and eager to regain the possession of it machinated with his other nephews and adherents to throw out of the window of the public palace his nephew philip and going with his followers to the palace he was introduced alone to a conference with the artful philip by his express order who immediately ordered the gates to be shut against the other conspirators and with a very few words again imposed on his uncle and made him prisoner philip thus liberated from the snares of his uncle suddenly renewed the truce with castruccio he conducted his negotiations both with florence and castruccio with so much duplicity that he deceived both there are few examples of deeper simulation more exquisite address or of selfish knavery of a blacker dye than he practised with his uncle with the florentines and castruccio after obtaining of the florentines the creation of his son a knight of the golden spur three thousand golden florins for himself and noble matches and rich dowries for his two daughters of the florentines he married himself to dialta the daughter of castruccio and delivered pistoia into his hands castruccio immediately informs the emperor louis of bavaria of his new acquisition and louis sends to this great man so faithful and ardent in his service a commission to govern pistoia as his imperial vicar florence makes war to recover the city but is beaten by castruccio who receives the emperor afterwards in pistoia and is made by him duke both of lucca and pistoia and soon after dies if he had lived the example would probably have here been complete the continual altercations of the principal families having completely overturned the constitution and introduced an absolute monarchy but his death opened a door for still further contentions m vinciguerra di astancollo panciatichi prefect of the royal militia of france and a general in the wars of normandy came into the service of the florentines at this time with the character of general and rendered himself memorable to posterity and most grateful to his family by building in four years his superb palace in pistoia in the parish of st matthew the sons of the deceased castruccio thought  by the favor of the vergiolesi chiarenti tedici and other powerful     families in pistoia to get themselves acknowledged as sovereigns of that city and to this end procured an armed force to take possession of the piazza and palace of the anziani but the imperial vicar with his four hundred german guards and by the favor of the muli gualfreducci and panciatichi families sufficiently powerful gave battle to the sons of castruccio and drove them out of pistoia into the mountains of lucca the florentines taking advantage of the divisions and confusions in pistoia excited their people suddenly to war and went and laid siege to carmignano and after many fierce battles for fifteen days it surrendered which made the florentines with the guelph exiles very insolent ravaging the country preventing the farmers from sowing their grounds and threatening even the walls of pistoia in this state of things there arose in pistoia two potent factions one originated in the house of vergiolesi and the other in that of panciatichi the vergiolesi adhering to the government of the imperial vicar through fear of the four hundred germans who were in pistoia induced a good part of the people to refuse their consent to a peace with the florentines and guelphs the panciatichi with their followers not judging the sentiment of the vergiolesi good and useful for the city esteemed it more advantageous to make peace than to maintain the country in subjection to the avidity of the bavarian and his ministers but the other party determined to interrupt the treaty by exciting the city to an uproar and by parading the streets with their germans by whom many of the people were assassinated finding themselves thus illtreated the people collecting together fell upon these germans a skirmish followed so serious that many were killed many surrendered prisoners and those who escaped were obliged to fly with their vicar to lucca in the mean time ricciardo di lazzaro cancellieri a guelph exile from pistoia secretly assisted by the florentines and rendered powerful both by the money and the bravery of his guelphs understanding the disunion in pistoia marched into the mountains of pistoia with great terror to acquire possession of some confiscated castles of his party this occasioned great disgust and alarm to all the city and roused giovanni panciatichi to go out with his faction to oppose him who attacking his enemy with great spirit prevented him from     making himself the lord of that extensive country the panciatichi then the muli and the gualfreducci pushing the advantage they had gained and suspecting some treason from the vergiolesi applied themselves at once to cut off the means to such designs with all diligence they procured from the anziani an assembly of the general council by whom all the sons and relations of castruccio philip tedici charles his son with all their families were banished and imprisoned out of pistoia and all their goods and estates confiscated and to make sure of the imprisonment or the death of the tedici a reward was offered of five hundred florins of gold this done they made peace with florence and four knights of the golden spur were made by the florentines two of the family of panciatichi one of the family of muli and one of the gualfreducci in gratitude for their important services and both cities submitted to the church and banished the emperor the common people about this time began to be weary of the cabals of the principal families but were too ignorant to contrive any method to restrain them but that which always renders them still more desperate and destructive to the community an attempt to bring all upon a level the fashion at funerals had become so expensive that every one exceeded his proper abilities in making a show and the pistoians not without giving occasion for ridicule attempted to regulate the expense upon such occasions by decreeing a uniform moderation for all at the same time considering the blessings and advantages of equal and clear laws and that the people by the means of them are rendered tractable and less haughty and audacious they prepared certain statutes and provisions for the good government of their city and as it appeared to them that some of the principal families arrogated an undue share in the management of public affairs and were disposed by force to oppress the commonalty they determined that all offences against the latter should be severely punished and that the next noble relation of any grandee should be obliged to pay any pecuniary mulct which should be inflicted in case his estate was not sufficient to discharge it and in case the delinquent was sentenced to a capital punishment and escaped by any means from justice his next relation among the grandees should be held to pay a thousand pounds     although nothing can be conceived more inconsistent with liberty equity or humanity than these laws yet the terror of them is said to have procured a momentary tranquillity especially as certain companies of armed militia of the popular party were instituted in the four quarters of the city to force them arbitrary oppressive and cruel as they were into execution but this militia was not long able to control the spirit of disorder and it became necessary to provide a stronger bridle for unquiet and seditious spirits and a new and most rigorous law to beat down their arrogance and insolence the plebeians at this time feeling themselves the true and real grandees and at the highest summit of power ordained by a law that all those of whatever condition they might be who should give themselves up to an evil life and give offence to the commonalty and disturb the quiet of the city or country should be as a punishment for their actions denominated grandees grandi e magnati and excluded from the magistracies and all management of public affairs and be subjected to more severe punishments it is true that the nobles had still some share in the government because the plebeians that they might not make too many enemies at once did not seek to exclude all from public offices but selected from the number divers houses of the most pacific and the greatest lovers of justice and placed them among the popular men to take away their power from the others and secure it to themselves no nobleman however adopted by the commonalty was permitted to make any ostentation of his nobility so that if any one of the popular men was made a knight by any prince or republic he was suddenly deprived of his office whence many of the nobles who wished to enjoy all the benefits of the commonalty were obliged by a simulated respect to the plebeians to lay aside their arms and surnames to distinguish themselves from their connections remaining among the grandees other nobles there were who chose rather to be excluded from all public offices and live exposed to the rigorous laws of the grandees than to lay aside their arms or surnames jealous of obscuring the ancient hereditary splendor of their ancestors in this however they were deceived for the principal popular men took care to preserve their distinction by a law that if by a statute nobles were made plebeian they do not lose by that their nobility that the     advantage of being of the people accrues to them besides and by another law declaring many to be magnati it is subjoined the rest we understand to be of the people although born of noble race and progeny from this it was contended that those were deceived who measured the antiquity and nobility of their own or other families by the rule of the enjoyment of the principal magistracies in      several of the most powerful families arrogating too much authority in public affairs or in other words being found by the plebeians to have too much influence for them to be able to control such dissensions and disturbances arose that it was thought necessary to declare them in the number of the grandees and accordingly it appears by the records that the cancellieri gualfreducci muli ughi panciatichi taviani ricciardi tedici sinibaldi tebertelli vergiolesi rossi lazzari forteguerri visconti foresi and others that is all the principal families in the nation were declared to be magnati stigmatized with that odious appellation and excluded from all share in public offices in this year severe sumptuary laws against effeminate luxury were made by the council the solemnities and expenses of weddings were regulated and the clothing of men extravagant fashions in these things had tempted most people to exceed their revenues had multiplied debtors and rendered dubious and difficult the credit of merchants certain wise citizens were authorized to prepare regulations of this kind and they succeeded in making such wise laws that frauds and abuses became less common yet the caprice and instability of this government appears very remarkable at this time for although the cancellieri were the year before recorded for grandees yet in      ricciardo cancellieri was declared a knight by the council of the people of pistoia and was feasted at the public expense when any one was made a knight by any sovereign or any city he became suddenly noble although he had not been so by birth for birth at that time was neither necessary to nobility nor to knighthood the ceremony of arming the knight was made with great solemnity receiving the military girdle from the other knights     in      the pistoians lamented the death of their most beloved citizen cino their greatest lawyer and judge the master of bartolo and petrarch in      pistoia was obliged to capitulate with the duke of athens who held the government of it three years and ruled it as tyrannically as he did florence in      the government was recovered from the duke of athens and to remedy the infinite tumults which were daily excited by the power of the families of the magnates who by their riches and adherents made their authority and influence prevail it was ordained that in time of any tumult or uproar it should not be lawful for any man of the people to enter the house of any grandee and if by chance any one should be in such a house at such a time he should immediately quit it that he might not be under the temptation to assist the grandee upon pain of the loss of all public offices and confiscation of all his goods and no one of these powerful families whom they branded with the name of grandees could go into the service of any prince city or republic if he had not first obtained the permission of the general council on pain of being declared a rebel and that the families of the grandees might be known to all the following description and declaration of them was made and published by thority namely—omnes de domo cancellariorum omnes de domo gualfreducciorum tediciorum lazarorum viscontorum panciaticorum ugorum mulorum tavianorum sinibuldorum vergiolensium rubeorum ricciardorum which grandees in time of any tumult or strife must not go out of their houses unless called by the captain or the gonfalonier and anziani the pistoians informed of the robberies assassinations and havoc which were daily committed by certain rebels in the above mountain and of the treasons plotting by those of serravalle against the peace and quiet of the commons of pistoia did not neglect to use the necessary expedition to chastise the insolence of the former and to divert the malignity of the latter against the former they sent out a body of soldiers who put the rebels to flight and pulled down their houses against the latter they promulgated severe laws with a promise of a thousand pounds reward to any one who would accuse an accomplice of treason to show the inefficacy of all such democratical despotism as     the declarations of grandeeism against the principal families in a community frederick cancellieri surnamed for his great valor barbarossa had influence enough to obtain so great a distinction and so popular and honorable a post as the command of the troops raised and paid by pistoia to go upon the expedition for the conquest of the holy land angiolo cancellieri was made a bishop and rose fast in the church and niccolò cancellieri as captain of the florentines acquired immortal glory by besieging in his own palace and deposing from the government of florence walter duke of athens and marcello cancellieri also made himself illustrious as a divine and obtained the place of auditor of the chief court of judicature at rome so much of the time of the husbandman the artisan and the people in general was taken up in war at home and abroad and the fields were so often laid waste that it was impossible to obtain a constant and certain supply of provisions for the people the consequence of this was famine and the plague two other evils in those days springing with innumerable others from their imperfect government the plague and famine which in the course of the past year had nearly deprived pistoia of inhabitants at length ceasing the few that remained were so grieved and astonished at such a calamity that one would have thought their minds too much softened and humbled to engage again for some time in their nefarious tumults but the few surviving citizens found as much disunion and animosity among them as ever fresh disorders arose and there was no possibility of restraining the indignation and fury of the two families of panciatichi and cancellieri who upon some dissatisfaction arising among them fell into such quarrels that as each party had many adherents many murders and much slaughter followed and much greater would have ensued if the people had not gathered to separate the combatants and compelled them to retire to their houses  to prevent the prevalence and increase of these disorders the citizens called together the general council by whom it was ordered that diligent inquisition should be made after the heads of the tumult and a rigorous prosecution was commenced against richard cancellieri and gio panciatichi the heads of the two families     who although they humbled themselves and asked pardon for the error they had committed and made an entire reconciliation with each other were condemned in a fine of five hundred lire each to be paid to the commons of pistoia and were obliged to ratify by an oath in full council the peace they had made between them but notwithstanding all this neither of the families really laid aside their bad temper towards the other for their principals having rather from the fear of justice than a desire of tranquillity made the peace between them they daily applied themselves to provide arms and men and finally proclaimed themselves openly to be mortal enemies to each other this gave rise to the factions of the panciatichi and cancellieri from whence arose such actions and events as brought final ruin on themselves their relations their friends and the city itself i reflect with astonishment and stupefaction says fioravanti that the pistoians abandoning without cause or reason their native sagacity and becoming factionaries should have fomented the passions of these two particular families have set the boasting of preëminence over one another before the public peace and have employed all their forces against the tranquillity of liberty in that city celebrated through the whole world for men illustrious in arms in letters in sanctity and wisdom prudent in her laws and in her government to such a degree that foreign republics had made a model of her laws nevertheless thus it was giving themselves up a prey to their griefs and afflictions they deprived themselves of all repose and making the passions of a few common to them all lost their liberty and their government blessings which till this time had been preserved not without the envy of their rival cities this writer needed not however have been so much surprised if he had considered the nature of man and compared it with the nature of a government in which all authority is collected into one centre an attentive reader will be surprised at the boast of that tranquillity and liberty hitherto enjoyed and will be at a loss to find one moment in the whole history where there could have been any degree of either arbitrary laws of exclusion and disqualification and awkward attempts to expose to popular odium the principal families made without the least modesty or equity by a popular majority will never have weight enough with the people to answer the     design of them those families will still retain an influence with the people and have a party at their command very nearly equal to that of the majority and being justly irritated and provoked at the injustice done them will never want a disposition to attempt dangerous enterprises the family of the cancellieri though stigmatized and disqualified as grandees were still held in great esteem among all ranks for their riches and numerous adherents richard the head of the family stimulated by his own resentment and ambition and no doubt excited by his partisans had the presumption to entertain thoughts of making himself sovereign lord of his country courting the people to this end by his liberality affability and courtesy he waited only for a favorable opportunity to acquire it having filled his house with a large number of persons his countrymen and foreigners he suddenly marched out with these and his relations to assault the piazza and the palace of the anziani but being met by the captain of the company of the anziani with his men and with these many of the grandees and a multitude of the common people adherents of the panciatichi the cancellieri were repulsed with great spirit and perceiving their lives in great danger they fled and shut themselves up in the house of the bondacchi their friends their faction seeing themselves left without a head in disorder and defeated fled in despair out of the city by the gate of st mark the panciatichi having thus conquered richard proceeded with great violence to burn the houses of the cancellieri richard was outrageous at the destruction of his houses and the flight of his followers but being informed that they were waiting for him in the country he scaled the walls in the night went out to meet them took the castle of marliana and there fortified himself with the cancellieri on their flank and gio visconti archbishop of milan and lord of bologna and all lombardy in their neighborhood both with parties desirous of making them lords of pistoia the pistoians were obliged to put themselves under the protection of florence upon certain conditions richard cancellieri hearing of this went to florence and with plausible reasons made it there believed that the panciatichi held a secret correspondence with visconti to deliver pistoia into his hands the florentines thought they might as well govern pistoia themselves and have it wholly at their devotion     and immediately gave richard the command of horse and foot to go and subdue it the attack was made in the night and would probably have succeeded if the ensigns of florence had not been imprudently displayed which so enraged the pistoians that resolving to die rather than submit they repulsed their invaders the florentines sent a formidable reinforcement but the pistoians defended themselves with intrepidity till they assembled their general council and although gio panciatichi was infamous as a grandee he was still the soul of the republic and no other man had enough of the confidence of his fellowcitizens to be sent ambassador and entrusted with their salvation he executed his commission convinced the florentines that they had been deceived by cancellieri and made an honorable peace and in      the pistoians effectually assisted florence in defending itself against the army of visconti of milan in      the attention of all parties was turned to peace to put an end once for all to the troubles of italy and it was finally concluded between all the guelph cities of tuscany namely florence siena pistoia perugia arezzo city of castello and others of one side and gio visconti on the other with certain pacts and conditions among which visconti freely released into the hands of pistoia the castles and fortresses of piteccio torri treppio fossato monticelli and sambuca and on all sides all the exiles were released by virtue of which article the families of the ammanati tedici vergiolesi gualfreducci and others were restored to pistoia and all their property was restored to them richard cancellieri nevertheless in      being still obnoxious to the panciatichi did not cease to strengthen his party by soliciting the friendship of those who might be useful to his views to this end he formed an intimate friendship with the captain of the florentine guards of whom he expected to make an essential use in all occurrences but the panciatichi jealous of this intimacy complained of it bitterly to the florentines who to please them dismissed their officer but at the same time exhorted the complainants to live quietly and lay down their arms for that at all events and at any expense as authors of the peace between the two families they were determined to maintain it at this time some disquiet arose between the different   0 members of the cancellieri family one of whom pievano joined the panciatichi and brought an accusation before the florentines against richard that he meditated some great treachery against them a rigorous investigation was instituted richard being found innocent the accuser and the heads of the insurrection were severely punished while he was honorably acquitted the emperor charles iv made a grant to the pistoians to govern themselves by their own laws and laudable customs in a free popular state under the guidance of the anziani and gonfalonier of justice whom he made perpetual vicars of the holy roman empire that this sketch may not be protracted to an immeasurable length we may pass over the rebellions and wars between      and      at which time the dissatisfactions among the citizens of pistoia were so increased by the renewal of officers in      that tumults arose and to such a height were they carried that the florentines who desired no more than to become lords of pistoia or to see it destroyed because it was rich noble and powerful thought it a favorable opportunity to strike in with their meditated designs under the specious color of peace and quiet they annulled the late renewal and by new laws under pretence of taking away the scandalous names of the two factions of the panciatichi and cancellieri divided the officers into two orders calling one the company of st john and the other the company of st paul so that a moiety of the citizens exclusively of the grandees who had not enjoyed the benefit of the imborsation was now imborsed in the purse of the company of st john and the other moiety in the purse of the company of st paul and to obtain the supreme magistrate four were drawn one for each quarter from the purse of st john and four in the proportion of one for each quarter from the purse of st paul and the gonfalonier was to be drawn alternately once from one purse and another time from the other and because the company of st john was protected by the cancellieri it immediately followed that it declared itself of that faction and that of st paul protected by the panciatichi declared itself openly of the faction of panciatichi and in this manner instead of extinguishing the fire it increased to such a degree that it spread not only in the city but through all its territory and pistoia was reduced to a condition     so deplorable as to be obliged to abandon all domestic society and familiarity every one being suspicious not only of his neighbors and relations but of his bosom friends in      all ranks of people exceeded their abilities in expenses at funerals and in other effeminate luxury sumptuary laws were made against extravagant expenses but the historian confesses that although he thought there was reason for them yet as he could not read them himself without laughing he feared he should do no good by relating them the pistoians having bestowed all their endeavors and studies to obtain a peace with bologna with whom they had long been at war on account of boundaries now hoped to live happily but they were again tormented with insurrections attended with rapine burnings and murders innumerable the news arrived in pistoia in    0 that john galeazzo visconti had sent against the florentines an army of twenty thousand men under the command of jacopo del verme this war lasted several years and was brought upon the city by its divisions the pistoians had now been eight and forty years in some sense dependent on florence for in    0 after the great commotions they had entered into a stipulation by richard cancellieri their fellowcitizen with the people of florence to keep forever a purse of six florentines taken from among the popular party out of which should be drawn their captain of the people in this year      for the sake of a more intimate connection and familiarity with the commons of florence it was farther stipulated that for the future the podestà of pistoia should be a florentine continual animosities had occasioned in the minds of the citizens such weariness grief and compunction that it is impossible to read without commiseration their awkward attempts to reconcile themselves with one another and to extirpate the civil discords with which pistoia was furiously agitated the whole people of every age sex and condition were persuaded to go in procession through the city clothed in white sacks to ask mutually each others pardon and to cry misericordia e pace mercy and peace and there can be no doubt that a momentary benevolence and many acts of christian charity must have been produced by a pilgrimage so solemn and affecting but the defects     in the constitution of their government were not amended by it and the troubles of the people soon revived the jealousies of the cancellieri and panciatichi  revived and proceeded to such lengths that in   0  richard cancellieri to revenge himself began a secret treaty with visconti duke of milan to deliver the city of pistoia into his hands that he might govern it with his absolute power and exterminate the faction of the panciatichi the plot was discovered and richard and all his children declared rebels and their houses reduced to ashes richard in the country joined with other exiles and burned the houses of panciatichi the pistoians were now so alarmed with the danger from the visconti and cancellieri in concert that they were obliged to put themselves into the hands of the florentines the cancellieri carried on the war however with so much spirit and success that although the duke of milan died in   0  richard was able in   0  to obtain a peace by which the state of pistoia was obliged to restore his family to all their estates and make good all their losses the panciatichi agreed to this that the consent of all the leaders might be obtained to lay this burden on the people by whom the damages done to the panciatichi too were to be repaired in    0 it was ordained  that in the renewal of magistrates and public offices the families who had been stigmatized with the opprobrious name of grandees should be restored to the rights of citizens and share in the management of public affairs but these beginning with their usual impertinence to labor that every thing should be done as they would have it and all offices disposed by their influence quarrels and dissensions among the citizens arose by which the whole city fell into the greatest agitation whence it was necessary for the maintenance of the public peace to exclude them afresh from public affairs these families were the panciatichi rossi sinibuldi ughi taviani vergiolesi lazari cancellieri ricciardi visconti gualfreducci and tedici the ladies indulged in great expenses in the furniture of their houses and in the superfluous ornaments of their persons and families the general council thought it necessary to interpose and prohibit all clothes to be lined with foreign furs or to be     embroidered with pearls gold or silver or other expensive and superfluous decorations and because all former laws for the same purpose had been found ineffectual they were now renewed with most rigorous penalties in      a civil war broke out in the territory of pistoia called alliana between the cancellieri and panciatichi which spread into the city and went to such furious lengths that the ladies themselves took arms and fought with as much bravery as the gentlemen to revenge the slaughter of their relations and before this commotion was ended the slaves or what they call the the vassals or villeins took arms and no method to restore peace could be devised till florence was requested to send four commissaries who compelled the cancellieri and panciatichi to take an oath to be peaceable yet insurrections tumults and civil wars continued in      and indeed with very little intermission till      in that year  baldinotto baldinotti foreseeing that lorenzo de medici might possibly arrive at the sovereignty of pistoia considering the great reputation influence and authority which he enjoyed in that city laid a plot to take him off as a lover of the liberty of his country he thought it just and honorable to go with his own son and lie in wait in the way between poggio and cajano by which he knew lorenzo was to pass in his journey to pistoia to the feast of st james but the confidants of lorenzo having discovered the design the conspirators were without delay apprehended carried prisoners to florence and there punished with death another civil war between the cancellieri and panciatichi attended with its customary cruelty and devastation occurred and was not composed till the florentines summoned four of each party and compelled them to give security that for the future no quarrels murders burnings or robberies should be committed in pistoia but this answered the end only in part for the parties went out of the limits of the state and there committed all sorts of cruelties on one another and in    0 the civil war was renewed in the city on the death of the emperor frederick iii maximilian his son succeeded to the throne of the empire but delaying his     entry into italy he gave occasion to louis sforza tutor of the duke of milan to invite charles viii king of france to come to the conquest of naples upon this occasion the pistoians threw off their subjection to florence or rather broke off the connection but this acquisition of liberty and independence had a short duration for the pistoians knew they could enjoy no tranquillity under their own government and with their own parties after two years negotiation they agreed to a new convention in      the families of the grandees or impertinents as they were called revived their pretensions to be admitted to the honors and public offices of the commonwealth but as this was contrary to the popular will and the passions and interest of their leaders tumults ensued  the pretensions of these families were countenanced by the florentines but the popular men in the plenitude of their power opposed it with so much resolution that nothing new was effected plague and famine raged in pistoia to such a degree that some were in hopes the citizens would put an end to discord and sedition and at least endeavor to enjoy peace but the people trampling under foot all laws human and divine began to renew both in the city and the country their oppositions and enmities which proceeded to such feats of arms and mutual slaughter that they were again obliged to have recourse to the imperial vicars in florence to interpose and put an end to those strange accidents which threatened the total destruction of the country the dissensions of parties in the city and its territory being somewhat abated the citizens began to flatter themselves with the hopes of quiet  but neglecting to provide a remedy against the emulations of private interest in individuals and families     by separating the executive power from the legislative rivalries arose which produced such ruin both to the country and the contending families as has been deplored by all subsequent generations the fact was that by the death of buonaccorsi a director of a hospital of st gregory it was necessary to proceed to the election of a successor on the tenth of october      four subjects or persons had been balloted for and approved as suitable by the general council among whom the one who should be confirmed and approved by the bishop of pistoia according to the law was to obtain the office the council having discharged their duty in the nomination of the four the ordinary proceeded to reject two of them one after another and left the competition undecided between piero terchio and bernardo nutini each of whom endeavored to interest his friends in his favor terchio was protected by the panciatichi and nutini by the cancellieri the bishop was at florence whence it happened that salimbene panciatichi caused his friend terchio to be confirmed as director of the hospital by the canon jacob panciatichi under color of his being the apostolical legate and sending to florence for the approbation of the bishop the good prelate promised to comply the cancellieri hearing of this went also to florence to supplicate the bishop not to approve the election but the bishop who wished to keep his word would not listen to them seeing that they could not move him from his promise they applied themselves to obtain solicitations of his friends and relations with such assiduity and importunity that the irresolute  prelate was at last induced to comply with their request the panciatichi understanding the strange resolution of the prelate had recourse to the priori of the people and the gonfalonier of justice of their country and obtained an order that the possession of the hospital should not be given to nutini who had the smaller number of votes but to terchio who by right ought to have it and terchio accompanied by some of the panciatichi was placed in the government of the hospital the cancellieri returning from florence with the confirmation of the bishop in the person of nutini carried him to the hospital to give him possession but found the place occupied     whereupon returning to florence they carried their complaint to the rettori and after much altercation between the parties it was determined that the affair should be decided in a court of justice and the cause committed to two lawyers the judges determined that nutini had been elected and canonically confirmed and he was accordingly put into the office against all that could be said or done by the panciatichi who upon pain of being declared rebels were obliged to abandon the hospital which they had held well guarded and give way to the execution of the sentence the cancellieri were made insolent by their victory and sometimes by words sometimes by actions assumed a haughty superiority over the contrary party who considering themselves derided and insulted not only by the cancellieri but by the bishop went about venting their passions among the people whence it happened that hostilities beginning between these two families they never ceased till they ruined the city of pistoia the panciatichi could not erase from their minds the many and great injuries they had received from the cancellieri and now meditated a cruel revenge on the fifth of february   00 they unexpectedly assaulted under the greater piazza baccino nutini and others and having mortally wounded giorgio tonti they set to running through the whole city and murdering all the cancellieri excepting some who had taken refuge in the palace of the lords priors the cancellieri who survived were not at all intimidated because having many adherents it was easy for them to rouse the plebeians against the panciatichi quick at their instigation these showed themselves fierce persecutors of that faction for arming themselves all shouted vengeance vengeance and in the tumult a multitude of the panciatichi and their adherents were killed upon the spot matters became so exasperated that both parties thought of nothing but mustering as many followers as they could in may the panciatichi assembled a great body of men and seized the piazza and more than half the city fortified themselves in the balconies steeples and towers and devoted their whole time and attention to preparations for war the cancellieri on their part with followers equally numerous fortified themselves in the other side of the city and were assisted by such numbers of men who came in from the mountains and plains in the country     that they composed a large army in such a scene of turbulence suspicions were so frequent and dangerous that it became necessary for every man to declare himself for both parties adopted the same maxim towards the moderate men and neutrals if you dont show yourself our friend we will show ourselves your enemy  there was not a man finally who did not take a share in all the injuries and insolence of a party and frequent battles sometimes in one street and sometimes in another both by night and by day disturbed the whole city so that there was no time for the people to take any repose in this state of things there arrived at pistoia two commissaries with five hundred men sent by the imperial vicars in florence to put a check to the impetuosity of faction who entered by the gate of caldatica and taking possession of the most important and advantageous posts gave orders to all to retreat and abandon their arms these orders were scarcely promulgated when there unexpectedly appeared a large body of armed men to the assistance of the cancellieri which had been sent by their adherents in bologna and on the other side a number of men from st marcello and other neighboring countries came to the succor of the panciatichi and neither party choosing to give way to the other they began in the face of the florentine guards to strike each other so cruelly that the faster their forces increased the more were multiplied the insults arsons murders and slaughter the commissaries seeing all things rushing to destruction ordered the heads of both parties to appear at florence and that the soldiers both foreign and domestic should leave the city upon pain of being declared rebels and they extended the same threat to all who should entertain them in their houses the panciatichi were disposed to obey but the cancellieri who were favored by one of the commissaries continued insolent and those who had been summoned made a jest of the orders and refused to move whence those ministers seeing themselves little respected and less obeyed returned to florence the soldiers had left the city and the heads of the factions seeing themselves deprived of their strength set themselves to enlisting the plebeians on their side and a great body of people eager     for slaughter stood ready to begin a new affray as the death of giorgio tonti had been displeasing to the cancellieri they could not forget it nor conquer their desire of a bitter revenge with this view they occupied with all their people the piazza della sala and leaving a number to guard it went with the rest to the little square of the trinity to pull down the houses of the cellesi and then that of one of the panciatichi after which they laid siege to the palace of gualtieri panciatichi which they briskly beat down then running through the city they killed francis nutini and plundered his house with that of gabriel visconti bernard cellesi matthew cellesi and setting fire to all of them they ran to attack the house of astorre panciatichi from whence those of its faction fled and this house remained in the power of its enemies who stripped and robbed it they then burned the houses of the centi those of gio di francesco and thomas balducci and that of gori archdeacon of st zeno and auditor of the bishop pandolfini after so many pillages burnings and demolitions they returned to the piazza and rifled all the shops and stores of the panciatichi with whom they engaged in a bitter conflict and a large number on both sides perished at this instant a powerful reinforcement of men arrived to the panciatichi who without loss of time renewed the attack upon the cancellieri and both parties fought in the parish of our lady of the lily and in that of st michael with such desperation that a great number on both sides were killed and wounded and if a great rain had not parted the combatants it seemed as if the whole race would have been here exterminated but upon this occasion a truce was concluded the heads of these factions were now summoned to florence thirty of them went and were immediately thrown into prison a rigorous prosecution as it is called was commenced against them some were acquitted without any conditions of peace or truce others were punished by imprisonment some by sequestration of their property and some were banished this decision extinguished no part of the flames of revenge on the contrary the rigor practised against some and the lenity to others gave rise to still greater insolence and in the face of the florentines themselves and in their own city some of the acquitted cancellieri committed excesses as outrageous as before introduced by some of the malignant into florence secretly at     the shutting of the gates they set themselves to search for andrew and salimbè panciatichi to assassinate them and favored by the obscurity of a foggy air after two oclock at night they found it easy to put salimbè to death though andrew had the good fortune to escape by hiding himself in a joiners shop for this atrocious crime seven were outlawed but they having been reinstated in pistoia in defiance of justice the factionaries soon came to another rupture they confounded all things in such a manner that there no longer remained any who dreaded the divine much less human justice but scattering their strife through the plains and mountains nothing was heard of but quarrels treachery conflagration and murder the two factions were at length weary of such inconveniences and fatigues and to prepare themselves to combat with greater vigor they made for a short time and with common consent a truce each party increased its supply of arms men and provisions and the panciatichi desirous of victory invented several new instruments and machines of war and fortifying themselves with these thought themselves invincible the cancellieri as well as the panciatichi fortified themselves with forts and bastions of timber and machines of war and stood well upon their guard in their posts the panciatichi no longer able to restrain themselves set in order all their people made palamidesse panciatichi and bartolomeo cellesi their leaders and arranged all their posts officers and soldiers but while they were occupied in these dispositions they unexpectedly found the opposite faction ready to meet them the battle was fought and the cancellieri obtained a bloody victory because the panciatichi were abandoned by a large body of lombards whom they had hired for their defence they did not however lose courage but reassembling their partisans and rallying their soldiers they appeared again in a short time with greater numbers and ferocity than ever and the engagement being renewed for the short time that it lasted was so terrible and fatiguing that both parties exhausted and faint were constrained to retire with their wounded men to their posts the cancellieri having taken some repose and considering that they had the countenance of the new florentine commissaries by whose advice those of their associates had been restored to pistoia who had been banished from florence for the murder   0 of salimbè panciatichi assumed fresh courage to attempt every means for the destruction of the panciatichi on the ninth of august they scoured all the streets and squares of the city and wherever they found a panciatichi they murdered him they put to death also bernardino gai and mortally wounded the conte di rigolo bisconti but many of the panciatichi thinking it their duty to avenge themselves fell with such impetuosity upon the rear of the cancellieri as obliged them to retire in this state of things the florentine commissaries cited to appear before them ten persons of each party who though they made their appearance were detained in the palace of justice and exhorted to peace or at least to a temporary truce would not accept of any of these proposals therefore the commissaries not knowing what to do with them dismissed them animated rather than terrified by this weakness of authority and the judicial power they recalled all their followers confined in various places and providing themselves again with arms and assistants renewed the war such was the ardor violence and force of the cancellieri and their party that they excited great terror not only in the country parts but in all the city not content to have taken possession of all the councils and assembled them to govern as they pleased and rendered their people disobedient to all law but they also sent them with the utmost license through the country to ravage plunder and burn the villages and habitations the men of prudence and reflection seeing such destruction and so much ruin and foreseeing more exerted themselves to obtain an election of eight citizens to whom were given the whole authority of the general council or in other words they were made dictators that they might find a remedy for so great confusions and do whatever should be necessary or convenient for restoring the public tranquillity in the meanwhile the clergy were aroused and with uncommon zeal exhorted the people in private and fulminated from the pulpit against all this ungodliness and unrighteousness of men but all this apostolical benevolence added to the unlimited power of the eight dictators were insufficient mens ears were deaf and their eyes blind to every thing but the malignity of their own passions and every one continued to do whatever seemed right in his own eyes they recalled into pistoia all the banished     men with numerous troops of their adherents these filling the city with bad men and bringing fresh force and vigor to the respective parties they prepared to commit new excesses the panciatichi finding themselves at liberty and loosened from all restraint went on the thirteenth of august unexpectedly to batter down the houses of giuliano fioravanti that of jacob peri that of antonio popoleschi and many others upon which occasion many were wounded francis panciatichi and john astesi with many others of inferior condition were killed on the fifteenth of august they went to batter down the house of biagio odaldi but these making a resolute resistance many were wounded and the rest obliged to retreat but returning the next day to attack it they labored to such purpose that partly with force and partly with fire they took possession of the house they went next to the palace of neri and thomas fioravanti and finding no resistance they took it and filled it with their men they assaulted too the houses of the celate salincorni and curradi and not being able to take them set fire to them and burnt five warehouses of antonio ambrogi they entered into the house of lorenzo gatteschi but there they were obliged to fight a long time and the engagement became general so that it was impossible to ascertain the number of the killed and wounded of the two factions but there was not a street in the city which was not incumbered with dead bodies and polluted with human blood intelligence of the strength of the panciatichi had been communicated by the cancellieri to their friends who on the morning of the seventeenth of august with a hundred cavalry and two hundred infantry appeared suddenly at the houses of the cellesi by whom so brave a defence was made that they were repulsed but after taking a short repose they returned to the assault took the house plundered it and set it on fire they went next to the houses of antonio ambrogi to the two houses of the cioci to that of vincenzo mati and burned them with many others and retook those which had been hitherto occupied by the panciatichi who finding themselves obliged to abandon the houses of andrea fioravanti and antonio popoleschi consigned them in desperation to the flames but while the party of the cancellieri were busy in this mischief they were attacked in two places at once by the panciatichi and     scarcely was the action begun when perceiving their disadvantage they retreated behind the church of st anthony and set fire to the house of nicholas godemini from thence they went to the old gate and attacked the houses of the bracciolini in the piazza where meeting with a bold resistance they went with great anxiety to find the commissaries and demanded of them the possession of the hospital del ceppo which was then governed by one of the panciatichi otherwise they would set fire to it the panciatichi had already two hundred countrymen of the plain under the command of michelino jozzeli and that of lisca who posted for the guard of the hospital were determined to perish rather than abandon it the commissaries seeing so many people assisting the panciatichi would not openly espouse the request and attempt of the cancellieri but pacifying them with soothing words they gave orders to m criaco the captain who in behalf of the florentine imperial vicars with five hundred soldiers guarded the piazza in their name to take possession of the hospital under the pretence of preserving it from so much fury the captain with one hundred of his soldiers marched to the hospital and employed all his art to obtain possession of it but was answered by the panciatichi that they would not go out of the place alive upon this the commissaries in person went to the hospital and acknowledging that it must require great feats of arms to take it talked so fair to the panciatichi that these delivered it up to them it was however unexpectedly pillaged by the cancellieri and then placed by the orders of the commissaries in the power of the supreme magistrate of the city by whom possession being taken regulations were made for the good government of it and the administration given to four prudent citizens a little afterwards the commissaries and the bishop undertook to persuade the party of the panciatichi not only not to seek the control of the hospital but also to absent themselves some time from the city and in that manner to remove the cause of so many disorders and endless evils which threatened to succeed these orders or this recommendation were given to bastiano and vincenzo bracciolini of that faction who immediately held a conference with andrew and antonio panciatichi their leaders these thought fit to obey first demanding security for their houses and other property which was     promised them by the commissaries they made haste to communicate these particulars to all their factionaries who adhering to the opinions of their principals collected together all their property of value and carried it towards the church of st paul and there filled up the whole street which leads to the gate caldatica and stood well upon their guard the cancellieri were in the contiguous street with four hundred soldiers from bologna but fearing to risk a battle the panciatichi marched out of pistoia without receiving injury followed by the cellesi rossi franchini forteguerri fabroni bisconti bracciolini brunozzi and many others of equal rank and condition the gates were instantly shut and the walls lined with men by the cancellieri who from that eminence scoffed at the retreating faction with impunity and without danger the cancellieri remained in pistoia and it is not possible to relate the abominable iniquities and cruelties committed by them in the height of their triumph insolence and power ranging the whole city without control they attended to no other business or amusement but to ruin burn plunder and ravish whatever of the panciatichi they could find and he who could commit the most atrocious deeds was the most esteemed admired and applauded in this manner was the public faith and the solemn promise made to the panciatichi fulfilled and performed to the principal palace of the panciatichi they set fire the houses of the brunozzi cellesi and many others contiguous to them were dismantled the beautiful habitations of john oliver and virgil panciatichi with many other places and houses filled with grain corn wine oil and timber were burned and all the summerhouses shops and stores and every other building which belonged to the panciatichi in one of which was found in bed the count di rigolo bisconti ill of the wounds he had received in some of the late engagements the count was without ceremony thrown out of the window into the street not by a common rabble but by ceccone beccano and gio taviani men of distinction and consequence they afterwards made search in all the steeples and towers as well as through all the churches for refugees of the other faction and wherever they found any they drove them out robbed them and sent them to their houses and so enormous was the evil committed by the cancellieri factionaries that by the end of the twentieth     of august they had burned more than two hundred houses and stores and all of the principal sort contrary to the promises and solemn faith passed to the panciatichi by the commissaries and thus a beautiful and charming city was become a receptacle of assassins of robbers of murderers and of men of every evil deed while the faction of the cancellieri thus tyrannically domineered in pistoia that of the panciatichi would have done the same if they had been in the city equally without control in their state of banishment they still meditated the oppression and destruction of their rivals and to this purpose collected men and fortified themselves on the plains in the country not being able to obtain the countenance and assistance of the florentines but rather being threatened by them with their displeasure and chastisement they set themselves with all their forces to maltreat the country with their robberies arsons homicides and imprisonments in such a manner that making frequent excursions into the mountains they soon reduced all the territory of the pistoians to a miserable and deplorable state at the same time the cancellieri no longer knowing what to steal or whom to rob went on inventing new affronts for the panciatichi or those whom they suspected to favor that party who remained in pistoia as the city was full of malicious people who could not contain themselves they went frequently out of the gates and stole cattle and other property from the panciatichi in the country till all the panciatichi who were near the bounds of the city were obliged to retreat into the plain and unite with their associates here they began to think of checking the power of their enemies and all being eager to return to their houses they thought it a duty by force to put a bridle on the arrogance of their adversaries and reduce them once for all to subjection to this purpose they erected a strong bastion near the bridge of bonelle and another in the neighborhood of the bridge alla pergola and fortified themselves at st angiolo at st bastiano at the great house of the forteguerri at tenuta at magia at st nuovo at tizzana and made other fortifications with preparations of munitions of arms provisions and men from the mountains and from lucca who came to lend them assistance and by these means they held all the country in subjection and all the contrary faction in terror     the cancellieri seeing the preparations made by the panciatichi and apprehending some unexpected assault without delay made preparations necessary to remove these factionaries effectually from the country collecting together a body of four thousand men of their own and the bolognese they went out to attack at the same time the two bastions near the bridges the panciatichi were astonished and panicstruck at the sight of so many men and giving themselves up most shamefully to flight the assailants in less than one hour had complete possession of both bridges and dismantled both the bastions proceeding to st angiolo which was guarded by bartolomeo cellesi an intrepid officer and experienced in arms they fought a most bloody battle in which cellesi himself was killed for this brave commander falling from his horse was assassinated and his head severed from his body was fixed on the bow of a saddle and carried to pistoia there to be exposed to mockery and insult at the sound of the trumpets it was placed upon the architrave of the well of the great market that the people might demonstrate their joy and triumph over it and there it was kept three days this inhuman exultation was the beginning of ill fortune to the cancellieri the indignation of the panciatichi was so excited by the scoffs and taunts offered to cellesi and by the shameful repulse in an assault of an enemys bastion near the river brana that whilst the cancellieri were shouting victory and returning without order and with a great booty to pistoia the panciatichi making a commander of franco di meo gori a man of a very numerous family in terruccia proud and fearful but fortunate and accompanied by four of his brothers and other relations in all about a hundred persons followed in the rear of those who thought themselves victorious to the grove of elms and there retaking the plunder routed the party many were slain more made prisoners and the rest scattered in various places returned late and in disorder to pistoia the panciatichi having obtained so signal a victory proceeded under their captain franco to tizzana and magia and there summoned all the people of the party to arms and stood night and day in good order and well guarded the cancellieri seeing the increasing force of the panciatichi despaired of dispossessing them of the plain and therefore employed all their craft to effect a separation between the panciatichi in the     country and the panciatichi in the city in order to weaken the faction in the course of two months they accomplished their design and a truce was concluded between the panciatichi in the country and the cancellieri in the country which occasioned great feasts and rejoicings in pistoia this truce however had but a short duration parties began again to rage and mutual slaughters were renewed and although the florentines knew that the territory of the pistoians was no longer manageable on account of the continual murders and assassinations committed in it by night and by day yet they would not or knew not how to put their hands to any effectual remedy and although they ordered into confinement for three years upon pain of rebellion for returning to pistoia all the families of bisconti panciatichi cellesi except that of bernardo fabbroni matteo brunozzi rossi forteguerri bracciolini cioci and gherardi and many others specified to the number of two hundred yet it was not possible that this banishment should have any effect because many florentines their friends besides favoring and assisting them with money and other effects obstructed the execution of it which was the principal cause that the panciatichi consolidated themselves on the plain with the firm resolution not to depart from it the panciatichi nevertheless were not a little anxious when they knew that the commons of florence were against them and the cancellieri were not less disturbed with fears when they saw their enemies in possession of the dominion of the country so that they were obliged to consider themselves as besieged in pistoia rather than as lords of it wherefore reflecting that there was no blessing more necessary than peace it was determined by the general council that they ought to have recourse to the most high with pious and holy works and to this end orders were given to the laborers of st james the apostle that adequate alms should be given to all the religious orders that they might by their prayers supplicate heaven to send peace and union among the citizens all this was very commendable and proper but to depend upon these prayers alone without changing their constitution was as irrational and presumptuous as for the crew of a sinking ship to pray for preservation without working the pumps or stopping the leaks     accordingly in   0  they were found to have been inefficacious  for the execrable factions in a still greater effervescence of cruelty made use of every cunning stratagem and attempted every means to destroy themselves and their country the cancellieri dreading that the panciatichi might return to pistoia determined not only to hold them at a distance from the city but to drive them with all the force they could possibly assemble quite out of the country and to this purpose having taken into their pay three thousand foot drawn from the country the mountains from valdinievole from prato and other places and fifty cavalry early in the morning of the fifth of february they sallied out with these forces well armed from the gate caldatica and went one thousand men towards montemagno and two thousand towards st angiolo these last arrived at st angiolo entered the church spoiled it of every thing valuable and set it on fire and because thirty of the panciatichi who were posted as guards in the steeple knew it was impossible in any manner to defend it they gave the signal of their being besieged by a flag as had been previously concerted with their friends in the neighborhood suddenly three hundred panciatichi compacted together in the form of a squadron under the command of their captain franco gori using every artifice to avoid being discovered by the enemy threw themselves by surprise into the middle of the cancellieri and in a short time broke and defeated to the number of two thousand persons this victory was so advantageous to the panciatichi that three of them only were wounded and one killed while the cancellieri lost more than three hundred and fifty killed a proportionable number wounded and many were made prisoners and those few who escaped threw down their arms and in small numbers and great disorder fled towards pistoia this splendid victory with the acquisition of a great booty obtained by the panciatichi animated them not to shrink from any inconvenience or fatigue to prosecute the abasement of their enemies wherefore without loss of time taking to deceive their antagonists a pair of colors which had been seized in the last battle they paraded with this on their march and went to attack the other cancellieri who at santo nuovo had besieged their associates the panciatichi then guarding it but the cancellieri advertised by means of a lady of the artifice fled with the enemy almost at     their heels and hastily coasting round the cliffs of casale took the road towards collina and fontana and in confusion disbanded and covered over with mire reached pistoia this retreat took up the whole night this flight of the cancellieri occasioned no small damage to the innocent panciatichi who had remained in security in pistoia because such fugitive cancellieri as returned to their country had no other thoughts than to revenge themselves wherever they could by scouring the city with arms in their hands and falling upon those unhappy people they assassinated in the piazza a countryman and felice di marco who were of the panciatic faction and the others wounded and beaten by flying into the fortresses and palace of the rettori escaped their fury and saved their lives the panciatichi upon the plain in the country having been informed of the treachery committed upon their companions in pistoia by the cancellieri conceived against that faction an indignation beyond all credibility greater than ordinary so that after a little repose from the fatigues lately suffered they prepared to persecute their enemies with greater ferocity hearing that some of them had built a strong bastion in the township of casale from which fortification they daily made inroads among the inhabitants and committed much mischief they went on the twentyfourth of march and took the bastion the cancellieri who guarded it shamefully flying others of the cancellieri in casale itself taking post in the church and in the belfry after a sharp conflict were overcome by michelino jozzelli and charles nicolai many of them cut to pieces many others wounded and the rest pursued over the mountains where they left their arms and fled with precipitation others in the meadows of vignole and of agliana were stripped and totally dispersed others at the bridge of bonelle suffered a perfect defeat in which many were slain and the rest fled in disorder the panciatichi seeing their affairs succeed so happily prepared themselves for greater enterprises and calling together all their people they went against the castle of momigno took it and set it on fire they then took vinacciano and burnt all the houses of the cancellieri and the houses of the panciatichi having been a little before burnt by the cancellieri this place by the last conflagration became entirely desolate and destroyed nor was the damage less that was done at montegastoli in the country of     fontana of collina and of gabbiano the panciatichi then fortified themselves at montebuono and did infinite damage from thence to the party of the cancellieri who taking giaccherino built by the families of the panciatichi made a stand against their enemies and there followed in this neighborhood burnings of houses and murders of people at length the two factions descended towards the long bridge and came to battle which was continued for some time with obstinacy but the cancellieri having the worst of it at last fled the few good and wise men who remained considering the miseries and destruction which resulted to the city of pistoia and its territory from the two unbridled factions exerted themselves to assemble the general council by whom two citizens were elected to see that all malefactors should be chastised and punished but a provision of this sort could never be sufficient to intimidate a number of factionaries so powerful it accordingly only animated them to greater fury for the persons elected being poorly attended and provided with little power or force how could they be able to restrain a desperate people who required extraordinary rigor and much greater energy to render them quiet pacific and obedient this was so well known to those ungovernable people that it rendered them more fierce proud and insatiable of revenge so that the cancellieri seeing themselves overcome in battle determined to accumulate a great quantity of money in order to provide men to conquer the force of their enemies to this end they burthened the city of pistoia with the payment of twenty thousand ducats of gold they sold the effects of st james to the amount of four thousand crowns they pawned for eighteen thousand crowns more at bologna the chalice of gold of the chapel of st james which weighed twentytwo pounds they sold two angels of silver a fathom and an half in height and a pair of candlesticks which were worth five hundred crowns they took a most beautiful basin and an ewer of silver of the value of four hundred crowns moreover they coined into money other silver basins and an image of the virgin and another of st john of pure silver which were of st zeno and all the dishes and basins of silver which were in the palace of the supreme magistrate they took from the monte di pietà six thousand ducats and one thousand five hundred from the house of wisdom and made up a sum of forty thousand crowns  00 in the age and country where these things were done this robbery of churches of saints and angels this plunder of holy relics was sacrilege and impiety of the deepest dye enough to have shocked and revolted the city in any other circumstances but the spirit of party made it all lawful to the cancellieri and their followers they made mancino of bologna their captain one of the bravest soldiers of those times hired fifteen hundred foreigners of infantry and cavalry and called in all their friends from the mountains and country so that pistoia was so full of soldiers that all the houses could scarcely hold them in the mean time the panciatichi party neglected nothing to procure all the advantages in their power encouraged by one pazzaglino of serravalle they attempted to take that castle in which by means of that traitor they succeeded and they fortified themselves in the post which guarded valdinievole and in the steeples of the churches of st stephen and st michael both parties being in want of provisions made excursions to the adjacent country reaped the grain pillaged cattle and sometimes burnt houses and killed inhabitants till they reduced the places to a most miserable and deplorable state having in this manner provided themselves on both sides with men arms and provisions the cancellieri were anxious to undertake some enterprise with the body which they had hitherto kept in pay at so great an expense and with so little effect after a consultation part remained as a guard in the city and part went out to the mountain six hundred infantry and fifty cavalry went out well armed and in good order and attempted an assault in two divisions upon brandeglio and castellaccio but were discouraged by a brave defence they then turned towards cireglio and making a fierce attack they easily carried it plundered it of all that was valuable and utterly destroyed it by fire they then went to the church which with its steeple was full of people and of property they laid siege to it in such a manner that those who guarded it became irresolute about defending it but encouraged by the women who had taken refuge there who like generous amazons took arms and repulsed the enemy they placed in security the goods and in a short time regained the post which the men alone would have abandoned the cancellieri filled with shame and disgrace returned to their main body and  0  advised their companions to return to pistoia but when they began their march they were so persecuted by the panciatichi that the killed and wounded exceeded by far those who in confusion returned to the city then it was that the panciatichi hastened to berrignardo borghetto and piazza and burnt all the houses of the cancellieri and such were the damages done that day by the factionaries that more than one hundred and fifty houses of both parties were burned down those of the party panciatichi who had entered into the castle of serravalle thinking themselves in security stood negligently on their guard in that post intelligence of which being sent to the contrary party they sent with great haste six hundred soldiers upon an enterprise against the place two hundred took post around it and the four hundred others introduced by some in the place into the castle began to rush everywhere without control so that the panciatichi taken by surprise retired to other strong posts in the neighborhood early in the morning the cancellieri approached the steeple of st michael and took it by a vigorous assault they afterwards battered that of the church of st stephen but perceiving that it was not to be carried without some delay they set fire to the church from whence the flames ascending to the balcony soon burnt those who held it they intended moreover to have attempted the acquisition of the citadel in which the greater part of the panciatichi were shut up but a reinforcement of five hundred infantry and one hundred cavalry arriving to those in the fort and reinforced farther with three hundred men from the mountain and two hundred from lucca conducted by michael jozzelli who had taken the most important posts without the walls the castle was besieged in such a formidable manner that the cancellieri lost all hopes of expelling the contrary faction from that place the cancellieri in pistoia however hearing the situation of their companions in the castle of serravalle sent at the approach of evening three hundred infantry and fifty cavalry with plenty of provisions to reinforce and refresh them but scarcely had these soldiers met the others at the foot of the mountain when repulsed and pursued by the panciatichi as far as the long bridge they were obliged to submit to the loss of twenty persons many arms and all their provisions in the mean time there came to the assistance of the panciatichi  0  martino ciuti with two hundred men the captain franco gori with three hundred and many others who uniting with those already there amounted to three thousand who attacked that castle on the side of the citadel in which the companies had taken refuge but seeing all their attempts were rendered vain one hundred of the most alert approached to the gate with such impetuosity that they made a breach and let four hundred men into the castle who attacking the cancellieri in the rear in less than an hour killed more than three hundred and made more than one hundred prisoners and permitting the foreigners to escape by a shameful flight gained a large booty of goods money arms and horses the panciatichi having obtained this noble victory the citizens of that faction began to think of endeavoring to return to pistoia but were dissuaded by their friends of the country who would not consent they all went therefore together to their usual posts upon the plain with their prisoners and rich plunder if they had attempted to return to pistoia they would not have been opposed for the factionaries in the city were so impoverished that many had gone out of the place and although the bells of the people were rung that day not one person appeared in the piazza there succeeded many more affrays and slaughters burnings and depredations to relate all of which in detail would be endless great were the damages done the same day by the panciatichi in alliana but by the treacherous misconduct of their captain martino francese they were disgracefully repulsed had many killed and many wounded and what was more to be dreaded the cancellieri carried thirteen of their heads in triumph to pistoia and by that means revived the courage of their companions almost sunk in terror and despair great was the slaughter of their enemies and numerous the burnings of houses committed by the panciatichi of montagnana the seventh of july at momigno the tenth of july the panciatichi of brandeglio collected a large number of men from the plain and the mountain and burnt all the houses of the cancellieri which were at satornana and at st felice and plundered the property and the cattle the twentieth of july the cancellieri burnt in pistoia eight houses and six shops of the bracciolini and set fire to three houses of gio di franco and demolished the house of francisco cellesi near st prospero the twentyeighth of july  0  the cancellieri went to montebuono a town of the panciatichi took it by treachery and burnt it after having made twelve prisoners whom they conducted to pistoia led into the hall of a house inhabited by giuliano dragucci where they strangled them and threw them out of the window this which they called justice they compelled a priest to execute who was in the number of the prisoners and then they put the priest to death in the same manner much destruction was made by fire on the thirtieth of july in the commons belonging to the house of the bishop and in other places by the panciatichi but no less were the evils committed the same day by fire by the cancellieri in the township of bonelle and in so many other places were such excesses committed by the two factions that they reduced pistoia to be the most unhappy among all the miserable cities of italy its whole territory was one scene of burnings murders and captivity of men and the citizens themselves were become the talk and the scorn of the whole world the florentines who as imperial vicars had some pretensions to interfere in the government of pistoia derived from the emperor robert had neglected till they reproached themselves to attempt any salutary remedy to so many evils in the beginning of august the cancellieri the faction which had now the dominion in pistoia considering that the panciatichi were masters of the country and were well furnished with provisions while the city was in danger of famine assembled in the public palace to deliberate and they concluded it would be for the advantage of their country and of both parties to make peace with the panciatichi this resolution was soon communicated to the panciatichi who suddenly consented to treat at this time the florentines offered their mediation proposed articles and sent troops to keep order c the particulars of this negotiation were curious enough but this essay is already too long the wisest and most prudent men in the city held secret communications sometimes with one party sometimes with the other and then with the florentines till at last they prevailed to have a general council called this consisted wholly of cancellieri for the panciatichi were still in the country and consequently the demands of the latter were thought too considerable such controversies arose even among the cancellieri that it was feared nothing would ever be concluded  0  some juggling monkish trick at last succeeded a dove white and black bianca e nera after the similitude of the arms of the panciatichi family flew down upon the seat of the supreme magistrate and gave manifest signs that the most high was in favor of peace the hard hearts of the cancellieri relented and peace was made the great affair of the appointment of a director of the hospital was settled by giving each party alternately the appointment the panciatichi were restored to the city all crimes and atrocities were pardoned and to be forgotten eight citizens were to reform the government in such a manner that the gonfalonier and all the other officers should be equally drawn from each faction and the families enlisted under the panciatichi on one side and under the cancellieri on the other were all named and recorded seditions and tumults had ceased the two factions enjoyed in pistoia a tranquillity that they believed would be lasting but the habits of discord were not eradicated passions were not extinguished and the parties were not balanced accordingly in   0  the symptoms were discovered of a hidden gangrene the cancellieri pretended to have been exempted by the general council from accounting for what they had taken from the commons and from pious places and the panciatichi demanded to be refunded in part if not in the whole of the damages done by fire to their houses but as the general council and the other offices of the city were composed of an equal number of subjects of the two factions one party refused to approve of the petition of the other this exasperated their minds to such a degree that the usual factions arose and proceeded to blows and to arms they were soon separated by the florentine troops of cavalry and infantry who were posted as guards in pistoia and obliged without laying down their hatred indignation and rancor to return to their houses there they prepared to give a fresh scope to their passions and the cancellieri as the most powerful causing to be taken out of the hands of the panciatichi the fortresses they held began anew to prepare for driving them altogether out of the state of pistoia the panciatichi penetrating the designs of the cancellieri made no delay in providing men and each party introducing them by night stood waiting the chance to execute their ill designs on the twentyfourth of february the cancellieri in  0  three divisions fortified themselves with three hundred men at the gate of guidi with two hundred and fifty on the hill in the street of st john and with two hundred and fifty in the street near st dominic a party of the panciatichi coming in from the country occasioned the battle to begin but the panciatichi outnumbered and almost surrounded by their enemies were compelled again to abandon the town with precipitation and disorder the panciatichi thus expelled a second time from the city dispersed in divers places on the plain and the cancellieri remaining lords of pistoia suddenly shut the gates and went with unbridled rage to plundering burning and destroying all the remaining houses and substance of the panciatichi they robbed and burned the houses of the rossi forteguerri cellesi radda bambolino doffo gualfreducci as well as the panciatichi and many others meditating still greater cruelties they ran in great fury to the public palace and all those of the magistracy who were of the party of the panciatichi whom they could find they most cruelly put to death in this state of things those who presided over the administration of justice supported by the florentines attempted to provide a remedy against new combinations and made the disturbers lay down their arms to make an example they hanged puccino puccini whom they found guilty of the murder of the supreme magistrates and declared thirteen others outlaws whom they condemned for high treason for the contempt shown to the supreme authority these were driven out of pistoia and fled to montale this rigor of justice however instead of restoring quiet to pistoia served rather to hasten its ruin because the panciatichi fortified themselves with bastions of wood well furnished with arms and men near the bridge di bonelle by means of which they controlled the whole city and kept the minds of the cancellieri in constant agitation till the pride and ferocity of the two parties suffered not a day to pass in the city or the country without rencounters burnings and slaughter the panciatichi being thus fortified at bonelle and other places of the plain concluded to make an exertion of all their possible strength totally to destroy the contrary party to this purpose early one morning they separated into several divisions traversed that extensive country by different routes and after a  0  few hours all met together to assault sixteen houses belonging to the tesi mati and other cancellieri families these they stripped of the most valuable effects and burnt to the ground the cancellieri hastened in great numbers to prevent so great a misfortune but the fury and the strength of the panciatichi were such that after having killed and wounded many they obliged the rest to fly their flight animated the panciatichi to set fire without delay to all the houses in that vast plain and produced a conflagration which the historian could compare to nothing better than the opening of one of the mouths of hell pistoia being in this deplorable condition and deprived of all succor and assistance was filled with people given up to a licentious way of living without fear of divine and much less of human justice who committed continual insolence and wickedness of every kind wherefore many knowing the great damage which resulted to their country instigated the general council to elect one of the wisest and most learned citizens with supreme authority to administer full and summary justice in order to find a remedy for so great disorders and extinguish so great a fire by punishing every fault and reducing the people to the necessity of embracing peace and tranquillity the council complied with the petition of the principal citizens of the place and taking all authority from the podestà and captain conferred the title of doge upon mariotto di peraccino del guida a doctor of laws living at porta guidi and gave him all the authority of the council itself mariotto assumed the government of the city acted with so much rectitude that no man could complain of his partiality and introduced so much tranquillity into the city as to excite the jealousy of florence which feared that it might thereby be defeated in the end it was aiming at but the cancellieri as being those who had been the occasion of the exaltation of mariotto desirous of demonstrating their superiority in all matters soon gave occasion to the general council to apprehend fresh evils they therefore appointed for the doge three of the wisest and most prudent citizens for his counsellors that amidst such dangers he might be animated and assisted to relax nothing in repressing the pride of restless  0  spirits and that he might be more ardent in reducing the people to order and quiet all these endeavors however availed little for jacopo savello coming to pistoia with a hundred men in arms on foot and on horseback in aid of the cancellieri these determined to go out to the attack of the panciatichi uniting three hundred men to the soldiers of savello they issued out of the city in two squadrons one of which went to assault the houses of the giacomelli and the other went towards the abbey of pacciana where having routed a hundred cavalry of the panciatichi they returned to unite with the other division and both went to work to rob the houses of every thing valuable and then to set them on fire and put the inhabitants to the sword in the mean time the party of the panciatichi numerous in armed men marching suddenly in front of the enemy thought to revenge themselves for their past defeat by the total extermination of the cancellieri but because the river ombrone which lay between hindered the two parties from coming to a fierce battle frequent skirmishes ensued on its banks which after a long time appearing about to terminate to the disadvantage of the cancellieri this was the reason that intimidated by the force of the contrary party they hastily retired with jacopo savello towards alliana and in the confusion they abandoned the greatest part of their arms this general depredation ruined the crops and the country was afflicted with a severe famine which obliged savello to leave pistoia the cancellieri of cavinana desirous of restoring to igno the cancellieri their companions who had been banished from thence assembled a body of men who joining with two hundred and sixty persons on horseback and on foot that came out to their assistance from the city advanced to make trial of their strength but meeting with their fellow factionaries from the mountain and making up five hundred foot and one hundred horse they all directed their march towards pitellio and encamped near the old parish church where they waited two days the arrival of other forces to make a united assault upon that castle not seeing them arrive and fearing that succor might come to the pitellians from their friends in st marcello they laid aside their meditated enterprise and returned to their homes the panciatichi of the mountain finding themselves disturbed  0  by the cancellieri thought it a duty to revenge themselves and collecting for that purpose one hundred and fifty men at cutigliano began to scour the country and commit depredations they were encountered with a great booty and a sharp engagement ensued and after three hours the panciatichi thought it convenient to leave their prey and retreat to save their lives to lizzano the cancellieri having recovered their property and observing the retreat of the panciatichi into certain houses of lizzano marched into it then the panciatichi of lizzano for fear of the contrary party who were increased to five hundred persons and thinking to save their property and the furniture of their houses deposited them in the church and its steeple to which also the women and the men retired the cancellieri arriving in lizzano and finding all the houses abandoned pillaged all that was left in them and then burnt them they then laid siege to the church and steeple in so close a manner that there was no space left for the panciatichi to escape the cancellieri sent notice to their fellows in the city country and mountains to send them immediate succor that they might have dead or prisoners their confined enemies one thousand five hundred men appeared and took away from the besieged all hope of assistance in this desperate situation there was no proposal of surrender or capitulation the cancellieri repeatedly assaulted their enemy but they obstinately defended themselves and often wounded the assailants these at length renewed the enterprise by fire and attacked both the church and steeple in that manner those in the church could no longer endure the raging flames and all retired into the steeple this place not being capacious enough for all many were suffocated with the heat and smoke the panciatichi reduced to this state of misery were by some of the cancellieri promised their lives if they would surrender eighteen of the besieged took advantage of these fair words but scarcely were they in the power of their enemies when they were perfidiously put to death none of the rest would surrender but resolved to perish in the balcony the besiegers seeing this courageous resolution increased the fire under the balcony in such a degree that the flames arising around and above it many of the poor wretches within it tormented with smoke and heat and pain sunk under their misery and the more they deafened the square below with  0  their cries the more their inhuman enemies exerted themselves to distress them the party of the panciatichi of the plain advised of these miseries in which their friends of the mountains were involved and not able to endure the horrid excesses which were committed expedited under the command of toso the brother of the captain franco gori at once to pupillio four hundred infantry and one hundred cavalry who giving notice to all the factionaries of the mountains that they might come to the relief of their friends in a short time had an army of a thousand men and more besides a large number of cavalry taking possession of proper posts and making suitable fortifications toso by a great shout gave a signal of the succor arrived to the poor victims besieged in the balcony the cancellieri when they discovered this reinforcement sent parties suddenly to repulse them who found them so well fortified that any attempt against them must be ineffectual succors from all parts arriving to the panciatichi the cancellieri found it necessary to raise the siege and retire without risking a battle the besieged who survived the pain hunger and other miseries came out of that steeple and balcony where more than one hundred and twenty were found dead by the heat thirst and hunger and their liberators not caring to pursue their fugitive enemies only set fire to their houses by which new conflagration there was not a house left in these two beautiful villages the panciatichi having avenged the wrongs done to their friends took the road of st marcello to return to the plain but one hundred and fifty of them deviating without military order were unexpectedly attacked by the people of calamecca and not being able to defend themselves they found it convenient to save their lives by taking their flight in the night this event instigated the panciatichi to increase their forces to destroy entirely the contrary party and hiring to this end troops from ferrara modena and lucca they brought together four hundred infantry and one hundred cavalry who continually increasing gave cause to the cancellieri to prepare for new battles the whole country was so excited that from the great preparations of both parties for war nothing remained to be expected but to see the utter ruin of those places in this miserable state of things louis king of france excited   0 the florentines to interpose they elected thirteen commissaries and gave them full power these prohibited all to wear arms and cited the heads of the factions both of the panciatichi and cancellieri in the city country and mountain to appear at florence on the twentieth of august of the heads of the panciatic faction who appeared at florence in obedience to the order were six of the principal men of the panciatichi family four of the cellesi four of the bisconti seven of the brunozzi three of the gherardi and four of the rossi bartolomeo panciatichi m goro ghieri and captain giuliano gherardi with seven others refused to come and incurred the penalty of banishment as rebels of the heads of the cancellieri party there appeared in florence in obedience to the citation two of the cancellieri three of the gatteschi three of the ambrogi two of perraccino three of the melocchi three of the tonti and two of the odaldi nine refused to go and were declared rebels six of the heads of the panciatichi on the plain appeared and four of those on the mountain and an equal number of the cancellieri from each as soon as they appeared in florence seven of the cancellieri and six of the panciatichi were committed to prison and all the rest forbidden to leave florence on pain of banishment as rebels the florentine commissaries then took all public offices and the public revenue out of the hands of the pistoians and imposed heavy fines on the leaders for breaking the peace upon examination it was found that more than four hundred houses had been burnt in the city and more than sixteen hundred in the country the rigor of the florentines  preserved the peace but a short time for in the next year the two factions of the cancellieri and panciatichi broke out into another civil war as violent and destructive as ever but let us pass over the particulars and mention only a few circumstances the florentines again made peace in pistoia by their commissaries imprisonments fines and other severities which the pistoians were too much exhausted to resist in   0  the pistoians petitioned florence to be restored to the honors offices and revenues of the city and it was granted     the pistoians were such friends of the house of medici that they had the address to escape at the time when the spanish army invaded prato and committed such cruelties and devastations there john de medici was made pope and assumed the name of leo x and the pistoians made such rejoicings upon this occasion and sent such congratulations by their ambassadors to the pope and to julian his brother and lorenzo his nephew as recommended them to favor in      the families of panciatichi cancellieri ricciardi gualfreducci and vergiolesi who in      had been forbidden to have obtain or exercise the offices and dignities of the city of pistoia its country or mountains supplicated with others to be admitted to public offices and honors their petition was repeatedly rejected by the council but at length by the influence and intercession of the pope leo x they their children and descendants were restored and admitted to all the honors demanded is there in history a more curious fact these families were by an obstinate arbitrary and stupid law excluded from all offices and share in government yet it was impossible to establish a government that could control them and they disposed of all offices and the whole government divided as they were into two parties struggling for the whole time and butchering each other that one of them might rule the whole one spark of malignity remained concealed in the minds of the factionaries the panciatichi and cancellieri and in      broke out in a furious flame extending into the plain and the mountains from tumults and murders both parties proceeded to make preparations of men and arms to revive the civil wars in all their horrors but the florentines that is to say the medici family interposed with such energy as restored the public tranquillity in order to preserve which they drew off many of the turbulent spirits by taking them into their service as guards c after the death  of the emperor maximilian charles of austria king of spain was elevated to the throne of cæsar and was called charles v upon this event the pistoians expected     some innovations but the emperor was prevailed upon by leo x to make no change in the government of tuscany on the contrary the emperor confirmed to the florentines the privileges of the state authority and lands of which they were in possession giulio de medici was seated on the pontifical throne and called clement vii the pistoians did honor to his elevation by great rejoicings and by an embassy of congratulation which produced a letter from the pope full of paternal affection for the city of pistoia and abounding in praises of the citizens who composed it the ascendency of the medici family was not however sufficiently established to prevent a civil war from breaking out again in pistoia between the cancellieri and panciatichi an obstinate battle was fought between them which lasted seven hours and the panciatichi were again obliged to leave the city and go into the country to their usual mischief they returned in a short time with additional force fought the cancellieri again and obtained a victory not without a multitude of killed and wounded on both sides after this new tumult many prayers were appointed in pistoia to obtain the extirpation of civil discord the insurrection was soon heard of in florence and niccolò capponi whose prudence was esteemed equal to his valor was sent as commissary with an army to suppress it with great difficulty and much severity he succeeded in making a peace or a truce between the two parties in      the same factions revived their hostilities but the leaders were seized and sent to florence and imprisoned and mulcted in fines so severe as intimidated others charles duke of bourbon with a large army of spaniards and germans approached the alps of tuscany and threw the pistoians into an uncommon agitation but a great fall of snow obliged him to divert his course from pistoia to rome the florentines having in      banished the medici and taken down with great impetuosity the arms of that family from every place in the city charles v in      took upon himself the obligation of entirely reëstablishing that family in that city and to this end he commissioned philibert prince of orange to lay siege to florence with a large army of italians     and germans the florentines made great preparations for defence not only of their city but also of pistoia they sent into it five companies of infantry and placed each gate of the city under a company and the piazza under the fifth all under commanders in whom they had confidence but all these exertions of the florentines for the security of the city of pistoia and to maintain it at their devotion appeared even to themselves to be vain and of little moment if the goodwill of the two factions of the panciatichi and cancellieri could not be obtained and as the cancellieri were already naturally inclined to their views they courted and complimented the panciatichi as the most powerful and as the adherents to the medici and to accomplish their purpose they called to florence some of the heads of that party and admitting them into their council of war affected a great esteem for their judgments and opinions in things of the greatest importance the pistoians however placed little confidence in those who at this time had the sway in florence they therefore created a new magistrate over all affairs of the war and gave him ample authority to do every thing for the advantage of the city this magistrate esteemed the five companies insufficient for the defence of the city and sent to florence for more but he was answered that the troops of charles v were approaching to lay siege to florence and that the forces of their enemies increased every day so that they had enough to think and to do for their own defence that the pistoians must therefore make use of the means they had for their own salvation and to this end they gave orders to their commissary who resided in pistoia in behalf of the commons of florence that he should release freely into the hands of the pistoians the balìa of their city that they might both govern and defend themselves and to their soldiers posted as guards to return with all possible expedition to florence these orders of their principals were suddenly executed by the commissary and podestà pistoia remained free from the yoke of the imperial vicars provided itself with men arms and provisions but dreading the army of charles v on one side and the panciatichi being known to favor the medici they sent four ambassadors of that party to offer the keys of the city to the pope and pray his intercession with the emperor that his army might not enter their territory     many of the citizens intimidated by the uncertainty of the times absented themselves not being able to foresee the end of the war the advising council adopted another measure the appointment of ambassadors to florence to obtain a reconsideration of their resolution this produced such a rage in the panciatichi party that one of the ambassadors tonti was assassinated and a riot instantly ensued in which eighteen of the cancellieri lost their lives and the whole party was driven out of the city and their houses plundered and burnt particularly the celebrated palace of that family near st lukes the principal actors in this mischief having made a rich booty of money and jewels fled to bologna where they were most graciously received and pardoned by the pope at this time the real extinction of the faction of the cancellieri followed because the panciatichi favorites of the pontiff as adherents of the house of medici assumed such vigor that enraged not only against the cancellieri of the city but of the country both on the plain and in the mountains they sacked burnt and destroyed the greater part of their houses spreading ruin and devastation as they went in cavinana lanciole cutigliano spignano and all the other castles and possessions of the cancellieri the people of serra followers of the panciatichi burnt the castle of calamecca which held for the party of the cancellieri these were so inflamed with resentment that with the help of some companies of lombards they compelled their enemy to fly some of whom retreating for safety into the church of crespole were there besieged and all put to death others retired to the belfry and there fortified themselves so as to hope to escape the fury of their persecutors but in vain for the assailants disappointed of their vengeance by the sword resolved to obtain it by famine the panciatichi being reduced to this state one of their most daring soldiers named appollonio di dante to deliver his companions from the hands of their enemies precipitated himself from the tower and his cloak taking the wind he descended with no other injury than a slight hurt in one of his arms running first to serra and then to pistoia he roused one of the cellesi to march with a good body of soldiers to the relief of the besieged after this pitellio pupillio and mammiano by turning to the party of the panciatichi suffered no other damage than the loss of a multitude of     their inhabitants who were driven from their habitations as adherents to the cancellieri the pope clement vii accepted the gift of the city and by a letter or charter directed to his beloved sons the priors gonfalonier and people of the city of pistoia sent his pontifical commissary to take possession the panciatichi had now exterminated the cancellieri and obtained the power of governing but it was at the expense of subjecting both themselves and their country to a foreign power and another rival family charles v the twentyeighth of october    0 constituted alexander de medici governor not only of florence but of all tuscany to the extreme joy and satisfaction of clement vii thus pope and emperor guelphs and ghibellines bianchi and neri panciatichi and cancellieri were at last all brought to unite as all such constitutions of government ever have united at last in a government of all authority in one centre but that centre a worthless however artful despot the pistoians were in hopes that at least under an absolute prince they might enjoy a little tranquillity but in      the usual disgusts between the two factions of panciatichi and cancellieri began to spring up although the former by the partiality of the house of medici were indulged in all their caprices yet finding themselves now increasing in strength nothing would satisfy them but the total expulsion from the city and the complete destruction of all that belonged to the cancellieri tumults and slaughter arose and no man had the knowledge or the will to provide a remedy alexander de medici took possession of his principality in florence great rejoicings were made in pistoia and four ambassadors sent to present the congratulations of their city and recommend it as having been always faithful lovers of his family the fortyeight senators instituted in florence this year under alexander pacified the two factions of panciatichi and cancellieri and those persons and families who remained of the latter faction returned to the city to the joy of all alexander distinguished pistoia from all other places under his dominion for its great affection and sweet love to his family by giving orders that all the business of pistoia should be addressed immediately to himself in person charles v having ascertained the untruth of the accusations     of tyranny brought against alexander de medici by the florentine exiles made a visit to pistoia where he was received and entertained in the public palace alexander took it into his head that commissaries and governors were destructive to a state and therefore abolishing the office he disarmed the inhabitants as inclined to tumults and appointed ten noble pistoians to govern their city on the sixth of january      alexander was assassinated by lorenzo and cosimo succeeded when the news of this assassination arrived in pistoia the heads of the panciatichi party assembled and after mature deliberation concluded that the present was a convenient opportunity for destroying totally all remnants of the cancellieri party to this purpose they excited an insurrection of all their factionaries under color of maintaining the city of pistoia in its devotion to the house of medici they made leaders of gio cellesi and some others and with a great multitude scoured the city and in a very short time assassinated fifteen many others hoping to secure themselves took post in the fortresses but betrayed by the commanders who let in the panciatichi they were miserably deprived of their lives the partisans of the cancellieri seeing that they could not resist the fierce assaults of the contrary faction went to hide themselves some in the towns some in the monasteries and others in subterraneous places others went out of the city found a leader and hazarded a battle with their enemies in which many were killed and others afterwards burnt in steeples many who had foreseen such an event had before retired to montale and montemurlo places of their faction so that the panciatichi remaining masters without control in pistoia sacked burnt and destroyed all the houses shops and stores which remained of the contrary party in the city cosimo i had ascended the throne of tuscany and ambassadors were sent from pistoia to congratulate him at the same time the factionaries of the cancellieri who had taken refuge in montale constituting as their leader the captain guidotto pazzaglia their compatriot and a head of the cancellieri faction who now aged and weakened by many military fatigues had retired to his estate called the house in the wood fortified     by a thick and high wall and defended by a high and strong tower entreated him to engage in their defence and obstruct the approaches of the panciatichi pazzaglia took under his command all the factionaries of his party and by a secret correspondence which he had with philip strozzi increased his numbers to four hundred men whom he quartered in his own habitation from this post they took the license to go out frequently to the annoyance of the panciatichi and gave them much disturbance and many apprehensions the panciatichi to make a diversion and a division of the forces of the opposite party which every day increased in power went and commenced a cruel warfare with the cancellieri of cavinana these were made uneasy and retired to their steeples where they made a brave defence at this time the commissary took the resolution of bridling the parties by authority and with rigor but the panciatichi who were more than a thousand men in number in contempt of justice and sparing neither age nor condition nor sex executed in a short time a cruel vengeance on their adversaries by fire and sword and going on every day increasing in ferocity they increased their murders rapines and fires till they reduced cavinana st marcello crespole calamecca lanciole pupillio and other places to spectacles of desolation many of the cancellieri perceiving that fortune was not favorable to them retired to the parish church of cutigliano and there fortified stood upon their defence without losing their presence of mind waiting from the brave captain luca giacomelli some convenient succor by which they might once more attempt an attack upon the rear of the panciatichi who to increase their power both in numbers and situation had taken a post very near them these disorders were very displeasing to the duke cosimo de medici and he took great pains by means of his commissary to restore quiet to the cancellieri to which the panciatichi at length consented nevertheless the church was scarcely opened when they burst into such a furious rage that they fell upon every one of the cancellieri and cut them to pieces cosimo was not discouraged even by this outrage from using other means to restore quiet to pistoia and at last reduced some part of it to good order but the faction of the panciatichi having no longer any of the cancellieri on whom to vent their rage turned all their hatred and indignation against one another     the faction became divided into two which rushed into such persecutions of each other that innumerable quarrels and murders succeeded the example was followed among their connections in florence which gave occasion to the rettori of that city who dreaded greater disorders to draw the two parties to a truce at the same time the duke cosimo was exactly informed that the captain pazzaglia received daily additions to the numbers in his house and that by the assistance of philip strozzi and the other exiles many were induced daily to go into his service and the terror had of this great captain was thus increased desirous of providing against every sinister event which he foresaw might occur not only from the great number of men who were assembled at the house in the wood but from the thousands of men which pazzaglia at the sound of a bell was able to raise the duke after having in vain attempted to gain him by means of some friends sent otto da montauto with a thousand infantry to attack the house in the wood and make prisoners of its garrison montauto by forced marches sat down before the place but he was early discovered by pazzaglia who always vigilant saw every thing and thought of every danger and was fiercely repulsed montauto perceiving the enterprise to be difficult which he had thought so easy sent to his brother frederick who commanded the guards in pistoia for immediate succor the prompt arrival of this aid alarmed pazzaglia who finding himself besieged by a great number of soldiers and not hearing the bell of montale which he had ordered one of his officers to ring to assemble the assistance he expected from that and other places ventured out of his habitation clothed and armed like a soldier and with a joyful countenance went to meet his besieger and demanding safety for himself and his soldiers put himself into his hands montauto received pazzaglia with a smiling countenance and knowing him to be humane generous and polite he knew not how to refuse his demand they both entered the house in the wood where they refreshed themselves so splendidly that montauto admiring still more the greatness of soul of pazzaglia could not without tears conduct him to the presence of the duke cosimo had enough of policy as well as generosity to receive him like an intimate and confidential     friend he took him to his most private consultations and decided on no affair of state without his advice the duke perceiving that the ten noble pistoians assigned to govern the city had not fulfilled the obligations enjoined upon them or preserved good order restored the use of the ancient offices of podestà and commissary he promoted to these offices men of moderation as well as of spirit and thought by their means to remedy all disorders but there still remained enough of the citizens inclined to quarrel to keep the city in tumults and to degrade all justice niccolò bracciolini had insinuated himself into favor with the duke by having revealed to him a conspiracy of the salviati ridolfi strozzi and valori and was appointed to the command of certain companies of infantry which were in garrison there this officer recollecting that francesco brunozzi had been averse to include him in the last truce made between the factions by the mediation of the florentines conceived the design of taking bitter revenge of all the brunozzi family for this purpose he put himself at the head of his adherents collected a considerable body of armed men besides those which gio cellesi held concealed in his house ready for any orders went through the city in search of brunozzi and having found him deprived him of his life he proceeded to set fire to his house and all the other houses of the family but was obliged to get possession of them at the point of the sword the brunozzi made a brave defence but were inferior in numbers and three sons of francesco were left dead and the rest fled to some obscure place not satisfied with this bracciolini proceeded to the country houses of the family with a soldiery as tyrannical as himself and there committed all imaginable cruelty burning and destroying every thing for this cruel revenge he was afterwards condemned to pay to the surviving brunozzi only two thousand five hundred ducats for damages at the same time many exiles from florence desirous of deposing from the throne of tuscany the duke cosimo de medici in order as they pretended to set their country at liberty collected together at mirandola four thousand infantry and three hundred cavalry and gave the command of them to piero strozzi who took for his colleague baccio valori and came with one division towards pistoia and halting at montemurlo   0 waited for the rest of the army the party of the cancellieri who there expected them received them with transports of joy and having repaired the citadel and furnished the castle with every necessary they all being fifteen hundred men in number thought of nothing else but doing infinite mischief to the party of the panciatichi they burned satornana valdibura uzzo and capo di strada carrying off from all a rich booty taking no account of the government of florence the cancellieri made every effort to reënter pistoia and the exiles from florence had no other view than to deliver their country from the government of the medici so that all were agreed to assemble men provide arms and collect money that they might be able by force to wrest the command from the duke cosimo that sovereign informed of this and that those in rebellion against him were fortified with much care every day increased in force and did great damage ordered alexander vitelli otto da montauto and piero pipicciano that they should depart in the night from florence with their troops three thousand spaniards and two regiments of germans and go to the assault of montemurlo and that the force of the enemy might be diverted and disunited he ordered the captain frederick da montauto then in pistoia to unite the force of his companies with those of the party of the panciatichi and the same night with cries and fires spread terror in the neighborhood of montemurlo that the party of the cancellieri might be necessitated to abandon it the party of the panciatichi adhering in all things to the will of the duke united with the forces of frederick da montauto and in a dark night set in an uproar the country of alliana and from thence went to burn the houses of the abbey of pacciana setting fire to a multitude of ricks of hay and stacks of corn belonging to the common people they constrained the captain bati rospigliosi the captain francesco gatteschi the captain francesco arferuoli the captain luca giacomelli with many others of the exiles to abandon montemurlo and the neighboring places to go and succor their factionaries of the abbey at pacciana a severe and obstinate battle ensued in which in the end the panciatichi were superior with the death of sixty persons of both parties among whom were numbered the captain mattana with five soldiers of cutigliano who were enough to put in doubt the victory the head of mattana was carried to pistoia     and amidst the exultations and rejoicings of his adversaries carried to the piazza as a spectacle to all this detachment of the exiles being at break of day the first of august      defeated vitelli and montauto knowing that the principal heads of the rebels were in the citadel went to the attack of montemurlo and finding it in all parts ill manned they animated their people and assaulted the fortress which after a resistance of five hours was carried pietro strozzi attempting to make his escape fell into the hands of the besiegers a thousand men of both parties were slain and philip strozzi baccio valori francesco degli albizzi and many others were conducted prisoners to florence where as rebels both to the state and the empire they were put to death this was the establishment and the basis of the grandeur of cosimo i de medici who afterwards on the thirtieth of september obtained a most ample diploma from the emperor charles v upon this memorable victory the pistoians congratulated the duke with an excess of joy by their ambassadors and the party of the panciatichi who had rendered all possible assistance recollecting that the cancellieri of the house in the wood had taken refuge in the parish church of cutigliano when that place was sacked by the captain vincenzo di poggio and the proud towers which were there were ruined to the foundation now hastened with such ferocity to the assault of that church that after a long and good defence the besieged without hope of succor surrendered at discretion to their enemies who uniting with those of valdibura of cireglio and of uzzo their adherents burned more than thirteen hundred houses of the cancellieri in the towns of bigiano the abbey of pacciana chiazzano satornana calamecca crespole and lanciole the emperor preparing in lombardy for battle against francis i king of france and relying on the valor of pietro strozzi general of the italian infantry the pistoians were agitated with fears and made great preparations for defence the controversy between pistoia and lucca about the boundary between them near pupillio being adjusted the duke cosimo was desirous of establishing the peace of the city and for this object with menaces and efficacious admonitions he did not cease to press the obstinate citizens to submit to a regular life and reduce their affairs for once to good order and a state of     tranquillity but as the pistoians in their unbalanced state had no other consolation than to stand immersed in dissensions quarrels and discords they paid no attention to the sovereign councils but went on more and more boisterous wicked and seditious destroying the good order of government reducing every thing without control to the advantage of their private interests and the wantonness of their wild caprices the indignation of the duke was at last excited against these obstinate brains whom he thought it his duty to tame by taking from them all the honors public offices and revenues of the city as well as the institutions of charity and to shut up the palace the residence of the supreme magistrates with this view he elected four commissaries for the affairs of pistoia and gave them full authority to fulfil his determination all this was ordained and established at the instigation of certain citizens of pistoia and all the efforts of the people were made idle since by the tenor of the sovereign command all the magistracies and offices of the city were suppressed and the administration of the entire revenues and institutions of charity was consigned to taddeo guiducci and christopher ranieri with the title of proveditors general who received into their possession all the movables of the public palace and the supreme magistrates who had resided in it were dismissed six citizens were deputed with the title of proveditors of the commons to whom the palace was committed these with the resident commissaries and not otherwise assembled to treat of the affairs of their city these having held the office a certain time it was permitted to the pistoians to draw six subjects from a purse destined to that use but the duke  apprehending that these new regulations would excite insurrections sent a body of soldiers only three hundred and fifty in number to disarm the citizens and rein in the seditious and the wicked amplified the fortifications and furnished them with every necessary many of the pistoians now considered themselves as slaves and thought their nobility debased by the privation of all the honors public offices and revenues they thought it inconsistent with the dignity of     their blood to lead a life so obscure and inglorious they therefore retired from the city and went to inhabit in other places hence the city was in danger of depopulation became defective in many arts of convenience and necessity and nothing was heard but sighs groans and lamentations the few inhabitants who remained knowing the great damage which had resulted to their country from this resolution of the duke were never satisfied with venting their reproaches and curses against those who had advised it and they would have attempted more such great things as compose the whole history of their country if many had not been disheartened by the rigor of the new government all the soldiers in garrison at pistoia being in obedience to the orders of the sovereign gone with all other persons of note to florence to make their honors and acclamations on the happy marriage of the duke cosimo with leonora the daughter of don peter of toledo marquis of villa franca and viceroy of naples the cancellieri esteemed the opportunity convenient to rise and take vengeance on the panciatichi as all the soldiers were gone and everybody was turned to florence the cancellieri resolved to enter the city in the night and kill all the panciatichi without pardoning or sparing one that there might not remain the least memorial of them they hired people from various places of every quality and some of the most brave intrepid and desperate and having gained over to their party many in the city that they might at a critical moment open the gates they introduced in small numbers at a time many of their most desperate men and quartered them in perfect secrecy in the houses of their adherents and partisans they elected for their captain giovanni tonti who entered the service in the night of the fifteenth of june put in order more than four hundred soldiers and marched with them to the gate of st mark at pistoia where the walls were lowest there giving the concerted signal to those within that with their knowledge he might enter the city unknown to their enemies at the signal of tonti those who were upon the walls suddenly let down one of their men with orders to say to those without that they had waited four hours and because day approached many had retired to their houses for fear of a discovery and that therefore it would be advisable to delay the enterprise till the next     night hearing this tonti sent immediately one of his aids to desire those upon the walls not to depart and instantly consulting his colleagues he found but one for waiting till the next night transported with impatience tonti at once cried out to his soldiers follow me now is the time to show our courage and placing a ladder against the wall mounted to the top from whence whilst grasping at a stone in order to climb over the wall he fell with it headlong into the ditch his people hearing the noise of his fall but not seeing by reason of the darkness what had happened suspected that they were discovered and that tonti had been repulsed by the contrary party those therefore who had ascended on other ladders turned back and gave themselves to flight very few remaining for the defence of tonti among these the most spirited and the most faithful pressed to see what had happened and discovered tonti with one thigh broken half dead in the ditch understanding the truth from him they placed him on a ladder and with the assistance of his brother carried him to a house in the neighborhood as a place of security in this state of things simon gatteschi and philip ghelardini persons of great zeal and activity prepared to carry on the enterprise confiding much in the assistance of those in the city they hastened early with thirty followers to the gate of st mark and finding it open entered the city and marched to the piazza as many of the panciatichi as they found they killed which raised a great uproar in the city and intimidated the people so much that all retired to their habitations the heads of the panciatichi observing that the rioters were very few and that none in the city gave them assistance took courage and making by order of the commissary a hasty collection of men they began with these to pursue the others with so much spirit that some of them fled out of the city went towards cireglio and cavinana there made a rich prey and escaped into lombardy others were taken and severely punished and afterwards all the accomplices of the conspiracy were by a public proclamation declared rebels thus ended the tumult the commissary afterwards ordered many of the cancellieri party to be arrested who were about fifty in number held them three months in prison put some of them to the torture by which he discovered the truth of the fact and then set all at liberty without condemning any     all contradiction and opposition being suppressed and the harvest being plentiful the pistoians thought no felicity superior to theirs and they held it lawful to forget the past by immersing themselves in a sea of pleasures by the allurements of which they were seduced into a very vicious and expensive life cosimo perceiving that the privation of honors and offices had decreased the population of the city and diminished commerce and the revenue esteemed it his interest as well as that of the public that the city should be restored to its primitive state on the thirtieth of march      he made a concession forever in favor of the pistoians of all the honors and public offices and all the privileges which were established in the year      in the convention with the florentines the purses were soon formed of the usual magistrates and all the persons worthy of that preëminence and those honors had their names imborsed and the individuals were drawn with universal rejoicings the representation of the faction of cancellieri under the name of dormentoni and that of the panciatichi under that of risoluti made by some among the sports and shows of the carnival with habits and ornaments proper to that age through some injurious words thrown out in jest among them occasioned disorders of so serious a nature that there was great danger of reviving the ancient animosities and insurrections but the duke cosimo caused to be arrested the inventors of those masquerades intimidated their followers and restored the public tranquillity and to make the greater impression on the people and secure their quiet for the future he punished the prisoners in an exemplary manner the government continued absolute  in the family of medici till the year      when upon the death of john gaston i the last grand duke of that family without issue the family became extinct don carlos king of naples in his own name and philip v king of spain not only in his own name but also in the name of the infant don philip and don louis and the other sons whom he might have by the queen of spain renounced all right and pretence which they or their descendants might have to the succession of the grand dukedom of tuscany and transferred all such rights actions or pretences to francesco di leopoldo     duke of lorraine and bar his heirs and successors and pistoia soon swore allegiance to the new sovereign and here ends another most splendid example of the blessings and felicities of a republic without three orders forming a mutual balance it is quite unnecessary to excite the resentment or flatter the vanity of any individuals or families in america by mentioning their names but if you begin at new hampshire and proceed through all the states to georgia you will at once be able to fix your thoughts upon some five or six families in each state some two of whom will in the course of fifty years perhaps of five unless they are restrained by an independent executive power three independent branches in the legislature and an independent judicial department be able to divide the state into two parties one generally at the head of the gentlemen the other of the simplemen tear one another to pieces and rend the vitals of their country with as ferocious animosity as unrelenting rancor and cruelty as ever actuated the cancellieri and the panciatichi in pistoia and it will not be the fault of these individuals or families they will not be able to avoid it let their talents or virtues be what they may their friends connections and dependents will stimulate and urge them forward by every provocation of flattery ridicule and menaces until they plunge them into an abyss out of which they can never rise it will be entirely the fault of the constitution and of the people who will not now adopt a good one it will be the misfortune of those individuals and families as much as of the public for what consolation can it be to a man to think that his whole life and that of his son and grandson must be spent in unceasing misery and warfare for the sake only of a possibility that his great grandson may become a despot      chapter eighth cremona cremona  had persevered under the government of consuls until    0 when she changed the form of her government reducing all the authority of the consuls to one person alone who from the supreme power which was given him was denominated a podestà the election of consuls had occasioned such contests among the principal families as none could be elected to that dignity who were not citizens that it was now ordained by law that none should be elected to the office of podestà who was not a foreigner and a citizen of some other city as should be agreeable to the council provided he was not related by blood to any of the electors had no real estate in the city or country and was arrived at least to thirtysix years of age and above all things they sought for men of prudence and most eminent reputation to whom as soon as they were elected they sent letters by a public order praying them to accept the dignity offered them and on the day when they made their entry into the city with a public concourse and acclamations they were solemnly met and received by the whole people they carried in ceremony the ensigns of their authority the furred cap the long sword and the rod or sceptre and because for the most part they were men of military talents rather than skilful in the laws they conducted with them judges expert in the legal science by whose means they tried all causes civil and criminal and assembled the council when it was necessary after this change of magistracy from consuls to a podestà which however was of short duration and little stability as they created sometimes a podestà sometimes consuls and at other times both together there occurred in the state and republic of cremona many and very great disturbances cremona in      sent her ambassadors to placentia where all the ambassadors of the other cities of lombardy the     march and of romagna were assembled together with the ambassadors of the emperor and king henry his son in may at this assembly it was concluded that all the cities should send their ambassadors to the diet of constance a principal city of germany to establish the peace negotiated between the emperor and the cities on the twentyfifth of june      was established ratified and confirmed that peace so solemn and so celebrated which from the name of the city where it was made was called the peace of constance a correct copy of which treaty is to be found at the end of the fourteenth book of sigonius of the kingdom of italy such was the instability of the government that the city returned in    0 to the administration of consuls they in the next year elected a podestà again who led them out to war but was unfortunate and this made them weary of a podestà and the next year they created consuls and consuls were annually elected until      when they returned to a podestà all this is perfectly natural the people were distressed by the contest of the principal families when they had consuls and therefore wished to have a foreigner as a podestà to keep them in order the principal families however struggled for consuls that they might have the rule and one party prevailed this year and the other the next the consuls in      to supply the city with water dug a well and built a conduit of water which was afterwards called the murmur from the complaints of the people against the expense of it which were so great that they rose in tumults and insisted on choosing a podestà cremosino oldoino was accordingly appointed and governed jointly with the consuls to the end of the year any one may pursue at his leisure the particulars of the changes from consuls to podestà and from podestà to consuls till the year   0  when upon the appointment of consuls there arose discords and civil seditions which brought the republic to the brink of ruin the city became divided as it were into two by a rivulet that passes through it  on one side it was called the new     city and on the other the old though all the popular men of the old city joined with the new in short the division was between the gentlemen and the populars  at bottom the new city arose in tumults and were joined by all but the gentlemen in the old made new magistrates and governors and congregated together to constitute a new general council at sant agata    0 the old city and the new each made its podestà and many quarrels and civil wars followed and the hatred between persons and parties increasing as if they had not been born in the same city but had been most cruel enemies they soaked the bosom of their common mother with blood and had no mercy on her houses or riches which they consumed by fire but with much pains and intercessions of the bishop a peace was made by which the podestà of the new city submitted to the podestà of the old and swore obedience to him with this reservation however that he was to remain podestà of the people the civil war was renewed in      between the citizens of the old and the new city the two factions proceeded to a sharp conflict and after having killed an infinite number of citizens those of the old city set fire to the houses in the neighborhood of the scene of action and consumed every thing in them the year before otho had been excommunicated by innocent the pope and deprived of the empire and frederic roger was elected in his place for this reason the cremonese went this year in favor of the marquis of este and drove out of ferrara uguccione de guarnesi who was podestà there in the name of otho in      civil discords were somewhat appeased and consuls were appointed the wars between cremona and milan and placentia may be read by those who are curious but are not to our purpose they lasted till      in the beginning of which year civil discords and seditions increased because the people could not agree in creating the magistrates and it was not till after a long delay and the interposition of the pope with apostolical exhortations by letter that they were persuaded to lay aside their hatreds and discords so far as to appoint a podestà   0 in      the most terrible discords and civil wars between the gentlemen  and the common people in placentia were accommodated for a time under the mediation of sozzo coglioni podestà of cremona the substance of the peace to which each party swore was to lay aside their discords and contentions and forgive the injuries damages and mischiefs mutually committed and received but of what avail are oaths and treaties which the nature of man and the form of the government will not permit to be observed      this year two noble citizens of cremona were made one after the other podestàs of placentia in the beginning of the year      the discords among the citizens prevailed so far that they created consuls and those only for six months and this year there was a confederacy of verona modena and parma against cremona there arose in      in the city of cremona seditions and civil wars      the cremonese united with the popular party in placentia in favor of whom uberto pallavicino from cremona went with a hundred lighthorse to oppose the noble exiles      the milanese and brescians joining the noble exiles from placentia went with a powerful army against cremona and deformed the whole country with blood and fire in the year      there began to take root in cremona those abominable and pernicious factions of guelphs and ghibellines and to infect it to such a degree as occasioned an infinite expense of the blood of the citizens an inestimable destruction of wealth an unspeakable perdition of families and a most melancholy and miserable ruin of the country the city was in      divided between the two factions but the ghibellines had the majority and obtained the appointment of a podestà this year the emperor frederic was excommunicated by the pope and council at lyons in france and henry duke of thuringia was elected the two factions daily increased in violence the old city that is the gentlemen were favorers of the ghibellines and adherents of frederic the schismatical emperor and the new     city that is the common people were partisans of the guelphs who adhered to the holy see the bloody wars occasioned by this division between frederic and innocent and their respective followers can be read at leisure and may cause a laugh at the terrible disgrace of cremona in the loss of their triumphal chariot  an infamy which none but the gentlemen could obliterate the marquis uberto pallavicino a most powerful man and of great reputation but a zealous ghibelline and oldcityman was appointed podestà he fought a memorable battle made two thousand prisoners retook the carroccio and returned in triumph to cremona campo begins his third book in the manner of machiavel with deep grave and formal reflections as if a diversity of sentiments contradictory principles inconsistent interests and opposite passions among the citizens could be reconciled and united by declamations against discord and panegyrics upon unanimity without a balance in a government possessed of sufficient force according to him disunion of the citizens is indeed the worst evil in a city for what mortal pestilence can bring upon them greater damage than discord this not only precipitates noble and illustrious families to ruin but exterminates powerful and famous cities nor is there any principality or kingdom so stable or well founded that it may not be torn up by factions if this is true it is still an argument against constituting a city in such a manner that it must necessarily be destroyed by factions all things are maintained and increased by concord and go to ruin by disunion union brings victory and discord defeat enemies are easily resisted when you agree among yourselves when members are disunited from the body the person loses both strength and beauty when cyrus divided the euphrates into three hundred rivulets a child might ford the largest of them though his favorite had been drowned in attempting the united water italy the lady and the queen of the world after infinite conflagrations sacks slaughters pillages subversions and ruins has finally been degraded by the discord of her sons into a servant and a handmaid     all this may be true but how long will republicans be the dupes of their own simplicity how long will they depend upon sermons prayers orations declamations in honor of brotherly love and against discords when they know that without human means it is but tempting and insulting providence to depend upon them for the happiness of life or the liberty of society the city of cremona to come to the present point by its discord and divisions suffered intolerable evils and ultimately lost her liberty falling under the power and domination of uberto pallavicino who taking the opportunity from the controversies which went on every day increasing among citizens disunited and divided into divers factions of new city and old gentlemen and common people guelphs and ghibellines of capelletti of barbarasi and of maltraversi in the year      from podestà made himself absolute lord patron and master of the commonwealth by the assistance of the ghibellines who in the old city were very numerous and powerful sozzo vistarino a principal nobleman of the city of lodi maintained as a guard of his person a company of soldiers from cremona but the whole family of vistarino being soon afterwards banished and expelled by the people of lodi pope innocent endeavored to negotiate their restoration but the people would accept of no conditions of peace until milan and cremona made war upon them and unitedly compelled them to receive the vistarini into their city at the end of the same year the marquis pallavicino at the requisition of the people of placentia to oppose their noble exiles went with many of cremona to the siege of rivergaro to which those nobles had retired the cremonians about rivergaro in      compelled the noble exiles of placentia to surrender and that castle was destroyed with some other great places pallavicino not content with having made himself master of cremona or rather of the old city aspired to the dominion of placentia and to this end gave trouble enough to the podestà of that city while pallavicino was master of the old city his rivals bosio doara first and azzolino of the same family were successively made lords of the new city uberto pallavicino in      was created by the placentians podestà of that city but as the affairs of cremona were in a     critical and fluctuating posture he left a vicepodestà at placentia the marquis pallavicino having arranged affairs as he liked in cremona returned to placentia in      and by favor of the ghibellines was created perpetual governor and lord of that city      uberto pallavicino with the ghibellines of cremona and placentia went to the assistance of ezzelino of romagna the most cruel of tyrants and confederating with him against the mantuans consigned the whole territory to fire and sword and laid siege to the city for three weeks and would have taken it if the marquis of este and the bolognese had not come to its relief      a kind of triumvirate was formed between ezzelino pallavicino and doara who aspired at the domination of lombardy      the triumvirate disagreed and a new league was formed between pallavicino doara and cremona on the one part with azzo marquis of este and ancona louis count of verona and the cities of ferrara and padua on the other part against ezzelino the particulars of the war and the success of pallavicino against ezzelino the conquest of bresca and the subsequent persecutions of the guelph party in that kingdom may be omitted but in the year    0 the rage of factions and seditions were so distressing to all the cities that there arose a new species of pilgrimage and penitence whose object was to restore peace among the parties and obtain the return of the exiles to their proper cities the number of these pious and charitable people grew to be prodigious in tuscany romagna and lombardy and very austere were their penitences and very affecting their cries of mercy mercy pallavicino was alarmed and prohibited under severe penalties these kind of pilgrimages in cremona and bresca because he feared they would prove the ruin of those seditions and divisions by which he maintained the domination of those cities he grew proud and insolent plundered the bishopric and drove the bishop into exile      pallavicino having recovered the city of placentia by means of the ghibellines went with a noble company of cremonians and established a government making podestà visconti pallavicino a son of one of his brothers          gandione doara a noble cremonese was in the name of pallavicino podestà of placentia but the guelph exiles making an insurrection he was driven out with his garrison pallavicino began at this time to be uncommonly jealous of bosio doara      pallavicino fell into a controversy with philip della torre and detained in cremona all the merchants of milan with their effects pretending that philip was his debtor for having given him assistance with his cremonese soldiers to recover the castle of arona occupied by otho visconti archbishop of milan pallavicino in      grew odious and the factions of the barbarasi as well as the ghibellines had plundered the church so that the city was laid under an interdict and the popes nuncios had influence enough with the people to produce a revolution a deposition of pallavicino and a restoration of all the exiles by the general council      after the deposition of pallavicino bosio doara occupied the government of cremona but did not retain it long for upon the return of amatino de gli amati the proper head of the contrary faction from exile doara with his followers was driven out of the city but he only went to placentia and there held the dominion and appointed to the government a podestà gerardino doara a relation      uberto pallavicino having lost the lordship of the principal cities of lombardy died miserably in sisaligo his castle in which he was besieged by the parmesans and placentians    0 bosio doara with the ghibelline exiles from cremona went in support of napoleon della torre against his enemies at lodi this year they began in cremona to create captains of the people      pontio amato a citizen of cremona being podestà of milan was killed in a battle between the torriani and otho visconti archbishop of milan      the torriani having taken crema set fire to it the cremonese of the guelph faction gave assistance to those of torre against otho and the other visconti with whom was bosio doara of the ghibelline faction who prepared employment enough to the torriani          the cremonese and parmesans desirous of effacing the memory of the injuries done to each other in times past restored their respective triumphal chariots which had in former days been taken great joy was discovered upon this occasion and the two cities entered into a strict confederation with the modenese and reggians and the marquis of este the principal article of this league was that they should assist the inhabitants of lodi who were molested by the milanese who favored the party of the visconti of which the marquis of monferrato was captain bosio doara and gabrino di monza who were also of the faction of the visconti entered into crema with four hundred soldiers on horseback and as many on foot the guelphs having fled      the torriani being exiled from lodi took refuge in cremona and at the same time bosio doara sallying out from crema took by stratagem soncino and romanengo castles in the jurisdiction of cremona the cremonese of the guelph faction then dominant fearing that their affairs would grow worse assembled their army and called a diet of the cities their confederates the ambassadors therefore of placentia reggio parma modena brescia bologna and ferrara assembled at cremona and the marquis of este wrote that he would come in person florence and the other cities of tuscany offered to lend their aid the same offer was made by john appiano procurator of romagna they sent also a noble embassy to the pope to inform him of the situation of affairs in lombardy and in how much danger the cities affectionate to his highness were otho visconti perceiving these movements entered into a closer league with the marquis of monferrato and they collecting as many armed men as they could marched out with the triumphal chariot of milan and united with bosio doara the cremonese conducted their army now very powerful by the additions of the confederates partly to castellione and partly to paderno castles of cremona and while the two armies stood fronting each other they began to treat of peace which was finally concluded by means of the ambassadors of placentia and brescia the conditions of this peace were that all the cities should expel each others exiles otho visconti easily complied with the conditions of this convention because he had already conceived no small jealousy of the marquis of monferrato     and a most violent hatred against bosio doara who being excluded from this confederation and peace and having too much confidence in himself refused to surrender soncino and romanengo the cremonese therefore called another diet who sent an army and expelled him not only from those two castles but from crema william and ugolino rossi noble and most powerful citizens of parma having contracted marriage the first with donella carrara of the signori of padua and the other with elena cavalcabò of the family of the marquis of viadana these cities had made peace and were full of rejoicings on the union      william marquis of monferrato having made war upon otho visconti archbishop of milan the cremonese sent some companies of soldiers to his assistance at this time the triumphal chariot began to be disused as very inconvenient in battle they retained only the general standard in white with a red cross to which otho who was the first not to use it added the image of st ambrose a peace was concluded in      between the visconti the archbishop and the exiles of milan the numerous family of sommi had a confirmation of certain rights anciently granted to the family by the bishop of cremona a new confederation was formed in      between otho visconti archbishop of milan and the cities of cremona pavia placentia brescia genoa and asto against the marquis of monferrato but the marquis having made himself sovereign lord of pavia a new diet was assembled at cremona and another confederation formed matthew visconti who had been declared imperial vicar of the city of milan by adolphus king of the romans called a diet in that city to deliberate on a war against the torriani the ambassadors of cremona were there and promised to send their forces to the aid of visconti but the torriani made no movement and visconti did not long hesitate to break with cremona and lodi for impatient to enrich his followers he began to discover an intention to impose taxes on those cities the torriani too began to complain and were supported by the patriarch of aquileia the torriani came to cremona and began to prepare war against matthew visconti      the torriani removed from cremona to lodi where they met many of their friends and soon received the news that     matthew visconti had taken castellione from the cremonese the torriani with some soldiers from cremona and lodi and a gross multitude of milanese exiles their adherents went to meet visconti but were attacked and routed by him      the ambassadors of cremona of the marquis of monferrato of the marquis deste of novara of casale of bergamo and of vercelli all congregated at pavia and made a league against matthew visconti the cremonese not long afterwards with the marquis deste were routed by visconti this year however a peace was concluded between milan and cremona in which no mention is made of visconti a league was made in   0  between cremona placentia and pavia and they chose for their captaingeneral alberto scotto then lord of placentia these having hired a good body of soldiers and united with the torriani went under the walls of milan matthew visconti seeing that he was hated by his fellowcitizens went out of milan and renounced all his authority to scotto and while they were treating of peace the torriani entered milan and drove off matthew and all his partisans after having expelled the visconti from milan a new congress met at placentia of ambassadors from cremona milan pavia lodi como novara vercelli tortona crema casale and bergamo and concluded to hire at the common expense and for the common defence a thousand horse and a thousand foot a tumult in parma in   0  was occasioned by an attempt of giberto di correggio to restore the parmesan exiles giacopo cavalcabò lord of viadana amato persico and sommo all noble citizens of cremona and old friends of correggio transported themselves to parma were elected arbitrators and soon decided the controversy in favor of their friend correggio this year controversies and enmity arose between the cremonese and alberto scotto lord of placentia there was a diet of confederate cities in   0  against alberto scotto a powerful army was collected and the marquis of monferrato and the marquis of saluzzo were created captains and having passed the po and taken many castles in the neighborhood laid siege to placentia but the cremonians and lodians considering the danger they might be exposed to if that noble and powerful city should fall into the hands of the marquis of monferrato began to withdraw their troops they     were followed by those of pavia and the others and the army was dispersed and placentia delivered from the siege a new league was made against scotto the head of which was visconti pallavicino and the next year the torriani made themselves masters of placentia   0  giacopo cavalcabò a most noble citizen of cremona and lord of viadana a man of ingenuity and an elevated spirit was created podestà of milan the fulgosi scotti and palastrelli noble families of placentia with the assistance of william cavalcabò and the cremonians expelled lando and visconti pallavicino from placentia   0  guido della torre lord of milan made persico a noble cremonian podestà of that city this year a controversy arising between the parmesans and giberto di correggio the rossi the lupi and other noble exiles who had taken refuge in cremona were summoned by their countrymen to return and they instantly obeyed and carried with them the assistance of tignaca pallavicino who at that time was podestà of cremona and the cremonian soldiers and having driven correggio from parma giacobo cavalcabò was created podestà of that city a confederation was also made between guido della torre and the city of cremona to which lodi bergamo placentia and crema acceded   0  giuliano sommo a noble cremonian was made podestà and captain of the commons and people of placentia for months according to the custom of those times henry vii the emperor came at the end of    0 into italy to be crowned and he called together all the ghibellines of lombardy among whom matthew visconti held the first place at that time the authority and influence of william cavalcabò brother of giacopo was so great in cremona that all public affairs were administered according to his will but as these brothers were the heads of the guelph faction they were little friendly to the emperor cremona in      tasted more than ever the bitter fruits of faction civil discord and unbalanced government with which however it had been vexed and distressed for many years it was now besides infinite proscriptions of property and slaughter of citizens upon the brink of total ruin from henry fachetto marquis of canossa had been sent with the title of imperial     vicar but had been refused and expelled by the guelphs who then had the domination in cremona the emperors indignation was excited and he gave orders to matthew visconti to pass the adda and assault cremona with an army of ghibellines who collecting together from every quarter were increased to a great number the emperor himself with the empress his consort departing from milan removed to lodi gulielmo cavalcabò to whom the absolute dominion of cremona had been given by the guelphs perceiving such formidable preparations for war knowing his own city to be nearly divided into equal parties and having little confidence in his own faction quitted the city and went to viadana followed by the picenardi sommi and persichi with many others nobles and populars his adherents and the city would have been wholly evacuated and abandoned if the citizens had not been dissuaded by sopramonte amato who went into the middle of the multitude exhorted them to stay and throw themselves on the mercy of the emperor whom he painted as pious and element and offered himself as one of the principal intercessors the people being comforted by his speech it was ordered that two hundred of the principal men should go to meet henry who hearing of the flight of cavalcabò and his adherents removed towards cremona and was already arrived at paderno eight miles distant from that city there he was found by the cremonians who had been sent with sopramonte amato and in miserable habits with their heads uncovered with naked feet and cords about their necks when they came before the emperor they fell upon their knees and cried out mercy misericordia and with tears and lamentations endeavored to recommend themselves and their country to the clemency of the conqueror such a spectacle of misery might have moved to compassion the heart of cruelty itself it had not however the force to move in the smallest degree to mercy the most inhuman soul of henry who with a cruelty more than barbarous rolling his eyes another way that he might not see them commanded with a voice of ferocity that they should be all sent to prison which was instantly executed by his ministers and they were soon after put to death henry entered cremona assembled the council and ordered that the walls of the city should be thrown down this order was executed and henry desired to have the houses demolished   0 but at the prayer of some of his lords and barons he was diverted from this malicious purpose but they could not hinder many from being burned by cremonian citizens who had been exiles for being of the ghibelline faction and who sought every cruel method of revenge for the injuries they had received the city was therefore filled with misery the germans and italians all robbed alike and nothing was heard but violence murder rapine and extortion the most rich were sure to be declared guilty and their estates to be confiscated at last the emperor came to the public palace and caused a most severe sentence to be published in which he condemned the cremonians to pay a hundred thousand golden florins confiscated the public revenue and ordered that the walls and bulwarks of the city should be ruined and the ditches filled up these hard conditions were accepted and the fulfilment of them sworn to by frederick artezaga syndic of the commons of cremona in whom was placed the government of the faction of ghibellines favored and exalted by the emperor who left one of his vicars and departed the guelphs thus ill treated now concerted another confederation and called in to their aid robert king of apulia into this league all the cities of romagna and tuscany entered the principal were florence lucca and siena and of those of lombardy bologna reggio and parma whose sovereign lord was giberto di correggio the torriani and the cavalcabòs with the rest of the milanese and cremonian exiles joined the confederacy and all these united after having made themselves masters of the bridge of dossolo over the pò took also casalmaggiore driving out the ghibellines william cavalcabò having learned that john castiglione podestà of cremona in the name of the emperor was gone with the militia to pozzobaronzo a place subject to the cremonians in which were some guelphs taking advantage of this opportunity flew with wonderful rapidity to cremona and entering the city by the gate della mosa arrived without opposition to the piazza where he was encountered by galeazzo visconti and manfredino pallavicino but these not being able to sustain the impetuosity of the soldiers of cavalcabò not without a great slaughter of ghibellines among whom giacomo redenasco was slain they betook themselves to flight and galeazzo saved himself in crema soon afterwards as an insurrection was expected     in cremona giberto di reggio went thither from parma where he was received with tokens of the greatest joy and having quieted with great prudence the controversies he established cavalcabò in the lordship of the city making quirico sanvitale his soninlaw podestà the inhabitants of soncino having also expelled the imperial governor surrendered to cavalcabò who fearing that the enemy would encamp at that post suddenly went thither with venturino benzone head of the guelphs of crema and with venturino fondulo one of the principal men of soncino the barbuoi and other families of soncino of the opposite faction having conveyed intelligence of this to the emperor he gave soncino to the count guarnero his general in lombardy who went and laid siege to the place there were in soncino besides the terrazzani the guelphs of cremona crema and bergamo and with the count guarnero besides the german troops were the ghibellines of cremona bergamo and crema the inhabitants of soncino defended themselves on the first assault with great activity encouraged by the valor of cavalcabò benzone and fondulo but seized with a panic upon some advantage gained by galeazzo visconti the soldiers who came to their assistance from cremona shamefully abandoned their defence and retreated into the houses cavalcabò seeing such cowardice or treachery consulted with benzone to get out of that place as soon as possible collecting their soldiers in a compact body they rushed into the midst of the enemy combating with wonderful intrepidity but cavalcabò being killed and benzone and venturino fondulo with his two sons made prisoners the ghibellines remained victorious benzone falling into the hands of the ghibellines of crema was miserably assassinated and fondulo with his two sons by the orders of guarnero was hanged before the gate of soncino the news of this defeat filled cremona with terror and confusion but giberto correggio with a company of parmesans coming in their fears subsided and the enemy having intelligence of this succor had not the courage to approach the walls the cremonians to recompense the benefit received from correggio gave him the government of the city for five years the guelphs took castellione in which was manfredino pallavicino who was made prisoner and castelnovo the mouth of the adda to the guelphs was taken by the ghibellines     passarino della torre had the government of cremona in      with the title of vicar of robert king of apulia giacopo cavalcabò marquis of viadana was in      by the common consent of the people elected to the government of cremona ponzino de ponzoni his brotherinlaw whether from private envy or republican jealousy was enraged beyond all measure at this and he stirred up insurrections against cavalcabò many other noble families the ponzoni the guazoni the amati and the picenardi who went out of cremona and made a league with the visconti and occasioned much mischief and ruin to their country against which they took up arms ponzino ponzone and all his adherents having made a league with cane della scala lord of verona and with passarino buonacossi lord of mantua came to cremona and laid siege to it but by the valor of those within they were repulsed yet they did much damage in the territory a peace or the appearance of a peace between those in the city and the exiles was then made and by common consent egidiolo piperaro was deputed to the government of the city with the title of abbate of the people and then the ponzoni with their partisans returned to the city the whole city in      arose in arms excited by giacopo and luigi cavalcabò and gregorio sommo and others their partisans of the guelph faction with whom were the brusati lords of brescia with all their followers these entering the great piazza of cremona slew egidiolo piperaro who had mounted the rostrum to still the tumult leonard and baccanino picenardi though one of them was a brotherinlaw of louis cavalcabò were both assassinated the pedecani malombra alemanni and others innumerable both of the noble and popular families of the ghibelline faction were murdered and the whole faction was in fact driven out of the city ponzone taking his flight with some others of the principal citizens who fled with him he was received into soncino by philip barbuò and soon obtained castellione and all the guelphs were driven out of both these places ponzone who had first holden with the guelph party now conjured up another faction by the name of the maltraversi of whom he was the head for every faction had its podestà little council and great council its king lords and commons and in a short time made himself master     of almost all the cremonese territories in the country finally the ghibellines and maltraversi made a coalition and constituting ponzino their head entered into close alliance with cane della scala lord of verona and passarino buonacossi lord of mantua and with matthew visconti vicargeneral of milan these came therefore to the assistance of the ghibellines and maltraversi against the guelphs in cremona cane and passarino with their people and matthew sent them luchino his son with the milanese cavalry and infantry with whom were some companies of pavians placentians parmesans bergamans and others from coma novara vercelli crema and monferrato all these people uniting together encamped against cremona the siege continued twentyeight days without any event of consequence excepting their depredations upon the territory in the country and destruction of all the estates of the guelphs      ponzone having made a breach in the wall entered the city with his ghibellines and maltraversi and reached the piazza without being discovered the guelphs when they saw him were astonished and fled and with them giacopo cavalcabò and gregorio sommo ponzone was proclaimed lord of cremona by the ghibellines and maltraversi at the same time the partisans of cavalcabò took robecco and went to olmeneta eight miles from cremona and ruined a certain tower of the zucchelli in which was niccolò borgo with some others of the faction of ponzone who upon hearing of the destruction of his friends went with a body of soldiers to those places and made much havoc among the people of cavalcabò giberto correggio captaingeneral of the guelph league with cavalcabò and all those of their faction broke down the walls of the city in      entered and by force of arms drove out the ghibellines and ponzino ponzone with his league of guelph maltraversi this ponzone appears to have joined any side as his circumstances gave him opportunity for in      he made a coalition with galeazzo visconti son of matthew and lord of placentia entered with the ghibelline faction by force of arms into cremona and drove away the cavalcabòs with all the real guelphs their partisans there was afterwards published a proclamation in the name of galeazzo that it should be lawful for all of     whatever faction to inhabit the city of cremona excepting the cavalcabòs and certain other citizens suspected of having concerted a plot against galeazzo and his partisans      alberto scotto of placentia head of the guelphs took the castle of malamorte which was on the bank of the po directly opposite to the city of cremona and more than three hundred ghibellines who were within were slain raimondo cardona was sent by the pope john xxii with a powerful army to the assistance of the guelphs who assembling all of his faction in lombardy went against galeazzo visconti and shutting him up in milan laid siege to it      louis iv of bavaria set up an antipope against john      louis confirmed to the cremonians all the privileges granted to them by his predecessors    0 guido de camilla imperial vicar had the government of the city and a truce was established between the community of cremona and gregory de sommi by which it appears that cremona was not at that time subjected to the visconti the city was governed by ghibellines who were the majority or predominant party and gregory sommo was one of the principal heads of the guelph party      azzo visconti son of galeazzo having made a peace with the cremonians gave them the dominion of crema which after the death of pope john had subjected itself to the visconti this year according to some historians the lordship of cremona was given by its inhabitants to the same azzo visconti      azzo visconti lord of cremona died without sons and to him succeeded in the dominion of milan and of cremona luchino visconti and john his brother who from bishop of novara was a little afterwards made archbishop of milan so that he became in that city lord both in spiritual and temporal affairs cremona enjoyed a state of tranquillity under the joint lordship of luchino and john the archbishop luchino visconti died in      and for his rare and excellent qualities very much regretted by the people his subjects he left no son and therefore the archbishop obtained the sole lordship of milan and cremona and of many other cities acquired by the virtue of luchino john and luchino had obtained     from benedict xii pope the title of vicars of the holy apostolical see    0 bernabò and galeazzo brothers of the visconti nephews of john the archbishop and lord of milan and cremona both married the first to regina della scala daughter of the lord of verona and vicenza and galeazzo married a sister of the duke of savoy named bianca john visconti archbishop and lord of milan after having greatly amplified his dominions died in      leaving as his heirs matthew bernabò and galeazzo sons of stephen his brother the extent of absolute dominion already acquired by this family over the ruins of so many commonwealths ruined by their unbalanced factions appears by the division made upon this occasion to matthew were assigned placentia lodi bologna massa lugo bobio pontremolo and borgo san donino to galeazzo the cities of como novara vercelli asti alba alessandria tortona castelnuovo di scrivia bassignana vigevano st angelo montebuono and mairano to bernabò were given cremona bergamo brescia crema valcamonica lonato with all the river dal lago di garda and other places

dower of a hundred thousand florins      violante daughter of galeazzo was married to a son of the king of england with another dower of a hundred thousand florins and an annual pension of twentyfour thousand more assigned upon some city of piedmont      isabella the first wife of john galeazzo conte di     virtù the firstborn son of galeazzo visconti before mentioned died and left an only daughter called valentina at this time bernabò gave great signs of an inhuman and cruel nature      la verde daughter of galeazzo was married to a son of the marquis of monferrato who was assassinated by his subjects she was then married by her father with a dispensation from the pope to a son of bernabò      galeazzo died and left two sons john galeazzo conte di virtú and azzo john galeazzo who was the eldest succeeded his father in the dominion of the state    0 catherine visconti daughter of bernabò was by her father married to john galeazzo conte di virtù her cousin with a dispensation from the pope      azzo died brother of john galeazzo to whom alone remained the government of their paternal state      cremona gave itself voluntarily to john galeazzo visconti conte di virtù under whose dominion came all the other cities and places subject to bernabò his uncle and fatherinlaw bernabò having been made a prisoner with ludovico and rodolfo his sons by the same john galeazzo who having learned from his wife the daughter of bernabò that her father had several times attempted to put him to death in order to rule alone resolved to relieve himself from anxiety and suspicion to this end he went to pavia and affected a retired life and pretended to go a pilgrimage to st mary del monte bernabò with his two sons went to meet him and all three were taken by the soldiers of john galeazzo and confined in the castle of trezzo where they all died of poison as it is supposed sent them by his nephew and soninlaw john galeazzo was immediately accepted by the milanese as their lord and the cremonians spontaneously gave themselves up to giacopo virino the captain and counsellor of the same john galeazzo and soon after sent sixteen ambassadors to milan with a capitulation which was accepted and confirmed by him article by article with some limitations the first article was that the city of cremona gave itself voluntarily and by a common concord of all the people      bianca mother of john galeazzo died and valentina his daughter by isabella his first wife was married to louis duke of orleans brother of charles vi king of france and this year was born john maria son of

dignity in      the duke obtained the domination of the city of pisa in   00 that of perugia and in   0  bologna   0  factions arose again in this province out of which were engendered seditions civil discords and rebellions by which john maria second duke of milan lost the ample dominion that had been left him by his father seditions arose in milan in which they expelled the ducal lieutenant which being understood by the other cities they all arose driving off the ducal officers john castiglione a milanese was then in cremona with the title of ducal vicar but he was now expelled by the fury of the people and at the same time john ponzone and ugolino cavalcabò marquis of viadana most noble and powerful citizens and heads of the factions of guelphs and maltraversi drove the ghibellines from the city and made themselves masters of it there followed at this time innumerable homicides and burnings of houses both in the city and country there not being a village in which there were not the two parties but passing over the horrid detail of particulars we may pass to the year   0  when ugolino cavalcabò having seized the dominion of cremona conceived suspicions of some of the principal citizens and caused their heads to be struck off as guilty of plotting against him and endeavoring to restore the city to the duke tyranny and cruelty are always the effect of such a state of affairs in all parties and the duke john maria grew every day more cruel he imprisoned his own mother catherine visconti in the castle of monza and caused her to be there strangled ugolino coming to battle near brescia with estore visconti was taken prisoner with marsilio and cæsar cavalcabò and many other citizens of their faction ugolino was     conducted to soncino and then to milan where he remained many months in prison and cabrino fondulo his captain saved himself in that conflict by flight to cremona the captivity of ugolino being known charles cavalcabò of the same family seized the government of cremona francesco gasoni a knight and heretofore podestà of cremona for ugolino cavalcabò and afterwards made captaingeneral in that city by charles his successor was beheaded for being suspected of holding a correspondence and concerting a conspiracy with estore visconti a league was published this year between charles cavalcabò pandolfo malatesta vignati lord of lodi and bartolomeo and paolo benzoni lords of crema and charles took piadena whose citadel was surrendered to him by william picenardo   0  the visconti castle was this year fortified by charles cavalcabò and ugolino escaping from prison went to mancastorma to find cabrino fondulo who came with him to cremona to enter into the castle in which was charles who had an understanding with fondulo ugolino was therefore received into the castle but his foot was scarcely within the gate before he was made prisoner for these people were not much more inclined to surrender their power to their own families than to strangers a little afterwards fondulo having fraudulently invited to supper with him in the castle of mancastorma charles and andreaso cavalcabò made them both prisoners and cruelly murdered them he came soon after to cremona with many armed men entered the castle and the other fortresses and made himself master of the city and of all the lands and castles possessed by cavalcabò except viadana which would not submit to him cabrino little grateful to that family by whom he had been elevated to an honorable rank defaced all the arms of the cavalcabòs which appeared in public places and miserably murdered ugolino by whom he had been made captain fondulo in   0  caused to be beheaded two sons of picenardo in the piazza of cremona and cast cruelly from the ruins of a tower two of the family of barbuò this year pandolfo the son of fondulo was born a truce made between the duke of milan and cabrino fondulo lord of cremona was renewed for four months       0  john maria duke of milan married in the city of brescia antonia daughter of malatesta lord of rimini cabrino fondulo caused to be burned john de sesto for having made false money and buried alive john lantero for having slandered cabrino he hanged lorenzo guazzoni and beheaded rubertino of the same family for having been found on the land of gazzo which had rebelled against him   0  another son was born to cabrino fondulo lord of cremona he had taken gazzo which had rebelled against him and destroyed it and was this year made a knight in the city of milan by bucicaldo governor of genoa for the king of france      john da terso lord of soncino was taken and assassinated by the people of cabrino near brescia and cabrino obtained from the inhabitants of soncino the land and fort      john maria visconti duke of milan while he was at mass was murdered by trivulzio guerrino and baruchino and other conspirators of several conspicuous families and estore visconti son of barnabas maternal grandfather of john maria was proclaimed by the conspirators lord of milan but these were driven out by philip maria lord of pavia brother of the deceased duke who entered milan with the forces of facino cane and estore being fled to monza was pursued by philip besieged fought and slain whereupon philip maria was proclaimed duke of milan and married beatrice formerly wife of facino cane and availed himself of her dower and of the soldiers of her late husband to recover the state from the hands of the tyrants who from the death of his father had possessed it at the end of this year a truce was made between the duke philip maria and cabrino fondulo      a confederation was made between fondulo malatesta the marquis of ferrara and philip arcelli lord of placentia on one part and philip maria duke of milan and his adherents on the other the friends of the duke were vignati lord of lodi rusca lord of como benzone lord of crema and orlando marquis pallavicino this convention lasted not long though it was made for two years      the duke philip maria having broken the truce and confederation sent his forces under carmagnuola his captaingeneral to commit depredations on the cremonians going   0 afterwards to placentia with part of his people he was met by cabrino lord of cremona with a few infantry of malatesta and defeated      philip maria duke of milan caused to be beheaded beatrice his wife for no other reason but because she was grown old and he was weary of her although he propagated against her suspicions of adultery      the count carmagnuola returned to the cremonian territory with the ducal army took castellione and all the other castles destroyed the vines and corn and laid siege to the city cabrino fondulo seeing that he could not resist the forces of the duke endeavored to sell the city of cremona to pandolfo malatesta but the duke sent carmagnuola upon the territory of brescia and soon had all its fortresses in his possession cabrino seeing that the assistance of malatesta would fail him began by the means of carmagnuola to treat of an agreement with philip maria who knowing the difficulty of taking the city from so powerful and sagacious a man as fondulo finally agreed with him    0 cabrino agreed with the duke to surrender cremona and all its country reserving only castellione of which he was invested in fee with the title of marquis by the duke for which he paid forty thousand ducats      the duke recovered genoa albenga savona and brescia      fondulo desirous of regaining the domination made an agreement with the florentines against the duke      the duke condemned to death cabrino fondulo and beheaded him the rest of this history may be consulted at leisure it was at this time and had been long an absolute monarchy while it was a republic it was a continual struggle between the families of pallavicini and doara cavalcabò and visconti ponzoni and cavalcabò visconti and fondulo the family of visconti acquired in lombardy a sovereignty like that of the medici in tuscany and by the same means and both because there was no balance in the governments and because the executive power and judiciary power were elected in the legislative assembly that is precisely because all authority was attempted to be     placed in the same centre is it worth while merely for the whistling of the name of a republic to undergo all the miseries and horrors cruelties tyrannies and crimes which are the natural and inevitable fruits of such a constitution     chapter ninth padua the elements and definitions in most of the arts and sciences are understood alike by men of education in all the nations of europe but in the science of legislation which is not one of the least importance to be understood there is a confusion of languages as if men were but lately come from babel scarcely any two writers much less nations agree in using words in the same sense such a latitude it is true allows a scope for politicians to speculate like merchants with false weights artificial credit or base money and to deceive the people by making the same word adored by one party and execrated by another the union of the people in any principle rule or system is thus rendered impossible because superstition prejudice habit and passions are so differently attached to words that you can scarcely make any nation understand itself the words monarchy aristocracy democracy king prince lords commons nobles patricians plebeians if carefully attended to will be found to be used in different senses perpetually by different nations by different writers in the same nation and even by the same writers in different pages the word king for example ask a frenchman what is a king his answer will be a man with a crown and sceptre throne and footstool anointed at rheims who has the making executing and interpreting of all laws ask an englishman his idea will comprehend the throne footstool crown sceptre and anointing with one third of the legislative power and the whole of the executive with an estate in his office to him and his heirs ask a pole and he tells you it is a magistrate chosen for life with scarcely any power at all ask an inhabitant of liege and he tells you it is a bishop and his office is only for life the word prince is another remarkable instance in venice it means the senate and sometimes by courtesy the doge whom some of the italian writers call a mere testa di legno in france the eldest sons of dukes are princes as well as the descendants of the blood royal in germany even the rhingraves     are princes and in russia several families not descended from nor allied to royal blood anciently obtained by grant of the sovereign the title of prince descendible to all their posterity the consequence of which has been that the number of princes in that country is at this day prodigious and the philosopher of geneva in imitation of the venetians professedly calls the executive power wherever lodged the prince how is it possible that whole nations should be made to comprehend the principles and rules of government until they shall learn to understand one anothers meaning by words but of all the words in all languages perhaps there has been none so much abused in this way as the words republic commonwealth and popular state in the rerumpublicarum collectio of which there are fifty and odd volumes and many of them very incorrect france spain and portugal the four great empires the babylonian persian greek and roman and even the ottoman are all denominated republics if indeed a republic signifies nothing but public affairs it is equally applicable to all nations and every kind of government despotisms monarchies aristocracies democracies and every possible or imaginable composition of them are all republics there is no doubt a public good and evil a commonwealth and a common impoverishment in all of them others define a republic to be a government of more than one this will exclude only the despotisms for a monarchy administered by laws requires at least magistrates to register them and consequently more than one person in the government some comprehend under the term only aristocracies and democracies and mixtures of these without any distinct executive power others again more rationally define a republic to signify only a government in which all men rich and poor magistrates and subjects officers and people masters and servants the first citizen and the last are equally subject to the laws this indeed appears to be the true and only true definition of a republic the word res every one knows signified in the roman language wealth riches property the word publicus quasi populicus and per syncope pôplicus signified public common belonging to the people res publica therefore was publica res the wealth riches or property of the people res populi and     the original meaning of the word republic could be no other than a government in which the property of the people predominated and governed and it had more relation to property than liberty it signified a government in which the property of the public or people and of every one of them was secured and protected by law this idea indeed implies liberty because property cannot be secure unless the man be at liberty to acquire use or part with it at his discretion and unless he have his personal liberty of life and limb motion and rest for that purpose it implies moreover that the property and liberty of all men not merely of a majority should be safe for the people or public comprehends more than a majority it comprehends all and every individual and the property of every citizen is a part of the public property as each citizen is a part of the public people or community the property therefore of every man has a share in government and is more powerful than any citizen or party of citizens it is governed only by the law there is however a peculiar sense in which the words republic commonwealth popular state are used by english and french writers who mean by them a democracy or rather a representative democracy a government in one centre and that centre the nation that is to say that centre a single assembly chosen at stated periods by the people and invested with the whole sovereignty the whole legislative executive and judicial power to be exercised in a body or by committees as they shall think proper this is the sense in which it was used by marchamont nedham and in this sense it has been constantly used from his time to ours even by writers of the most mathematical precision the most classical purity and extensive learning what other authority there may be for this use of those words is not known none has been found except in the following observations of portenari in which there are several other inaccuracies but they are here inserted chiefly because they employ the words republic commonwealth and popular state in the same sense with the english and french writers we may say with the philosopher  that six things are so necessary to a city that without them it cannot stand   the     first is provisions without which its inhabitants cannot live   the second is clothes habitations houses and other things which depend upon the arts without which civil and political life cannot subsist   the third is arms which are necessary to defend the city from its enemies and to repress the boldness of those who rebel against the laws   the fourth is money most necessary to a city in peace and in war   the fifth is the care of divine worship   the sixth is the administration of justice and the government of the people for the first are necessary cultivators of the land for the second artificers for the third soldiers for the fourth merchants and capitalists for the fifth priests for the sixth judges and magistrates seven sorts of men therefore are necessary to a city husbandmen artificers soldiers merchants rich men priests and judges but according to the same philosopher as in the body natural not all those things without which it is never found are parts of it but only instruments subservient to some uses as in animals the horns the nails the hair so not all those seven sorts of men are parts of the city but some of them namely the husbandmen the artificers and the merchants are only instruments useful to civil life as is thus demonstrated a city is constituted for felicity as to its ultimate end and human felicity here below is reposed according to the same philosopher in the operations of virtue and chiefly in the exertions of wisdom and prudence those men therefore are not parts of a city the operations of whom are not directed to those virtues such are the husbandmen who are occupied not in wisdom and prudence but in laboring the earth such are the artisans who fatigue themselves night and day to gain a livelihood for themselves and their poor families such finally are the merchants who watch and labor continually not in wisdom and prudence but in the acquisition of gold it is therefore clear that neither husbandmen artificers nor merchants are parts of a city nor ought to be numbered among the citizens but only as instruments which subserve certain uses and conveniences of the city we must pause here and admire the foregoing are not only the grave sentiments of portenari and of aristotle but     form the doctrine almost of the whole earth and of all mankind not only every despotism empire and monarchy in asia africa and europe but every aristocratical republic has adopted it in all its latitude there are only two or three of the smallest cantons in switzerland besides england who allow husbandmen artificers and merchants to be citizens or to have any voice or share in the government of the state or in the choice or appointment of any who have there is no doctrine and no fact which goes so far as this towards forfeiting to the human species the character of rational creatures is it not amazing that nations should have thus tamely surrendered themselves like so many flocks of sheep into the hands of shepherds whose great solicitude to devour the lambs the wool and the flesh scarcely leave them time to provide water or pasture for the animals or even shelter against the weather and the wolves it is indeed impossible that the several descriptions of men last enumerated should in a great nation and extensive territory ever assemble in a body to act in concert and the ancient method of taking the sense of an assembly of citizens in the capital as in rome for example for the sense of all the citizens of a whole republic or a large empire was very imperfect and extremely exposed to corruption but since the invention of representative assemblies much of that objection is removed though even that was no sufficient reason for excluding farmers merchants and artificers from the rights of citizens at present a husbandman merchant or artificer provided he has any small property by which he may be supposed to have a judgment and will of his own instead of depending for his daily bread on some patron or master is a sufficient judge of the qualifications of a person to represent him in the legislature a representative assembly fairly constituted and made an integral part of the sovereignty has power forever to control the rich and illustrious in another assembly and a court and king where there is a king this too is the only instrument by which the body of the people can act the only way in which their opinions can be known and collected the only means by which their wills can be united and their strength exerted according to any principle or continued system it is sometimes said that mobs are a good mode of expressing the sense the resentments and feelings of the people whig     mobs to be sure are meant but if the principle is once admitted liberty and the rights of mankind will infallibly be betrayed for it is giving liberty to tories and courtiers to excite mobs as well as to patriots and all history and experience shows that mobs are more easily excited by courtiers and princes than by more virtuous men and more honest friends of liberty it is often said too that farmers merchants and mechanics are too inattentive to public affairs and too patient under oppression this is undoubtedly true and will forever be so and what is worse the most sober industrious and peaceable of them will forever be the least attentive and the least disposed to exert themselves in hazardous and disagreeable efforts of resistance the only practicable method therefore of giving to farmers c the equal right of citizens and their proper weight and influence in society is by elections frequently repeated of a house of commons an assembly which shall be an essential part of the sovereignty the meanest understanding is equal to the duty of saying who is the man in his neighborhood whom he most esteems and loves best for his knowledge integrity and benevolence the understandings however of husbandmen merchants and mechanics are not always the meanest there arise in the course of human life many among them of the most splendid geniuses the most active and benevolent dispositions and most undaunted bravery the moral equality that nature has unalterably established among men gives these an undoubted right to have every road opened to them for advancement in life and in power that is open to any others these are the characters which will be discovered in popular elections and brought forward upon the stage where they may exert all their faculties and enjoy all the honors offices and commands both in peace and war of which they are capable the dogma of aristotle and the practice of the world is the most unphilosophical the most inhuman and cruel that can be conceived until this wicked position which is worse than the slavery of the ancient republics or modern west indies shall be held up to the derision and contempt the execration and horror of mankind it will be to little purpose to talk or write about liberty this doctrine of aristotle is the more extraordinary as it seems to be inconsistent with his great and common principles that     a happy life must arise from a course of virtue that virtue consists in a medium and that the middle life is the happiest in every city the people are divided into three sorts the very rich the very poor and the middle sort if it is admitted that the medium is the best it follows that even in point of fortune a mediocrity is preferable the middle state is most compliant to reason those who are very beautiful or strong or noble or rich or on the contrary those who are very poor weak or mean with difficulty obey reason the former are capricious  and flagitious the latter rascally and mean the crimes of each arising from their different excesses those who excel in riches friends and influence are not willing to submit to command or law this begins at home where they are brought up too delicately when boys to obey their preceptors the constant want of what the rich enjoy makes the poor too mean the poor know not how to command but are in the habit of being commanded too often as slaves the rich know not how to submit to any command nor do they know how to rule over freemen or to command others but despotically a city composed only of the rich and the poor consists but of masters and slaves not freemen where one party despise and the other hate where there is no possibility of friendship or political community which supposes affection it is the genius of a free city to be composed as much as possible of equals and equality will be best preserved when the greatest part of the inhabitants are in the middle state these will be best assured of safety as well as equality they will not covet nor steal as the poor do what belongs to the rich nor will what they have be coveted or stolen without plotting against any one or having any one plot against them they will live free from danger for which reason phocylides wisely wishes for the middle state as being most productive of happiness it is plain then that the most perfect community must be among those who are in the middle rank and those states are best instituted wherein these are a larger and more respectable part if possible than both the other     or if that cannot be at least than either of them separate so that being thrown into the balance it may prevent either scale from preponderating it is therefore the greatest happiness which the citizen can enjoy to possess a moderate and convenient fortune when some possess too much and others nothing at all the government must either be in the hands of the meanest rabble or else a pure oligarchy the middle state is best as being least liable to those seditions and insurrections which disturb the community and for the same reason extensive governments are least liable to these inconveniences for there those in the middle state are very numerous whereas in small ones it is easy to pass to the two extremes so as hardly to have any medium remaining but the one half rich and the other poor we ought to consider as a proof of this that the best lawgivers were those in the middle rank of life among whom was solon as is evident from his poems and lycurgus for he was not a king and charondas and indeed most others hence so many free states have changed either to democracies or oligarchies for whenever the number of those in the middle state has been too small those who were the more numerous whether the rich or the poor always overpowered them and assumed to themselves the administration when in consequence of their disputes and quarrels with each other either the rich get the better of the poor or the poor of the rich neither of them will establish a free state but as a record of their victory will form one which inclines to their own principles either a democracy or an oligarchy it is indeed an established custom of cities not to desire an equality but either to aspire to govern or when they are conquered to submit these are some of the wisest sentiments of aristotle but can you reconcile them with his other arbitrary doctrine and tyrannical exclusion of husbandmen merchants and tradesmen from the rank and rights of citizens these or at least those of them who have acquired property enough to be exempt from daily dependence on others are the real middling people and generally as honest and independent as any these however it must be confessed are too inattentive to public and national affairs and too apt to submit to oppression when they have been provoked beyond all bearing they have aimed at demolishing the government and when they have done that they have   0 sunk into their usual inattention and left others to erect a new one as rude and illmodelled as the former a representative assembly elected by them is the only way in which they can act in concert but they have always allowed themselves to be cheated by false imperfect partial and inadequate representations of themselves and have never had their full and proper share of power in a state but to proceed with portenari the other kinds of men says he namely the rich the soldiers the priests and the judges are parts of the city and properly citizens the first because riches are instruments for generating and conserving virtue in the citizens the second because it is necessary that military men besides the virtue of fortitude should be adorned with prudence to know the times and occasions proper for undertaking an enterprise the third because the priests ought to be examples of every virtue to the people and give themselves to the contemplation of divine things the fourth because the judges and rectors of a city to judge and govern rightly have occasion more than all the others for science and prudence which are the true lights and guides of human actions if these are proper arguments for admitting these descriptions of men into the order of citizens instead of being reasons for excluding merchants c they are of proportional weight for admitting them as to the form of government which is the other part of the animated city let us say with those wise men who have written of civil dominion and public administration as plato aristotle† polybius‡ plutarch§ and others∥ that the simple forms of good government are three to which are opposed three other forms of bad government the first form of good government is monarchy or kingship and is the absolute and independent dominion of one man alone who has for the ultimate end of his operations the public good and the best state of the city and who has the same relation to his subjects that the shepherd has to his flock and the father to his children such were the monarchies of the assyrians medes persians macedonians scythians egyptians and romans from the beginning of their     reign to the creation of the consuls and after the extinction of the roman republic under the empire of many cæsars to monarchy is opposed that form of government which is called tyranny in which one lords it alone who has no thoughts of the public good but whose aim is to depress and exterminate the citizens to whom he shows himself a monster rapacious after their property and a cruel wild beast after their lives such were phalaris in agrigentum† dionysius in syracuse‡ and nero in rome§ the second form of good government is aristocracy according to which the dominion is held by those who above all others are adorned with virtue prudence and benevolence who directing all their actions to the utility and common dignity of the city procure it a happy and blessed state this species of government is called also the regimen of the better sort optimates either because the best men of the city bear rule or because they look in all their operations to the best and most perfect state of the city this manner of government was used by the spartans to this form of government is opposed oligarchy which is a principality of the most rich and powerful who for the most part are few who by depressing and robbing of their property the less rich and crushing the poor with intolerable weight make a government full of arrogance and of violence and are like wolves among lambs such was the dominion of the triumvirs in rome who having oppressed the republic proscribed and put to death many good citizens and plundered their property exalting the seditious and perverse and abasing good men they distempered rome with their contagious wickedness and of a city the capital of the world they made it a den of robbers∥ the third form of good government not having a proper name was called by the greeks politeia and by the latins respublica names common to every species of government this is the dominion of the multitude namely—of the whole body of the city composed of all sorts of citizens rich and poor nobles and     plebeians wise and foolish which is also called a popular government all this body which contains men some endowed with prudence and wisdom some inclined to virtue and persuadable to all good works by the conversation and familiarity which they have with the prudent and learned employ all their care labor and industry to the end that the city flourish in all those things which are necessary and convenient for living well and happily such as was at one time the government of the athenians to this species of good government is opposed democracy according to which the most abject plebeians and the vilest vulgar hold the domination for their own private interest by which they oppress the rich and the noble and aggrandize and enrich the poor and the ignoble as the two brothers the gracchi began to do in rome† three therefore are the simple forms of good government monarchy aristocracy and that which by a common name is called a republic and from these mixed together four others may result the first is compounded of all the three as was that of the lacædemonians instituted by lycurgus‡ who selecting the good from the three former composed out of them one of the most perfect kind such also was the roman republic§ in which the power of the consuls was like the regal authority that of the senate was aristocratical and that of the people resembled the popular state the second form of mixed government is composed of monarchy and aristocracy such as according to some is the most serene republic of venice∥ in which the annual podestàs have a power similar to a regal authority and the senate are an assembly or collection of the optimates although others contend that it is a perfect aristocracy the third is mixed of a monarchy and a republic and the fourth of a republic and an aristocracy of which two species of mixed government we have no examples to allege but to return to the three simple forms it is the common opinion of the learned¶ that monarchy holds the first rank     above all others resembling the power of god almighty who alone governs the world resembling the heart which alone vivifies all the parts of the animal and resembling the sun which alone illuminates the celestial bodies as well as the lower world it is very true that to a monarchy ought to be elevated only that citizen according to the philosopher who exceeding others in the ordinary course in riches wisdom prudence and benevolence is like a god upon earth such as would be the man who should be adorned with heroic virtue according to which performing all the labors of virtue in the utmost perfection and supreme excellency he would appear to be not the son of a mortal† but of god but it being impossible or at least most difficult to find a man so rare it has happened that laying aside monarchy the philosophers have disputed which of the other two forms of good government is better accommodated more practicable and more profitable for the regimen of cities and of peoples some were of opinion that this praise was due to an aristocracy nevertheless aristotle confutes them because in the aristocratical government the magistracies and the honors being always in the hands of a few there is great danger that the multitude perpetually excluded from public management should be tumultuous and conspire against the lives of the principal men to the great damage of the whole city because in these revolts the force and violence of the people regard friends no more than enemies it is mad and most horribly pillages murders and abuses all that comes in its way it remains then that the third species of good government which is the popular government in which the citizens alternately command and obey must be the most useful and better adjusted to the nature of man in whose soul the divinity has stamped the desire of ruling with such limitations and temperaments however as says the same philosopher that the vile plebeians may not have magistrates appointed for their ignorance and imprudence which are the two fountains of all civil calamities but that the plebeians may not be totally despised and that all occasion of insurrections may be taken away power should be given them of joining with the other citizens in the election of magistrates and of calling them to account for their administration     all these opinions appear to be not unbecoming for although the plebeians be not qualified of themselves to judge who are fit for the administration of the affairs of the city and to know the failings of those who have governed nevertheless by the conversation and practice which they have in such things with the wise men it is presumed that from daily intercourse with these and from common fame and public reputation which daily circulates concerning men who are wise and good in government they may have so much light that they may discern the apt from the inept and good behavior from bad this may suffice to have said concerning the different forms of government according to the writers before cited in order to explain the following account of the form of government in padua and the various changes it passed through in the four hundred and fiftysecond year of the christian era padua was miserably destroyed by attila king of the huns the paduans who then fled for safety to the islands in the adriatic could not return for fifty years to rebuild their city for the many armies of barbarians who infested italy till     when theodoric king of the ostrogoths killed odoacer king of the heruli and remained unrivalled in the dominion of italy but justinian the emperor having in     sent belisarius and afterwards in     narses to drive away the goths from italy padua in that war which lasted with alternate victories and defeats of the goths and the greeks eighteen years was subjected sometimes by one and sometimes by the other afterwards under the government of exarchs till  0  it was a second time burned and destroyed by aginulphus king of the lombards it was afterwards restored by the paduans assisted by the venetians and remained under the dominion of the lombards till they were exterminated by charlemagne king of france in     it became subject to the kings of france of the race of charlemagne and after them to the berengarii and finally to the emperors of germany from otho i to henry the fourth according to the german and the third according to the italian historians in a word padua lived under foreign law six hundred and twentynine years namely—from     to  0   thirtythree years before which period namely—in  0   a few rays of liberty began     to dawn because the emperor henry iii as appears by public instruments preserved in the archives of the cathedral of padua granted for the repose of his soul and that of agnese his wife to bernard maltravers bishop of padua the prerogative of coining money building fortresses and castles with towers and ramparts erecting mills and to be as it were prince of the city afterwards henry iv his son at the solicitation of the queen bertha his wife and on account of the prayers of milo bishop of padua his relation gave liberty in  0   to the paduans conceding to them that for the future they might live according to their own laws and have a triumphal chariot carroccio which was the principal sign of a free city this carroccio for a perpetual memorial of the benefit received by the intercession of queen bertha was called by the paduans by her name henry also granted them the faculty of making of the body of their nobility a senate who for the government of the city created annually two consuls† there was therefore formed a government mixed of monarchy and aristocracy says the historian of monarchy because the consuls according to the manner of kings had the power of life and death and of aristocracy because the senate exclusively of the plebeians was composed only of patricians or nobles these as the desire of enlarging dominion is insatiable not contented to have the government of the city procured partly by imperial grants and partly by other means jurisdiction of blood in their castles situated in the country of padua assuming the titles of proceri peers or barons and a little afterwards the yet higher ones of marquises counts and castellans padua was ruled by this form of government about eighty years in peace and tranquillity but peace being the nurse of riches and riches of ambition the consular dignity began to be ardently desired by all men and caballed for by every artifice in the progress of these contests as one would not give way to another and as it all depended on a few of the most powerful the city became divided into factions which finally in      came to arms and civil wars ensued which for some years filled the city with slaughter burnings revolt and confusion so that the consulate     becoming feeble was now intermitted and then exercised according as the power of different parties prevailed but finally this magistracy serving no longer for the maintenance of the public good but merely as an instrument of revenge against enemies and having become most pernicious not less to the plebeians than to the patricians was in      abrogated and totally extinguished the good government  composed of monarchy and aristocracy as our author calls it though nobody will agree with him in opinion at this day being changed by the malice of men into the bad one of oligarchy and this by its noxious qualities being in a short time annihilated there arose another species of government mixed of monarchy and a republic in this form—the paduans instituted four councils the first was of eighteen whom they called the anziani three of whom were drawn by lot every three months they were afterwards reduced to the number of sixteen and then drawn to the number of four every four months the office of these magistrates was together with the podestà to exert themselves with all their influence and power to conciliate and appease all discords and dissensions among the citizens not only in civil affairs but in criminal prosecutions to see that the decrees of the senate regarding the public utility were observed that the buildings going to decay should be rebuilt or repaired that the streets public roads and walks should be kept in order free and unincumbered with obstructions that in the principal quarters of the city instruments should be provided for extinguishing or preventing the progress of fire such as buckets vessels and ropes for drawing water ladders hatchets pickaxes iron bars c and finally to suggest to the other councils all those things which might be of public utility and that they might be enabled to do this all public letters from foreign princes and from all magistrates within the dominion of padua were read in their presence no man was admitted to this council of the anziani who was not a paduan by birth and an inhabitant of the city for at least thirty years without interruption and who had not a foundation of property among his fellow citizens of at least two hundred pounds a year the second council was called the lesser which at first consisted     of forty citizens partly noble and partly plebeian but afterwards was increased to the number of sixty the authority of this council was such that nothing could be treated in the greater council if it were not first discussed and agitated here and from hence proposed to the greater council the mode of discussing and consulting upon business was by the way of orations or harangues made by the senators after which they proceeded to a vote and two thirds of the suffrages determined the question this rule was also observed in the greater council this council was changed every four months and the senators who had once been in it must be excluded for eight months father and son brothers and uncle and nephew were not permitted to sit together in it to be of this council it was necessary to be a paduan born to have a father who was a paduan born to have inhabited in padua with a family at least for forty years continually to have an estate of fifty pounds income and to have served in the ordinary charges of the commons of the city the third council was called the greater council and parliament it was at first of three hundred senators one moiety nobles and the other moiety plebeians it was afterwards increased to the number of six hundred and finally in      to a thousand the magistrates were chosen and all affairs relative to peace and war were debated in it by these two councils the greater and the less were made at divers times various municipal laws and statutes of which by a determination of      four copies were made the first was deposited in the monastery of st benedict the second in that of st john the third in that of st mary and the fourth in that of the fathers of st mary di porciglia the fourth and last council was common to all the people of the city into which the doors being open every one might enter but this council was very seldom assembled and never but for things of the utmost importance the paduans desirous of providing a remedy against the disorders and mischiefs occasioned by the consulate and to extinguish in the citizens all occasions of ambition to enjoy the government of the city invented the annual magistrate of the podestà which was the best medicine that could be thought of by them to cure the disorders already felt and prevent the greater that were apprehended they established     therefore as ruler of the city a person who should be a foreigner of noble blood and excellent reputation for virtue who by the weight and eminence of his authority in cases of life and death and from his superintendence over all the judicial authority civil and criminal from the more absolute obedience paid him as the supreme head of all the other magistracies of the patricians of the plebeians and of the rustics and in a word from his absolute power as it is called over the city and its territory was called by way of eminence by the name of podestà this manner of government continued happily enough as it is said till      when the city was subjected by ezzelino da romano who most terribly afflicted and most cruelly tormented it for the space of nineteen years in which time there was no sort of torment inhumanity or cruelty which it did not suffer from that infernal monster during whose tyranny that most malignant pestilence the factions of guelphs and ghibellines which under the names of the imperial party and the party of the church infected many cities of italy among others distempered pistoia and did inestimable mischief before we pass on it may be well for the more complete information concerning this magistrate of the podestà to relate a few particulars the podestà was obliged three months before the end of his government which lasted one year to assemble the greater council and cause to be elected eight citizens four noble and four plebeian of more than thirty years of age these elected twelve senators of the same council and of the same age six of the patricians and six plebeians who in like manner elected eight others of the same council age and condition the office of whom was to elect the new podestà these were shut up together in one apartment and could not speak to any one or have more than one repast a day that they might the sooner agree in the nomination of three personages who were afterwards carried to the greater council who proceeded to the election in this manner all three were separately balloted for and he who had the most suffrages was the new podestà he who had the next number of votes held the second place and he who had fewest the last in such election the syndic of the city was sent in haste with public letters to him who had been honored with most votes who if he accepted the charge was understood to be podestà but if in four days he did not accept it the syndic     was sent to the second and if he refused the third was sent to and if he declined a new election was made of other three persons and of the acceptance or refusal of these a record was made by a notary this method of electing the podestà was changed in      whereby the examination of the subjects fit for the post was committed to the lesser council the election of whom afterwards was made by the greater council with this condition however by virtue of a statute made in      that the electors of the present podestà could not have a vote in the election of the subsequent podestà no man could be elected podestà who had in padua relations by consanguinity or affinity within the fourth degree nor who had been banished from his country for forgery or treason and this was also understood of the court or retinue which the podestà brought with him which consisted of four judges or assessors two lieutenants of police and some other constables the office of the first judge was to assist the podestà in all things belonging to the government of the city the other three judges had the charge of hearing and trying the criminal causes each one for three months which was ordained to remove all occasion of suspicion that the accused by length of time might possibly corrupt the judges but these orders were afterwards changed and it was resolved that the first judge who must be an eminent doctor of laws should be the vicar of the podestà that the second should judge criminal causes the third should have the charge of the provisions and that the fourth should be questor and receiver of the public money the podestà judges and lieutenants could not have with them in padua their wives nor other ladies their relations unless for fifteen days on occasion of sickness nor even their brothers sons or nephews above twelve years of age nor servants who were paduans the podestà was obliged to bring with him his two lieutenants twelve bailiffs twelve horses twelve valets and servants and to maintain all this family and these horses at his expense for the public service of the city his salary was two thousand five hundred lire a year and was afterwards increased to four thousand the podestà was required to come to padua eight days at least before possession was given him of the post in which time he was obliged to take the oath of office namely—to swear that he with his judges would govern without ambition and justly and that they   0 would give the greatest attention to the affairs of the public and with all their power would conciliate and pacify the controversies and discords of the citizens the podestarate began on the first of july but in    0 it was decreed to begin the first of january this magistracy at first continued for a year but in      a law was made that it should endure only six months and that two podestàs should be created each year one of whom should begin his administration with january the other with july which law was observed as long as the republic of padua remained but after padua became subject now to the emperor henry vii now to frederic duke of austria now to his brother henry duke of carinthia now to the scaligeri lords of verona then to the duke of milan and finally to the carrara family this custom of two podestàs went into desuetude the podestà when once in possession of his office was bound to execute the following orders—first in the space of eight days to cause to be read and afterwards to cause to be punctually observed the papal constitutions against heretics secondly to reside continually in the city and rule it until the arrival of a successor thirdly during the whole time of his administration to hear the causes of all persons indifferently to which end the gates of the palace except at the hour of dinner always stood open fourthly that together with the anziani he should use all his endeavors that the canonicates and the other ecclesiastical benefices of the bishopric and diocese of padua should be conferred on citizens of padua or of the district fifthly to elect eight citizens men of prudence and experience two for each quarter who should make choice of four or five hundred able men who when they should hear the sound of the palace bell were to come armed under their standards to the palace of the pretor and to the piazza del vino for the defence of the podestà sixthly to give orders that at the sound of the great bell of the tower of the palace all the citizens and inhabitants of padua from sixteen to sixty years of age should run armed to the piazza to defend the common liberty seventhly to create a captain who with some soldiers should have the custody of the city and its suburbs eighthly to hold night and day guards at the gates of the city ninthly to give orders that in the city and in the suburbs should be kept crossbows and other weapons to exercise the soldiers tenthly to cause to be enrolled in the militia many     men of the villages who according to occurrences should come armed to the city eleventhly in all great tumults to order into the piazza the standard of the community in which case all the gastaldi of the arts at the sound of the bells of the palace were held to go to the piazza del vino with the men under their command armed ready to obey whatever orders the podestà should issue and there assemble to be formed into a body under the ensign of the community which could not depart from the piazza without the express command of the podestà himself for whose guard there were always five hundred soldiers chosen one hundred from the body of the patricians and four hundred from the plebeians and distinguished into four squadrons under four standards twelfthly that for eight days before the arrival of a successor the podestà cannot give sentence in civil or criminal causes thirteenthly that having finished his podestarate he his assessors and court should remain fourteen days in padua to render an account before the syndic of their administration which is done in this manner—for the first three days it was lawful to every one to accuse the podestà assessors and court before the syndics of any wrongs or injuries done them in the eight following days these complaints were determined by the votes of the major part of the syndics and if by the multitude of complaints or by differences of opinions among the syndics or through other reasons the business could not be finished three other days were added in which the syndics were obliged to determine it from the defence against the complaints made of the podestà all his favorites friends and relations were excluded and all advocates his own judges and assessors were alone admitted and were thought sufficient for his defence at the end of the fourteenth day the podestà might depart with his family he could not be confirmed in the post for the next year nor for the five following years neither himself nor any of his relations could hold any office dignity or honors in the city of padua and this was understood of the assessors lieutenants of police and other officers but this statute was very often not observed as population augmented and causes and controversies multiplied and therefore the podestà and his assessors could not determine the whole certain other judges were instituted and called judges of the lower courts and were distinguished from each other by the names of animals for the most part as     the bear the horse the leopard and others for the suits arising between relations two judges were instituted as arbitrators who in the space of two months were to give sentence and terminate the controversy and if they could not agree they called in ten jurors for each party and if these disagreed the podestà himself in the space of fifteen days sat in judgment with the rest and decided the cause  as to the government of the territory it is to be observed that some of the most rich and powerful citizens of padua had the name of proceres noblemen or barons and in some of their landed estates and places they exercised the jurisdiction of blood that is the power of life and death and to ennoble their dominions manors or lordships with the magnificence of titles in the year      they distinguished themselves into marquises counts and castellans the lords of este were entitled marquises the lords of anguillara abano arquà baone bibano borgoricco calaone rusta and cerro calcinara caldenazzo candiana carturo castelnuovo cortaloro fontaniva honara limena lozzo montebello montebuso montemerlo and mandria nono and piazzola were called counts the lords of carrara camposanpiero montagnone peraga pievedisacco publica revolone ronchi de campanili stra selvazzano tertula tribano and galzignano noventa treville and villa nova were denominated castellans but the castellan of selvazzano having caused the eyes of a certain woman to be put out for theft who afterwards came deprived of her eyes to padua the cruelty of this action displeased the republic so much that in the year   00 a law was made that under pain of death no man should for the future exercise any jurisdiction in the territory of padua which law was reënacted and confirmed in   0  the jurisdiction of life and death and all other jurisdiction being taken away from these grandees magnati the whole territory was governed by the podestà of padua and afterwards in the course of time the republic of padua sent a podestà into the following districts of land namely—conselve lonigo montagnana and twentyfour other districts the custom of sending podestàs into those districts continued till    0 when a statute was made that places which were not walled should not have a podestà but that into some of them vicars only should be sent     such then was the government of padua from the year      to the tyranny of ezzelino mixed of monarchy and a republic and this constitution was restored after the delivery of the city from that fierce and cruel oppression and lasted happily for fifty years with a remarkable increase of the city in riches and power and it would have lasted much longer if the cursed factions of ghibellines and guelphs had not disturbed the peace of the citizens which afterwards by little and little after the fashion of poison creeping in their hearts afflicted the city to such a degree that at last in the year      it took away their vital spirits depriving them of their beloved liberty the parties of ghibellines and guelphs under the names of the empire and the church sown in the hearts of men by the enemy of the human race had poisoned italy and distempered the city of padua so says the historian and without denying to the devil his share in the instigation of all such party distinctions and animosities it must be still insisted on that the essential defect in the constitution of every italian republic was the greatest cause and the instrument with which the infernal agent wrought the parties of rich and poor of gentlemen and simplemen unbalanced by some third power will always look out for foreign aid and never be at a loss for names pretexts and distinctions whig and tory constitutionalist and republican anglomane and francomane athenian and spartan will serve the purpose as well as guelph and ghibelline the great desideratum in a government is a distinct executive power of sufficient strength and weight to compel both these parties in turn to submit to the laws the mischiefs of these contagious parties were greatest under the tyranny of ezzelino who being standardbearer and head of the imperial or ghibelline party exerted all his force to extirpate the guelph party followed by the people and a great part of the patricians after his death the guelph party rose and with all their power persecuted the ghibellines driving them from the city and spoiling them of all their goods and as the plebeians of padua were devoted to the guelph party whether from their natural inclinations or because the guelphs had delivered the city from the empire of ezzelino upon this occasion certain profligate popular men made through their favor heads     of the guelph faction became proud arrogant and presumptuous desiring that all the affairs of the republic should depend upon their will but suspecting that some of the principal gentlemen to whom although guelphs so much pride had become disgusting would oppose their ambitious enterprises they gave the plebeians to understand that those gentlemen intended to make themselves sole masters of the government so great a commotion was excited that the plebeians who servile in adverse fortune as insolent in prosperity demanded in a turbulent manner and obtained by threats of force the institution of a magistrate according to the usage of the roman republic like a tribune of the people the paduans called these magistrates gastaldi dell arti who should defend the rights of the plebeians and have authority to rescind all those determinations of the senate as was the custom in rome which could occasion any prejudice to the jurisdiction of the plebeians wherefore in testimony of the power granted to the tribunes it was in      ordained by a decree of the senate that every podestà in the beginning of his administration should consign to each of the gastaldi of the arts the standard of that art and this tribunitian magistracy advancing every day in power caused to be made in its favor in the year      a statute that on the first sunday in every month the gastaldi should all assemble in the church of the palace of the commons and treat fully of all things that belonged to the state of the city the whole government of the city by this alteration devolved into the hands of the tribunes because as has been said before they annulled or confirmed at their pleasure the determinations of the greater council and because they carried up to the council whatever they had concluded among themselves with a certainty of obtaining their concurrence by the dependence which they had upon the popular  senators and also upon the less powerful of the noble senators whose devotion they had secured by electing them to the honors of the city and by assuming some of them into the number of the tribunes from which magistracy as universally from all the greater honors they always most arbitrarily excluded the most powerful from this disorderly and violent domination of the tribunes     who had for the most part greatly enriched themselves grew intestine hatreds and terrible seditions between the first class of persons and the heads of the popular party with whom the patricians of middling power exalted by the people to honors joined and finally some of the gentlemen and most powerful patricians not being able any longer to bear to be neglected by the tribunitian power took up arms killed the principal heads and defenders of the plebeians and so far intimidated those patricians who adhered to the plebeians that after many engagements and a profuse effusion of blood the tribuneship of the people was abolished in the year      and the government and the public authority were transferred to the patricians excluding totally the plebeians these in order to keep down the ghibellines increased the senate which from the time of the extinction of the house of honara had been only of three hundred members to the number of a thousand incorporating seven hundred guelphs and wishing that all questions and matters relative to peace or war should depend wholly on the guelph faction and the better to establish the superiority of their party they instituted another council wholly of guelphs which had authority to approve or reject the decrees of the greater senate from the body of this lesser council were created the four anziani conservators of liberty and eight secretaries for the care of the city this mode of government continued till the year      when padua began to lose her liberty which she afterwards wholly lost remaining subject sometimes to the germans sometimes to the scaligeri sometimes to the carrari until finally after infinite calamities she was benignly received into the pious bosom of the most serene republic of venice in the year   0  such as has been related were the vicissitudes of the government of the city of padua after the tyranny of ezzelino which may be recapitulated thus according to the historian at first it was a mixture of monarchy and a republic afterwards it was changed into a democracy for such he denominates the tribuneship of the plebeians in which the people attempted the abasement and annihilation of the grandees and finally it terminated in a government mixed of monarchy and aristocracy having the senate of the optimates and creating the podestà annually     for the major part of the time from  0   to      it was governed by one or other of the two best species of mixed government as our historian thought which are composed of monarchy and aristocracy and of monarchy and a republic  this sovereignty of padua was for the most part in one assembly for although a check was aimed at by the law that nothing should be done in the great council which had not been previously debated in the little council yet when any thing was proposed by the latter to the former they sat together and voted as one assembly at some times the sovereignty was clearly in one assembly of optimates or patricians at another in one assembly of plebeians as that of the tribunes was at last two assemblies were formed with each a negative but there being no third power to mediate between them no balance could be formed or maintained between them at no time had the monarchical power either under the consuls anziani or podestàs a negative for though the podestà was an office of great dignity and splendor he never had the whole executive power nor a negative on the legislative the nobles and commons were mixed together in both councils and the executive power the appointment of officers c was always in one or other of the assemblies and the consequence was instability to the laws insecurity to life liberty and property constant rivalry between the principal families particularly the scaligeri and carrari which ended in conquest and subjection to venice from   0  to      the government of consuls continued from      to      the government of podestàs under the republic of padua from      to      the tyranny of ezzelino     was supported from      to      the government of podestàs under the republic was revived and maintained from      to      they had two podestàs in      gerardo de gl inzola da parma was imperial vicar for the emperor henry vii to whom the paduans began to yield obedience though they rebelled again this year against his authority and the podestàs and republic were revived and continued till      in which year giacomo grande da carrara was made the first lord of padua he governed one year and three months and then renounced the dominion and died in      in      a podestà again for one year in    0 the city of padua to deliver itself from the siege of cane scaligero lord of verona gave itself to frederic iii emperor and duke of austria who afterwards gave it to his brother henry duke of carinthia under whom they were governed by podestàs who were at the same time imperial vicars till      the podestà of this year was dismissed by marsilio da carrara who had been elected by the people lord of padua who however made pietro de i rossi of parma podestà but he not being able longer to resist in the war with cane della scala married tadea daughter of giacomo grande da carrara first lord of padua to mastino dalla scala nephew of cane giving him padua in dower from      to      padua was governed by podestàs under the dominion of the scaligers in      marsilio da carrara having expelled the scaligers was made the second lord of padua and governed in      in      marsilio da carrara second lord of padua died and to him succeeded ubertino da carrara third lord of padua from      to      the government of podestàs continued under the princes carrara in      ubertino da carrara third lord of padua being sick caused to be elected for his successor marsilietto papafava da carrara who was the fourth lord of padua and died but the same year marsilietto was killed by giacomo da carrara who became the fifth lord of padua and under him the government of podestàs continued till    0 when giacomo da carrara the fifth lord of padua was assassinated by william da carrara a natural son of giacomo grande the first lord to whom succeeded giacobino da carrara his brother the sixth lord and francesco da carrara surnamed the old his son and seventh lord of padua under these the government by podestàs continued till      when francesco da carrara the     old imprisoned his uncle giacobino da carrara because he had conspired his death and reigned lord alone till      when francesco da carrara renounced the dominion of this city to his son francesco da carrara called the new eighth and last lord of padua the same year in november both the father and the son were deprived of the government of this state by john galeazzo visconti first duke of milan who governed it by podestàs for the years      and      when francesco da carrara called the new drove out the people of the duke of milan and recovered padua and its district except bossano from    0 podestàs were continued till   0  when the carrara were conquered and padua admitted into the republic of venice in      francesco da carrara surnamed the old seventh lord of padua died in a prison in monza to which he had been sent by john galeazzo visconti duke of milan     chapter tenth mantua—montepulciano equicola  concurs with leonardo aretino and all the other italian writers in his account of the antiquity riches and power of the tuscans etruscans etrurians tyrrhenians or dodecapoli for by all these names they were known their original emigration from lydia their government of lucumoni their twelve confederated peoples their subjection in a course of time to the romans goths lombards and charlemagne who for his merit was in the year  00 created emperor with the titles of cæsar and augustus by the pope leo iii who understood the effect upon the minds of the people of words and titles so anciently beloved as well as dreaded in italy he gave him also the title of great which had been before given only to three princes alexander pompey and constantine the authority which the roman senate and people had anciently exercised of electing and confirming the emperors was now by charlemagne transferred to the roman pontificate and to prevent seditions the power of confirming the pontiff was given to the emperor a promising alliance afterwards gregory v in  00  ordained a constitution which continues to this time that the election of future emperors should be free in the power of the germans and the ecclesiastical and temporal electorates were then created in     mantua fell into discords threw off her subjection to matilda and assumed an independence but being besieged and reduced to great distress was obliged in      to submit again to that princess sigebert an enterprising man took the opportunity of the troubles in italy to aggrandize himself and going from lucca he made himself lord of parma and reggio he was a lombard   0 by descent and was prefect or lord of the aforesaid city sigebert had three sons sigebert ii atto and gerardo two of them died and atto alone remained who by the change of the letters was afterwards called azzo he fortified canossa in reggiano and dwelt there as his principal seat whence his descendants were called da canossa he had two sons the first of whom was named tedaldo and the other uniting the names of his grandfather and father was called sigebertazzo although it was afterwards corruptly called albertazzo this person was sent into germany and recommended himself to otho the emperor so effectually as to obtain a grant for his services of calaone monselice montagnana arqui and este with the title of marquis he married alda a natural daughter of the emperor from this match there issued two sons ugo and folco the latter remained in germany with his mother ugo came into italy with his father and succeeded to the lands above mentioned and to the marquisate of este from this ugo are descended the illustrious lords of the house of este who reigned so long in ferrara and from them were descended the family that was called the canossi of verona there were in mantua in      four most powerful families and four others their adherents of somewhat less influence the bonacossi and grossolani inhabited one quarter the arlotti and the poltroni another these not long before had driven out the calorosi in a third quarter were the casaloldi and those of riva and in the fourth the zenacalli and the gaffari the government was as in all the other cities of italy in one centre a general council who first appointed consuls then podestàs then gonfaloniers captains of the people c which produced the usual struggles for power in the year      the gaffari entered into a secret conspiracy to deliver the city of mantua into the hands of the estensi lords of ferrara the treason was discovered those who saved their lives by flight were banished forever and the others instantly put to death and the houses of all who were accomplices or privy to the crime were burnt and demolished the power of individual citizens increased every day and parties and factions in consequence the podestà though a foreigner was usually appointed to that office administered its functions according to the will and pleasure of a small number of the principal men justice     was oppressed by power and equity gave way to violence in such a tumult of the factious the prudent men called a convention to deliberate on a new form of government some were for ephori as in sparta others for cosmi as in crete others for suffetes as in carthage but the most were for hypati as in greece or rather for two consuls as in rome two magistrates were therefore created and that they might be sure to guard against ambition they must be chosen in rotation every six months two at a time from each of the four quarters of the city these were to be called captains of the people and were to be the protectors of the plebeians and defenders of their liberties two magistrates therefore from the body of the nobility were elected in the nature of tribunes of the people and those were pinamonte of the family of bonacossi and ottonello of that of zenecalli in the year      these had not continued one month in office together before such animosities arose between the two families that zenecalli was treacherously called in the night into the palace of bonacossi under pretence of consulting upon some sudden affair of the last importance and there murdered the next morning bonacossi called together the principal nobility and with fictitious grief and pharisaical tears communicated the fact and exhorted the people to revenge wishing that every one might believe that the deceased magistrate had been assaulted and put to death by some private enemy an inquiry was ordered which engaged so much attention and took up so much time that no man spoke of any successor and therefore pinamonte governed alone the scramble for power was as yet altogether among the gentlemen benvenuto da imola in his commentaries upon dante where he discourses of mantua writes that this city had been inhabited by gentlemen of riva of mercaria and of the casaloldi and that bonacossi had agreed with these houses to expel from the city every other nobleman and that afterwards forming a particular agreement with two of them he drove out the third and then uniting with the casaloldi he banished the     second and finally driving out the casaloldi he remained alone and by artifice assisted with force continued without a colleague in the magistracy and taking for his podestà alberto della scala for a stricter union he obtained the place of podestà in verona for giannino de bonacossi not failing to maintain a good intelligence with the marquis of este by all these arrangements he easily obtained from his followers the prolongation of his own power for another six months and when he had thus laid his foundations sufficiently strong to support any edifice he assumed the title of captaingeneral these encroachments were very uneasily supported by the nobles who perceived that from free citizens they were become by little and little the subjects of a tyrant whereupon the arlotti the casaloldi the agnelli and the grossolani conspired together to throw off the yoke but pinamonte being informed of the plot on the very day on which it was to have been executed and being well prepared fell unexpectedly on the conspirators separately a part of whom he took prisoners others were killed many wounded and the great multitude saved themselves by flight many suspected persons were sent out of their beloved home and confined in various places pinamonte did not cease to persecute his adversaries until all things in the city appeared to be quieted under his dominion the miserable mantuans were dispersed in various places and particularly in gonzaga but the tyrant had the art to hold out temptations of lands restitution of property and restoration to their country to these till they surrendered to him that gonzaga which had often defended itself both against popes and emperors pinamonte then established a friendship with venice and padua but was interrupted in his career in      by death the family of bonacossi with pinamonte at their head had by forming a popularity among the vilest plebeians been able to expel the other noble families and make themselves absolute so complete was their ascendency over the minds of the rabble that upon the death of pinamonte the minority were not able to obtain any regular election or rational reform of the government but bardello bonacossi was set up by his party for a successor a man universally hated a monster without virtue wholly without capacity insolent without judgment or experience equally     ignorant and arrogant vile and suspicious yet credulous and a slave to adulation devoted to cruelty and lust this pestiferous tyrant governed in mantua five years according to platina but the plebeians themselves could bear him no longer and set up another of the same family against him bottigella bonacossi with little difficulty was able to expel him and tamo his brother one of whom died miserably at padua and the other at ferrara we pass over the actions of bottigella and his wars with cremona and with azzo of este c in   0  bottigella died as well as his enemy azzo to the latter succeeded his son flisco and to the former passarino his brother for this plebeian tyranny was already become hereditary in the family although the government of passarino was not remarkable for folly or severity yet luigi gonzaga who had connected himself in marriage with the bonacossi being a man of abilities and knowing the general discontent of the people and the universal hatred of the nobility against that family entered into concert with some of the neighboring lords as cane della scala c found little difficulty to depose and expel passarino put him to death and reign in his stead the family of the gonzaghi were named from the place of their ancient residence which was gonzaga a multitude of conjectures and fables collected from various authors concerning the origin of this family we pass over guido gonzaga who fought against manfred king of naples had five sons the first of whom was luigi the author and founder of the lordship and marquisate of mantua in      it is said that by the consent of the people according to the laws and good custom one was elected after the death of passarino to whom and to his successors the whole empire was given for perpetuity as was usual in the heroic times the mantuans reasoned in this manner the mode of making a commonwealth perpetual or of any long duration is by prudence which disposes and rules with manly energy as well as with wise discernment this can alone be performed in a state by means of justice which distributes to every one his deserts to the good rewards and honors to the wicked punishment and infamy as the virtue of clemency is the daughter of magnanimity and participates of divinity we always applaud it when it extends only to offences committed against ourselves     and it is commended in princes whenever pardon and mercy cannot cause an injury to the public and give insolence to the daring to rise against the laws it should be a pleasure to princes to remit private injuries but skilful in the healing art they should not be so partially compassionate as to heal one wound at the hazard of destroying the whole body the liberty of the people consists in two things in the laws and the tribunals when these prevail in a city without favor respect or partiality that city and its citizens are free upon these principles the mantuans finding that liberty never had been enjoyed by them under their uncouth government of a republic strange to relate adopted voluntarily an absolute monarchy louis gonzaga was elected and constituted upon these principles and for these reasons and began his reign by an assiduous attention to the revival of laws which had been trampled under foot and by a diligent solicitude that all the good customs should be observed with equality and this is sufficient for another example of the struggles of a few families in an unbalanced government for preëminence and of the final triumph of the gonzaghi over the bonacossi in a monarchy erected on the ruins of a republic montepulciano chiusi the country and residence of porsenna the ancient king to whom tarquin fled for hospitality was one of the most ancient and powerful cities of tuscany or etruria as chiusi was in a low situation and a bad air porsenna chose for his pleasure and his health a mountain in the neighborhood where was a salubrious atmosphere and an admirable prospect an ample plain the lake of thrasimene and the river of chiane with hills and valleys loaded with every production of the earth in grapes grains and fruits in the most perfect elegance and abundance were around it  in after ages upon a civil war in chiusi between the gentlemen and plebeians in which the former were expelled they retired to this mountain and gave it the name of mons politicus which was corrupted afterwards in the vulgar pronunciation into monspolitianus and since into montepulciano the plebeians     of the same city passed the river took possession of another elevated situation where they built a castle and called it castrum plebis though florence and siena have at different times pretended that montepulciano was in their dominion yet it is certain that for three hundred years at least it was an independent sovereign republic at an expense of continual wars it maintained its liberty its government was by podestàs and general councils like all the other cities and its whole history is made up of revolutions from nobles to plebeians and from plebeians to nobles florence and siena taking the parties of opposite factions even in this little village there were great families as well as little ones the guidos ugolinos the bulgarellos and rinieri continually struggling for precedence in the year      the rinieri or rather the family del pecora were accounted noble because they were rich and powerful in followers adherents and relations they had increased in reputation and power to such a degree that they domineered at their discretion over all their compatriots the heads of the house were jacob and nicholas de cavalieri who governed in concurrence with prudence and good order till      when dissensions and discords began to arise between them jacob concerted with peter sacconi who governed in arezzo a project to make himself master of montepulciano but nicholas his colleague revealed it to the governor of the people who excited an insurrection and expelled jacob with twenty of his followers and afterwards with the influence and counsels of nicholas the government was reformed and all the friends of jacob were excluded from any share in it according to the custom and nature of all majorities when there is no power but a minority to rebuff their pretensions jacob then intrigued with visconti archbishop of milan and his allies and corrupting a notary an officer on guard broke down a gate in the night entered with all his men and excited a tumult nicholas a knight of great spirit seized his arms and mounting his horse with a few of his companions waiting for no further help attacked the enemy with such impetuosity that they fled in a panic jacob with twentyfive horsemen escaped the others were taken to the number of seventyfive together with the     notary and the guard the governors of the people hanged thirty and released the rest having first marked them forever by slitting their noses and cutting off their ears jacob then fled to siena and there attempted to form connections and obtain auxiliaries and nicholas and the governors of the people of montepulciano applied to perugia a war was excited between those two cities which was terminated by ambassadors upon these conditions that montepulciano should remain under the government of the people under the protection of the commons of siena for twenty years jacob and nicholas were to be indemnified for the expenses and their estates restored and the commons of florence and perugia were to be guarantees tommasi adds that another condition was the restoration of all the refugees the next year the peace was broken and nicholas sent into banishment but collecting his friends without and concerting measures with his partisans within he found means to enter montepulciano with two hundred horse and five hundred foot but he met with such a resistance from his enemies in the place and their sienese allies that he perceived he could not overcome them he therefore took the barbarous resolution to burn the town and retire his party set fire to as many houses as possible and while the people and soldiers were intent upon preventing the progress of the flames he retreated nicholas and jacob at length finding that they gained nothing and lost much by continual quarrels came to an agreement and solicited the emperor to hold the government of montepulciano as imperial vicars but the people would not admit them because the sienese would not receive such vicars this occasioned a fresh war between the commons of montepulciano and those of siena on one side and the perugians in conjunction with the pecora family and their adherents on the other in this war a memorable battle was fought and the montepulcians distinguished themselves by so much valor that the perugians created four of them cavaliers namely—john the son of nicholas and gherard the son of jacob and two of their nephews berthold and corrado all of the family del pecora and the perugian conquerors with their montepulcian cavaliers committed the customary depredations and devastations     the government of the land being in the hands of the people for the sake of the public tranquillity jacob and nicholas del pecora remained abroad in banishment inhabiting valiano a strong place and a plentiful situation the latter knowing the nature of the citizens of montepulciano accustomed to hope more than they ought and to tolerate less than was necessary discontented and prone to novelties vacillating between the commons of siena and those of perugia through alternate envy jealousy and resentment and being never at rest entered into a secret correspondence with them in order to return to his country his purpose was in time accomplished and he was joyfully received by the people and mutual forgiveness of injuries and affronts was stipulated recollecting that the rupture between him and jacob had been the cause of all the evils he sent a messenger to him and a reconciliation was effected between them for the common benefit of their country all was now joy friendship and festivity in appearance but the secret causes of discord were still at work and before the year      produced another revolution and nicholas and his friends were again exiled five years afterwards the exiles from montepulciano with some assistance from the grandees of siena entered and conquered their country and sent jacob who had made himself lord and master to prison but the plebeians and others who had been oppressed by him and mortally hated him could not satiate their vengeance merely by burning and plundering all his property they broke open his prison and tore him into pieces so small that no part of his body could ever be collected for sepulture the grandees were so transported with indignation at this infamous barbarity that they put to death a great part of the plebeians and banished the remainder they reformed the government of the land however into a popular state and banished the cavalieri as rebels not to pursue this relation to any greater length it may be observed in general that this little hill maintained its independence for three hundred years by the mutual jealousies of florence siena and perugia but it was by uninterrupted wars with one or the other of them all in their turn seeking its alliance or subjugation and all in their turn taking its part when in danger of being subdued by any one this occasioned a continual vacillation of its friendship and enmity with those cities     and constant revolutions of government at home upon every change there was no balance in their government by which parties or powerful individuals might be restrained and a few families were continually scrambling for superiority there were no nobles by name that is there were no marquises counts or barons but there were gentlemen and common people and the gentlemen were called cavaliers because they could afford to keep a horse or at most three horses to each man the family del pecora was the principal one of these cavaliers and they enslaved their country of course as the medici did in florence perhaps it may be said that in america we have no distinctions of ranks and therefore shall not be liable to those divisions and discords which spring from them but have we not laborers yeomen gentlemen esquires honorable gentlemen and excellent gentlemen and are not these distinctions established by law have they not been established by our ancestors from the first plantation of the country and are not those distinctions as earnestly desired and sought as titles garters and ribbons are in any nation of europe we may look as wise and moralize as gravely as we will we may call this desire of distinction childish and silly but we cannot alter the nature of men human nature is thus childish and silly and its author has made it so undoubtedly for wise purposes and it is setting ourselves up to be wiser than nature and more philosophical than providence to censure it all that we can say in america is that legal distinctions titles powers and privileges are not hereditary but that the disposition to artificial distinctions to titles and ribbons and to the hereditary descent of them is ardent in america we may see by the institution of the cincinnati there is not a more remarkable phenomenon in universal history nor in universal human nature than this order the officers of an army who had voluntarily engaged in a service under the authority of the people whose creation and preservation was upon the principle that the body of the people were the only fountain of power and of honor officers too as enlightened and as virtuous as ever served in any army the moment they had answered the end of their creation instituted titles and ribbons and hereditary descents by their own authority only without the consent or knowledge of the people or their representatives or legislatures if these gentlemen had been of opinion that titles and ribbons were necessary     in society to have been consistent they should have taken measures for calling conventions of the people where it should have been determined first whether any such distinction should be introduced secondly how many such orders thirdly what number of individuals of each and lastly there should have been in convention a general election of noblemen for each of the thirteen states as great injustice may be done by giving too much honor to one and too little to another as by committing trespasses upon property or slanders upon reputation the public good requires justice in the distribution of fame as well as fortune and the public or some tribunal erected by the public can be alone competent to the decision  as there is no instance more parallel than this of montepulciano where the people who owned horses agreed together to call themselves cavaliers and thus created a distinct order in the state this opportunity has been taken to make an observation upon an institution which ought not to be passed over in considering the subject of these labors it is greatly to be wished that the officers would voluntarily discontinue their societies and lay aside their eagles which will do them as well as the community much more hurt than good they have already excluded many excellent men from places in civil life to which their merit in other respects entitled them they have excited disputes which are very pernicious they are founded on no principle of morals true policy or our own constitution    0     appendix postscript the following was appended to the first volume of the original edition of the defence which made its appearance alone as it seems to have no necessary connection with that place it has been transferred to this where it seems equally appropriate and where it serves more nearly to equalize the size of the volumes the foreign gazettes and journals have announced to the world that the abbé de mably was applied to by the united states of america for his advice and assistance in the formation of a code of laws  it is unnecessary to say any thing to this only that it is a part of a million volumes of lies according to the best computation which are to be imposed upon posterity relative to american affairs the abbé himself in his observations has said that i desired his sentiments this is true but the manner of the request ought to be known that those who think it of any consequence may understand in what sense it is true upon my arrival in paris in october      upon the business of the peace the abbé de mablys book upon the manner of writing history was put into my hands at the conclusion of that publication he declared his intention of writing on the american revolution meeting the abbé soon afterwards at dinner at monsieur de chaluts the farmergeneral my friends the abbés de chalut and arnoux who were of the party informed me that their friend was about writing the history of the american revolution and would be obliged to me for any facts or memorials that might be in my power the question was asked what part of the revolution he intended to write the whole where had he obtained the materials it was supposed they might be obtained from the public papers and inquiry of individuals in answer to this a few difficulties were started and the conversation spun into length at last the gentlemen asked to have in writing what had been then said upon the subject as the conversation being in     french it might not have been fully comprehended accordingly in a few days i wrote the abbé a letter the translation of which by a friend into french is here inclosed the original in english not being in my possession by this it will be seen that the request to the abbé to write upon american affairs was a mere civility and rather a desire that he would not expose himself by attempting a history that he was altogether unprovided for than any formal request that he should write at all we ought to be obliged to any gentleman in europe who will favor us with his thoughts but in general the theory of government is as well understood in america as it is in europe and by great numbers of individuals is every thing relating to a free constitution infinitely better comprehended than by the abbé de mably or m turgot amiable learned and ingenious as they were  john adams      labbé de mably gabriel bonnot to the abbé de mably it is with pleasure that i have learned your design to write upon the american revolution because your other writings which are much admired by americans contain principles of legislation policy and negotiation which are perfectly analogous to their own so that you cannot write upon this subject without producing a work instructive to the public and especially to my fellowcitizens but i hope sir you will not accuse me of presumption of affectation or of singularity if i venture to express my opinion that it is yet too soon to undertake a complete history of that great event and that there is no man either in america or europe at this day capable of performing it or who is in possession of the materials requisite and necessary for that purpose to engage in such a work the writer ought to divide the history of america into several periods   from the first establishment of the colonies in   00 to the commencement of their disputes with great britain in        from the commencement of those disputes in      occasioned by an order of the board of trade and plantations in great britain sent to the officers of the customs in america to carry into execution in the strictest manner the acts of trade and to apply to the courts of judicature for writs of assistance for that purpose to the commencement of hostilities on the nineteenth of april      during this period of fourteen years there was little more than a war of the quill   from the battle of lexington to the signature of the treaty with france on the sixth of february      during this period of three years the war was exclusively between great britain and the united states   from the treaty with france to the commencement of hostilities between great britain and france in the first place afterwards with spain then to the gradual progress of the armed neutrality and the war of england against holland finally all these scenes have their catastrophe in the negotiations of the peace     without a distinct knowledge of the history of the colonies in the first period a writer will find himself embarrassed from the beginning to the end of his book to account for events and characters which will present themselves in every step of his path as he advances to the second third and fourth periods to acquire a sufficient knowledge of the first period it will be necessary to read all the charters granted to the colonies and the commissions and instructions given to governors all the codes of laws of the different colonies and thirteen volumes in folio of dry disgusting statutes cannot be read with pleasure or in a short time all the records of the legislatures of the several colonies which cannot be found but in manuscript and by travelling in person from new hampshire to georgia the records of the board of trade and plantations in great britain from its institution to its dissolution as also the files in the offices of some of the secretaries of state there is another branch of reading which cannot be neglected if the former might be omitted i mean those writings which have appeared in america from time to time i pretend not however in the place where i am at a distance from all books and writings to make an exact enumeration the writings of the ancient governors winthrop and winslow dr mather mr prince neals history of new england douglass summary the progressive amelioration of the lands and the present state of the british colonies hutchinsons history of the massachusetts bay smiths history of new york smiths history of new jersey the works of william penn dummers defence of the new england charters the history of virginia and many other public writings all these were anterior to the present quarrel which began in      during the second period the writings are more numerous and more difficult to be procured there were then given to the public works of great importance in the controversies between those who were actors in this scene as writers there are some who ought to be distinguished among them are the governors under the king pownall bernard and hutchinson lieutenantgovernor oliver mr sewall the judge of admiralty for halifax jonathan mayhew d d james otis oxenbridge thacher samuel adams josiah quincy joseph warren and perhaps the following have not been less important than the foregoing namely—the writings of mr dickinson mr wilson and dr rush of philadelphia of mr livingston and mr mcdougall of new york of colonel bland and arthur lee of virginia and of many others the records of the town of boston and especially of the committee of correspondence the records of the board of commissioners of the customs in boston the journals of the house of representatives and of the council of massachusetts bay moreover the gazettes of the town of boston not forgetting those of new york and philadelphia ought to be collected and examined from the year    0 all this is necessary in order to write with precision and in detail the history of the discussions before hostilities commenced during the period from the year      to the nineteenth of april      during the third and the fourth periods the records pamphlets and gazettes of the thirteen states ought to be collected as well as the journals of congress of which nevertheless a great part is still secret and the collection of the new constitutions of the several states the remembrancer and the annual register periodical papers published in england the affaires de langleterre et de lamérique and the mercure de france published in paris and the politique     hollandois printed at amsterdam the whole course of the correspondence of general washington with congress from the month of july      to this day which has not yet been published and which will not be published till congress shall order or permit it allow me to say that until this vast source of information shall be opened it will be scarcely possible for any man to undertake the history of the american war there are still other writings of importance in the office of the secret committee of congress in the committee of foreign affairs in the committee on the treasury in the marine or naval committee in the board of war as long as it existed and of the departments of war of the navy the finances and of foreign affairs from their institution there are also letters of american ministers in france spain holland and other parts of europe the greatest part of the documents and materials being still secret it is premature to undertake a general history of the american revolution but too much labor and care cannot be employed in making collections of those materials there exist however in part already two or three general histories of the american war and the american revolution published in london and two or three others published in paris those in the english language are only materials indigested and confused without discernment and all these histories both in french and english are only monuments of the complete ignorance of the writers of their subject the whole of a long life to begin at the age of twenty years will be necessary to assemble from all nations and from all parts of the world in which they are deposited the documents proper to form a complete history of the american revolution because it is indeed the history of mankind during that epoch the histories of france spain holland england and the neutral powers must be united with that of america the materials ought to be assembled from all those nations and the documents the most important of all as well as the characters of actors and the secret springs of action are still concealed in cabinets and enveloped in ciphers whether you sir undertake to give a general history or only observations and remarks like those you have published concerning the greeks and romans you will produce a work very interesting and instructive in morality policy and legislation and i shall esteem it an honor and a pleasure to furnish you with any little assistance in my power to facilitate your researches it is impossible for me to say whether the government of france would wish to see any work profoundly written and by an author of great celebrity in the french language principles of government must be laid open so different from those which we find in europe especially in france that such an essay perhaps would not be seen with indifference but of this i am not a competent judge permit me sir before i finish this letter to point at a key to all this history there is a general analogy in the governments and characters of all the thirteen states but it was not till the debates and the war began in massachusetts bay the principal province of new england that their primitive institutions produced their first effect four of these institutions ought to be amply investigated and maturely considered by any person who wishes to write with correct information upon this subject for they have produced a decisive effect not only in the first determinations of the controversies in writing and the first debates in council and the first resolutions to resist in arms but also by the influence they had on the minds of the other colonies by giving them an example to adopt more or     less the same institutions and similar measures the four institutions intended are—     the towns or districts     the congregations     the schools     the militia the towns are certain extents of country or districts of territory into which massachusetts bay connecticut new hampshire and rhode island are divided these towns contain upon an average say six miles or two leagues square the inhabitants who live within these limits are formed by law into corporations or bodies politic and are invested with certain powers and privileges as for example to repair the great roads or highways to support the poor to choose their selectmen constables collectors of taxes and above all their representatives in the legislature as also the right to assemble whenever they are summoned by their selectmen in their town halls there to deliberate upon the public affairs of the town or to give instructions to their representatives in the legislature the consequences of these institutions have been that the inhabitants having acquired from their infancy the habit of discussing of deliberating and of judging of public affairs it was in these assemblies of towns or districts that the sentiments of the people were formed in the first place and their resolutions were taken from the beginning to the end of the disputes and the war with great britain   the congregations are religious societies which comprehend the whole people every district contains a parish or religious congregation in general they have but one though some of them have several each parish has a temple for public worship and a minister maintained at the public expense the constitutions of these congregations are extremely popular and the clergy have little influence or authority beyond that which their own piety virtues and talents naturally give them they are chosen by the people of their parishes and receive their ordinations from the neighboring clergy they are all married have families and live with their parishioners in an intimate and perfect friendship they visit the sick they are charitable to the poor they solemnize marriages and funerals and preach twice every sunday the smallest imputation on their moral character would destroy their influence and ruin them forever they are therefore wise virtuous and pious men their sentiments are generally conformable to those of their people and they are jealous friends of liberty   there are schools in every town established by an express law of the colony every town containing sixty families is obliged under a penalty to maintain constantly a school and a schoolmaster who shall teach his scholars reading writing arithmetic and the rudiments of the latin and greek languages all the children of the inhabitants the rich as well as the poor have a right to go to these public schools there are formed the candidates for admission as students into the colleges at cambridge new haven princeton and dartmouth in these colleges are educated future masters for these schools future ministers for these congregations doctors of law and medicine and magistrates and officers for the government of the country   the militia comprehends the whole people by virtue of the laws of the country every male inhabitant between sixteen and sixty years of age is enrolled in a company and a regiment of militia completely organized with all its officers he is enjoined to keep always in his house and at his own expense a     firelock in good order a powder horn a pound of powder twelve flints fourandtwenty balls of lead a cartridge box and a knapsack so that the whole country is ready to march for its own defence upon the first signal of alarm these companies and regiments are obliged to assemble at certain times in every year under the orders of their officers for the inspection of their arms and ammunition and to perform their exercises and manœuvres behold sir a little sketch of the four principal sources of that prudence in council and that military valor and ability which have produced the american revolution and which i hope will be sacredly preserved as the foundations of the liberty happiness and prosperity of the people if there are any other particulars concerning which i can give you any information be

souvenir cest un peuple qui semble avoir eu soif de guerres civiles il ne fut point désaltéré de sang même après avoir réduit sa patrie à navoir quun rang obscur parmi les villes ditalie il ne se reposa point sous le joug du despotisme qui étouffant toutes les passions détruisant tous les intérêts endort presque toujours les peuples dans le repos de la mort il continua de combattre après que la liberté le gouvernement la gloire ne pouvoient plus exister pour lui tel quun des géans de larioste dans la chaleur de ses batailles il oublioit quil étoit mort exemple à jamais mémorable de la

in a history of illbalanced governments un principe odieux paroît avoir été constamment admis à pistoia cest que pour que la vengeance fût complete il falloit quelle ne tombât pas sur loffenseur car si elle natteignoit que celuici elle nétoit quun châtiment qui proportionné à loffense et attendu ne pouvoit causer une douleur assez profonde à ceux dont on vouloit se venger la premiere offense étoit tombée sur un innocent pour que la réciprocite fût complète il falloit que la seconde atteignît un homme également innocent sil y avoit dans lune ou lautre famille un homme que ses vertus fissent respecter et chérir de tous ou même que son caractère paisible eût éloigné des dissensions civiles et eût rendu comme inviolable au milieu des fureurs de la guerre cétoit lui que le parti contraire désignoit pour sa victime et il ne croyoit savourer tout le plaisir de sa vengeance que lorsquil avoit bravé pour commettre le crime la sauvegarde des loix et tout respect divin ou humain

there is abundant proof in the publications of the time the moderation of washington in recommending a modification of the objectionable features of the institution and the wisdom of the society in yielding at once to public opinion smoothed all difficulties nevertheless it may be doubted whether the institution ever had in it the seeds of any mischief for it was not based upon a distinction of property without which no aristocratic class can really continue the statute of distribution of estates is the most solid pillar of a republican edifice   this volume contains all of that part of the defence devoted by the author to a review of the domestic history of some of the italian republics in the middle ages a portion to the perusal of which it is difficult to attach great interest and yet not without its value to those disposed to study faithfully the working of popular forms of government m de sismondi has since given to the public a more extended and perfect sketch of the italian history for the same period and has endeavored to analyze the causes as well of the prosperity as of the decline of the republican states his hundred and twentysixth chapter is devoted to an examination of their ideas of liberty and to a comparison of them with those established at the present day he considers the former as embraced in three propositions which are equally considered as axioms among the people of the united states the first is that all authority exercised over the people emanates from the people secondly that the power conferred should return at stated intervals to its source thirdly that the recipient of the power must be responsible to the people for its exercise these axioms m de sismondi considers as sufficient to account for the great impulse given to the energy and activity of those communities at that time but they do not supply the regulating principle which should have prevented them from falling into disorders and excess the truth seems to be that no well defined ideas of human rights were entertained in any quarter and consequently there were no limitations of the power of majorities over minorities the histories consequently show nothing but a series of struggles for the control of the government between factions all equally disposed to abuse their power whenever they succeeded in securing it in these contentions the safety and happiness of the individual citizen were made of no account he rose or fell with the success or defeat of the faction to which he attached himself with such a state of things continued for any length of time it could not fail to happen that a great number would gradually be led to prefer the more durable authority emanating from the will of one it is therefore no great cause of surprise to find that in course of time the people of each separate city voluntarily submitted to the unrestrained will of some single person powerful enough to compel the maintenance of order for their protection to remedy the dangers attendant upon the arbitrary use of power checks however multiplied will scarcely avail without an explicit admission of some limitation of the right of the majority to exercise sovereign authority over the individual citizen the modern theory of republicanism rests upon the axioms that in the eye of the state certain natural rights belong equally to all men and that these rights cannot be annihilated at the mere pleasure of the greater number without some such securities there is no protection from social tyranny whatever may be the form it takes in popular governments minorities constantly run much greater risk of suffering from arbitrary power than in absolute monarchies for the majority which wield the power against the smaller number at the same time create the public sentiment that will sustain them at least for the moment in a despotic act whereas under single rulers although individual cases of oppression are more likely to happen public opinion will yet be left free to censure or correct them the only cure for this is in the recognition of the right of every individual citizen to complete protection so long as he conducts himself like a good citizen hence spring all the safeguards so carefully introduced into the constitutions and the declarations of rights in america which are however after all dependent for their force mainly upon the establishment of a sound public opinion the use of checks and balances in the forms of government is to create delays and multiply diversities of interests by which the tendency on a sudden to violate them may be counteracted in the cities of italy there was no effective barrier between the passions of the majority and their object but physical force hence the minority was always driven to violence to protect itself it is a little singular that the course of education generally pursued in america especially among those destined to make and to expound the laws should be almost exclusively devoted to the consideration of those precedents in history in which the inequality of ranks is an acknowledged and vital element whilst very little attention has been paid to the observation of those phenomena which the legislation and the social systems by analogy most nearly approximating our own almost uniformly present it must be conceded that as yet philosophical generalization upon abstract questions of the highest class is not the characteristic of the american mind but the time may come when it will be pushed to a higher point in some departments connected with practical results than has yet been anywhere reached   this statement is made by baron de grimm in his literary correspondence for the month of january      and corrected in his review of de mablys observations sur le gouvernement et les lois des étatsunis damérique in october      the story was revived in some of the american newspapers in      which drew from the author a note to the editor of the north american review inclosing a copy in english of the letter to the abbé de mably and both were published in that magazine for the month of november      together with two notes of acknowledgment one from the abbé himself and the other from marmontel which are now appended   in the original edition of this work the letter was in french but as it was not so written by the author and as an authorized english version has been since published that has been adopted in the present instance
