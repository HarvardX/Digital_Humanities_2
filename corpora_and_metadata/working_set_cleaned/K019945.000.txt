science soon struck root and flourished into high repute each learned priest o strange to tell could circles make and cast a spell could read and write and taught the nation the holy art of divination nobles themselves for at that time knowledge in nobles was no crime could talk as learned as the priest and prophecy as much at least hence all the fortunetelling crew whose crafty skill mars natures

emperors would live or die they in an asss scull could spy when generals would their station keep or turn their backs in hearts of sheep in matters whether small or great in private families or state

foolishly wherever dispersed still place their native country first for englishmen alone have sense to give a stranger preference whilst modest merit of their own is left in poverty to groan campbell

every folly of the age the honorable arts would buy to pack the cards and cog a die the parson too for now and then parsons are just like other men and here and there a grave divine has passions such as yours and mine burning with holy lust to know when fate preferment will bestow fraid of detection not of sin with circumspection sneaking in to conjrer as he does to whore through some bye alley or backdoor with the same caution orthodox consults the stars and gets a pox the citizen in fraud grown old who knows no deity but gold worn out and gasping now for breath a medicine wants to keep off death would know if that he cannot have what coins are current in the grave if when the stocks which by his power would rise or fall in half an hour for though unthought of and unseen he worked the

knowledge than themselves when fines and penalties were laid to stop the progress of the trade and stars no longer could dispense with honor farther influence and wizards which must be confessed was of more force than all the rest no certain way to tell had got which were informers and which not affrighted sages were perforce obliged to steer some other course by various ways these sons of chance

gascoynes help a six months feast whilst in contempt of all our pains the tyrant superstition reigns imperious in the heart of man and warps his thoughts from natures plan whilst fond credulity who never the weight of wholesome doubts could bear to reason and herself unjust takes all things blindly up on trust whilst curiosity whose rage no mercy shows to sex or age must be indulged at the expense of judgment truth and common sense impostures cannot but prevail and when old miracles grow stale jugglers will still the art pursue and entertain the world with new for them obedient to their

heart at fearcreated phantoms start the priest that very word implies that he is both innocent and wise yet fears to travel in the dark unless escorted by his clerk but let not every bungler deem too lightly of so deep a scheme for reputation of the art each ghost must act a proper part observe decorums needful grace and keep the laws of time and place must change with happy variation his manners with his situation what in the country might pass down would be impertinent in town no spirit of discretion here can think of breeding awe and fear twill serve the purpose more by half to make the congregation laugh we want no ensigns of surprise locks stiff with gore and sawcer eyes give us an entertaining sprite gentle familiar and polite one who appears in such a form as might an holy hermit warm or who on former schemes refines and only talks by sounds and signs who will not to the eye appear but pays her visit to the ear and knocks so gently twould not fright a lady in the darkest night such is our fanny whose good will which cannot in the grave lie still brings her on earth to entertain her friends and lovers in cocklane end of the first book the ghost book ii a sacred standard rule we find by poets held time out of mind to offer at apollos shrine and call on one or all the nine this custom through a bigot zeal which moderns of fine taste must feel for those who wrote in days of yore adopted stands like many more though every cause which then conspired to make it practiced and admired yielding to times destructive course for ages past has lost its force with ancient bards an invocation was a true act of adoration of worship an essential part and not a formal piece of art of paultry reading a parade a dull solemnity in trade a pious fever taught to burn an hour or two to serve a turn they talked not of castalian springs by way of saying pretty things as we dress out our flimsy rhimes twas the religion of the times and they believed that holy stream with greater force made fancy teem reckoned by all a true specific to make the barren brain prolific thus romish church a scheme which bears not half so much excuse as theirs since faith implicitly has taught her reveres the force of holy water the pagan system whether true or false its strength like buildings drew from many parts disposed to bear in one great whole their proper share each god of eminent degree to some vast beam compared might be each godling was a peg or rather a cramp to keep the beams together and man as safely might pretend from jove the thunderbolt to rend as with an impious pride aspire to rob apollo of his lyre with settled faith and pious awe established by the voice of law then poets to the muses came and from their altars caught the flame genius with phoebus for his guide the muse ascending by his side with towering pinions dared to soar where eye could scarcely strain before but why should we who cannot feel these glowings of a pagan zeal that wild enthusiastic force by which above her common course nature in exstasy upborne looked down on earthly things with scorn who have no more regard it is known for their religion than our own and feel not half so fierce a flame at clios as at fishers name who know these boasted sacred streams were mere romantic idle dreams that thames has waters clear as those which on the top of pindus rose and that the fancy to refine waters not half so good as wine who know if profit strikes our eye should we drink helicon quite dry the whole fountain would not thither lead so soon as one poor jug from tweed who if to raise poetic fire the power of beauty we require in any public place can view more than the grecians ever knew if wit into the scale is thrown can boast a lenox of our own why should we servile customs choose and court an antiquated muse no matter why  to ask a reason in pedant bigotry is treason in the broad beaten turnpikeroad of hackneyd panegyric ode no modern poet dares to ride without apollo by his side nor in a sonnet take the air unless his lady muse be there she from some amaranthine grove where little loves and graces rove the laurel to my lord must bear or garlands make for whores to wear she with soft elegeiac verse must grace some mighty villains hearse or for some infant doomed by fate to wallow in a large estate with rhimes the cradle must adorn to tell the world a fool is born since then our critic lords expect no hardy poet should reject established maxims or presume to place much better in their room by nature fearful i submit and in this dearth of sense and wit with nothing done and little said by wild excursive fancy led into a second book thus far like some unwary traveller whom varied scenes of wood and lawn with treacherous delight have drawn deluded from his purposed way whom every step leads more astray who gazing round can no where spy or house or friendly cottage nigh and resolution seems to lack to venture forward or go back invoke some goddess to descend and help me to my journeys end though conscious   all the while hears the petition with a smile before the glass her charms unfolds and in herself my muse beholds truth goddess of celestial birth but little loved or known on earth whose power but seldom rules the heart whose name with hypocritic art an errant stalking horse is made a snug pretense to drive a trade an instrument
