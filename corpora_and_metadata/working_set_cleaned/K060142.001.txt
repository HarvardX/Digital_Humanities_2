a tour through the whole island of great britain divided into circuits or journeys giving a particular and entertaining account of whatever is curious and worth observation viz i a description of the principal cities and towns their situation government and commerce ii the customs manners exercises diversions and employment of the people iii the produce and improvement of the lands the trade and manufactures iv the sea ports and fortifications the course of rivers and the inland navigation v the public edifices seats and palaces of the nobility and gentry vi the isles of wight portland jersey guernsey and the other english and scottish isles of most note interspersed with useful observations particularly fitted for the perusal of such as desire to travel over the island  by a gentleman  the third edition with very great additions improvements and corrections which bring it down to the year       in four volumes  with a copious index to each volume  vol i  london printed for j osborn s birt d brown j hodges a millar j whiston and j robinson mdccxlii  preface the kind reception which the last edition of this work has met with determined the proprietors to spare no expense to make the present as complete as the nature of the work would admit and the editor in pursuance of their intention has besides his own observations and experience been favored with such ample materials by several curious gentlemen as have made it impossible to comprize the whole in three volumes as before although he omitted all that could be spared and abstracted whatever would bear it he was therefore obliged to add a fourth volume  and this he found himself under the greater necessity of doing because when he came to compare the former edition with his own notes and the maps he discovered many very material omissions particularly that the whole county of hertford was omitted excepting st albans and one or two villages as also the isles of wight portland guernsey jersey alderney and sarke together with that of man and the scots isles that the description of the northern counties of england which abound with great numbers of remarkables was also very defective and that the first author had directed his tour in several places in such a manner as to pass wholly by several of the best towns and most remarkable places and quite out of any geographical course or order  then the materials which the editor was supplied with for scotland he found would swell that part of the united kingdom to one entire volume which before made not half a one and he was glad of the opportunity of doing some further justice to that country which has generally been slightly considered by those who know little of it  it must also be observed that the first author had in many places disclaimed antiquities as a subject out of his province whereas we have thought ourselves obliged so far as our limits would permit to take notice of such as still remaining may be considered as a part of the present state of the counties and places where at this day they continue visible and which may moreover merit the attention of a curious traveller and particularly of such antiquities as have been brought to light since the last edition of camdens britannia  for the above reason we have been pretty ample in our accounts of the famous stonehenge and the barrows in wilts and confess our obligations on this head to the learned dr stukeley in his late work on that subject to whom we are also beholden in several other places  we have likewise thought ourselves obliged to take notice of the benefits which several port and trading towns in this kingdom as well in its northern as southern parts have of late years received from acts of parliament for enlarging and restoring of piers and harbors repairs of roads and for making rivers navigable where the face of affairs in their particular neighbourhoods have been any way altered or effected by those laudable works  we have moreover subjoined to this edition lists of the cities and boroughs which return members to the parliament of great britain the lists of such gentlemens seats in each county as we had not room to describe likewise a brief account of the english bishoprics and lists of the peers of england and scotland in such a manner as will not be subject to any other variations than that of the total extinction of families for our intention was to carry this piece as much as the nature of the work would admit beyond the reach of temporary fluctuations and changes  by what we have said it will appear that this will have the face of a new work and indeed more than the face as will be seen by any who will take the pains to compare the different editions and that therefore it was impossible to print by themselves for the use of the purchasers of the last edition those new observations descriptions and corrections which are incorporated in the present as the proprietors were very desirous to have done had it been practicable but this we may venture to promise that though the nature of this work is such that there must be always room for additions etc as new discoveries may be made or alterations happen by time yet that all such necessary alterations and additions shall for the future be printed by themselves after the manner of the appendix to vol iii of this edition that the reader may not be under the necessity of repurchasing the whole work  but lest it should be imagined from any thing we have said above that we have been so ungenerous as to endeavor to raise a merit to the present edition at the expense of the former we shall observe that the good reception which the labors of the original author met with in his first edition and which also attended the second which was printed with very great additions and improvements is no bad argument of the value of his performance and indeed he well deserved that success who could with justice give such an account of his abilities for the undertaking as is contained in the following paragraphs  the preparations for this work says he have been suitable to the authors earnest concern for its usefulness seventeen very large circuits or journeys have been taken through diverse parts separately and three general tours over almost the whole english part of the island in all which the author has not been wanting to treasure up just remarks upon particular places and things so that he is very little in debt to other mens labors and gives but very few accounts of things but what he has been an eyewitness of himself  besides these several journeys in england he has also lived some time in scotland and has traveled critically over great part of it he has viewed the north part of england and the south part of scotland five several times over all which is hinted here to let the readers know what reason they have to be satisfied with the authority of the relation and that the accounts here given are not the produce of a cursory view or raised upon the borrowed lights of other observers    we shall only add that if the first edition had all these advantages we may very safely submit the merit of the present to the judgment of the candid reader  a tour through the island of great britain letter i a description of part of the county of essex and of the county of suffolk etc sir i set out from london on my first journey eastward and took a circuit down by the coast of the thames through the marshes or hundreds on the south side of the county of essex to malden colchester and harwich thence continuing on the coast of suffolk to yarmouth thence round by the edge of the sea on the north and west side of norfolk to lynn wisbich and the wash thence back again on the northside of suffolk thence into the county of cambridge and so to the westpart of essex ending it in middlesex near the place where i began reserving the middle or center of the several counties to some little excursions which i made by themselves  passing bowbridge where the county of essex begins i came first to the village of stratford which is greatly increased of late years in houses and inhabitants every vacancy being filled up in a manner with the addition of two little newbuilt hamlets as they may be called on the forestside of the town namely marylandpoint and the gravelpits one facing the road to woodford and epping and the other that to ilford as for the hitherpart it is almost joined to bow in spite of rivers canals marshygrounds etc  the same increase of buildings may be seen proportionally in the other villages adjacent especially on the forestside as at lowlayton laytonstone walthamstow woodford wansted and the towns of westham plaistow upton etc and this generally speaking of handsome large houses from  0 l to  0 l a year being chiefly the habitations of the richest citizens such as are able to keep a country as well as a town house or such as have left off trade altogether this is so apparent that they tell me there are no less than two hundred coaches kept by the inhabitants within the circumference of the few villages named above besides such as are kept by accidental lodgers the cause of which i shall enlarge upon when i come to speak of the like in the counties of middlesex surrey etc where there will be still more occasion to take notice of it  there have been discerned within these few years in the bottom of hackneymarsh between oldford and the wyck the remains of a great stone causeway which is supposed to have been the highway or great road from london to essex instead of that which now leads over the bridge between bow and stratford  that the great road lay this way and that the great causeway continued just over the river where now the templemills stand and passed by sir henry hickess house at ruckholls is not at all doubted and that it was one of those famous highways made by the romans there is undeniable proof by the several marks of roman work and by roman coins and other antiquities found there some of which were collected by the late reverend mr strype vicar of lowlayton  from hence the great road passed up to laytonstone a place by some known now as much by the sign of the greenman formerly a lodge upon the edge of the forest and crossing by wanstedhouse the noble seat of earl tilney of which hereafter went over the same river which we now cross at ilford and passing that part of the great forest called henaultforest came into the present great road a little on this side the whalebone a place so called because a ribbone of a large whale taken in the river of thames the year that oliver cromwell died      was fixed there  according to my first intention of effectually viewing the seacoasts of essex suffolk and norfolk i went from stratford to barking a large market town but chiefly inhabited by fishermen whose smacks ride in the thames at the mouth of barking creek from whence their fish are sent up to london to the market at billingsgate in small boats  these fishingsmacks are very useful vessels to the public upon many occasions as particularly in time of war they are used as presssmacks running to all the northern and western coasts to pick up seamen to man the navy when any expedition is at hand that requires a sudden equipment at other times being excellent sailors they are tenders to particular men of war and on an expedition they have been made use of as machines for the blowing up fortified ports as formerly at st malo and other places  the parish of barking is very large and by the improvement of lands recovered out of the thames and out of the river which runs by the town the great and small tithes as the townsmen assured me are worth above  00 l per annum this parish has two chapels of ease viz one at ilford and one on the side of the forest called newchapel  a little beyond the town on the road to dagenham stood a great old house where tradition says the gunpowdertreason was contrived and where all the first consultations about it were held  this side of the county is rather rich from the nature of its land than from the number of its inhabitants which is occasioned by the unhealthiness of the air for these low marsh grounds which with all the south side of the county have been gained as it were out of the river thames and the sea where the river is wide enough to be called so begin here or rather at westham by stratford and extend themselves from hence eastward growing wider till we come beyond tilbury when the flat country lies six seven or eight miles in breadth and is both unhealthy and unpleasant  however it is very good farming in the marshes because the landlords let good penyworths though the land is rich for it being a place where every body cannot live those that venture it will have encouragement and it is but reasonable they should  in passing from barking to dagenham we saw the place where was the famous breach that laid near  000 acres of land under water but which after near ten years inundation and the works being several times blown up was at last effectually stopped by captain perry who for several years had been employed in the czar of muscovys works at veronitza on the river don  great part of the lands in these levels especially those on this side easttilbury are held by the farmers cowkeepers and grasingbutchers who live in and near london who generally stock them with lincolnshire and leicestershire wethers which they buy in smithfield in september and october when the grasiers sell off their stocks and feed here till christmas or candlemas and though they are not made much the fatter here than when bought in yet very good advantage accrues by the difference of the price of mutton between michaelmas when cheapest and candlemas when dearest and this is what the butchers call by way of excellence right marsh mutton  at the end of these marshes close to the edge of the river stands tilburyfort which may justly be looked upon as the key of the city of london it is a regular fortification the design of it was a a pentagon but the waterbastion as it would have been called was never built the plan was laid out by sir martin beckman chief engineer to king charles ii who also designed the works at sheerness the esplanade of the fort is very large and the bastions the largest of any in england the foundation is laid upon piles driven down two an end of one another so far till they were assured they were below the chanel of the river and that the piles which were pointed with iron entered into the solid chalkrock adjoining to the chalkhills on the other side  the works to the landside are complete the bastions are faced with brick there is a double ditch or moat the innermost of which is   0 feet broad a good counterscarp and a covered way marked out with ravelins and tenailles but they have not been completed  on the landside there are also two small redoubts of brick but the chief strength of this fort on the landside consists in being able to lay the whole level under water and so to make it impossible for an enemy to carry on approaches that way  on the side next the river is a very strong curtain with a noble gate called the watergate in the middle and the ditch is palisadod at the place where the waterbastion was designed to be built and which by the plan should run wholly out into the river so to flank the two curtains on each side stands a high tower which they tell us was built in queen elizabeths time and was called the blockhouse the side next the water is vacant  before this curtain above and below the said vacancy is a platform in the place of a counterscarp on which are planted  0  cannon generally carrying from    to    pound ball a battery so terrible as well imports the consequence of that place besides which there are smaller pieces planted between and the bastions and curtain also are planted with guns so that they must be bold fellows who will venture in the biggest ships to pass such a battery if the men appointed to serve the guns do their duty as becomes them  from hence there is nothing for many miles together remarkable but a continued level of unhealthy marshes called the three hundreds till we come before leigh and to the mouth of the rivers chelmer and blackwater saving that the towns of horndon rayley and rochford lie near the seacoast extending in the order i have named but are of no note the above rivers united make a large firth or inlet of the sea which our fishermen and seamen who use it as a port call maldenwater  in this inlet is osey or osyth island so well known by our london men of pleasure for producing such vast numbers of wildducks mallards teals and wigeons that the island seems covered with them at certain times of the year and they go from london for the pleasure of shooting and often come home very well laden with game and sometimes too with an essex ague on their backs which they find a heavier load than the fowls they have shot  on the shore beginning a little below candy island or leigh road lies a great shoal or sand called the black tail which runs out near three leagues into the sea due east at the end of it stands a pole or mast set up by the trinityhouse of london as a seamark this is called shoebeacon from the point of land where this sand begins which is called shoeberryness from a town of that name which stands by it from this sand and on the edge of shoeberry before it or southwest of it all along to the mouth of colchesterwater the shore is full of shoals and sands with some deep channels between all which are so full of fish that the barking smacks are well employed here and the shore swarms besides with small fisherboats belonging to the villages and towns on the coast which come in every tide with what they take and selling the smaller fish in the country send the best and largest upon horses which travel night and day to london market  on this shore also are taken the best and most relishing though not the largest oysters in england the spot from whence they have their appellation is a little bank called woelfleet in the mouth of the river crouch called crookseawater but the chief place where these oysters are now had is from wyvenhoe and the shores adjacent whither they are brought by the fishermen who take them at the mouth of colchesterwater and about the sand they call the spits and carry them up to wyvenhoe where they are laid in beds or pits on the shore to feed as they call it and then being barrelled up and carried to colchester which is but three miles off they are sent to london by land and are from thence called colchester oysters  they take also here fine soals which generally yield a good price at london market also sometimes middling turbut with whitings codling and large flounders  in the several creeks and openings on this shore are also other islands but of no great note except mersey which lies between the two openings of maldenwater and colchesterwater and is a place of such difficult access that it is thought a thousand men might keep possession of it against a great force whether by land or sea on this account and because if possessed by an enemy it would shut up all the navigation and fishery on that side a fort was built on the southeast point of it and generally in a dutch war a strong garrison is kept there to defend it  at this place may be said to end what we call the three hundreds of essex which include the marshy country viz barstable hundred rochester hundred and dengy hundred  one thing deserves mention here which is that all along this county it is very frequent to meet with men that have had from five or six to fourteen or fifteen wives and i was informed that in the marshes over against candy island was a farmer who was then living with the fiveandtwentieth and that his son who was but thirtyfive years old had already had about fourteen indeed this part of the story i only had by report though from good hands but the other is well known and will be attested about fobbing curringham thundersly benfleet prittlewell wakering great stambridge cricksea burnham dengy and other towns of the like situation the reason as a merry fellow told me who said he had had about a dozen was this that they being bred in the marshes themselves and seasoned to the place did pretty well but that they generally chose to leave their own lasses to their neighbors out of the marshes and went into the uplands for a wife that when they took the young women out of the wholesome fresh air they were clear and healthy but when they came into the marshes among the fogs and damps they presently changed complexion got an ague or two and seldom held it above half a year or a year at most and then said he we go to the uplands again and fetch another so that marrying of wives was reckoned a kind of good farm to them nor do the men in these parts hold it out as in other countries for we seldom meet with very ancient people among the poor insomuch that hardly one half of the inhabitants are natives of the place but such as come from other parts for the advantage of good farms  from the marshes and low grounds being not able to travel without many windings and indentures by reason of the creeks and waters i came up to the ancient town of malden situate at the conflux of two principal rivers the chelmer and the blackwater where they enter into the sea it is built in the form of a cross is a liberty in itself and has a convenient haven for ships it consists of one street near a mile long besides lanes etc it is governed by two bailiffs aldermen steward recorder etc here is a good public library for the use of the minister and the clergy of the hundreds adjoining to the sea and any gentleman may borrow a book upon depositing the value of it  the chanel called maldenwater is navigable to the town where by that means is a great trade for carrying corn by water to london the county of essex being especially on that side a great corn country king edward the elder resided here whilst he built the town and castle of witham in this county and also hertford castle  malden was a roman colony which camden diffidently conjectures to be the ancient camalodunum but mr salmon will have it to be the villa faustini which has been so long attributed to st edmundsbury but however that be it was here the britons under the valiant queen boadicea cut in pieces the tenth legion killed above  0000 romans and destroyed the colony but she was afterward overthrown herself in a great battle  0000 britons slain and herself and daughters most inhumanly treated and disgraced by those great reformers of the world who in her case forgot not only the honor due to the sex but that which the truly brave show to the brave in misfortune  being obliged to come thus far into the uplands i made it my road to pass through witham built as i mentioned by edward the elder it is a pleasant wellsituated market town in which and in its neighborhood are many gentlemen of good fortunes and families  nearer chelmsford hard by boreham is the famous seat of beaulieu in which king henry viii very much delighted it is the largest edifice in the county next audleyend where lived the late lord viscount barrington who had the advantage to be twice made heir to the estates of gentlemen not at all related to him at least one of them as is mentioned in his patent of creation he changed the name of shute for that of barrington by an act of parliament and had the dignities of a baron and viscount of ireland conferred on him by k geo i  the product of all this part of the country is corn as that of the marshy feeding grounds is grass where their chief business is breeding of calves which i need not say are the best and fattest and the largest veal in england if not in the world  kelvedon or as it is commonly called keldon lies within three miles of witham which as it is said derives its name from killdane the massacre of the danes being begun here by the women but as neither mr camden nor any author of credit mentions it i think the story is not to be heeded  colchester the iciani of the romans according to mr salmon is pleasantly situated upon an eminence above the river coln it is a large and populous town adorned with handsome streets and though it cannot be said to be finely built yet there are abundance of good houses in it in the conclusion of the late civil war it suffered a severe siege which as it made a resolute defense was turned into a blockade wherein the garrison and inhabitants also suffered the utmost extremity of hunger and were at last obliged to surrender at discretion when their two chief officers sir charles lucas and sir george lisle were shot to death under the castlewall  the battered walls the breaches in the turrets and the ruined churches still show marks of this siege except that the church of st mary where they had the royal fort is rebuilt but the steeple which was twothirds battered down the besieged having a large culverin upon it which did much execution remains still in that condition  the lines of contravallation which surrounded the whole town and the forts of the besiegers remain very visible in many places  the river coln which passes through the town encompasses it on the north and east and served in times of war for a complete defense on those sides there are three bridges over it and it is navigable within three miles of the town for ships of large burden a little lower it may receive even a royal navy and up to that part called the hithe close to the houses it is navigable for hoys and small barks for which it is indebted to three acts of parliament passed for that purpose one in the reign of king william iii one in that of king george i and the other in that of king george ii  this hithe is a long street passing from west to east on the south side of the town and is so populous toward the river that it may be called the wapping of colchester there is one church in that part of the town a large quay by the river and a good customhouse  the town chiefly subsists by the trade of making bays though indeed all the towns around carry on the same trade as kelvedon witham coggshall braintree bocking etc and the whole county large as it is may be said to be employed and in part maintained by the spinning of wool for the baytrade of colchester and its adjacent towns  the town of colchester has been supposed to contain about  0000 people including the outvillages within its liberty of which there are a great many the liberty of the town being of a large extent the government is by a mayor highsteward a recorder or his deputy eleven aldermen a chamberlain a town clerk assistants and eighteen commoncouncilmen  there are in colchester eight churches besides those which are damaged and five meeting houses whereof two for quakers besides one dutch and one french church its other public edifices are    bayhall where the goodness of the manufacture of bays made in this town is ascertained by a corporation established for this purpose consisting of a set of men called governors of the dutch bayhall    the guild hall of the town called by them the moothall contiguous to which is the towngaol    the workhouse for the poor which has been enlarged of late years    a grammar free school which has good allowance to the master who is chosen by the town    the castle of colchester is a monument of the antiquity of the place it being built as the walls of the town also are with roman bricks and the roman coins dug up here and ploughed up in the fields adjoining confirm it the inhabitants boast much that helena the mother of constantine the great first christian emperor of the romans was born there but it would be hard to make it out and indeed were it our business we could produce strong proofs to the contrary mr camden says that this castle was in his time ready to fall with age and yet it has stood above   0 years since and perhaps is not much worse than it was then although it received several cannon shot in the last siege of the town which made no impression upon it as the besiegers found and therefore left off firing against it and the rather as the garrison made no great use of it against them the queens head in the marketplace and the stable are also roman buildings there was likewise a roman military way from colchester by braintree dunmow and farther that way  there are two charityschools set up here and carried on by a generous subscription with very good success  from colchester i took a turn down to the coast the land running out a great way into the sea south and southeast makes that promontory of land called the nase wellknown to seamen who use the northern trade here one sees a sea open as an ocean without any opposite shore though it be no more than the mouth of the thames this point called the nase and the northeast point of kent near margate called the northforeland make the mouth of the river and the port of london though it be here above  0 miles over  but as it is pretended by some that according to the present usage of the customhouse the port of london is not allowed to extend so far it is thought proper to insert the clause taken from the act of parliament establishing the extent of that port  to prevent all future differences and disputes touching the extent and limits of the port of london the said port is declared to extend and be accounted from the promontory or point called the northforeland in the isle of thanet and from thence northward in a right line to the point called the nase beyond the gunfleet upon the coast of essex and so continued westward throughout the river thames and the several channels streams and rivers falling into it to london bridge saving the usual and known rights liberties and privileges of the ports of sandwich and ipswich and either of them and the known members thereof and of the customers comptrollers searchers and their deputies of and within the said ports of sandwich and ipswich and the several creeks harbors and havens to them or either of them respectively belonging within the counties of kent and essex  notwithstanding which the port of london as in use since the said order is understood to reach no farther than gravesend in kent and tilburypoint in essex and the ports of rochester milton and feversham belong to the port of sandwich  in like manner the ports of harwich colchester wyvenhoe malden leigh etc are said to be members of the port of ipswich  this observation may suffice for what is needful to be said upon the same subject when i come to speak of the port of sandwich and its members and their privileges with respect to rochester milton feversham etc in my circuit through the county of kent  at walton under the nase they find on the shore copperasstones in great quantities and there are several large works called copperashouses where it is made with great expense  on the northforeland is a new mark erected by the trinityhouse men at the public expense being a round brick tower near  0 feet high the sea gains so much upon the land here by the continual winds at southwest that within the memory of some of the inhabitants above  0 acres of land have been lost in one place  from hence we go back into the county about four miles because of the creeks which lie between and turning east again come to harwich on the utmost eastern point of this large county  harwich is a town strong by situation and may be made more so by art the harbor or road is one of the securest in england and covered at the entrance by landguardfort and a battery of guns to the seaward just as at tilbury and which sufficiently defend the mouth of the river though the entrance or opening of the river into the sea is very wide especially at high water at least two miles if not three over yet the chanel in which the ships must keep and come to the harbor is deep narrow and lies only on the side of the fort so that all the ships which come in or go out must come within gunshot of the fort  the fort is on the suffolk side of the bay but stands so far into the sea upon the point of a sand or shoal running out toward the essex side that in a manner it covers the mouth of the haven and our surveyors of the country affirm it to be in the county of essex the making this place which was formerly no other than a sand in the sea solid enough for the foundation of so good a fortification cost many years labor frequent repairs and a prodigious expense but it is now so firm that neither storms nor tides affect it  the harbor is of a vast extent for the river stour from maningtree and river orwel from ipswich empty themselves here and the channels of both are large and deep and safe for all weathers and where they join they make a large bay or road able to receive the biggest ships of war and the greatest number that ever the world saw together in the dutch war great use was made of this harbor and there have been  00 sail of men of war with their attendants and between   and  00 sail of colliers all riding in it at a time with great safety and convenience  harwich is the port where the packetboats between england and holland go out and come in the inhabitants are far from being famed for good usage to strangers but on the contrary are esteemed a little extravagant in their reckonings in the publickhouses this has encouraged the setting up of sloops which they now call passageboats to go directly from the river of thames to holland though the passage may be something longer yet the masters of the sloops are said to be more obliging to passengers and more reasonable in the expense and the vessels good seaboats harwich has been a sufferer on this account  the people of harwich boast that their town is walled and their streets paved with clay and yet that one is as strong and the other as clean as those that are built or paved with stone the fact is indeed true for there is a sort of clay in the cliff between the town and the beaconhill adjoining which when it falls down into the sea where it is beaten with the waves and the weather turns gradually into stone but the chief reason assigned is from the water of a certain spring or well which rising in the cliff runs down into the sea among those pieces of clay and petrifies them as it runs and the force of the sea often stirring and perhaps turning the lumps of clay when storms of wind may give force enough to the water causes them to harden everywhere alike otherwise those which were not quite sunk in the water of the spring would be petrified but in part these stones are gathered up to pave the streets and build the houses and are indeed very hard it is also remarkable that some of them taken up before they are thoroughly petrified will upon breaking them appear to be hard as a stone without and soft as clay in the middle whereas others that have lain a due time shall be thorough stone to the center and full as hard within as without the same spring is said to turn wood into iron but this i take to be no more or less than the quality which as i mentioned of the shore at the ness is found to be in much of the stone along this shore of the copperas kind and it is certain that the copperasstone so called is found in all that cliff and even where the water of this spring has run and i presume that those who call the hardened pieces of wood which they take out of this well by the name of iron never tried the quality of it with the fire or hammer if they had it is not unlikely that they would have given some other account of it  on the promontory of land which they call beaconhill which lies beyond or behind the town toward the sea is a lighthouse to give the ships direction in their sailing by as well as their coming into the harbor at night  this town was formerly fortified but in the reign of king charles i the fortifications were demolished it has since been ordered to be fortified again and ground has been bought accordingly to the kings use by act of parliament but there is nothing more done in it yet and indeed it is many years since the government having a better security in the british shipping have had occasion to fortify towns to the landward  it was incorporated in the   th of edward ii the harwich men pretended a grant from edw iii to take customduties for goods coming into the haven till on a complaint made by the town of ipswich that it was an infringement upon their liberties an inquisition was appointed by that prince at ipswich in the   th of his reign by which it was determined against harwich in favor of ipswich  harwich after all may be said to be a neat clean well built town enjoys a good maritime trade is governed by a mayor etc has a market every tuesday and friday and two annual fairs one on may day the other on october the   th  landguardfort was built in the reign of king james i and was a much more considerable fortification than at present having had four bastions named the kings the queens hollands and warwicks mounted with  0 very large guns particularly those on the royal bastion where the kings standard was displayed which would throw a    pound ball over harwich and it had a constant garrison with a chapel and many houses for the governor gunners and other officers but it has been demolished and a small platform made instead of it by the waterside but yet as the particular current of the chanel which ships must keep in as i have said obliges them to pass just by the fort the harbor is sufficiently defended on the seaside from sudden invasion  and now being at the extremity of the county of essex of which i have given you some view as to that side next the sea only i shall conclude this part of my circuit by telling you that i will take the towns which lie more toward the center of the county in my return by the north and west part that i may give you a few hints of some towns which were near me in my rout this way  on the road from london to colchester before i came into it at witham lie four good market towns at near equal distance from one another viz rumford brentwood ingatstone and chelmsford rumford stands first and is noted for two markets one for calves and hogs the other for corn and other provisions mostly bought up for london market  at the farther end of this town in the middle of a stately park stood guldyhall vulgarly giddyhall an ancient seat of one sir thomas coke lord mayor of london anno      in the reign of edward iv whose great riches being his principal crime exposed him in bad times to so great sufferings that though he was acquitted by the integrity of his judge of the crimes laid to his charge yet he was fined to the value very nearly of his whole estate it is since pulled down to the ground and there now stands a stately mansion house built upon the spot by sir john eyles lately lord mayor of london  brentwood and ingatstone are two others and are large thoroughfare towns full of good inns chiefly maintained by the multitude of carriers and passengers constantly passing this way to london with droves of cattle provisions and manufactures  chelmsford is the  th chiefly supported by the fame business it is the countytown where the assizes are often held and stands on the conflux of two rivers the chelmer whence the town derives its name and the cann and has a good free school belonging to it  southeast of brentwood lies billiricay a pretty considerable market town  near chelmsford stands a seat of the right honorable the earl of fitzwalter which is seen on the left hand of the road just before you enter the town the house is large and has been lately new fronted so that it makes a handsome appearance there are also several new plantations about it and in time if his lordship continues his design of improving it it will become a fine seat  i shall take notice in my return through these parts of the noble seat of the lord petre and his lordships great improvements in this county  at lees or leespriory as some call it is to be seen an ancient house in the middle of a beautiful park formerly the seat of the duke of manchester but after the death of the duke it was sold to the duchess dowager of buckinghamshire and since purchased by mr hoare  five market towns fill up the rest of this part of the country dunmow braintree thaxted halsted and coggshall all noted for the manufacture of bays but dunmow i must particularly mention on account of its famous old story of its flitch of bacon which is this  one robert fitzwalter a powerful baron in this county in the time of henry iii instituted a custom in the priory here that whatever married man did not repent of his being married or differ and dispute with his wife within a year and a day after his marriage and would swear to the truth of it kneeling upon two hard pointed stones in the priory churchyard set up for that purpose in presence of the prior and convent such person should have a flitch of bacon  this has been actually claimed and received as appears by record there but the priory being dissolved there is an end of the flitch and it were well if no worse consequence had attended the dissolution of religious houses for as there was no danger of many claimants there were the fewer to regret the loss  of braintree and bocking i shall take notice in my return to london  formerly it is thought the forests of epping and henault took up all the south part of the county but particularly we are assured that it reached to the river chelmer and into dengy hundred and from thence again west to epping and waltham where it continues to be a forest still  probably that of epping has been a weald or forest ever since this island has been inhabited and may show us in some parts of it where enclosures and tillage have not broke in upon it what the general face of this island was before the romans landed in britain  the constitution of this forest is best seen as to its antiquity by the pleasant grant of it from edward the confessor before the norman conquest to randolph peperking one of his favorites who was after called peverell and whose name remains still in several villages in this county as particularly that of hatfield peverell in the road from chelmsford to witham which is supposed to be originally a park called a field in those days and hartfield may be as much as to say a park for deer for the stags were in those days called hearts so that this was neither more nor less than randolph peperkings hartfield or deerpark  this randolph or ralph peverell had it seems a beautiful lady to his wife who was daughter of ingelrick one of edward the confessors noblemen he had two sons by her william peverell a famed soldier and lord or governor of dovercastle which he surrendered to william the conqueror after the battle in sussex and pain peverell his youngest who was lord of cambridge when the eldest son delivered up the castle the lady abovenamed was there and the conqueror fell in love with her and had a son by her who was called william after the conquerors christian name but retained the name of peverell and was afterward as history acquaints us created by the conqueror lord of nottingham  this lady as is supposed by way of penance for her frailty founded a nunnery at the village of hatfieldpeverell mentioned above where she lies buried in the parish church and her memory is preserved by a tombstone under one of the windows the grant i have mentioned being to be found in camden i shall not transcribe it here  i shall now in pursuance of my first design proceed to the county of suffolk  from harwich therefore having a mind to view the harbor i sent my horses round by maningtree a good but dirty market town where there is a timberbridge over the stour or as it is more usually called maningtreewater and took a boat for ipswich up the river orwel known best by the name of ipswichwater by which passage from harwich to ipswich it is about twelve miles  in a creek in this river called lavingtoncreek we saw at low water such shoals of muscles tha great boats might have loaded with them and the quantity scarce diminished to the eye near this creek sir samuel barnardiston had a fine seat as also a decoy for wild ducks and a very noble estate but it is divided into many branches since his death  ipswich is seated at the distance of    miles from harwich upon the edge of the river which taking a short turn to the west the town forms there a kind of semicircle or half moon upon the bank of the river it is very remarkable that though ships of  00 tuns may upon a springtide come up very near this town and many ships of that burden have been built there yet the river is scarce navigable above the town not even for the smallest boats nor does the tide which rises sometimes    or    feet and gives them    feet water very near the town flow much farther up the river than the town  no place in britain is qualified like ipswich for carrying on the greenland fishery whether we respect the cheapness of building and fitting out their ships and shalloops furnishing victualling and providing them with all kind of stores convenience for laying up the ships after the voyage room for erecting their magazines warehouses roapwalks cooperages ande on the easiest terms and especially for the noisome cookery which attends the boiling their blubber which may be on this river remote from any places of resort then the nearness to the market for the oil when it is made and which above all ought to be regarded the convenience that arises from this consideration that the same wind which carries them from the mouth of the haven is fair to the very seas of greenland  ipswich was formerly much more considerable for trade than at present but yet it may be accounted a very neat and well built town and much larger than many cities carries on still a considerable maritime trade and though it is but thinly inhabited to what it has been yet whoever looks into the churches and meeting houses of a sunday will not even in this particular think so meanly of it as some have done  it has a very spacious marketplace in the midst of that is a fair cross in which is the cornmarket adjoining is the shambles or butchery very commodious and vulgarly but erroneously supposed to have been built by cardinal wolsey for it owes its original to a much later date viz to the  0th year of queen elizabeth behind this is the herbmarket and in a spacious street a little distant is a market for butter poultry and other country provisions and another for fish with which the town is served in great plenty it has five marketdays weekly tuesday and thursday for small meat wednesday and friday for fish and saturday for all sorts of provisions it has also five annual fairs one on april    one on may   and   one on july    one on the   th and   th of august for cattle also and the fifth on september    which is a very considerable one for butter and cheese to which the whole country round resort to furnish themselves with winter stores as do also many of the london dealers in those commodities who however are not suffered to buy till after the first three days of the fair  there are even now in this town    parishchurches out of    which there once were and two chapels in the corporationliberty out of several which have been demolished besides meeting houses etc and it once abounded with religious houses which have yielded to the fate of the times  here is also a fair town hall with a spacious council chamger and other commodious apartments a shirehall where the county sessions are held for the division of ipswich a large public library adjoining to a noble hospital founded by the town called christs hospital for the maintenance of poor children old persons maniacks and in it rogues vagabonds and sturdy beggars are kept to hard labor also adjoining to this is a good free school and there is likewise the noble foundation of mr henry tooly anno      for poor old men and women  it is a town corporate governed by two bailiffs a recorder    portmen four of which besides the bailiffs are justices of the peace two coroners    commoncouncilmen who are also highconstables and    of them headboroughs and    petty constables  its privileges are extraordinary for the bailiffs pass fines and recoveries hear and determine causes as well criminal as civil arising in the town and even crown causes preferably to any of his majestys courts at westminster they appoint the assize of bread wine beer etc no freeman can be obliged to serve on juries out of the town or bear any offices for the king without his own consent sheriffs for the county excepted nor are they obliged to pay any tolls or duties in any other parts of the kingdom having cast the city of london in a trial at law for duties demanded by the city of freemens ships in the river thames they are entitled to all waifs estrays etc to all goods cast on shore within their admiraltyjurisdiction which extends on the coast of essex beyond harwich and on both sides the suffolk coast and their bailiffs even hold their admiraltycourt beyond landguard fort etc and by a solemn decision in their favor by an inquisition taken at ipswich in the   th of edward iii they carried the point which harwich contested with them of taking customduties for goods coming into harwich haven which was determined to belong solely to the bailiffs and burgesses of ipswich as i before hinted in king johns reign there was a mint in this town  i shall just mention in this place though it be generally known that the famous cardinal wolsey archbishop of york was born in this town his father being a butcher in it though according to dr fiddes who published his will he seems to have been a man of substance for those times this prelate rose to the highest pitch of honor and grandeur that it was possible for a subject to attain to and was suddenly stripped of all having been cast in a praemunire whereby he incurred a forfeiture of all his effects and preferments and being afterward pardoned and restored to some part thereof particularly to the archbishopric of york he was arrested for high treason at his archiepiscopal palace at cawood in yorkshire and died at leicester abbey as he was carrying to london where he was buried  the french refugees when they first came over to england began a little to take to this place and some merchants attempted to set up a linen manufacture in their favor but it did not meet with the expected success and at present i find very little of it the poor people are however employed as they are all over those counties in spinning wool for other towns where manufactures are settled  the country round ipswich as are all the counties so near the coast is applied chiefly to corn of which a very great quantity is continually shipped off for london and sometimes they load corn here for holland especially if the market abroad is encouraging  there is a great deal of very good company in this town and though here are not so many of the gentry as at bury yet it has more than any other town in the county  i take this town to be one of the most agreeable places in england for families who have lived well but may be reduced to live within a narrow compass for   here are good houses at very easy rents   an airy clean and wellgoverned town   very agreeable and improving company almost of every kind   plenty of all manner of provisions whether fish or flesh very good of the kind and very cheap   easy passage to london either by land or water the coach going through to london in a day   the lord viscount hereford had a very fine seat and park in this town the house indeed was built in the ancient taste but very commodious it is called christchurch and had been a priory or religious house in former times the green and park is a great addition to the pleasantness of this town the inhabitants being allowed to divert themselves there with walking bowling etc this seat has been lately purchased by and is now in the possession of claude fonnereau esquire  the country round ipswich is an inexhaustible storehouse of timber of which now their trade of building ships is abated they send very great quantities to the kings buildingyards at chatham which by water is so little a way that they often run to it from the mouth of the river at harwich in one tide  i cannot omit in this place the following account of an excellent charity for the relief and support of the widows and orphans of poor clergymen of the county of suffolk which was begun in the year   0  by a voluntary subscription of a small number of gentlemen and clergy in and about ipswich and woodbridge and has since that time been carried on with such great success that the yearly collection which in   0  was but   l by gradual advances every year amounted in the year    0 to     l   s   d and in the whole    years to the sum of      l   s   d  besides the yearly subscriptions there have been diverse gifts and legacies given to the said society to the uses abovementioned to the amount of     l    s so much of which is laid out in south sea annuities and kept for raising a capital stock for the general benefit of the charity and the interest arising from it has been and still is every year applied to the relief and support of the said widows and orphans that they may not mourn without a comforter and that the sons and daughters of the poor clergy entitled to this relief may not be suffered to wander as vagabonds up and down the earth exposed to those miseries and temptations which attend upon extreme poverty  from ipswich i took a turn to hadley famous for the martyrdom of dr rowland tailor who was burnt at aldham common anno      on the place where he was martyred i observed a stone with this inscription anno      dr tailor for defending what was good in this place shed his blood   it has been a town corporate governed by a mayor etc but a quo warranto being brought against their charter in the reign of king james ii it has not been renewed since here are two weekly markets and two annual fairs it deals much in corn and abounds with all manner of provisions the town is large and tolerably well built but being in a bottom is generally dirty its church is a very handsome building graced with a spire steeple and being near the middle of the town is an ornament to it it is of some note still for the manufacture of woollen cloths but not so much as formerly  a little to the southwest lies neyland a large market town in a bottom upon the stour over which is a very good bridge the baystrade is carried on here too  higher up to the northwest upon the same river stands sudbury situate on the stour which is now made navigable for barges from maningtree hither and gives a great addition to their trade it is a very ancient town governed by a mayor and at present consists of three distinct parishes which have each a handsome and large church the names of which are st gregorys st peters and all saints though st peters is rather a chapel of ease to st gregorys this town is pretty well built but the streets being unpaved are dirty it has an handsome bridge over the stour leading into essex this town was one of the first places where king edward iii placed the flemings whom he allured hither to teach the english the art of manufacturing their own wool of which before they knew nothing and here the woollen trade has continued ever since in a flourishing way the inhabitants at present employ themselves in making says perpetuanas etc  simon theobald surnamed sudbury archbishop of canterbury translated thither from london anno      was a native of this town he was murdered at the instigation of one john ball a seditious and fanatical preacher in wat tylers rebellion he was a prelate of very good character for learning and charity he built the upperend of st gregorys church in sudbury where his head is still shown it was not long since entire covered with the flesh and skin dried by art the mouth wide open occasioned by convulsions through the hard death he died having suffered eight blows before his head was cut off he founded in the place where his fathers house stood a neat college which he furnished with secular priests and other ministers and likewise endowed it bountifully  near sudbury is melford a pleasant village and perhaps the largest in england being about a mile in length the church is a very fine edifice and stands at the northend of it there were two chantries in it weaver says that on some part of the outside of the church are these words pray for the souls of john clopton and richard boteler of whose goodys this chapel was built and that several of the ancient family of clopton are there buried this town has given two lord mayors to london sir john milburn draper in      and sir roger martin mercer in      it has an annual fair diverse good inns many handsome houses and creditable inhabitants here lived the unhappy mr drew who in the year      was barbarously murdered and his son mr charles drew executed for it who effected it either with his own hands or by those of another person whom he procured to do it for the sake of enjoying his estate the parricide was attended with circumstances of great horror but the particulars being well known and the fact so recent i shall not say any more of it here  in my way from hence to st edmondsbury i passed due north through lavenham or lanham a pretty good town standing upon a branch of the river breton it has a spacious marketplace which was formerly of much better account than at present it had many years ago great advantage from its trade in blue cloths but though this is lost yet it has a good trade for serges shalloons says etc made here spins a great deal of fine yarn for london and has of late flourished much by setting up a hall for selling wool the town being conveniently situated for that purpose  the church and steeple here are justly accounted the finest in the county it is situate on a hill on the west side of the town the steeple being     feet high it has six tuneable bells in it and the inhabitants boast much of their tenor which they say outdoes all the bells in england for its deep note and though it weighs but    hundred weight they say it sounds like a bell of  0 hundred this town is also remarkable for the many charitable bequests made to its poor and gave london a lord mayor in      in the person of sir thomas cook draper the son of robert cook of this town  east of lavenham and pretty near it is bildeston a market town noted for the cloathingtrade its good church its mean buildings and dirtiness  bury st edmunds is situate on the west side of the river lach which within these few years has been made navigable from lynn to fornham a mile north of the town it is so regularly built that almost all the streets cut one another at right angles it stands on an easy ascent and overlooks a most fruitful enclosed country on the south and southwest on the north and northwest the most delightful champain fields which extend themselves to lynn and that part of the norfolk coast and on the east the country is partly enclosed and partly open no wonder then that it is called the montpellier of suffolk and even of england and indeed a certain ancient author says no more than it deserves that the sun shines not upon a town more agreeable in its situation  it is governed by an alderman which is their chief magistrate a recorder    capital burgesses and    common burgesses  it has two plentiful weekly markets on wednesdays and saturdays and three annual fairs one three days before and three days after the feast of st matthew and it is generally protracted to an uncertain length for the diversion of the nobility and gentry that resort to it in great numbers  the abbey once so famous was first built of wood by sigebert king of the east angles soon after christianity was planted here and when finished about the year     that king retired into it and shut himself up from the world  king edmund from whom the town takes its name began to reign over the east angles anno     in the   th year of his age and reigned    years being killed anno   0 as supposed at hoxne at    years old and his corpse was    years after removed to bury the abbey being much enriched thereby the monks who were of the benedictine order found means about the year  0 0 to get it entirely to themselves excluding the seculars and king canute in the  th year of his reign founded a more magnificent church in honor of st edmund which was finished in    years and dedicated to christ st mary and st edmund  uvius prior of hulm who was consecrated the first abbot anno  0 0 got the abbey exempted from episcopal jurisdiction and encompassed that and the town with a wall and ditch the ruins of which in several places are still to be seen and the abbots afterward were made parliamentary barons but in the reign of king henry viii it run the common fate of all religious houses and that prince put an end to all its glory  when the abbey was in its prosperity there was a chapel at every one of the five gates and the town abounded with chapels and oratories it is possible these might be hospitals for there was an hospital of st peters without rishy gate an hospital of st saviors without northgate an hospital of st nicolas at or near eastgate and godshouse or st johns at the southgate a college of priests with a gild to the holy or sweet name of jesus the situation of which i could not find and an house of gray friars at babwell or the tollgate but at this time there are only two churches which indeed are very beautiful and stately and stand in the same churchyard the one dedicated to st mary the other built in the reign of edward vi to st james the latter has a convenient library and at the west end of the south isle are interred james reynolds esquire late lord chief baron of the exchequer and his lady to whose memories two large monuments are erected the church of st mary has on the northside of the altar to which we approach by a fine ascent of six steps the tomb of mary queen of france sister to henry viii and wife to charles brandon duke of suffolk her coffin is of lead and has this inscription on it mary queen      of france edmund h   there are other handsome monuments in this church  the other most remarkable public buildings are the abbeygate which is still a fine monument of what the abbey once was the guild hall the woolhall the shirehouse the marketcross and the grammar school endowed by king edward vi  such as is the town for situation is the neighborhood and gentry about it for politeness and no place glories in brighter ladies or better families  in the pathway between the two churches it was that arundel coke esquire a barrister at law in the year      attempted with the assistance of one woodbourne a barbarous assassin an unheard of outrage on his brotherinlaw edward cris esquire for the sake of possessing what he had he had invited him his wife and family to supper with him and in the night on pretense of going to see a friend to them both he led him into the churchyard when on a signal he gave the assassin made at mr crisp with a hedgebill and in a most terrible manner mangled his head and face and supposing him dead there left him and coke returned as if he knew nothing of the matter to the company but it happening that mr crisp was not killed and coming back to cokes house to the company all bloody and cruelly mangled the shocking sight amazed and confounded them all coke that he was not dead the rest that he had met with so strange a disaster mr crisp has survived this outrage many years and coke and woodburne the hired assassin were justly executed for a villainy so detestable that it hardly had its parallel the gentleman being not killed the assassins were tried and condemned on the statute for defacing and dismembring called the coventry act and coke was so good a lawyer and so hardened a wretch that he thought to have saved himself by pleading that he intended not to deface but to kill some nice people say the law was a little strained in their punishment as the gentleman recovered but surely if in any case the letter might be dispensed with and the spirit be brought in aid of it it was right in this and it would have been next to a national disgrace not to have a law that would reach so flagrant and complicated a wickedness  there is very little or no manufacturing in this town except spinning the chief business of the place depending upon the neighboring gentry who cannot fail to cause trade enough by the expense of their families and equipages among the people of a country town our monarchs edward i and ii had a mint at bury and some of their pennies coined there are yet remaining stow in his survey of london p    says that here was also a mint in king johns time  this town is famous for two great events one that a parliament was held here in the year      in the   th year of henry vi the other that at the meeting of this parliament the good humphry duke of gloucester regent of the kingdom during the absence of king henry v and in the minority of his son henry vi and to his last hour the safeguard of the whole nation and darling of the people was basely murdered here by whose death the gate was opened to that dreadful war between the houses of lancaster and york which ended in the confusion of the very race who are supposed to have contrived that murder  as i made some stay at ipswich and bury being obliged to wait the leisure of a gentleman who accompanied me part of this journey i made several excursions more inland than i had at first intended when i set out and visited the following towns  as first boxford which is about seven miles from sudbury and is a neat and well built village and carries on a considerable traffic  at bures on the stour king edward was crowned and not at bury it has a good bridge on that river anno      the spire of the steeple of the handsome church here was burnt by lightning the bellframes destroyed and the bells melted  clare is situate on the stour about    miles from bury and is but a poor town and dirty the streets being unpaved but yet the civil and spiritual courts are held at it and it has a good church and shows still the ruins of a strong castle and an old monastery it gives title of earl to his grace the duke of newcastle of the pelham family as it did to that of holles before  not far from clare is honedon where in the year      the sexton digging a grave found a large quantity of saxon coins  cavendish upon the stour deserves mention for giving name to the noble family of the dukes of devonshire  haverhill stands partly in essex and partly in suffolk by the ruins of a church and castle still to be seen here it appears to have been of greater consequence formerly than at present now i am at this place i shall just mention  ledgate on account of its giving birth and name to the famous poet orator mathematician and philosopher john ledgate who died in    0 here are to be seen the ruins of a strong castle  stoke juxta neyland gave a lord mayor to london in   0  viz sir william capel of the drapers company from whom is descended the present earl of essex it has a fair church and steeple giffards hall in this parish is a noble old seat belonging to sir francis mannock bart and penderinghall is the newbuilt fair seat of sir john williams alderman of london  stratford is a thoroughfare village of great traffic and is employed in the woollen manufactures  easterbergholt near four miles from stratford and half a mile north of the stour is a large and handsome village employed in the woollen way but not to so great a degree as formerly it has a good church but the steeple is in ruins and the bells are rung by hand in a kind of cage set up in the churchyard a little south of the church is an elegant house of sir joseph hankey alderman of london  hemingston may bear the mention for the merry tenure by which that manor was held according to camden by serjeanty the possessor being obliged every christmas day to perform before the king one saltus one sufflatus and one bombulus or as is read elsewhere it was held by a saltus a sufflatus and a pet that is as camden interprets the words he was to dance make a noise with his cheeks puffed out and let a f  t  needham is a thoroughfare town about nine miles northwest from ipswich it is tolerably well built has several considerable dealers in it and formerly carried on a large trade in the woollen manufactures which it has lost for some years  bildeston is a meanly built dirty town but has a good church  stowmarket about three miles from needham is a tolerable town with a spacious church and spiresteeple  and five miles further being eight from bury is wulpit famous for the white bricks made there it has a handsome church and spiresteeple  at norton near wulpit king henry viii was induced to dig for gold he was disappointed but the diggings are visible at this day  ixworth about seven miles from bury is a dirty illbuilt town with a mean market but is a thoroughfare town and has two annual fairs  botesdale is a long meanbuilt dirty thoroughfare town yet it is remarkable for a grammar free school founded by sir nicolas bacon and established by queen elizabeth the master and usher are to be elected out of bennet college cambridge where sir nicolas was educated the master enjoys a salary of  0 pounds per annum besides the benefit of the schoolhouse and the usher eight pounds with a house and yard the schoolhouse is now in the gift of edmund britiffe esquire sir nicolas also bequeathed  0 l a year to the said college for six scholars out of this school to whom likewise archbishop tenison was said to have given six pounds annually there is a mean market here every thursday and an annual fair on holy thursday  mildenhall about    miles from bury is situate on the river lark it is a town of very extensive limits pleasant and well built and has a noble church and lofty steeple it has a plentiful friday market and a very considerable annual fair which lasts four days a little north of the church is the mansion house of sir thomas hanmer bart who in the reign of queen anne was speaker of the house of commons in the year   0  a great part of this town was consumed by fire it furnished the city of london with two lord mayors sir henry barton skinner anno      and sir william gregory of the same company anno       ickworth was once a parish but now is a noble park in which is the seat of the earl of bristol it is a place of great antiquity and what confirms it is what that learned antiquarian dr battley archdeacon of canterbury writes that in his memory a large pot of roman money was found here  debenham is a tolerably clean though meanbuilt town and among very dirty and heavy roads being seated on a hill the church is a good building the marketplace tolerable and there is a free school founded by appointment of sir robert hitcham  crowshall about a mile southeast of this town was formerly the seat of the gawdies till sir charles gaudy bart conveyed it to john pit esquire in a descendant of whose family it still remains  mendlesham is a dirty and poor town but has a handsome church and a small tuesdays market  eye is a town corporate governed by two bailiffs ten principal burgesses and    commoncouncilmen and gives title of baron to the lord cornwallis it is situate in a bottom between two rivers is meanly built and the streets dirty near the west end of the church are still to be seen some of the ruinous walls of the castle  my friend having finished his business in those parts of suffolk which lie round the towns of bury and ipswich gave me an opportunity of resuming my journey according to the plan i laid down at the beginning of the letter and so from the former of these towns i returned by stowmarket and needham to ipswich that i might keep as near the coast as was proper to my designed circuit having determined to take the opportunity which he told me his affairs would give me of making two or three excursions from woodbridge aldborough and southwould to make my observations on that part of suffolk which i have not yet touched upon from ipswich therefore i went to visit the sea again and so to woodbridge and from thence to orford on the sea coast  woodbridge is a market town situate on the river deben about    miles from the sea this river being navigable to the town for ships of considerable burden it drives a pretty good trade with holland newcastle and london and has passage hoys that go to and return from london weekly it has a fine church and steeple and traded formerly in sackcloth and now in refining salt the shirehall is a handsome pile of building where the quarter sessions for this part of the county are held and under it is the corncross one street in it called stonestreet is well built and paved but the rest are dirty the marketplace and thoroughfare are also well enough built but the rest of the town is mean the quays and warehouses are very commodious and here is a grammar school and an almshouse erected in      by thomas seckford master of the requests for thirteen men and three women which is well endowed it has a pretty good market on wednesdays and two annual fairs  walton has been an ancient market town and though the market is now disused the cross is still remaining in the neighboring parish of felixstow on the cliff by the sea and about a mile from the colne side of woodbridgehaven are discerned the ruins of a quadrangular castle advantageously situated of which nothing now remains but the foundation of one side of the wall the rest has been devoured by the sea and in all probability these remains must in a few years undergo the same fate it was built principally of rockstones but the many roman bricks still to be seen and roman coins which have been discovered among the ruins of the side walls as they have been washed away by the sea in the present age are an undeniable evidence that it was a place of considerable antiquity probably a roman colony which might give name to the hundred of colnies in which it stood  now begins that part which is ordinarily called highsuffolk which being a rich soil is for a long way wholly employed in dairies and famous for the best butter and perhaps the worst cheese in england the butter is barrelled and sometimes pickled up in small casks in which it keeps so well that i have know a firkin of suffolk butter sent to the west indies and brought back to england again perfectly good and sweet as at first  from hence turning down to the shore we see orfordness a noted point of land for the guide of the colliers and coasters and a good shelter for them to ride under when a strong northeast wind blows and makes a foul shore on the coast  orford is situate on the northwest side of the river ore whence it had its name it was formerly a town of good account having a strong castle of reddish stone for its defense of which and of a benedictine nunnery near the quay there are still to be seen considerable ruins the sea has so much withdrawn itself from this town that it is robbed of its chief advantage and deserves not the name of a harbor the town is mean and no one contends for an interest in it but such as want to make themselves a merit in the choice of the two members which it returns to parliament it is a town corporate and is governed by a mayor eight portmen and twelve burgesses it has also a mean monday market and an annual fair it had the honor to give title of earl to the brave admiral russel but that is now extinct  about three miles from orford is aldburgh a town pleasantly situated in a valley it has two streets each near a mile long but its breadth which was more considerable formerly is not proportionable and the sea has of late years swallowed up one whole street the town though meanly built is clean and well peopled in the seafaring way the sea washes the east side of it and the river ald runs not far from the southend of it affording a good quay in the adjacent seas sprats soles and lobsters are caught in abundance the town trades to newcastle for coals and from hence corn is transported the manor of aldburgh as also the manors of scots and taskards in the neighborhood formerly belonged to the monastery of snape and were first granted with that monastery to cardinal wolsey and soon after to thomas duke of norfolk aldburgh is pretty well situated for strength and has several pieces of cannon for its defense the church which is a good edifice stands on a hill a little west of the town it is a town corporate governed by two bailiffs ten capital burgesses and twentyfour inferior officers  from aldburgh i passed through saxminden a little dirty market town to dunwich a very ancient town which by roman coins dug up there is supposed to have been a roman station in the reign of the conqueror it was so considerable a place that it had   0 burgesses and was valued to that king at  0 l and  0000 herrings we read that in the reign of henry ii it was a very famous village well stored with riches and fortified with a rampart some remains of which still appear  before these times in the reign of king sigebert anno   0 dunwich was a bishops see and so continued till the conqueror made his chaplain bishop of it and translated the sea to thetford which was afterward translated from thence to norwich  there were several religious houses in dunwich and some pretend no less than fifty churches but there is a certain account of six parishchurches and three chapels besides the several religious houses four of these parishchurches and the three chapels have been long devoured by the sea and one of the others met with the same fate in this age so that there is only one now standing and what remains of this once famous place is but a pitiful parcel of sorry cottages  hereabouts they begin to talk of herrings and the fishery and here also and at swole or southwould the next seaport they cure sprats in the same manner as they do herrings at yarmouth  from dunwich we went to southwould pleasantly situated on a hill and almost surrounded with the sea and the river biyth over which it has a bridge it drives a considerable trade in salt and old beer and in herrings sprats etc the church is large and very strong the bay called corruptly sowl or solebay is a commodious place for anchorage and occasions a great resort of mariners to it which adds greatly to its trade and commerce  the traffic of my friend at woodbridge aldburgh and this place gave me the opportunity i hinted at of making excursions into the maininland parts of suffolk adjacent to those towns which i shall transcribe from my memorandumbook in the order i set them down  ufford is at present of no great remark but has the ruins of a chapel called sogenhoc chapel richard lufkin was rector of this parish    years and was buried september         in the    th year of his age he performed all the offices of his function to the last and preached the sunday before his death he was plundered in the grand rebellion and lost all that he had except a silver spoon which he preserved by hiding it in his sleeve  in the hundred of hartsmere stands broom a noble old mansion which for many ages has been the seat of the noble family of cornwallis in this parish of broom is an almshouse for poor widows fronting the hall but not endowed  wickham market is situated about four miles from woodbridge the church is built on a hill and though but    yards high affords the best prospect of any in suffolk for in a clear day near  0 parishchurches may be seen from it it is now only a village but has some trade and the civil and spiritual courts are held in it  snape was once noted for a famous monastery few remains of which are to be seen it has a considerable annual fair for horses which lasts four days beginning august    to which the london jockeys resort  at sudbourne is a fine seat of the lord viscount hereford  at easton is the seat of the earl of rochford formerly belonging to the wingfield family  letheringham was of note for a little priory which was obtained at the dissolution by sir antony wingfield and sir henry spelman tells us that as a judgment for the sacrilege he died without issue male it was converted into a mansion house and is now the seat of the ancient family of the nauntons sir roger naunton was in the reign of king james i secretary of state and master of the court of wards and liveries he died anno    0 in the abbey is a long gallery adorned with several valuable pictures and in letheringham church are some elegant and magnificent monuments of the wingfields and nauntons  rendelsham was anciently famous for being the royal residence of redwald king of the east angles hugh fitzotho procured a market and fair for this town from king edward i digging here about  0 years ago an ancient silver crown was found weighing about  0 ounces supposed to have belonged to redwald or some other king of the east angles which was sold and melted down for the sake of the metal  at butley was a priory of canons regular founded by ranulph de glanville chief justice of england to the honor of the blessed virgin the ruins of the abbey which are still to be seen show it to have been very large and the gate house is a magnificent building it remains entire and is embellished in the front with many coats of arms finely cut in stone  framlingham is situate north of aldburgh a large town well built and pleasantly seated near the head of the river ore it has a spacious marketplace the church is built of black flint and is a very stately and noble edifice wherein several of the mowbrays dukes of norfolk lie buried the castle is a fair piece of antiquity being a large beautiful and strong building and contains within the walls now standing an acre   rood    perches and was formerly much larger its walls are    feet high and thick and are standing pretty entire and it has    towers    feet higher than the walls two of which are watchtowers it was both by art and nature formerly very strong there are two good almshouses and a free school founded by sir robert hitcham who is interred in the church for  0 poor boys who are taught to read write and cast accounts and  0 l is given to settle each of them apprentice this gentleman bought of the duke of norfolk the castle manor etc and gave them to pembrokehall in cambridge to this castle queen mary i retired when the lady jane was proclaimed queen by the northumberland faction  blithburg was formerly a place of good note but now has nothing to recommend it but its church which is a fine old building and kept in good repair  at chediston is the fine seat of walter plumer esquire who bought it lately and rebuilt the hall in a beautiful manner  halesworth is northeast of framlingham a large and good market town situated upon the river blyth which runs through it the streets are clean and partly paved it has a very neat church beautifully decorated within and is noted for linenyarn which is spun in the neighborhood and sold here  hoxne is the place where edmund king of the east angles was murdered by the pagan danes because he would not renounce his faith anno   0 and his body was removed to bury as abovementioned  bungay is a wellfrequented market town pleasantly situate upon and almost surrounded with the waveney which is navigable thither for barges it lies northeast of halesworth its streets are mostly unpaved but the town is handsome and well built since the great fire which broke out about sunrising on march         in a small uninhabited house and in four hours time consumed the whole town except one small street the whole loss was computed at       l and upwards it has two parishchurches one of which is a very noble one and has a beautiful steeple the ruins of a benedictine nunnery and a very strong castle are still to be seen here the latter was so strong that hugh bigod its owner in the wars between the empress maud and king stephen with the latter of whom he sided made this boast upon it were i in my castle of bungay upon the river waveney i would not care for the king of cockney   but yet he was forced afterward to compound with king henry ii for its preservation it has a grammar school with  0 scholarships for emanuel college cambridge  in this excursion i stretched to beccles still further northeast a large illbuilt market town situate on the waveney which is navigable hence from yarmouth to bungay as i have said it has a noble church and steeple and a grammar and english school well endowed it has a plentiful market and a common of above  000 acres the streets are well paved and clean but the houses are but ordinary the ruins of another church called ingate church are to be seen here which was formerly the parish church to the town  burghcastle situate at the mouth of the waveney was a place of considerable note in the time of the romans the walls on the east north and south sides are still standing pretty entire and the river being a defense on the west no wall was wanting there  i returned from these excursions to southwould in order to proceed on my journey according to my first plan but it may not be amiss to mention before i proceed that this town is made famous by an engagement at sea in the year      between the english and dutch fleets in the bay opposite to the town in which the brave montague earl of sandwich admiral under the duke of york lost his life his ship royal prince carrying  00 guns which was under him commanded by sir edward spragg was burnt and several other ships lost and about  00 seamen  at this town in particular and so at all the towns on this coast from orfordness to yarmouth is the ordinary place where our summer friends the swallows first land when they come to visit us and here they may be said to begin their voyage when they go back into warmer climates i was some years before at this place about the beginning of october and lodging in a house that looked into the churchyard i observed in the evening an unusual multitude of swallows sitting on the leads of the church and covering the tops of several houses round about this led me to inquire what was the meaning of such a prodigious multitude of swallows sitting there i was answered that this was the season when the swallows their food failing here began to leave us and return to the country wherever it be from whence they came and that this being the nearest land to the opposite coast and the wind contrary they were waiting for a gale and might be said to be windbound  this was more evident to me when in the morning i found the wind had come about to the northwest in the night and there was not one swallow to be seen  certain it is that the swallows neither come hither merely for warm weather nor retire merely from cold they like the shoals of fish in the sea pursue their prey being a voracious creature and feeding as they fly for their food is the insects of which in our summer evenings in damp and moist places the air is full and when cold weather comes in and kills the insects then necessity compels the swallows to quit us and follow their food to some other climate  this passing and repassing of the swallows is observed nowhere so much as on this eastern coast namely from above harwich to the east point of norfolk called wintertonness north which is opposite to holland we know nothing of them any farther north the passage of the sea being as i suppose too broad from flambro head and the shore of holderness in yorkshire etc  this part of england is remarkable for being the first where the feeding and fattening of sheep and other cattle with turnips was first practiced in england which is made a very great part of the improvement of their lands to this day and from whence the practice is spread over most of the east and south part of england to the great enriching of the farmers and increase of fat cattle and though some have objected against the goodness of the flesh thus fed with turnips and have fansied it would taste of the root yet upon experience it is found that there is no reason for this fancy  the county of suffolk is particularly famous for furnishing the city of london and all the counties round with turkeys insomuch that more turkeys are bred in this county and the part of norfolk that joins to it for sale than in all the rest of england  nor will this be found an inconsiderable article if it be true that  00 droves of turkeys have passed in one season over stratfordbridge on the river stour on the road from ipswich to london each drove generally containing from  00 to  000 turkeys which at  00 one with another will be   0000 in all and yet the numbers which are driven by new marketheath and the open country and the forest and also those by sudbury and clare are much greater  for the further supplies of the markets of london with poultry in which these countries particularly abound they have within these few years found it practicable to make the geese travel on foot too and prodigious numbers are brought up to london in like droves from the farthest parts of norfolk even from the fencountry about lynn downham wisbich and the washes as also from all the east side of norfolk and suffolk and it is very frequent now to meet  000 or  000 in a drove they begin to drive them generally in august when the harvest is almost over that the geese may feed on the stubble as they go thus they hold on to the end of october when the roads begin to be too stiff and deep for their broad feet and short legs to march in  besides such methods of driving these creatures on foot they have of late invented a new kind of carriage being carts formed on purpose with four stories or stages to put the poultry in one above another whereby one cart will carry a very great number and for the smoother going they drive with two horses abreast like a coach thus quartering the road for the ease of the poultry and changing horses they travel night and day so that they bring the fowls  0  0 or  00 miles in two days and one night the horses are fastened together by a piece of wood lying crosswise upon their necks by which they are kept even and together and the driver sits on the top of the cart as in the public carriages for the army etc  in this manner vast numbers of turkeypoults and chickens are carried to london every year which yield a good price at market and more out of this county than any other part of england which is the reason of my speaking of it here  in this part which we call high suffolk there are not so many families of gentry or nobility as in the other side of the country but it is observed that though their seats are not here their estates are and the pleasure of west suffolk is much of it supported by the wealth of high suffolk for the richness of the lands and application of the people to all kinds of improvement are scarce credible the farmers also are so very considerable and their farms and dairies so large that it is very frequent for a farmer to have  000 l stock upon his farm in cows only  from southwould coastwise i proceeded to leostoff a considerable market town standing near the sea it is indifferently well built the church which is situate near a mile on the west side of the town is a good building but for the ease of its inhabitants there is a chapel in the town wherein divine service is sometimes celebrated the ness below the northend of the town is since the washing away of eastonness the most eastern point of land in great britain its principal trade is fishing for herrings and maycril it has a noted market weekly on wednesdays and two small fairs yearly the one on the  st day of may and the other on the   th of september besides the present chapel here was formerly at the southend of the town a chapel called goodcrosschapel which has long since been destroyed by the sea this town having been part of the ancient demesnes of the crown has a charter and a townseal but the greatest privilege they now enjoy from their charter is that of not serving on juries either at the sessions or assizes  from high suffolk i passed the waveney near scholeinn and so came into norfolk  but i believe sir you will allow that i have written enough in all conscience for one letter i will therefore only further add that i am  your humble servant  letter ii containing a description of the counties of norfolk and cambridge and that part of essex not touched on in the former sir in my journey from high suffolk to norfolk i saw at redgrave the seat of the family a beautiful monument of that excellent judge sir john holt with the following inscription upon it m s d johannis holt equitis aur totius angliae in banco regis per    annos continuos regi annaeque reginae consiliarii perpetui libertatis ac legum anglicarum assertoris vindicis custodis vigilis acris and intrepidi frater unicus and haeres optime de se merito posuit die martii vto   0  sublatus est ex oculis nostris natus  0 decembris anno    0 in english thus sacred to the memory of sir john holt knight lord chief justice of the kings bench for the space of    years successively and of the privy council to king william and queen anne a vigilant penetrating and intrepid assertor vindicator and guardian of the liberty and laws of england  rowland his only brother and heir erected this monument to him who deserved all things at his hands he departed this life the fifth day of march anno   0  and was born the  0th of december anno         when we come into norfolk we see a face of diligence spread over the whole country the vast manufactures carried on chiefly by the norwich weavers employ all the country round in spinning yarn for them and also use many thousand packs of yarn which they receive from other countries even from as far as yorkshire and westmorland of which i shall speak in its place  this side of norfolk is very populous and filled with a great number of considerable market towns insomuch that between the borders of suffolk and the city of norwich on this side which is not above    miles in breadth are the following market towns viz thetford dis harling bucknam hingham west deerham attleboro windham harleston east deerham watton loddon etc most of these towns are very populous and large but that which is most remarkable is that the whole country round them is interspersed with villages so large and so full of people that they are equal to market towns in other counties  an eminent weaver of norwich gave me a scheme of their trade on this occasion by which calculating from the number of looms at that time employed in the city of norwich only he made it appear very plain that there were   0000 people busied in the woollen and silk manufactures of that city only not that the people all lived in the city though norwich is very large and populous but they were employed for spinning the yarn used for such goods as were all made in that city  this shows the wonderful extent of the norwich manufacture or stuffweaving trade by which so many thousand families are maintained  this throng of villages continues through all the east part of the country which is of the greatest extent and where the manufacture is chiefly carried on if any part of it be thin of inhabitants it is the west part drawing a line from about brandon south to walsingham north this part of the country indeed is full of open plains and somewhat sandy and barren but yet feeds great flocks of good sheep  norwich is the capital of the county and the center of all the trade and manufactures which i have just mentioned an ancient large rich and populous city if a stranger was only to ride through or view the city of norwich on ordinary days he would be induced to think it a town without inhabitants but on the contrary if he was to view the city either on a sabbath day or on any public occasion he would wonder where all the people could dwell the multitude is so great but the case is this the inhabitants being all busy at their manufactures dwell in their garrets at their looms and in their combingshops as they call them twistingmills and other workhouses almost all the works they are employed in being done within doors there are in this city    parishes besides the cathedral and a great many meeting houses of dissenters of all denominations the castle is ancient and decayed and now for many years past made use of for a gaol  this city as it is said was built by the saxons out of the ruins of venta icenorum now called caster where some years since were found several roman urns in the time of the saxons it was the principal seat of the east angles and was reduced to ashes by sueno the dane it was reedified and famine only compelled it to yield to william the conqueror  the famous rebellion of kett the tanner of windham in the reign of edward vi reduced it again to a ruinous state but it was happily restored by queen elizabeth who sent hither part of the flemings that came over from the cruel persecution of the duke of alva to whose industry and example is owing the rich manufacture of stuffs for which this city is so famous  the walls of this city are reckoned three miles in circumference taking in more ground than the city of london within the walls but much of that ground lies open in pasturefields and gardens nor does it seem to be like some ancient places a decayed declining town the walls only marking out its ancient dimensions for we do not see room to suppose that it was ever larger or more populous than it is now but the walls seem to be placed as if it was expected that the city would in time increase sufficiently to fill them up with buildings there are    large gates which give entrance to the city  the cathedral is a fine fabric and the spiresteeple beautiful and next salisbury the highest in england it is not ancient the bishops see having been first at thetford from whence it was not translated hither till the   th century yet the church has so many antiquities in it that our late great scholar and physician sir thomas brown thought it worth his while to write a whole book to collect the monuments and inscriptions in this church to which i refer the reader it has an hospital in it for  00 poor men and women and a fine marketcross that called bridewell is a large and most beautiful building of square flint  the river yare runs through it and is navigable thus far without the help of locks or stops and being increased by other waters passes afterward through a long track of the richest meadows and the largest take them all together that are anywhere in england lying for  0 miles in length from this city to yarmouth including the return of the said meadows on the bank of the waveney south and on the river thyrn north  there are six large bridges over the river running through the city called hellesden coslany blackfriars tyebridge whitefriers and bishopsgate bridges and to repair these bridges as also the walls and gates and the city wastes stathes and wharfs which were become so ruinous that the ordinary revenue of the city was insufficient for that purpose an act of parliament passed in the year       which laid diverse tolls and imposts on particular goods and merchandises brought into the city the produce of which were also to repair the great roads leading from norwich toward london by which means these roads bridges walls etc were put into good condition and kept so  one thing is proper to be mentioned here which history accounts not for it is this the river waveney is a considerable river and of a deep and full chanel navigable for large barges as high as beccles and bungay it runs for a course of about  0 miles between the two counties of suffolk and norfolk as a boundary to both and pushing forward though with a gentle stream no one would doubt when they see the river growing broader and deeper and going directly toward the sea even to the edge of the beach and within a mile of the main ocean but that it would make its entrance into the sea at that place and afford a noble harbor for ships at the mouth of it when on a sudden the land rising high by the seaside crosses the head of the river like a dam checks the whole course of it and it returns bending its course west for two miles or thereabouts and then turning north through another long course of meadows joining to those just now mentioned seeks out the river yare joins its water with hers and both find their way to the sea together  some of our historians tell a long fabulous story of this rivers being once open and a famous harbor for ships belonging to the town of leostof adjoining but that yarmouth envying the prosperity of leostof made war upon them and that after many bloody battles as well by sea as by land they came at last to a decisive action at sea with their respective fleets but the leostof fleet being overthrown and utterly destroyed the yarmouth men either actually stopped up the mouth of the said river or obliged the vanquished leostof men to do it themselves and bound them never to attempt to open it again  i see no authority for this relation neither do the relators agree either in the time or in the particulars of the fact  in this vast tract of meadows are fed a prodigious number of black cattle which are said to produce the fattest beef though not the largest in england and the quantity is so great as that they not only supply the city of norwich the town of yarmouth and the county adjacent but send great quantities of them weekly in all the winter season to london  and this in particular is worthy remark that the gross of all the scots cattle which come yearly into england are brought to a small village lying north of the city of norwich called st faiths where the norfolk grasiers go and buy them  these scots runts as they call them coming out of the cold and barren mountains of the highlands in scotland feed so eagerly on the rich pasture in these marshes that they thrive in an unusual manner and grow very fat and the beef is so delicious for taste that the inhabitants prefer them to the english cattle which are much larger and fairer to look at some have told me and i believe with truth that there are above  0000 of these scots cattle fed in this county every year and most of them in the marshes between norwich beccles and yarmouth  yarmouth is an ancient town much older than norwich and though not extending over so much ground yet better built and more complete and not much inferior in number of inhabitants and for wealth traffic and advantage of its situation infinitely superior to norwich  it is situated on a peninsula between the river yare and the sea the two last lying parallel to one another and the town in the middle the river lies on the west side of the town and being grown very large and deep by the receiving of all the rivers on this side the county forms the haven and the town facing to the west also and open to the river makes the finest quay in england if not in europe at least equalling that of marseilles itself  the ships ride here so close as it were keeping up one another with their headfasts on shore that for half a mile together they go cross the stream with their boltsprits over the land their bows or heads touching the very wharf so that one may walk from ship to ship as on a floating bridge all along by the shoreside the quay reaching from the drawbridge almost to the southgate is so spacious and wide that in some places it is near  00 yards from the houses to the wharf in this pleasant and agreeable range of houses are some very magnificent buildings and among the rest the customhouse and town hall and some merchants houses which look like little palaces rather than the dwellinghouses of private men  the greatest defect of this beautiful town seems to be that though it is very rich and increasing in wealth and trade and consequently in people there is not room to enlarge it by new buildings being precluded on the west and southsides by the river and on the east side by the sea so that there is no room but on the northend without the gate and there the land is not very agreeable but had they had a larger space within the gates there would before now have been many spacious streets of buildings erected as we see is done in some other thriving towns in england  during the fishingfair as they call it one sees the land covered with people and the river with barks and boats busy day and night landing and carrying off the herrings which they catch here in almost incredible quantities i happened to be there during their fishingfair when i told in one tide one hundred and ten barks and fishing vessels coming up the river all laden with herrings taken the night before and this over and above what was brought on shore on the dean that is the seaside of the town by open boats which they call the cobles are open boats which come from the north from scarbro whitby etc and come to yarmouth to let themselves out to fish for the merchants during the fairtime cobles and which often bring in two or three a last is ten barrels each barrel containing a thousand herrings lasts of fish at a time the the barks come from the coast of kent and sussex as from folkston dover and rye in kent and from brighthelmston in sussex and let themselves out to fish for the merchants during the said fair as the cobles do from the north barks often bring ten lasts apiece  this fishingfair began on michaelmasday and lasts all the month of october by which time the herrings draw off to sea shoot their spawn and are no more fit for the merchants business at least not those that are taken hereabouts  we have very different accounts of the quantity of herrings caught here in this season some have said that the towns of yarmouth and leostoff only have taken  0000 lasts in a season i will not venture to confirm that report but i have heard the merchants themselves say that they have cured  0000 barrels of merchantable red herrings in one season which though far short of the other is a very considerable article and it is to be added that these are over and above all the herrings consumed in the country towns of both those populous counties for  0 miles from the sea whither very great quantities are carried every tide during the whole season  but this is only one branch of the great trade carried on in this town another part of its commerce is in the exporting these herrings after they are cured and for this its merchants have a great trade to genoa leghorn naples messina and venice as also to spain and portugal exporting likewise with their herrings great quantities of worsted stuffs and stuffs made of silk and worsted camblets etc the manufactures of the neighboring city of norwich and of the places adjacent  besides this they carry on a very considerable trade with holland exporting a vast quantity of woollen manufactures every year also they have a fishingtrade to the north seas for white fish which from the place are called the north sea cod  they have likewise a considerable trade to norway and to the baltic from whence they bring back deals and fir timber oaken plank baulks spars oars pitch tar hemp flax canvas and sailcloth with all manner of naval stores for which they generally have a consumption in their own port where they build a very great number of ships every year besides refitting and repairing the old  add to this the coaltrade between newcastle and the river of thames in which they are so improved of late years that they have now a greater share of it than any other town in england and have quite worked the ipswich men out of it who had formerly the chief share of the colliery in their hands  for the carrying on all these trades they have a very great number of ships either of their own or employed by them and it may in some measure be judged of by this that in the year      i had an account from the town register that there were then      sail of ships using the sea belonging to the town besides such ships as the merchants of yarmouth might be concerned in and be partowners of belonging to any other ports  to all this i must add without compliment to the town that the merchants and even the generality of traders of yarmouth have a very good reputation in trade as well abroad as at home for fair and honorable dealing and their seamen as well masters as mariners are justly esteemed among the ablest and most expert navigators in england  this town however populous and large had till lately but one parish church dedicated to st nicolas though it is very large it has a high spire which is an useful seamark it was built by that famous bishop of norwich william herbert who flourished in the reign of william ii and henry i william of malmsbury calls him vir pecuniosus from the works of charity and munificence which he has left as witnesses of his immense riches for he built the cathedral church the priory for  0 monks the bishops palace and the parish church of st leonard all in norwich this great church at yarmouth the church of st margaret at lynn and of st mary at elmham he removed the episcopal see from thetford to norwich and instituted the cluniack monks at thetford and gave them or built them a house  but in the reigns of queen anne and the late king george i two acts passed for building a new church or chapel of ease in yarmouth and for enlightening the streets of the town and other purposes all which is performed in so complete a manner as is worthy of the place  also in the year      an act passed for clearing depthening repairing extending maintaining and improving the haven and piers of yarmouth and for depthening and making more navigable the several rivers emptying themselves at that town and also for preserving of ships wintering in the haven from accidents by fire this provision was a very necessary one for the haven is so very commodious for the secure and safe lying of ships in the winter season that several hundred sail are yearly laid up and winter in it which lie so contiguous to one another and so near the houses that in case of fire not only the ships but the town would be in danger of being totally destroyed  here is one of the finest marketplaces and the best served with provisions in england london excepted the streets are all exactly strait from north to south from lanes or alleys which they call rows crossing them in strait lines also from east to west so that it is the most regularbuilt town in england and seems as if it had been erected all at once upon one uniform plan  they have particular privileges in this town and a jurisdiction by which they can try condemn and execute in especial cases without waiting for a warrant from above and this they exerted once very smartly in executing a captain of one of the kings ships of war in the reign of king charles ii for a murder committed in the street the circumstance of which did indeed call for justice but some thought they would not have ventured to exert their power as they did however i never heard that the government resented it or blamed them for it  it is a very well governed town and i have nowhere in england observed the sabbath day so exactly kept or the breach of it so constantly punished as in this place which i mention to their honor  from yarmouth i resolved to pursue my first design viz to view the seaside on this coast which is particularly noted for being one of the most dangerous and most fatal to the sailors in all britain and the more so because of the great number of ships which are continually going and coming this way in their passage between london and all the northern coasts of great britain  the reason of which is that the shore from the mouth of the river of thames to yarmouth road lies in a strait line from southsoutheast to northnorthwest the land being on the west or larboard side from wintertonness which is the utmost easterly point of land in the county of norfolk and about four miles beyond yarmouth the shore falls off for near  0 miles to the west as far as lynn and boston till the shore of lincolnshire tends north again for about  0 miles more as far as the humber whence the coast of yorkshire or holderness which is the east riding shoots out again into the sea to the spurn and to flambro head as far east almost as the shore of norfolk had given back at winterton making a very deep gulf or bay between those two points of winterton and the spurn head so that the ships going north are obliged to stretch away to sea from wintertonness and leaving the sight of land in the deep bay i have mentioned that reaches to lynn and the shore of lincolnshire they go as i observed north or still northnorthwest to meet the shore of holderness which as i said runs out into the sea again at the spurn this they leave also and the first land they make is called as above flambro head so that wintertonness and flambro head are the two extremes of this course there is indeed the spurn head between but as it lies too far in toward the humber they keep out to the north to avoid coming near it  in like manner the ships which come from the north leave the shore at flambro head and stretch away southsoutheast for yarmouth roads and the first land they make is wintertonness as above now the danger of the place is this if the ships coming from the north are taken with a hard gale of wind from the southeast or from any point between northeast and southeast so that they cannot weather wintertonness they are thereby kept within that deep bay and if the wind blows hard are often in danger of running on shore upon the rocks about cromere on the northcoast of norfolk or stranding upon the flat shore between cromere and wells all the relief they have is good groundtackle to ride it out which is very hard to do there the sea coming very high upon them or if they cannot ride it out then to run into the bottom of the great bay to lynn or boston which is a very difficult and desperate push so that sometimes in this distress whole fleets have been lost here all together  in the same danger are ships going northward for if after passing by winterton they are taken short with a northeast wind and cannot put back into the roads which very often happens they are driven upon the same coast and embayd just as the latter the danger on the northpart of this bay is not the same because if ships going or coming should be taken short on this side flambro there is the river humber open to them and several good roads to have recourse to as burlington bay grimsby road the spurn head and others where they ride under shelter  the dangers of this place being thus considered it is no wonder that upon the shore beyond yarmouth there are no less than four lighthouses kept flaming every night besides the lights at castor north of the town and at goulston south all which are to direct the sailors to keep a good offing in case of bad weather and to prevent their running into cromerebay which the seamen call the devils throat  as i went by land from yarmouth northwest along the shore toward cromere aforesaid and was not then fully master of the reason of these things i was surprised to see in all the way from winterton that the farmers and country people had scarce a barn shed stable or pales to their yards and gardens or a hogstye or necessaryhouse but what was built of old planks beams wales and timber etc the deplorable wrecks of ships and ruins of mariners and merchants fortunes and in some places were whole yards filled and piled up very high with the same stuff laid up for the like building purposes  about the year      there was a melancholy example of what i have said of this place a fleet of  00 sail of light colliers went out of yarmouth roads with a fair wind to pursue their voyage and were taken short with a storm of wind at northeast after they were past wintertonness a few leagues some of them whose masters made a better judgment of things or who were not so far out as the rest tacked and put back in time and got safe into the roads but the rest pushing on in hopes to keep out to sea and weather it were by the violence of the storm driven back when they were too far embayd to weather wintertonness a above and so were forced to run west every one shifting for themselves as well as they could some run away for lynn deeps but few of them the night being so dark could find their way thither some but very few rid it out at a distance the rest being above   0 sail were all driven on shore and dashed to pieces and very few of the people on board were saved at the very same unhappy juncture a fleet of laden ships were coming from the north and being just crossing the same bay were forcibly driven into it not able to weather the ness and so were involved in the same ruin as the light fleet was also some coasting vessels laden with corn from lynn and wells and bound for holland were with the same unhappy luck just come out to begin their voyage and some of them lay at anchor these also met with the same misfortune so that in the whole above  00 sail of ships and above  000 people were lost in the disaster of that one miserable night very few escaping  cromere is a market town close to the shore of this dangerous coast i know nothing it is famous for besides its being thus the terror of the sailors except good lobsters which are taken on that coast in great numbers and carried to norwich and in such quantities sometimes too as to be conveyed by sea to london  farther within the land and between this place and norwich are several good market towns and a great many villages all diligently applying to the woollen manufacture and the country is exceeding fertile as well in corn as pasture particularly which was very pleasant to see the pheasants were in such great plenty as to be seen in the stubble like cocks and hens a testimony though by the way that the county had more tradesmen than gentlemen in it indeed this part is so entirely given up to industry that what with the seafaringmen on the one side and the manufactures on the other we saw no idle hands here but every man busy some of the principal of these towns are   hickling and northwaltham noted only for a market each   alsham a poor town noted for knitters   worsted for the invention and twisting of yarn so called also famed for stockens and stuffs   catton noted for a brazen hand being carried before the steward of the demesne instead of a mace and for a bridge over the duze   reepham for a good maltmarket having no church at all out of three for there are only the ruins of one of them standing   holt for giving two lord mayors of the name of gresham who were brothers to london in      and        fakenham noted for nothing at all but formerly for having salt pits and   st faiths whither the drovers bring their black cattle to sell to the norfolk graziers as i observed above   not far from cromere is gresham the birthplace of the generous founder of the royal exchange and gresham colge london  from cromere we rode on the strand or open shore to weyburn hope the shore so flat that in some places the tide ebbs out near two miles from weyburn west lies clye where there are large saltworks and very good salt made which is sold all over the county and sometimes sent to holland and  ick from clye we go to marham and to wells all towns on the coast in each whereof there is a very considerable trade carried on with holland for corn which that part of the county is very full of besides the great trade driver here from holland back again which i take to be a trade carried on with much less honesty than advantage especially while the art of smuggling was so much in practice which the laws have of late rendered more difficult than it was though far from suppressing it  the seven burnhams which are so many small towns called by the same name and each employed in the same holland trade as marham and wells lie on and near the seacoast to the northwest of walsingham  from the seacoast we turned to the southwest through snetham a small market town to castlerising an old decayed borough town with hardly ten families in it which yet sends two members to parliament but shows a great many marks of roman saxon and danish antiquities in and about it  on our left we saw walsingham an ancient town famous for the old ruins of a monastery there and the shrine of our lady as noted as that of st thomasabecket at canterbury hence called our lady of walsingham two wells here are still called by the name of the blessed virgin  near this place at raynham is the seat of the lord viscount townshend and not far distant at houghton that noble newbuilt one of sir robert walpole the gardens and plantations of which are very large and beautiful  the general plan and front of the house and offices extend to   0 feet the great hall is a circle of  0 feet the salon  0 by  0 feet and all the other rooms in the four great apartments are    feet high the attick story is    feet high and the rustic story the same all above ground under which is an entire story of cellars all arched the front to the great entrance extends to     feet lying open to the park the building is finished with two towers dressed with two rustic venetian windows the section of the great hall all in stone the most beautiful in england the whole building is of stone and without pretending to excuse any seeming or real defect it may be truly said to be a house of state and convenience worthy of a princes residence  this stately structure begun in the year      was completely finished inside and outside in the year      the noble founder having had the singular felicity all the time to continue at the helm of affairs as he does still anno       on the foundationstone placed in the southeast angle is this inscription hic me posuit ille walpole quem tu non nescies posteritas fandamen ut essem demus in agro natali extruendae die maii a d mdccxxii faxit deus postquam nea urus aevi dominus diu laetatu fuerit abluta incolumens tueantur incolumes ad summam diem et nati natorum and qui nascentur ab illis which may be englished thus here that sir robert walpole with whom o posterity thou shall not be unacquainted has fixed me to stand as the foundation of a seat designed to be built in his native county the   th day of may in the year      god grant that after its master to a mature old age shall have long enjoyed it in perfection his latest descendants may safely and securely possess it to the end of time  the noble founder had doubtless in his thoughts in this inscription the uncertain state of prime ministers and of the superb structures built by them in the height of their power in all ages and countries and we hope the merits of him and his descendants to their native country may induce the almighty to give a fiat to his prayer  we proceeded hence to lynn another rich and populous porttown well built and well situated at the mouth of the river ouse which has the greatest extent of inland navigation of any port in england london excepted the reason whereof is that more navigable rivers empty themselves here into the sea including the washes which are branches of the same port than at any one mouth of waters in england except the thames and the humber by these navigable rivers the merchants of lynn supply about six counties wholly and three counties in part with their goods especially wine and coals viz by the little ouse they send their goods to brandon and thetford by the lake to mildenhall bartonmills and st edmundsbury by the river grant to cambridge by the great ouse itself to ely to st ives to st neots to barfordbridge and to bedford by the river nine to peterboro by the drains and washes to wisbich to spalding marketdeeping and stamford besides the several counties into which these goods are carried by land carriage from the places where the navigation of those rivers ends which has given rise to this observation on the town of lynn that they bring in more coals than any seaport between london and newcastle and import more wines than any port in england except london and bristol their trade to norway and to the baltic sea is also great in proportion and of late years they have extended it farther to the southward  there are many gentry and consequently more gayety in this town than in yarmouth or even norwich the place abounding in very good company and indeed it is so considerable that it merits as particular a description as the nature of this work will admit and which therefore i will give as succinctly as i can  to begin then this town was first called lynnepiscopi as the property of the bishop of norwich till the dissolution of monasteries by king henry viii when that prince becoming its possessor conferred on it the name of lynn regis  it is situated toward the mouth of the great ouse encompassed with a deep trench walled almost all round containing about   00 houses and divided by four rivulets arched over with about    bridges it extends along the east side of the river which in high springtides flows above  0 feet perpendicular and is about the breadth of the thames above bridge for the length of a mile and is divided into nine wards on the northend toward the sea stands st annes fort with a platform of    large guns commanding all ships which pass by the harbor and toward the land besides the wall there are nine regular bastions and a ditch nearly in the form of a semicircle which make it above half a mile in breadth the town is so ancient as to be supposed the same with maidenbower according to several old historians  it has many remarkable places which deserve a more particular description than i have room for however i shall touch upon them briefly as st margarets church the town hall bridewell the customhouse and exchange the marketcross st nicolass chapel all saints church the free school the hospitals the statue of king james ii king johns sword and cup the common stathyard the ladys mount the public libraries the kings stathyard and other remarkables of which in their order and first of st margarets church  this church which was formerly an abbey and is one of the largest parochial churches in england is adorned with a very fair and high lanthorn covered with lead containing the clockbell lately cast which may be heard all over the town its height is     feet at the west end stands a stone tower    feet high and facing the street a moondial designed to tell the increase and decrease of that planet with the exact hour of the day it moves by clockwork over the tower is a spire     feet high in form of a pyramid near to which is the belltower built of freestone    feet high containing a ring of eight bells in this church is kept the bishops court when he comes hither on his visitation  the townhouse called trinityhall is an ancient and noble building which makes a fine appearance  adjoining to it is the house of correction called bridewell with apartments proper for the reception of such as are put there who beat and dress hemp during their confinement  the exchange is a fair structure of freestone with two orders of columns situated in the middle of the town and built at the expense of sir john turner knight and within it is the customhouse containing several commodious apartments  the markethouse is a new edifice of freestone in the modern taste  0 feet high erected on four steps neatly adorned with statues and other embellishments with an inscription giving an account of its former condition and present rebuilding  st nicolass chapel is very ancient and stands at the northend of the town it is an appendage to st margarets and is esteemed one of the fairest and largest religious fabrics in england it has a belltower of freestone and a pyramidical octangular spire over it both which together are   0 feet from the ground  all saints church in southlynn belonged formerly to the carmelite and white friars on the ruins of whose monastery it is built though not large it is neat solid and regular in form of a cross within a churchyard well walled in  on the northside of st margarets churchyard is the free school a strong and beautiful building  the only fabric formerly belonging to any religious order now standing is the greyfryers steeple a noted seamark which was repaired and amended out of the ruins of a demolished chapel in the year      it may not be amiss to mention here a remarkable and laudable order that was made in the year      that on every first monday in the month there should be a meeting of the mayor aldermen some of the common council and the preachers in order to settle peace and quietness between man and man and to decide all manner of controversies this was called the feast of reconciliation  in the parish of all saints is a small hospital for four poor men to live rentfree st mary magdalens hospital founded in the reign of king stephen for a prior and    brethren and sisters continued in a flourishing condition about  00 years and devolved to the crown at the making the statute for dissolution of religious houses in the reign of edward vi in whose time it was robbed and almost levelled with the ground by ketts mutineers at their return from their frustrated attempt to surprise lynn so that it remained destitute of brethren and sisters except some poor people whom the mayor and burgesses maintained with design to support the ancient hospital till king james i upon petition restored them their lands granted them many privileges and incorporated them but in the year      it was a second time destroyed by fire by the earl of manchesters forces when they besieged lynn then standing out for the king in the year      the corportation rebuilt it very commodiously as at present with two courts a chapel and convenient apartments for the master brethren and sisters and several inscriptions commemorating the late disaster it is now committed to the care of two of the elder aldermen chosen for that purpose by the other governors  there is in the great marketplace a statue erected in the year      to the honor of king james ii with an inscription that may serve for a satire on the undue compliments which are frequently paid to princes during the time of their prosperity it stands on a pedestal which has several embellishments and is enclosed within a palisade of iron the inscription is as follows non immemor quantum divinis invictiss principis virtutibus debeat hanc regiae majestatis effigiem aeternum fidei et obsequii monumentum erexit s p q l anno salutis      in english thus the aldermen and common council of lynn not forgetting how much they owe to the divine virtues of the invincible king james ii as a lasting monument of their faith and loyalty have erected this statue of his royal majesty anno       in      an old ruinous building which was once a chapel was by the corporation and other inhabitants made a public receptacle for poor children to learn to spin wool here they are also taught to read it is now by act of parliament settled and vested in the guardians of the poor  there was a church formerly in the town dedicated to st john and belonging to the hospital of that name both which are alike extinct  the corporation boasts of having been presented by king john with a very rich doublegilt cup and cover weighing    ounces which is preserved to this day and used on public occasions and at the same time a large sword with a silver mounting from his own side as is engraven on the inscription on the hilt  the entrance into the common stathyard from the tuesday market is by two large gateways with habitable rooms over them it is a beautiful large square area with a commodious quay or wharf surrounded with warehouses and granaries for all sorts of merchandise with spacious vaults  at a small distance from the town stands a ruinous pile called the ladys mount or red mount wherein formerly was a chapel dedicated to the blessed virgin which served as a receptacle for pilgrims traveling this way toward the celebrated convent of our lady at walsingham  the library at st nicolas was erected by a voluntary subscription of several hundred pounds to which the late lord townshend who took his title of baron from this town sir robert walpole sir charles turner and robert britiffe esquire deceased were considerable benefactors there is also another library at st margarets to which the late thomas thurlin d d president of st johns in cambridge bequeathed all his books and also left an exhibition of six pounds a year to a poor scholar who should go from the grammar school to st johns college in cambridge and forty shillings yearly toward the clothing three of the poorest inhabitants of gaywood etc  the inhabitants of lynn suffer great inconvenience from the want of fresh water springs within the town with which element however they are supplied from a river running by gaywood and by leaden pipes from middleton and mintling  the church of st edmund in northlynn was long ago entirely swallowed up by the sea  the kings stathyard is a very handsome square with brick buildings fronting each way in the center of which stands the statue of james i in a nich fronting the west here the greatest part of imported wines are landed as it has a convenient quay and large winevaults  at the southend of the town stood an oilmill framed in holland and brought over hither near  00 years ago it gave a pleasant prospect to every part of the town but in the year      was consumed by fire  from what has been said it will be observed that the situation of this town renders it capable of being made very strong and in the late wars it was so a line of fortification being drawn round it at a distance from the walls the ruins or rather remains of which works appear to this day nor would it be a hard matter to restore the bastions with the ravelins and counterscarp upon any sudden emergency to a good state of defense especially because they are able to fill all their ditches with water from the sea in such a manner as that it cannot be drawn off  they pass over here in boats into the fen country and over the famous washes into lincolnshire but the passage is very dangerous and uneasy for here passengers often miscarry and are lost but then it is usually on their venturing at improper times and without the guides which if they would be persuaded not to do they would very rarely fail of going or coming safe  from lynn i bent my course southward to downham where is an ugly wooden bridge over the ouse at which as hollingshead informs us in october      were taken    monstrous fishes from  0 to    feet long  when we were at downham we took a turn to the ancient town of thetford situated partly in norfolk and partly in suffolk it was raised on the ruins of the ancient sitomagus which was destroyed by the danes it is at present but meanly built but by the ruins of churches and monasteries still remaining appears to have been formerly of great account and even so far back as the time of king edward the confessor it had     burgesses and in that of william the conqueror   0 mansions on the suffolk side there now remain the ruins of six churches and monasteries and there were several others in the town but now there are but three parish churches standing entire one on the suffolk and two on the norfolk side it is however a town corporate governed by a mayor aldermen and common council has three annual fairs a plentiful weekly market and is a kind of see suffragan to that of norwich in the  th year of king james i an act passed for the founding of an hospital a grammar school and maintenance of a preacher in this town for ever according to the last will of sir richard fulmarston and sir joseph williamson secretary of state to king charles ii built here a new councilhouse and was otherwise a good benefactor to the place the lent assizes are usually held here  from thetford we crossed the ouse to brandon which gives the title of an english duke to duke hamilton of scotland this is no illbuilt town and has a good church belonging to it it gave a lord mayor to london anno      viz sir simon air draper who built leadenhall for the use of the city and left  000 marks a very great sum in those days to charitable uses brandon has lost its market but stands conveniently upon the ouse over which it has a bridge and a ferry to convey goods to and from the isle of ely to which we directly bent our course  we made an excursion from ely northwards up to the fens but we saw nothing that way worth our curiosity or remarking but deep roads vast drains and dykes of water which are all navigable but with all this a very rich soil bearing a great quantity of hemp but a bad unwholesome air  wisbich however which lies on the northern extremity of the county has not only been of note in the conquerors time who built a castle here but is now a well built market town has a good town hall and is esteemed the best tradingtown in the isle as having the convenience of good watercarriage to london whither they send great quantities of oil and butter and bring back all sorts of commodities with which the whole isle is furnished for it has a plentiful market  a good way lower down to the south are the two market towns of mersh and thorney the first is very inconsiderable the other is delightfully situated and the land about it very fruitful in grass and trees  the isle of ely is encompassed with the ouse and other waters the city is situated on a hill in the middle of a great plain it is full of springs insomuch that in the principal street in the east part of the town there are wells bricked up kneehigh almost at every hundred yards which the whole year generally overflow from one to another all the way down the declivity of the hill on which the town stands the soil is exceeding rich and the city is encompassed with gardens the produce of which is so excellent that it furnishes all the county for  0 miles round even as far as cambridge and st ives the former of which has almost all its gardenstuff from hence great quantities of strawberries are cultivated here particularly of the white wood sort  the most remarkable thing that i observed of the minster was that it is seen for many miles round but is so old that it seems to totter with every high gust of wind  on the east side of the came a little below ely stands soham a little market town toward the borders of suffolk near the marshes which were formerly dangerous to pass but now there is a causey made which leads very securely over them here are the remains of an ancient church which was ruined by the danes  we proceeded from hence to newmarket near snaybell as we went we saw a noble seat of admiral russel created earl of orford for the glorious victory obtained under his command over the french fleet and the burning their ships at la hogue  the situation of this house is low and on the edge of the fen country but the building is fine the apartments noble and the gardens wellfinished on the earls death it devolved to samuel sandys esquire in right of his wife one of the earls heirs who now possesses it  arriving at newmarket in the month of october i had the opportunity to see the horseraces and a great concourse of the nobility and gentry as well from london as from all parts of england but they were all so intent so eager so busy upon what is called the sharping part of the sport of wagers and bets that to me they seemed rather like so many horsecoursers in smithfield than persons of dignity and quality who descend so low as even to circumvent one another and if i may speak it pick one anothers pockets to see a person of distinction who perhaps being ennobled his word of honor by the laws of the land is to be esteemed and received with equal sanction as an oath in our courts of justice level himself with a groom or a ridingboy and put his credit and honor in his hands with a bribe to betray his master and his trust is a thing scarce credible among those who are really men of honor and yet it is too often the case to the indelible shame of men of rank and quality be it spoken in particular and to the reproach of the nation in general how different is this conduct from that of those in the circus at rome how much more different from those who gained so much honor in the grecian races what pindar could be found in these days to celebrate them what must his subject be tricks and circumventions alas how degenerate and yet these races were instituted with a very good intent to raise an emulation in our nobility and gentry to keep up and preserve a race of good horses in honor of the nation in general but as the institution is debased it is not the best horse that wins the race but that which is destined for it by a combination  before i was let into the secret as it is called which is indeed nothing but the knavish part of the sport i was much diverted with these races but when i was i rejoiced not a little at the regulation that it has met with from the power that only had authority to make it for this diversion becoming a public nuisance by spreading itself in little matches all over the kingdom the legislature took cognizance of it and in the   th of king george ii a law passed which injoins as follows viz that none but the owners of horses shall enter them and but one horse at a time that no plate under  0 l value shall be run for on penalty of  00 l  and  00 l to such as shall advertise print or publish any advertisement of a plate to be run for of less value than  0 l five years old horses to carry  0 stone six    seven    on the forfeiture of the horse and  00 l the race to be begun and ended in one day matches to be at newmarket and blackhambleton yorkshire only on penalty of  00 l but gifts left for annual races not to be altered somersetshire penalties to go to bath hospital entrance money to be paid to the secondbest horse   i went in the intervals of the sport to see the fine seats of the gentlemen in the neighboring county for this part of suffolk being an open champain country and in a healthy air is formed for pleasure and all kinds of rural diversion nature as it were inviting the gentlemen to visit her where she is plentifully furnished to receive them and the country is accordingly in a manner covered with fine palaces of the nobility and pleasant seats of the gentry  eustonhall the seat of the duke of grafton lies in the open country toward the side of norfolk not far from thetford a place capable of all that is pleasant and delightful in nature and greatly improved by art  from thence i went to rushbrook formerly the seat of the noble family of jermyns lately lord dover and now of the house of davers then we saw brently the seat of the earl of dysert and the ancient palace of my lord cornwallis with several others most agreeably situated and adorned with the beautiesboth of art and nature  newmarket is a handsome well built town and being a thoroughfare reaps no small advantage by that means as well as from the races it consists chiefly of one long street the northside of which is in suffolk and the south in cambridgeshire the king has a house of his own where he resides when he thinks fit to come to the races the town has two churches belonging to it and a free school endowed by king charles ii  we entered cambridgeshire out of suffolk with all the advantage that can be imagined just upon those pleasant and agreeable plains called newmarketheath across which extends a fortification or ditch with a rampart commonly called the devils dyke as works of an extraordinary nature are generally by the vulgar attributed to that prince of darkness through the nation but among the gentry it is best known by the name of rech dyke from rech a small market town lying near the heath it is supposed to have been the boundary of the kingdom of the east angles  passing this ditch we see from the hills called gogmagog or rather hogmagog a rich and pleasant vale westward covered with cornfieldsd gentlemens seats villages and at a distance to crown all the rest that ancient and truly famous town and university of cambridge capital of the county  cambridgeshire except the fen country is almost wholly a corn country and of that corn five parts in six of all they sow is barley which is generally sold to ware and royston and other great maltingtowns in hertfordshire and is the fund from whence that vast quantity of malt called hertfordshire malt is made which is esteemed the best in england as essex suffolk and norfolk are taken up in manufactures and famed for industry this county has no manufacture at all nor are the poor except the husbandmen noted for any thing so much as idleness and sloth to their scandal be it spoken what the reason of it is i know not  on the top of hogmagog hills appears an ancient camp or fortification with a treble rampart and ditch which most of our writers say was neither roman nor saxon but british king james ii caused a spacious stable to be built in the area of this camp for his runninghorses and made old mr frampton master or inspector of them the stables remain still there though they are not often made use of the earl godolphin has here a fine house on the very summit of the hill to which his lordship frequently resorts especially in the racingseason  as we descended westward we saw the fen country on our right almost all covered with water like a sea the michaelmas rains having been very great that year sent down vast floods of water from the upland countries and those fens being the sink of no less than    counties they are often thus overflowed the rivers which thus empty themselves into these fens and carry off the water are the came or grant the great ouse and little ouse the nene the welland and the river which runs from bury to mildenhall the counties which these rivers drain as above are those of lincoln  cambridge  huntingdon  bedford warwick oxford leicester  northampton rutland norfolk suffolk and essex those marked with  empty all their waters this way the rest but in part in a word all the water of the middle part of england which does not run into the thames or the trent comes down into these fens  in these fens are abundance of those admirable pieces of art called duckoys and it is incredible what quantities of wildfowl of all sorts duck mallard teal wigeon etc they take in them every week during the season it may indeed be guessed at in some measure by this that there is a duckoy not far from ely which yields the landlord  00 l a year clear of the charge of maintaining a great number of servants for the management from whence alone they assured me at st ives a town on the ouse whither the fowls are always brought to be conveyed to london that they generally sent up  000 couples a week  there are more of these about peterborough from whence wagon loads are sent up twice a week to london i have seen these wagons before the act of parliament to regulate carriers drawn by ten or twelve horses apiece they were laden so heavy  as these fens appear overwhelmed with water i observed that they generally at this latter part of the year appear also covered with fogs so that when the downs and higher grounds of the adjacent country glistered with the beams of the sun the isle of ely seemed wrapped up in mist and darkness so that nothing could be discerned but now and then the cupola of ely minster  one could hardly see this from the hills without concern for the many thousand families confined to those fogs who had no other breath to draw than what must be mixed with the choking vapors which spread over all the country but notwithstanding this the people especially those that are used to it live as healthy as those in a clearer air except nowandthen an ague which they make light of and there are great numbers of very ancient people among them an act passed a few years ago for the effectual draining and preservation of haddenham level in the isle of ely which contains   00 acres which were overflowed chiefly through the neglect of preserving and clearing the outfalls into the sea and as these grounds are naturally very rich and fertile it may be imagined what a benefit must accrue to the public by this means when the draining and recovery of them can be completed  having been at sturbridgefair when it was in its height in the month of september the year before i was at newmarket i must say that it is not only the greatest in the whole nation but i think in europe nor is the fair at leipsick in saxony the mart at frankfort on the main or the fairs at nuremberg or ausburg reputed any way comparable to this at sturbridge this fair is pretty much dwindled since this account of it though it is still very considerable   it is kept in a large cornfield near casterton extending from the side of the river came toward the road for about half a mile square  if the field be not cleared of the corn before a certain day in august the fairkeepers may trample it underfoot to build their booths or tents on the other hand to balance that severity if the fairkeepers have not cleared the field by another certain day in september the plowmen may reenter with plow and cart and overthrow all into the dirt and as for the filth dung straw etc left behind by the fairkeepers which is very considerable these become the farmers fees and make them full amends for the trampling riding carting upon and hardening the ground  it is impossible to describe all the parts and circumstances of this fair exactly the shops are placed in rows like streets whereof one is called cheap side and here as in several other streets are all sorts of traders who sell by retale and come chiefly from london here may be seen goldsmiths toymen brasiers turners milaners haberdashers hatters mercers drapers pewterers chinawarehouses and in a word all trades that can be found in london with coffeehouses taverns and eatinghouses in great numbers and all kept in tents and booths  this great street reaches from the road which as i said goes from cambridge to newmarket turning short out of it to the right toward the river and holds in a line near half a mile quite down to the riverside in another street parallel with the road are the like rows of booths but somewhat larger and more intermingled with wholesale dealers and one side passing out of this last street to the left hand is a great square formed of the largest booths called the duddery but whence so called i could not learn the area of this square is from  0 to  00 yards where the dealers have room before every booth to take down and open their packs and to bring in wagons to load and unload  this place being peculiar to the wholesale dealers in the woollen manufacture the booths or tents are of a vast extent have different apartments and the quantities of goods they bring are so great that the insides of them look like so many blackwellhalls and are vast warehouses piled up with goods to the top in this duddery as i have been informed have been sold  00000 poundsworth of woollen manufactures in less than a weeks time besides the prodigious trade carried on here by wholesalemen from london and all parts of england who transact their business wholly in their pocketbooks and meeting their chapmen from all parts make up their accounts receive money chiefly in bills and take orders these they say exceed by far the sales of goods actually brought to the fair and delivered in kind it being frequent for the london wholesalemen to carry back orders from their dealers for  0000 poundsworth of goods a man and some much more this especially respects those people who deal in heavy goods as wholesale grocers salters brasiers ironmerchants winemerchants and the like but does not exclude the dealers in woollen manufactures and especially in mercery goods of all sorts who generally manage their business in this manner  here are clothiers from halifax leeds wakefield and huthersfield in yorkshire and from rochdale bury etc in lancashire with vast quantities of yorkshire cloths kerseys pennistons cottons etc with all sorts of manchester ware fustians and things made of cotton wool of which the quantity is so great that they told me there were near  000 horsepacks of such goods from that side of the country and these took up a side and half of the duddery at least also a part of a street of booths were taken up with upholsters ware such as tickens sackens kidderminster stuffs blankets rugs quilts etc  in the duddery i saw one warehouse or booth consisting of six apartments all belonging to a dealer in norwich stuffs only who they said had there above  0000 l value in those goods  western goods had their share here also and several booths were filled with serges duroys druggets shalloons cantaloons devonshire kersies etc from exeter taunton bristol and other parts west and some from london also  but all this is still outdone at least in appearance by two articles which are the peculiars of this fair and are not exhibited till the other part of the fair for the woollen manufacture begins to close up these are the wool and the hops there is scarce any price fixed for hops in england till they know how they sell at sturbridgefair the quantity that appears in the fair is indeed prodigious and they take up a large part of the field on which the fair is kept to themselves they are brought directly from chelmsford in essex from canterbury and maidstone in kent and from farnham in surrey besides what are brought from london of the growth of those and other places  inquiring why this fair should be thus of all other places in england the center of that trade and so great a quantity of so bulky a commodity be carried thither so far i was informed by one thoroughly acquainted with that matter that hops for this part of england grow principally in the two counties of surrey and kent with an exception only to the town of chelmsford in essex and there are very few planted anywhere else  there are indeed in the west of england some hops growing as at wilton near salisbury at hereford and broomsgrove near wales and the like but the quantity is inconsiderable and the places so remote that none of them come to london  formerly in the north of england few hops were used their drink being chiefly pale smooth ale which required but little hops and consequently they planted none north of trent but as for some years past they not only brew great quantities of beer in the north but also use hops in the brewing their ale much more than they did before so they all come south of trent to buy their hops and here being vast quantities brought it is great part of their back carriage into yorkshire and northamptonshire derbyshire lancashire and all those counties nay of late since the union even so far as scotland for i must not omit here also to mention that the river grant or came which runs close by the northwest side of the fair in its course from cambridge to ely is navigable and that by this means all heavy goods are brought to the fairfield by watercarriage from london and other parts first to the port of lynn and then in barges up the ouse from the ouse into the came and so to the very edge of the fair  in like manner great quantities of heavy goods and hops among the rest are sent from the fair to lynn by water and shipped there for the humber to hull york etc and for newcastle upon tyne and by newcastle to scotland now as they do not yet plant hops in the north though the consumption there is great and increasing daily this is one reason why at sturbridgefair there is so great a demand for them besides there were very few hops if any worth naming growing in all the counties even on this side trent above  0 miles from london those counties depending on sturbridgefair for their supply so the counties of suffolk norfolk cambridge huntingdon northampton lincoln leicester rutland and even to stafford warwick and worcestershire bought most of if not all their hops at sturbridgefair  this is a testimony of the prodigious resort of the trading people of all parts of england to this fair where surprising quantities of hops formerly have been sold  the article of wool is of several sorts but principally fleece wool out of lincolnshire where the longest staple is found the sheep of those parts being of the largest breed  the buyers are chiefly the manufacturers of norfolk suffolk and essex and it is a prodigious quantity they buy  here i saw what i have not observed in any other county of england a pocket of wool which seems to have been at first called so in mockery this pocket being so big that it loads a whole wagon and reaches beyond the most extreme parts of it hanging over both before and behind and these ordinarily weigh a ton or   00 lb weight of wool all in one bag  the quantity of wool only which has been sold at this place at one fair has been said to amount to  0 or  0000 l in value some say a great deal more  by these articles a stranger may make some guess at the immense trade which is carried on at this place what prodigious quantities of goods are bought and sold and what a vast concourse of people are seen here from all parts of england  i might proceed to speak of several other sorts of english manufactures which are brought hither to be sold as all sorts of wrought iron and brass ware from birmingham edged tools knives etc from sheffield glass wares and stockens from nottingham and leicester and unaccountable quantities of other things of smaller value every morning  to attend this fair and the prodigious crowds of people which resort to it there are sometimes no less than  0 hackney coaches which come from london and ply night and morning to carry the people to and from cambridge for there the gross of them lodge nay which is still more strange there are wherries brought from london on wagons to ply upon the little river came and to row people up and down from the town and from the fair as occasion presents  it is not to be wondered at if the town of cambridge cannot receive or entertain the numbers of people that come to this fair for not cambridge only but all the towns round are full nay the very barns and stables are turned into inns to lodge the meaner sort of people as for the fair people they all eat drink and sleep in their booths which are so intermingled with taverns coffeehouses drinkinghouses eatinghouses cooks shops etc and so many butchers and higglers from all the neighboring counties come in every morning with beef mutton fowls butter bread cheese eggs and such things and go with them from tent to tent from door to door that there is no want of provisions of any kind either dressed or undressed  in a word the fair is like a wellgoverned city and there is the least disorder and confusion i believe that can be seen anywhere with so great a concourse of people  toward the latter end of the fair and when the great hurry of wholesale business begins to be over the gentry come in from all parts of the county round and though they come for their diversion yet it is not a little money they lay out which generally falls to the share of the retalers such as the toyshops goldsmiths brasiers ironmongers turners milaners mercers etc and some loose corns they reserve for the puppetshews drolls ropedancers and suchlike of which there is no want the last day of the fair is the horsefair where the whole is closed both with horse and footraces to divert the meaner sort of people only for nothing considerable is offered of that kind and the late act i presume must have put an end to the former thus ends the whole fair and in less than a week more scarce any sign is left that such a thing has been there except by the heaps of dung and straw and other rubbish which is left behind trod into the earth and is as good as a summers fallow for the land and as i have said above pays the husbandman well for the use of it  i should have mentioned that here is a court of justice always open and held every day in a shed built on purpose in the fair this is for keeping the peace and deciding controversies in matters arising from the business of the fair the magistrates of the town of cambridge are judges in this court as being in their jurisdiction or they holding it by special privilege here they determine matters in a summary way as is practiced in those we call pyepowder courts in other places or as a court of conscience and they have a final authority without appeal  having just mentioned the puppetshews drolls etc with which the people are entertained during the time of this fair i cannot but relate a deplorable accident that happened on this occasion at barnwelt in this neighborhood as follows  on the  th of september      about eight at night a puppetshew being to be acted in a barn built of barnwell stone and thatched with straw a fellow attempted to thrust himself in without paying but being refused and the door locked and as some report nailed to keep out intruders the villain threatened he would set the barn on fire over their heads in revenge there was a place adjoining to the barn where were hay and straw and a boy setting down a wooden lantern with a short candle in it at a little distance whilst he was looking through a hole at the sight the villainous fellow aforesaid beat the lantern about till the fire took the straw which he left burning and run away there was a floor above them and the flame getting into the false roof spread like wildfire the people in the utmost consternation all making to the door which opened inwards fell upon one another and became as it were so many barricadoes to hinder its being opened and just at this fatal crisis the fire having seized some and dreadful shrieks and cries resounding from all the floor fell in and smothered almost all for not above five or six escaped of the whole and about   0 men women and children miserably perished the next day it was one of the most shocking sights that ever was beheld to see the relations of the unhappy persons flocking thither to find and own the bodies some of their brothers some of their children some of their wives and husbands which they found difficulty enough to discover for some of them had their heads burnt off some their legs some their hands and arms and others in a manner consumed to ashes and at last most of the mangled bodies were carried in carts and put promiscuously into a large hole dug in the churchyard for that purpose among the unfortunate sufferers were several young gentlewomen of considerable fortunes about four years after this another terrible fire happened which almost consumed the whole town of barnwell  within these few years a fine road of about four miles in length is completed from the town of cambridge to hogmagoghills which by reason of the badness of the way in that place is an exceeding useful benefaction to the town which generous work was done in pursuance of the will of william wortes esquire of cambridge as i think they told me the gentlemans name was  the two universities of cambridge and oxford are so much the glory of this nation that it would be an almost unpardonable defect in me not to take particular notice of them i shall refer that of oxford to its proper place and here give as brief an account as i can of this of cambridge and of the originals and founders of the several colleges together with the favors and advantages that have been within these few years conferred upon it by his late majesty and other benefactors  the town is governed by a mayor and aldermen but with regard to the government of the university that has a chancellor eligible every three years aut manner in eodem officio durante tacito consensu senatus cantabr he has under him a commissary who holds a court of record of civil causes for all privileged persons and scholars under the degree of master of arts  they have also a high steward chosen by the senate and holding by patent from the university  the vice chancellor is annually chosen on the  th of november by the body of the university out of two persons nominated by the heads of colleges  two proctors are also annually chosen as at oxford as also are two taxers who with the proctors have cognizance of weights and measures as clerks of the market  the university has also a custos archivorum or register three esquire beadles one yeoman beadle and a library keeper  the vice chancellor sometimes visits the taverns and other publickhouses in his own person but the proctors do it very frequently and have power to punish offending scholars and to fine the publickhouses who entertain them after eight at night in the winter or nine in summer  as to the antiquity of the university of cambridge the story goes that cantaber a spaniard   0 years before christ first founded it and that sebert king of the east angles restored it anno christi   0 afterward as the learned camden observes it lay a long time neglected and was overthrown by the danish storms till all things revived under the norman government soon after inns hostels and halls were built for students though without endowments there are now    colleges and halls which differ only in name being equally endowed and privileged    masters  0  fellowships about     scholarships     exhibitions and the whole number of masters fellows scholars exhibitioners and other students are about   00  i shall now give a brief account of the colleges and begin with    peterhouse which was founded by hugh balsham bishop of ely anno      when only prior of ely but at first the scholars had no other conveniences than chambers which exempted them from the high rates imposed on them by the townsmen for lodgings the endowment was settled by the same hugh when bishop anno      for a master    fellows etc which number might be increased or diminished according to the improvement or diminution of their revenues it seems to have taken its name from the church of st peter in its neighborhood    clarehall was founded in the year    0 by richard badew chancellor of the university with the assistance of the lady elizabeth clare countess of ulster he had before built a house called universityhall wherein the scholars lived upon their own expense for    years till it was accidentally destroyed by fire the founder finding the charge of rebuilding would exceed his abilities had the kind assistance of the said lady through whose liberality it was not only rebuilt but endowed it has been lately newbuilt all of freestone and is one of the neatest and most uniform houses in the university and delightfully situated on the banks of the river which forms for it a kind of natural canal    pembrokehall was founded in the year      by the lady mary st paul countess of pembroke third wife to audomare de valentia earl of pembroke who having been unhappily slain at a tilting on his wedding day she entirely sequestered herself from all worldly delights and amongst other pious acts built this college which has been much augmented since by the benefactions of others    st bennets or corpuschristi college was founded by the society of friars in corpuschristi in the year      this arose out of two guilds or fraternities one of corpus christi and the other of the blessed virgin which after a long emulation being united into one body by a joint interest built this college which took its name from the adjoining church of st benedict their greatest modern benefactor was dr matthew parker once master of the college and afterward archbishop of canterbury who by his prudent management recovered several rights of the college and besides two fellowships and five scholarships gave a great number of excellent mss to their library which were mostly collected out of the remains of the old abbeylibraries colleges and cathedrals and chiefly relate to the history of england    trinityhall was founded about the year      by william bateman bishop of norwich it was built upon a place which once belonged to the monks of ely and was a house for students before the time of bishop bateman who by exchange for the advowsons of certain rectories got it into his own possession he was a great master of civil and canon law whereupon the master two fellows and three scholars the number appointed by him at the first foundation were obliged to follow those two studies it has been since much augmented by benefactors and the number of its members is proportionably increased    gonevil and caius college anno      edmund gonevil founded a hall called after his name upon the place where now are the orchard and tenniscourt of bennetcollege but within five years after it was removed into the place where it now stands by bishop bateman founder of trinityhall anno   0  john caius doctor of physic improved this hall into a new college since chiefly called by his name and it has of late years received considerable embellishments etc    kings college was founded in the year      by king henry vi it was at first but small being built by that prince for a rector and    scholars only near it was a little hostel for grammarians built by william bingham which was granted by the founder to king henry for the enlargement of his college whereupon he united these two and having enlarged them by adding the church of st john zachary founded a college for a provost  0 fellows and scholars three chaplains etc the chapel belonging to this college is deservedly reckoned one of the finest buildings of its kind in the world it is  0  feet long    broad and    high to the battlements and has not one pillar in it it has    large windows on each side finely painted and the carving and other workmanship of the numerous stalls surpasses any thing of the kind it constitutes one side of a large square for the royal founder designed that the college should be a quadrangle all of equal beauty but the civil wars in which he was involved with the house of york prevented his accomplishing it and the prosecution of his good design was reserved to our own time for what has been added within these few years past is not only an ornament to the college but to the whole university and it is to be hoped that the college will be enabled in time to finish the noble work this new part runs from the west end of the chapel a little detached from it to the southward and makes another side of the square and contains spacious chambers and apartments being     feet in length and    in breadth built with great regularity and modern beauty  febr      the workmen digging for the foundation of the new buildings of this college found a great number of broad pieces of gold of the coin of king henry v exceeding fair as soon as it was known the governors of the college got out of the workmens hands a considerable number which they made presents of to their particular benefactors and divided among themselves and the fellows of the college but it is supposed that the workmen secreted many for this coin was very scarce before but after this was much easier to be met with    queens college was founded by queen margaret of anjou wife of king henry vi in the year      but the troublesome times that followed would not give her leave to complete the fabric the first master of it andrew ducket procured great sums of money from welldisposed persons toward finishing of this work and so far prevailed with queen elizabeth wife of king edward iv that she perfected what her professed enemy had begun the reverend mr ferdinando smithes senior fellow of queens college who died in november      gave   00 l to the same to be appropriated to the use of three batchelors of art till the time of their taking their masters degree    catharinehall was founded in the year      by robert woodlark third provost of kings college and the hall was built over against the carmelites house for one master and three fellows and the numbers have been since greatly increased as well as the revenues a great part of it is lately newbuilt and may be said to be a beautiful and regular fabric   0 jesus college was founded anno      by john alcocke bishop of ely out of an old nunnery dedicated to st radegund given him by king henry vii and pope julius ii on account of the scandalous incontinence of the nuns in order to be by him converted to this use and this prelate established in it a master six fellows and six scholars but their numbers have been much increased by great benefactions     christs college was founded by the lady margaret countess of richmond mother to king henry vii anno   0  upon the place where gods house formerly stood she settled there a master and    fellows etc which number in king edward vis time being complained of as favoring of superstition by alluding to our savior and his    disciples that prince added a   th fellowship with some new scholarships this college has been within these few years past adorned with a very fine new building     st johns college was founded about the year   0  by the same lady upon the place where anno      nigel or neal second bishop of ely founded an hospital for canons regular which by hugh de balsham was converted into a priory dedicated to st john and by the executors of the said countess of richmond into a college under the name of the same saint for she died before it was finished which retarded the work for some time but it was afterward carried on by her said executors and in the beginning of the reign of king james i was greatly enlarged with fair new buildings this college pleasantly situated by the river is no less remarkable for its number of students and its beautiful groves and gardens than for its strict and regular discipline it has a noble library which has been of late years greatly augmented by the accession of the library of dr gunning late bishop of ely who bequeathed the same to it     magdalen college was founded anno      by thomas audley lord chancellor of england and was afterward enlarged and endowed by sir christopher wrey lord chief justice of england this college stands by itself on the northwest side of the river and has been of late years improved and adorned by a handsome piece of building a fellowship of a considerable value has been lately founded at this college which is appropriated to gentlemen of the county of norfolk and called the traveling norfolk fellowship  to the library of this college was left a valuable collection of pamphlets by    pepys esquire as also great numbers of papers relating to the navy and admiralty the benefactor bequeathed the presses as well as the books and papers and they are kept in the manner he left them     trinity college was founded anno      by king henry viii out of three others st michaels college built by hervie of stanton in the time of edward ii kingshall founded by edward iii and fishwicks hostel its worthy master t nevil dean of canterbury repaired or rather newbuilt this college with that splendour and magnificence that for spaciousness and the beauty and uniformity of its buildings it is hardly to be outdone all which has been since still further improved by a most noble and stately library begun by the late famous dr isaac barrow a building for the bigness and design of it says a right reverend prelate perhaps not to be matched in these kingdoms nor is the learning of the present master easily to be paralleled any more than the troubles given to the college by the contention between him on the one side and the college and bishops of ely its visitors on the other which take them all together in their causes progress and invalid decision against him as it hitherto proves is one of the most extraordinary affairs that ever happened in the university     emanuel college was founded anno      by sir walter mildmay chancellor of the exchequer to queen elizabeth in a place where was formerly a convent of dominicans founded in the year    0 by the lady alice countess of oxford after the suppression of monasteries it came into the possession of mr sherwood of whom sir walter seems to have bought it it has a very near chapel built not many years ago by the bounty of dr william sancroft archbishop of canterbury and others and the library belonging to it has received of late years a fine addition by the valuable collection of books of the same archbishop given to it on the decease of that prelate     sidneysussex college was founded by virtue of the will of the lady frances sidney countess of sussex who died anno      and by her will left  000 l for the founding of a college to be called sidneysussex it was erected on the place where formerly the monastery of gray friars built by king edward i had flourished but though this college owes its rise to the bequest of this lady and the care of her executors it is exceedingly improved by the benefactions of sir francis clerk who besides erecting a set of new buildings augmented the scholarships and founded four fellowships with eight scholarships more and moreover sir john brereton left to it above  000 l  these are the sixteen colleges or halls in this university  the new senate house is a fine edifice and with the schools the universitylibrary and some other buildings intended to be erected opposite to it will form a stately quadrangle it is in length  0  feet and in breadth    and is adorned with fluted pillars a triangular pediment and other beautiful decorations  the schools of this university were at first in private houses hired from ten years to ten years for that purpose by the university in which time they might not be put to any other use afterward public schools were built at the charge of the university in or near the place where they now stand but the present fabric as it is now built of brick and rough stone was erected partly at the expense of the university and partly by the contributions of several benefactors  the university library was first built by rotheram archbishop of york who with tonstal bishop of durham furnished it with choice books few whereof are to be found at present but it contained nevertheless about   000 books when his late majesty king george i was graciously pleased in the beginning of his reign to purchase the large and curious library of dr john moor bishop of ely who died july  0      and as a mark of his royal favor to bestow it upon this university  there have been very lately great additions and alterations made in the library for the better disposition of this valuable royal present which consisted of upwards of  0000 volumes and cost the king  000 guineas and we cannot but observe in this place that the late lord viscount townsbend having understood that the university to show their gratitude and do honor to the memory of his late majesty king george i intended to erect a statue of that prince in the said library was pleased to offer to cause the same to be carved and set up at his own expense which generous tender was received by the university in the manner it deserved and with circumstances equally to their own and his lordships honor and in the month of october      in pursuance thereof a fine marble statue of this great prince was accordingly erected in the senatehall of kings college on which are the following inscriptions viz on the front georgio optimo principi magnae britanniae regi ob insignia ejus in banc academiam merita senatus cantabrigiensis in perpetuum grati animo testimonium statuam mortuo ponendam decrovit that is the senate of cambridge has decreed that this statue should be erected to his late most excellent majesty george i king of great britain as a perpetual monument of their gratitude for his signal benefits to this university on the left carolus vicecomes townshend summum tum academiae tum reipublicae decus pro eximia qua regem coluerat pietate preque singulari qua academiam feverat caritate statuam a senatu academito decretam sumptibus suis e marmore faciendam locavit that is charles lord viscount townshend a principal ornament both of the university and the state agreeably to his singular loyalty toward his prince and the particular affection wherewith he had cherished the university engaged to have the statue which was decreed by the senate of cambridge made of marble at his own expense carolus filius vicecomes townshend virtutum aeque ac honorum paternorum haeres statuam quam pater morte subita abreptus imperfectam reliquerat perficiendam atque in hoc ornatissimo academiae loco collocandam curavit that is charles the son lord viscount townshend heir alike to the virtues and dignities of his father has caused the statue which his father seized by sudden death had left imperfect to be finished and erected in this most honorable place of the university  this great king was not contented with having given this noble instance of his royal bounty to the university of cambridge but in the year      was graciously pleased to confer another mark of his favor upon them and which extended not only to that but to the university of oxford in creating a new establishment in a most useful branch of learning which was much wanted and for which till then there had been no provision which was to appoint two persons not under the degree of master of arts or bachelor of laws skilled in modern history and in the knowledge of modern languages to be nominated kings professors of modern history one for the university of cambridge and the other for that of oxford who are obliged to read lectures in the public schools at particular times each of which professors to have a stipend of  00 l per annum out of which each professor is obliged to maintain with sufficient salaries two persons at least well qualified to teach and instruct in writing and speaking the said languages gratis twenty scholars of each university to be nominated by the king each of which is obliged to learn two at least of the said languages  the same excellent prince also was pleased to appoint twelve persons chosen out of each of the universities to be preachers in the royal chapel of whitehall at stated times with handsome salaries and declared that he would cause a particular regard to be had to the members of the two universities in the dispositions of those benefices which fell in the royal gift  some other benefactions to this university within these few years past are as follow  dr john woodward who died april         left to the university of cambridge a sum of money for erecting a professorship for natural philosophy with a provision of   0 l per annum for the support and maintenance of the same for ever he likewise bequeathed to the said university his collection of fossils and other natural curiosities and such a part of his library moreover as was necessary to illustrate his said collection  on the death of mrs addenbroke mar    0 widow of an eminent physician of that name the sum of about  000 l devolved to this university which by the doctors will is to be applied to the building and furnishing a physical hospital in cambridge in which poor diseased people are to be admitted for cure gratis the master and fellows of catharinehall are appointed trustees of this charity  i shall not here enter into the puerile dispute which has so much engaged several learned pens that might have been better employed whether this university or that of oxford is the most ancient their emulation ought to be more worthily founded and indeed they have so much to boast as to the great and shining ornaments they have respectively produced to church and state and the figure they make in the commonwealth of learning that it is strange so trifling a contention should have been so warmly maintained  cambridgecastle was built by william the conqueror as one of those many which he erected in diverse parts to curb his newly conquered people it was strong and stately and had in it among other spacious apartments a most magnificent hall this being neglected the stones and timber of it were afterward begged of henry iv by the master and fellows of kingshall toward the building of their chapel nothing is now standing but the gatehouse which is the prison and an artificial high hill of a steep ascent and level at top  the town of cambridge is very large most of its streets are narrow the houses very illbuilt and the greatest part of them much out of repair so that were it not for the colleges and other public edifices it would make a very mean appearance  from cambridge the road lies northwest on the edge of the fens to huntingdon on which stands the little market town of caxton remarkable for the birthplace of caxton the first printer in england the roman way passes from arington s e through holm into this town and so on to papworth higher up on the same road which three lastmentioned places are villages only on this side it is all an agreeable corn country adorned with several seats of gentleman but the chief is wimplehall formerly built at a vast expense by the late earl of radnor it was afterward bought by his grace john holles cavendish late duke of newcastle in a partition of whose vast estate it fell to edward late earl of oxford and mortimer in right of his lady the only daughter of the said duke who brought the earl this estate and many others sufficient to denominate her one of the richest heiresses in great britain but his lordship parted with it a little before his death to the right hon the lord chancellor hardwick who now possesses it it is situated in a very dirty country and notwithstanding the cost bestowed upon it from its first owner to this time the gardens and buildings are both in a very bad taste  from cambridge my design obliging me and the direct road in part concurring i came back through the west side of the county of essex to saffronwalden passing by linton a small markettown of no note saying that a roman military way falls into the ikening here  saffronwalden is a fair town with a good church where stands a monument of the lord audley chancellor to king henry viii who made him a grant of certain lands belonging to a dissolved monastery near this town which takes its name from the great quantities of saffron which formerly grew in the grounds and were cultivated hereabouts and answered exceeding well in the manufacturing but how it came into decay nobody could account to me though there may be still seen a great many acres of saffronground about this town this commodity was never known to grow in england till the reign of edward iii this town gives title of baron to the earl of suffolk whose eldest son is by courtesy called lord walden  near this town on the side of cambridge road stands the noble and stately palace of audleyinn on audleyend formerly the largest palace of any in england and though a great part of it has been pulled down is still one of the most magnificent structures in the whole kingdom it was built out of the ruins of the abovementioned monastery by thomas second son of thomas duke of norfolk who married the only daughter and heir of the aforementioned lord audley this thomas was summoned into parliament in queen elizabeths time as lord audley of walden and was afterward created earl of suffolk by king james i to whom he was first chamberlain and afterward lord hightreasurer it was designed for a royal palace for that king and when it was finished with all the elegance and politeness of taste of the times the king was invited to see it and as he passed to newmarket he took up a nights lodging there and after having viewed it with great surprise and astonishment the earl asked him how he approved of it who answered very well but troth man said he it is too much for a king but it may do for a lord hightreasurer and so left it upon the earls hands who is reported to have had then an estate of  0000 l a year which has been gradually decaying ever since and is now reduced to about  000 l a year with encumbrances upon it king charles ii purchased this house and so it became what it was originally designed for a royal palace the king mortgaged the hearthtax to the earl to answer the purchasemoney and appointed james then earl of suffolk housekeeper thereof with a salary of  000 l a year which office continued in the family till the revolution when the hearthtax was abolished and the exigence of the state being such as it could not afford to pay the purchasemoney king william iii regranted the said house to the family upon which henry earl of suffolk who in his fathers lifetime was created earl of bindon to qualify him to hold the marshals staff pulled down a great part of this noble edifice and reduced it considerably and yet it is still very large and makes a grand appearance you enter in at a large wide pair of iron gates into a most spacious courtyard on each side of which was formerly a row of cloisters in which stood the outoffices belonging to the house which have been all pulled down and supplied with a stone wall you pass in at the forefront through part of the house into a large open quadrangle enclosed by four different parts of the house and almost surrounded with cloisters the apartments above and below are very lofty and spacious and there is a very long wide gallery which extends the whole length of the backfront of the house the gardens are very indifferent but very capable of improvement behind the house is a fine park extending to saffronwalden well stored with deer but not overburdened with timber in which there is a rising spot of ground whereon if the house had been erected it would have had a much better effect as to prospect for its present situation is low neither are the grounds about it very fertile or i think healthy  but however great and magnificent this noble house appears it bears an indelible stain if what is said be true that it was built with spanish gold upon the ruin of the great and learned ralegh who fell by the revenge of spain the arts of gundamor the avarice of suffolk and the unpardonable weakness of his own king but the present earls mind is more nobly endowed than that of his great ancestor as being a generous and truly charitable nobleman which he has testified by many beneficent acts among his poor neighbors especially during the great frost in the winter of       at a little town called littlebury not far from audleyinn is a house which was erected by the famous mr winstanley who built eddystone lighthouse and perished in it as i shall mention in its place here he had made many odd contrivances of chairs running on springs etc which usually much surprised strangers who came to see the house the person appointed to show it generally placed the greatest stranger into a particular chair which on touching the spring ran backward through the house into the garden the same gentleman was famous also for his waterworks full of whimsical but ingenious contrivances  but i ought not to omit that near icleton and strethal upon the river came lies chesterford where in the year      were discovered the vestigia of a roman city the foundation of the walls is very apparent quite round though level with the ground including about  0 acres great part of it serves for a causeway to the public cambridge road from london the crown inn is built upon it in the northwest end of the town is the foundation of a roman temple many roman coins have been found in the boroughfield as they term the ancient city whose name was camboritum according to dr stukely in this parish they say has been a royal manor not far off by audleyinn is a great roman camp upon an eminence where now stands an huntingtower of brick  a little north of this part of the country rises the river stour which for a course of fifty miles or more parts the two counties of suffolk and essex passing through or near haveril clare cavendish halsted sudbury buers nayland stretford dedham manningtree and into the sea at harwich  as we came on this side we saw at a distance braintree and bocking two large and populous towns which join together being parted by a little stream of water these were formerly very rich and flourishing occasioned by the great trade for bays which were manufactured in such quantities in these two towns as to send weekly to london four five or six wagons laden with them but this trade having greatly decreased in a few years the inhabitants are in a very miserable condition at present for by an increase of their poor their parish rates are risen so high as in the year      the poors rate in bocking parish was nine shillings in the pound which together with their other rates and taxes rendered it very burdensome to all the inhabitants and at the same time the small pox having infested both the towns their markets were almost deserted by the country people the parish of bocking is a deanery and the living is valued at upwards of  00 l per annum  near braintree is the parish of black notely in which are a few scattered houses scarcely worth noticing except for the memory of the late learned mr ray who resided many years in this place and was buried in the churchyard over whose grave a monument was erected with an inscription in latin which being long we shall refer the learned to the original and content ourselves with giving the english for the sake of our common readers and in regard to so great a man who was an honor to his country it may be thus rendered  the mortal part of the most learned john ray a m is deposited in this narrow tomb but his writings are not confined to one nation and his fame everywhere most illustrious renders them immortal formerly he was fellow of trinitycollege in cambridge and of the royal society in london a singular ornament of both in every kind of science as well divine as human most expert and like a second solomon to whom alone perhaps he was inferior from the cedar to the hyssop from the largest of animals to the smallest insects he arrived at a consummate knowledge and not only did he most accurately discourse of plants spread over the face of the whole earth but making a most strict search even into its inmost bowels whatever deserved discussion throughout all nature he described while on his travels abroad he diligently discovered what had escaped the observation of others and first brought to light many things most worthy of remark further than this he was endowed with so unaffected a manner of behavior that he was learned without pedantry of a sublime genius and at the same time which is rarely known of an humble and modest disposition not distinguished by an illustrious extraction but what is greater by his own virtue little solicitous about obtaining wealth and titles he chose rather to deserve than to possess them content with his own lot he grew old in a private station worthy a more ample fortune in every other respect he readily observed moderation in study none  to conclude to all these perfections he added a piety free from artifice bearing an entire and hearty veneration for the church of england which he confirmed with his last breath thus happily in a virtuous retirement lived he whom the present age reveres and posterity will admire    nb this monument beginning to want repair by standing exposed in the churchyard has been lately removed and set up in the chancel of black notely church to the former epitaph is added on the table on the east side a latin inscription which may be thus rendered  this cenotaph formerly exposed to the open air in the churchyard defaced by the injuries of the weather and just falling into ruins was by j leg m d repaired and removed under shelter march          the country hereabout is very pleasant having many risings and falls with great plenty of water the fields are well cultivated so as to render the whole face of the country like a garden but what is often very surprising to strangers is the nakedness of most of the large trees growing in their hedge rows and on the sides of the road even in the month of may at which time few of them have put out any leaves but upon inquiry i found they were a peculiar sort of elm which rarely puts out leaves before the middle of may and this is one of the most common trees of this country  near braintree is felsted a small place but noted for a flourishing free school of an ancient foundation  near to this is the priory of lees which i mentioned before  p  0 and hence keeping the london road i came to chelmsford mentioned also before and ingatestone five miles west which i mention again as i promised  page  0 to have an opportunity to speak of the noble family of lord petre and of the improvements making at his seat near this place by the present lord who is a nobleman of fine taste and great qualities  ingatestonehall one of his lordships seats lies at a small distance from the public road on the right hand about a quarter of a mile short of ingatestone town  the house is situated very low so as not to be seen at a small distance it is a very large irregular building and the gardens are old though there were many alterations made in them for the better by the present lord before he came of age but as this was not the seat where he intended to reside so his lordship did not employ his fine genius in modelling of these gardens but his whole thoughts were bent to embellish his noble seat at thorndon which is situated on a rising ground about three miles on the right hand of brentwood in essex where his lordship has been some years laying of a plan for a house and gardens which when executed will be an honor to the nation  the house when finished will be     feet in front exclusive of the offices the principal front is to the southeast aspect where is designed a spacious court before this is designed a terracewalk near  00 feet broad and of a great length on the other side of this will be a lawn of grass containing near  00 acres of land which is bounded by plantations of trees and handsome farms  on the backfront of the house is a noble range of stoves for tender exotic plants which when finished will far exceed whatever has been done of this nature even by the greatest princes in europe  the park which lies on the northeast and northwest side of the house is very large and well stocked with timber which fully grown adds greatly to the beauty of the place in many parts of this park are large enclosures which have been made by the present lord and are converted to nurseries which are completely stored with all trees and shrubs that will live in the open air in this climate so that when these trees are planted out according to his lordships design it will be the most beautiful and complete plantation perhaps in europe  through the park there is already an avenue cut leading from brentwood to the house three miles in length on each side of it are designed plantations of trees in regular clumps which when finished will have a noble effect as people pass through up to the house  the kitchengarden is already finished and laid out with equal elegance and usefulness this is situated behind the offices so that it does not appear in sight from the house and is detached from the other gardens and thereby is not exposed to strangers who may have admittance to walk through the pleasuregarden and plantations  in short the whole plan is the most extensive and grand of any yet executed in this kingdom  in the parish church of ingatestone are to be seen the monuments of his lordships ancestors who by a constant series of beneficent actions to the poor and bounty upon all charitable occasions gained to themselves an affectionate esteem through all that part of the country such as no prejudice arising from a difference in religion could or ought to impair for great and good actions command our respect whatever the opinions of the donors may be  from hence we crossed the country to the great forest called epping forest reaching almost to london the country on that side of essex is called the roodings i suppose because there are no less than ten towns almost together called by the name of roding and is famous for good land good malt and dirty roads the latter being in the winter hardly passable for horse or man in the midst of this we see chipping onger hatfield broadoak epping and many foresttowns famed also for husbandry and good malt on the south side of the county is walthamabbey which was formerly a monastery built by harold son to earl godwin in honor of the cross the town is said to be built and peopled by one tovius toward the latterend of the saxons reign this town is seated on the river lee where the streams being divided enclose several small islands which in times of great floods are commonly overflowed but these meadows produce great plenty of grass in summer so that here are many dairy farms which turn to good account  the abbey is turned into a seat which is now in the possession of   jones esquire the gardens belonging to this house were some years since in great repute but since the taste for enclosed gardens has been condemned they have been little frequented unless by some curious persons to see the tuliptree which grows on a grassplat near the house and is one of the finest and most flourishing of the kind in england producing annually a great quantity of flowers in the month of july  at this abbey was buried the body of king harold slain in the great battle in sussex against william the conqueror whose mother begged that favor of the conqueror but no monument was built for him only a flat gravestone on which was significantly engraven harold infelix  from hence i came again over the lower or western part of the forest where it is bespangled with villages filled with fine seats most of them built by citizens of london but the luster of them seems to be entirely eclipsed by the magnificent palace of earl tilney which i barely mentioned  page   and intimated that i would touch upon it again as i shall now briefly do this noble seat was prepared by his lordships father sir josiah child in his lifetime who added to the advantage of its situation a vast number of rows of trees planted in curious order for avenues and vistas all leading up to the spot of ground where the old house stood  in the place adjoining the present lord before he was ennobled and some years before he began the foundation of his new house laid out the most spacious pieces of fine ground in gardens that are to be seen in this part of england the greenhouse is an excellent building fit to entertain a prince it is furnished with stoves and artificial places for heat from an apartment which has a bagnio and other conveniences which render it both useful and pleasant and these gardens have been so much the admiration of the public that it has been the general diversion of the citizens to go out to see them till the crowds grew so great that his lordship was obliged to restrain the showing them to particular and stated times  the house was built since these gardens were finished it is all of portland stone in the front which gives it a most magnificent effect at a distance as the nature of that stone except in london where it is tinged with smoke is to grow whiter and whiter the longer it stands in the open air  as the forefront of the house looks through a long row of trees reaching to the great road at leightonstone so the backfront respects the gardens from which you fall down an easy descent which lands you upon the terrace and gives a most beautiful prospect to the river which is all formed into canals and openings to answer the views from above and beyond the river the walks and wildernesses go on to such a distance and in such a manner up the hill as they before went down that the sight is lost in the woods adjoining and it looks all like one continued planted garden as far as the eye can see  i have not room in this letter to say half what might be said of this truly noble palace nor for a particular description of the beautiful house and gardens erected at lowlayton by the late sir fisher tench which the duke daumont ambassador from france about the year      said was one of the neatest boxes he had seen in england and so shall hasten to conclude this letter  from earl tilneys house and the rest of the fine dwellings on that side of the forest for there are several very good houses at wanstead only that they seem as i have said all lost in the luster of his lordships palace i went south toward the great road over that part of the forest called the flats and by this turn came necessarily on to stratford where i set out and here i shall conclude my second letter with assuring you that i am  your most humble servant  letter iii containing a description of the county of kent etc sir i shall begin my account of the famous county of kent at deptford it was anciently called westgreenwich and is a very large town and of late so very much improved that a handsome new church has been built there dedicated to st paul  here was built by king henry viii a storehouse who also incorporated certain officers by the name of master and wardens of the holy trinity these were to take care of the building keeping and conducting of the royal navy their hall or house was adjoining to the church and the treasurer of the navy had also a convenient house at the dock for his residence  here is a foundation belonging to the said corporation of trinityhouse by whom it was built at different times and in two places not quite contiguous the old part contains    houses the new    for decayed pilots or masters of ships or the widows of such the men are allowed  0 s the women    s per month  but what deptford is most noted for is its noble dock where the royal navy was used to be built and repaired till it was found more convenient to build the larger ships at woolwich as i shall mention in its place notwithstanding which the whole area of the yard is now enlarged to more than double what it formerly was it has a wet dock of two acres for ships and another of an acre and half for masts besides an enlargement of its storehouses dwellinghouses launches etc suitable to it  near the dock is a seat belonging to sir john evelyn which is called sayscourt this was originally in the family of the magmenots who were normans one of whom was lord warden of the ports and governor of dovercastle  the red house at deptford was a noted collection of warehouses and storehouses for many sorts of merchandises and particularly hemp flax pitch tar etc but on thursday the  th of july      a dreadful fire broke out there which consumed the same the loss was incredible for the materials were so combustible that nothing could be saved nor could the flames be extinguished till they had nothing to prey upon  from deptford i proceeded to greenwich one of the most delightful spots of great britain the park in which is the fine observatory called flamsteadhouse from the late famous mathematician of that name the royal house but more especially the noble hospital deserve particular notice  the ground on which part of this hospital now stands is the same on which was formerly situated the royal palace of our kings here henry viii held his feasts with jousts and tournaments and the ground which was called the tiltyard is the spot on which the east wing of the hospital is built  the park was enlarged walled about and planted by king charles ii soon after the restoration and the design or plan of a royal palace was then laid out one wing of which was finished in a magnificent manner and makes now the first wing of the hospital toward london  the royal palace now remaining was originally built by humphrey duke of gloucester surnamed the good brother of henry vi and called by him placentia king henry vii much enlarged it added to it a small house of friersmendicant and finished a tower begun by duke humphrey on the top of the hill where now stands the royal observatory from which is a most pleasant prospect down to the winding river and the green meadows it was completed by king henry viii and afterward much enlarged and beautified by henry howard earl of northampton who dwelt in it here queen mary and queen elizabeth were born and here died king edward vi  the hospital was founded by king william and queen mary in the year      for the relief of seamen their widows and children and encouragement of navigation three tables are hung up at the entrance into the hall which record the names of several generous benefactors to this noble charity amounting in the whole to the sum of    0  l and in the year      the forfeited estate of the late earl of derwentwater being by means of the right honorable the lord viscount gage a peer of ireland recovered out of the hands of certain private persons who had purchased the same at a rate vastly disproportioned to the value amounting to near  000 l per annum was given by parliament to carry on and complete this work which will enable them to prosecute it with vigor and success and accordingly they have made a great progress since that time in the second wing and other parts of this sumptuous edifice  the hall is very noble and finely painted by the late sir james thornhill at the upperend of it in an alcove are represented the present royal family the late princess sophia king george i king george ii and queen caroline the queen dowager of prussia the prince of wales the duke and the five princesses on the ceiling over the alcove are her late majesty queen anne and prince george of denmark and on the ceiling of the hall are king william and queen mary with several fine emblematical figures  on a pedestal in the middle of the area of the hospital fronting the thames is a statue of his majesty king george ii  anno   0   00 disabled seamen were the first that were received into this hospital but the present number was made up in december      a complete  000 to each  00 pensioners six nurses are allowed who are to be seamens widows at  0 l per annum and   s per week more to those who attend in the infirmary their common clothing is blue with brass buttons  the church of greenwich is a very handsome newbuilt edifice dedicated to st alphage archbishop of canterbury who is said to have been killed by the danes on the spot where the church stands anno  0    there are two freeschools in this parish one founded by sir william boreman knight the other was set up by mr john roan who left his estate for teaching boys in reading writing and arithmetic allowing   l per annum for each boys clothes their number is twenty  there is also a handsome college in this town which fronts the river for the maintenance of twenty poor men and a master founded and well endowed by henry earl of northampton and committed by him to the care of the mercers company of london a chapel belongs to this college where the earls body is laid which as well as his monument was removed hither a few years ago from the chapel of dover castle whereof he was constable  this town may be said to be one of the genteelest as well as pleasantest in england the inhabitants are many of them persons of note and fashion who have served abroad in the fleets or armies and here pass the remainder of their days in ease and delight having the pleasure to reflect upon the dangers they have gone through and the faithful and honorable parts they have acted on the public stage of life in their countrys cause  a market was erected in the year      at this town the direction of which is in the governors of the hospital and the profits which shall arise from it are to be carried to the use of that fine foundation  the river of thames is here very broad and the chanel deep and the water at some very high springtides is salt but in ordinary tides sweet and fresh  the country behind greenwich adds to the pleasure of the place black heath both for beauty of situation and an excellent air is not outdone by any spot of ground in england  near this is a vast hill used as a butt for archers and in great request among the neighboring people till king henry viiis time whence it took the name of shootershill  on the east side of black heath stands the hospital built by sir john morden bart a turkey merchant several years before his death which happened in   0  he erected this spacious structure in form of a college solely at his own charge in a field called great stone field not far from his own habitation for the reception of poor decayed honest merchants whereof in his lifetime he placed twelve there but by reason of great losses they were reduced to four in the lady mordens time who was forced to retrench the expenses of the house because the share allotted her by the last will of sir john and some parts of his estate did not answer so well as was expected  when she died sir johns whole estate coming to the college the number was again increased and there are at this time    poor gentlemen in the house and the number not being limited they are to be increased as the estate will afford for the building was designed for and will conveniently hold  0  seven turkey merchants have the direction and visitation of this hospital and the nomination of the persons to be admitted into it and as often as any of these seven die the survivors are to choose others to fill up that number  every treasurer of this hospital has  0 l per annum there is also a chaplain who is to read prayers twice a day in the chapel and to preach twice every sunday his salary at first was  0 l a year but the lady morden doubled it at her death she was in other respects a benefactress to the college and as she put up her husbands statue in a niche over the gate of the college the trustees have also put up hers in another niche adjoining to that of her husband  the pension is  0 l per annum each at first they wore gowns with the founders badge which they have not done for some years  the chapel within the college is neatly wainscotted and has a costly altarpiece and it has a buryingplace adjoining for the members of the college the founder according to his own desire was buried in a vault under the communion table of this chapel  the chaplain the treasurer the merchants are all indispensably obliged to be resident there and unless in case of sickness no other persons are to reside live or lodge there and no person is to be admitted as a pensioner who cannot bring a certificate to prove himself upwards of  0 years of age  in a word as the situation of the place is pleasant the air very good and the endowment very sufficient this may be said to be one of the most comfortable and elegant pieces of charity in england  near this college is the noble house or rather palace of sir gregory page bart whose father was a brewer at greenwich a few years ago it is one of the finest seats in england belonging to a private gentleman and the park gardens and country round it contribute to make it a most delightful and truly noble habitation  it was begun and entirely raised and covered in the space of eleven months which shows how soon a large building may be finished where money the sinews of building etc is not wanting  over this heath the famous roman watlingstreet ran toward shootershill and so on to rochester canterbury and dover here are great numbers of small tumuli with some large and eminent ones out of which bones have been dug by the late learned dr gale who resided many years on this heath which show that many persons of eminence have been formerly buried here  on this heath the danish army lay a great while encamped a d  0   and many trenches and other remains of the lines of camps are still visible  on the other side of the heath north is charlton a well built pleasant village the church was beautified and repaired by order of sir edward newton bart who was tutor to king james the firsts son prince henry and it is one of the finest churches in this county  at the entrance of this village fronting black heath stands the ancient house built by sir edward newton who had this manor granted to him by king james i it is a long pile of building in a gothic taste having four turrets on the top the court before the house is spacious at the entrance of which are too large gothic piers to the gates and in a line on the outside of the wall is a long row of cypress trees which are some of the oldest in england on the back of the house are large gardens remaining in the same taste in which they were formerly laid out and behind these is a small park which joins to woolwich common this house is now in the possession of the earl of egmont  near the church are two fine houses one of which was built by the late lord romney who married a daughter of sir cloudesly shovel the other was in the possession of the late governor hunter before he went to jamaica  these houses stand on the edge of the hill having their gardens sloping down toward the river which though it renders the prospect to the river very delightful in the heat of summer yet as it exposes their gardens to the north winds their fruit trees are generally blighted and in the spring when the wind usually blows from the north and east these gardens are so much exposed to them that it is very few days during that season that persons can walk with any pleasure in them  it is true that in these gardens you have a large reach of the river in view so that every tide of flood a great number of ships are generally sailing by to london as in the tide of ebb many are passing toward gravesend which affords a very delightful sight as it shows the great trade carried on by the metropolis yet as the country on the other side of the water is a dead flat for a great number of miles and this often covered with water in winter so the winds not only come very cold over this flat but also bring fogs damps and a very unwholesome air with them which greatly diminishes the pleasure of these seats  charlton is noted for the fair held in its neighborhood on st lukes day october    called hornfair the rudeness of which in a civilized wellgoverned nation may well be said to be unsufferable the mob at that time take all kinds of liberties and the women are especially impudent that day as if it was a day that justified the giving themselves a loose to all manner of indecency without any reproach or without incurring the censure which such behavior would deserve at another time  and this in a circumstance which far from being to be gloried in ought to be discountenanced by the sex as fixing the brand of incontinence on too many of them which they have little reason to be proud of  a vulgar tradition gives the following origin to this disorderly fair it pretends to say that one of the kings of england some say king john who had a palace in this neighborhood at eltham being a hunting near charlton then a pitiful hamlet only and separated from his attendants entered into a cottage and found the mistress of it alone and she being handsome the king took a liking to her and having prevailed over her modesty just in the critical moment her husband came in and vowing to kill them both the king was forced to discover himself and to compound with gold for his safety giving him moreover all the land from thence as far as the place now called cuckolds point and making him master of the whole hamlet established a fair in favor of his new demesne and in memory thereof horns and wares and toys of all sorts made of horn are sold at this fair  through this town lies the road to woolwich a town situated on the bank of the river and wholly taken up by and in a manner raised from the yards and works erected there for the naval service for here when the business of the royal navy increased and queen elizabeth built larger and greater ships of war than were usually employed before new docks and launches were erected and places prepared for the building and repairing ships of the largest size because here was a greater depth of water and a freer chanel than at deptford  the docks yards and all the buildings belonging to it are encompassed with a high wall and are exceeding spacious and convenient and so prodigiously full of all sorts of stores of timber plank masts pitch tar and other naval provisions as can hardly be calculated  besides the buildingyards here is a large ropewalk where the biggest cables are made for the men of war and on the east or lowerpart of the town is the gunyard commonly called the park or the gunpark where is a prodigious quantity of cannon of all sorts for the ships of war every ships guns apart heavy cannon for batteries and mortars of all sorts and sizes insomuch that as i was informed here have been sometimes laid up at one time between seven and eight thousand pieces of ordnance besides mortars and shells almost beyond number  here also is the house where the firemen and engineers prepare their fireworks charge bombs carcasses and grenades for the public service  here is usually a guardship riding especially in time of war the town of late years is much enlarged and beautified several fine docks ropeyards and capacious magazines added and the royal foundery for cannon repaired and improved the thames is here at high water near a mile over and the water salt upon the flood and as the chanel lies strait east and west for about three miles the tide runs very strong and the river is entirely free from shoals and sands and has seven or eight fathom water so that the biggest ships may ride here with safety even at low water  the parish church of woolwich has been lately rebuilt as one of the fifty new churches in a very handsome manner  from this town till we come to gravesend the whole shore is low and spread with marshes and unhealthy grounds except some few intervals where the land bends inward as at erith greenhythe northfleet etc in which places the chalk hills almost join the river and from thence the city of london the adjacent countries and even holland and flanders are supplied with lime or with chalk to make it  from these cliffs on the riverside the rubbish of the chalk which they must be otherwise at the charge of removing is bought and fetched away by lighters and hoys and carried to all the forts and creeks in the opposite county of essex and even to suffolk and norfolk and sold there to the farmers to lay upon their land which they do in prodigious quantities and are glad to give from   s   d to   s a load for it according to the distance  this is the practice in all the creeks and rivers in essex even to malden colchester the nase and into harwich harbor up to maningtree and ipswich as also in suffolk to aldborough orford dunwich swold and as high as yarmouth in norfolk  thus the barren soil of kent for such the chalky grounds are esteemed make the strong clayey lands of essex rich and fruitful and the mixture of earth forms a composition which out of two barren extremes makes one prolifick medium  behind these marshy grounds in kent at a small distance lies the road from london to dover on which or near it are several good towns for example eltham formerly a royal palace when the court was kept at greenwich and queen elizabeth who as before said was born at greenwich was often carried to eltham by her nurses to draw in the wholesome air of that agreeable place but at present there are few or no signs of the old palace to be seen  it is now however a pleasant town very handsomely built full of good houses and many families of rich citizens inhabit there who bring a great deal of good company with them  near eltham lies chesilhurst where is the buryingplace of the family of the walsinghams who resided in this parish for several generations  in this parish is an ancient seat called frogpool or fragnall which in the reign of king henry iii was in the possession of thomas le barbur who in the   th year of the late kings reign had a charter of free warren for his lands here this seat is now in the possession of mr tryon a merchant of london  this village is famous for the retirement of the famous mr camden who resided here for several years and here composed the greatest part of his annals of queen elizabeth  near this are several other towns and villages as bexley crayford wilmington footscray northcray etc which being places of little note i shall pass over with only observing that about these villages are many woods chiefly of birch from whence the broommakers in kentstreet southwark are supplied with their birch which bring in a considerable profit to the landowners  from this side of the country all pleasant and gay we go over shootershill where the face of things seems quite altered for here we have but a chalky soil and far from rich much overgrown with coppicewood which is cut for faggots and bavins and sent up by water to london here they make those faggots which the woodmongers call ostreywood and in particular those small light bavins which are used in taverns in london to light their faggots and are called in the taverns a brush and by the woodmen pimps it is incredible what vast quantities of these used to be laid up at woolwich erith and dartford but since the taverns in london are come to make coalfires in their upper rooms that trade declines and though that article would seem to be trifling in itself it is not immaterial to observe what an alteration it makes in the value of those woods in kent and how many more of them than usual are yearly grubbed up and the land made fit for the plough  in july      a very good design was begun to be put in execution on shootershill a number of hands being employed in cutting a new road wide enough for three carriages to pass abreast on the eastern descent of the hill which was formerly so narrow that it was impossible for a passenger if waylaid to escape falling into a ruffians hands and which gave occasion to many robberies being committed here  dartford is a handsome large town having many good houses in it and is finely watered by two or three very good springs the river goes through the town and discharges itself into the thames on this river the first papermill in england was built by sir john spillman in the reign of king charles i who granted him a patent with a salary of  00 l per annum for his encouragement  the first mill also for slitting of bars of iron for making of wire was on this river  there are two churchyards here one about the church and the other on the top of the hill toward northfleet in the latter of which you may look over the tower of the church the ground rising suddenly so very high  here is a very good market for corn on saturdays and an annual fair on the   d of july  january          the powdermill at dartford blew up with this remarkable circumstance that though all the servants were about their respective employments not one of them received any hurt and it is further remarkable that within eight years this is the fourth time that this mill has been blown up and no damage done by the disaster to the persons of the people belonging to it  gravesend lies on the northside of kent on the river thames about six miles northeast from dartford and about the same distance from rochester the town of gravesend and milton were incorporated in the  0th year of queen elizabeth by the name of the portreeve jurats and inhabitants of the towns of gravesend and milton as this place is the most frequented passage of taking boat for london by persons who come from dover rochester etc or through any part of kent from foreign parts so queen elizabeth ordered the mayor aldermen and companies of the city of london to receive all eminent strangers and ambassadors here in their formalities and so to attend them to london in their barges if they came up by water and if they came by land they were ordered to meet them on black heath on horseback in their gowns so much did that wise queen consult the honor and grandeur of the city  king henry viii raised here a platform of guns and another at milton as well as two others over against them on the essex side for the security of the river but since the erection of tilburyfort these have been demolished  in the year    0 this town was burnt by the french and spanish galleys and the enemies carried away most of the inhabitants prisoners  here is a very handsome charity given by one mr henry pinnock in the year      of    dwellings and a house for a master weaver to employ the poor and a good estate is also settled for the repairs  in this town on the east side is still standing the body of an ancient chapel which seems to have belonged to some religious house for places in the walls of the vault remain still for holy water a market is kept here on wednesdays and saturdays and an annual fair on the   th of october which lasts a week  there have been very great improvements made of the lands near this town within a few years past by turning them into kitchengardens the land being fresh for this purpose as also pretty moist and the town having good quantity of dung made in it with which they manure the land it produces very good gardenstuff in great plenty wherewith they not only supply the towns for several miles round but also send great quantities to the london markets particularly asparagus which is so much esteemed that the name of gravesend will bring a better price than what is brought from any other place this having obtained a much greater reputation than battersea which was some years since famous for asparagus  as gravesend is the great ferry as they call it between london and eastkent it is hardly credible what numbers of people pass here every tide as well by night as by day between this town and london almost all the people of eastkent when they go for london go no farther by land than this town and then for   d in the tiltboat or   s in a small boat or wherry are carried to london by water  another thing for which this town is worth notice is that all the ships which go to sea from london take as we say their departure from hence for here all outwardbound ships must stop come to an anchor and suffer what they call a second clearing viz here a searcher of the customs comes on board looks over all the coquets or entries of the cargo and may if he pleases romage the whole lading to see if there are any more goods than are entered which however they seldom do though they forget not to take a compliment for their civility and besides being well treated on board have generally three or five guns fired in honor to them when they go off  the method of causing all ships to stop here is worth observing and is as follows  when a merchantship comes down from london if they have the tide of ebb under foot or a fresh gale of wind from the west so that they have what they call freshway and the ships come down apace they generally hand some of their sails haul up a foresail or mainsail or lower the foretopsail so to slacken her way as soon as they come to the old mans head when they open the reach which they call gravesend reach which begins about a mile and half above the town they do the like to signify that they intend to bring to as the sailors call it and come to an anchor  as soon as they come among the ships that are in the road as there are always a great many the sentinel at the blockhouse on gravesend side fires his musket which is to tell the pilot he must bring to if he comes on as soon as the ship passes broadside with the blockhouse the sentinel fires again which is as much as to say why dont you bring to if he drives a little farther he fires a third time and the language of that is bring to immediately and let go your anchor or we will make you  if the ship continues to drive down and does not let go her anchor the gunner of the fort is called and he fires a piece of cannon though without ball and that is still a threat though with some patience and is to say will you come to an anchor or will you not if he still ventures to go on by which he gives them to understand he intends to run for it then the gunner fires again and with a shot and that shot is a signal to the fortress over the river viz tilbury fort which i described in my account of essex p   and they immediately let fly at the ship from the guns on the east bastion and after from all the guns they can bring to bear upon her it is very seldom that a ship will venture their shot because they can reach her all the way to the hope and round the hopepoint almost to holehaven though it is said this has been done once or twice but the occasion must be very extraordinary to make a ship run the risque as for ships coming in they all go by here without any notice taken of them unless it be to put waiters on board if they are not supplied before  on the   th of august      a dreadful fire happened here which burnt down and destroyed the church and the greatest part of the town and in      an act of parliament passed for rebuilding the church as one of the fifty new ones and the town too being mostly rebuilt makes a better appearance for the calamity it underwent  the passage to and from gravesend to london is now made more commodious and safe for passengers than before by act of parliament passed in       for regulating the company of watermen etc between gravesend and windsor which limits the number of passengers to forty at the most on board the tiltboats and ten at most by the wherries directs the burden of the said boats prohibits close decks and bails nailed down in the wherries prescribes the times of departure of the tiltboats and wherries and the age of the watermen navigating the said boats and directs a punishment against such watermen as wilfully lose their tide or set the passengers on shore two miles short of the place to which they are bound and the rulers of the watermens company are thereby obliged to provide officers at billinsgate and at gravesend who as near as is possible night and day at every time of high water and first of flood are at the respective places to ring publicly a bell set up for that purpose for fifteen minutes to give notice to the tiltboats and wherries to put off and make the best of their way without lying by or putting on shore being within two miles of their respective ports which excellent provisions must be a great ease and safety to all persons who are obliged to use this passage  a remarkable occurrence happening the last time i was at gravesend deserves to be mentioned here in honor to a brave and excellent english mariner the case was thus  on saturday december         the ship anne and thomas captain ogilvie commander outwardbound for africa lying at gravesend was by the boiling over of a kettle of pitch set on fire to extinguish which the crew at first made an attempt but finding the flames increase upon them they were all upon the point of leaving her for fear of  00 barrels of gunpowder which were on board when happily the mate returning from a visit he had been making to a brother officer of a neighboring ship stopped their design and with a noble resolution cutting the boats clear of the ship told them they had no means left to escape perishing either by fire or water but by heartily joining their endeavors to extinguish the flames when they found themselves in so bad a dilemma they unanimously attempted it and after some time providentially got it under to the no small joy of the town of gravesend as well as of all the ships near them who were in the utmost consternation for fear of the gunpowder and every moment in expectation of the terrible blow  we see nothing remarkable on the road hereabouts but gads hill a noted place for robbing of seamen after they have received their pay at chatham here it was that a famous robbery was committed in or about the year      which deserves to be mentioned it was about four oclock in the morning when a gentleman was robbed by one nicks on a bay mare just on the declivity of the hill on the west side nicks came away to gravesend and as he said was stopped by the difficulty of getting the boat near an hour which was a great discouragement to him but he made the best use of it as a kind of bait to his horse from thence he rode cross the county of essex to chelmsford here he stopped about half an hour to refresh his horse and gave him some balls from thence to braintree bocking wethersfield then over the downs to cambridge and from thence keeping still the cross roads he went by fenny stratford to godmanchester and huntingdon where he baited himself and his mare about an hour and as he said himself slept about half an hour then holding on the north road and keeping a full gallop most of the way he came to york the same afternoon put off his boots and riding clothes and went dressed as if he had been an inhabitant of the place to the bowlinggreen where among other gentlemen was the lord mayor of the city he singling out his lordship studied to do something particular that the mayor might remember him by and then takes occasion to ask his lordship what oclock it was who pulling out his watch told him the hour which was a quarter before or a quarter after eight at night  upon a prosecution for this robbery the whole merit of the case turned upon this single point the person robbed swore to the man to the place and to the time in which the fact was committed but nicks proving by the lord mayor that he was as far off as yorkshire at that time the jury acquitted him on a bare supposition that it was impossible the man could be at two places so remote on one and the same day  on the road from gads hill to rochester are very large cherryorchards especially on the righthand of the road these cherries are sent up to london in hoys and were formerly a great branch of trade to the landowners of this country but of late years there has been such plenty of this fruit that they have scarce paid for gathering and sending to london which has occasioned many of the owners of these orchards to destroy them  from gads hill we come to rochesterbridge the longest highest and the strongest built of all the bridges in england except that of london some indeed say the bridge of newcastle upon tyne exceeds all the bridges in england for strength but then it is neither so high nor so long as this at rochester it is supported by eleven arches and was built by sir robert knowles in the reign of henry iv and railed in with iron at the charge of archbishop warham  the river medway at this place is very broad and rapid foaming most violently rochester was the roman city durobrivis and was very strong being walled about and ditchd many antiquities have been found hereabouts this city stands in an angle of the river and seems to have been of a square form the watlingstreet running directly through it most of the walls still remain and a large piece of the roman wall made of rubblestone laid sloping sideways is to be seen near that angle below the bridge encompassed by the river with roman bricks in several places  rochester stroud and chatham are three distinct places but in a manner contiguous  rochester has suffered very much by fire and war it consists chiefly of a large illbuilt broad street stroud is separated from it only by a bridge and may alone pass for a small city and is well built but has nothing very remarkable in it  the castle of rochester was erected by king william i out of one angle of the river the walls of the great tower now left are four yards thick the body of the cathedral is of the original structure before the conquest and repaired by bishop gundulph an architect who likewise built the castle the great tower is called gundulphs tower the chalky cliff under the castle wall next the river is a romantic sight the rapidity of the stream wastes it away and then huge tracts of the wall fall down on the north side of the northwest tower of the church is gundulphs effigies the front of the church is of the old work but a new window put in the middle the eastern gate of the city was pulled down not very long ago the stones of which were of a roman cut the townhouse and charityschool are two of the best public buildings in rochester and stroud except the churches  but chatham being the chief arsenal of the royal navy of great britain is the most considerable of the kind in the world the private buildings as the houses of the seaofficers directors inspectors and workmen belonging to the royal navy are well built and many of them stately but the public edifices there are indeed like the ships themselves surprisingly large and in their several kinds beautiful the warehouses or rather streets of warehouses and storehouses for laying up the naval treasure are the largest in dimension and the most in number that are anywhere to be seen in the world the ropewalks for making cables and the forges for anchors and other ironwork bear a proportion to the rest as also the wetdock canals and ditches for keeping masts and yards of the greatest size where they lie sunk in the water to preserve them the boatyard ropeyards the anchoryard forges founderies all not easy to be described  we come next to the stores themselves for which all this provision is made and first to begin with the ships that are laid up there the sails the rigging the ammunition guns great and small shot small arms swords cutlasses halfpikes with all the other furniture belonging to the ships that ride at their moorings in the river medway powder excepted which is generally carried to particular magazines to avoid disaster all these stores are reposited in separate buildings and storehouses appropriated for the furniture of every ship and may be taken out on the most emergent occasion without confusion  besides these are warehouses for laying up the furniture and stores for ships in general and for the furnishing other ships to be built or for repairing and supplying the ships already there as occasion may require  for this purpose there are separate and respective magazines of pitch tar hemp flax tow resin oil tallow also of sailcloth canvas cables standing and running rigging ready fitted and cordage not fitted with all kinds of shipchandlery necessaries such as blocks tackles runners etc with the cooks boatswains and gunners stores and also anchors of all sizes grapnells chains bolts and spikes wrought and unwrought iron castiron work such as pots caldrons furnaces etc also boats spare masts and yards with a great quantity of lead and nails and other necessaries too many to be enumerated  to observe these things deliberately one would almost wonder what ships they were and where they should be found which could either for building or repairing fitting or refitting call for such a quantity of all these things but when on the other hand one sees the ships and considers their dimensions and consequently the dimensions of all things which belong to them how large how strong every thing must be how much of the materials must go to the making every thing proportionable to the occasion the wonder would change its prospect and one would be as much amazed to think how and where they should be supplied  the particular government of these yards is very remarkable the commissioners clerks accomptants etc within doors the storekeepers yardkeepers dockkeepers watchmen and all other officers without doors with the subordination of all officers one to another respectively as their degrees and offices require the watchmen are set duly every night at stated and certain places within the several yards with every one a bell over his head which they ring or toll every hour giving so many strokes as the hour reckons and then one taking it from another through every part of the yard and of all the yards makes the watch be performed in a very exact and regular manner in the river is a guardboat which like the mainguard in a garrison rows the grand rounds at certain times by every ship in the river to see that the people on board are at their post if the man placed to look out in each ship does not call who comes there the guardboat boards it immediately to examine into the defect of duty  the expedition that has been sometimes used here in fitting out men of war is scarce credible for the workmen told us that the royal sovereign a first rate of  0  guns was riding at her moorings entirely unriggd and nothing but her three masts standing as is usual when a ship is laid up and that she was completely rigged all her masts up her yards put to her sails bent anchors and cables on board and the ship sailed down to blackstakes in three days sir cloudesly shovell being then her captain  i do not vouch the thing but when i consider first that every thing lay ready in her storehouses and wanted nothing but to be brought out and carried on board a thousand or fifteen hundred men to be employed in it and more if they were wanted and every man knowing his business perfectly well boats carriages pullies tackles cranes and hulk all ready i do not know but it might be done in one day if it was tried certain it is the dexterity of the english sailors in those things is not to be matched by any in the world  the buildingyards docks timberyard dealyard mastyard gunyard ropewalks and all the other yards and places set apart for the works belonging to the navy are like a wellordered city and though you see the whole place as it were in the utmost hurry yet you see no confusion every man knows his own business the master builders appoint the working or converting as they call it of every piece of timber and give to the other headworkmen or foremen their moulds for the squaring and cutting out of every piece and placing it in its proper birth so they call it in the ship that is in building and every hand is busy in pursuing those directions and so in all the other works  rochester has a market on fridays and it has by grant from king henry i two annual fairs viz may the   th and nov the  0th the ground on that side of the town next the river is very low and marshy being overflowed by every high tide which renders the situation unpleasant and the air unwholesome from the vapors which arise from these salt marshes  it may not be amiss in this place to take notice that there is in the river medway at rochester and in several of its creeks and branches within the jurisdiction of the city an oysterfishery which is free to every one who has served seven years apprenticeship to any fisherman or dredger who is free of the said fishery and the mayor and citizens of rochester hold a court commonly called an admiraltycourt once a year or oftener when occasions have required it for the regulating of the said fishery and to prevent abuses committed in it in these courts they appoint from time to time when oysters shall and shall not be dredged and taken which they call opening and shutting the grounds after the quantity each dredgerman shall take in a day which is usually called setting the stint they have a power to go on board and enforce these orders and when they have found them not duly observed or that the brood or spat has been taken which should have been preserved they seize and throw into the river and creeks the brood or such oysters as have exceeded the prescribed quantity  persons who dredge or fish for oysters not being free of the fishery are called cablehangers and are presented and punished by the court every licensed dredger pays six shillings and eightpence yearly to the support of the courts but several licentious persons having in process of time contested the authority of this court and great inconveniences arising from it to the endangering the fishery and to the destruction of all good order and rule the corporation and free dredgermen applied to parliament and an act passed anno      establishing the jurisdiction of the city of rochester and enforcing the authority of the said courts and since that another act explaining and supplying defects so that at present this fishery is in a flourishing condition and all the fair dealers in this commodity find their account in it  it is about sixteen or eighteen miles from rochester bridge to sheerness fort by water on the river medway of this it is about fourteen miles to blackstakes the chanel is so deep all the way the banks so soft and the reaches of the river so short that in a word it is the safest and best harbor in the world and we saw two ships of eighty guns each riding afloat at low water within musket shot of rochester bridge the ships ride as in a millpond or a wetdock except that being moored at the chains they swing up and down with the tide but as there is room enough they are moored in such manner that they cannot swing foul of one another nor did i ever hear of any accident that befell any of the kings ships here by storms and weather except in that dreadful tempest in   0  when the royal catharine was driven on shore and receiving some damage sunk and the ship also being old could not be weighed again  there are two castles on the shore of this river the one at upnor where is a good platform of guns and which guards two reaches of the river and is supposed to defend all the ships which ride above between that and the bridge also on the other shore is gillingham castle formed for the same purpose and well furnished with guns which command the river besides which there is a fort or platform of guns at a place called the swamp and another at cockham wood but these are principally added since the time that the dutch made that memorable attempt upon the royal navy in this river on the   d of june in the year      for at that time all was left unguarded and there were but four guns that could be used at upnor and scarce so many at gillingham the carriages being rotten and broken and in a word every thing concurring to invite the enemy there were about twelve guns at the isle of shepey where now sheerness fort is built but the dutch soon dismounted most of them after which they went boldly up to blackstakes with their whole squadron and after that seven of their biggest men of war went up as high as upnor where they did what mischief they could and went away again carrying off the royal charles a firstrate ship of  00 guns and burning the london and several others besides damaging most of the ships that were within their reach and all things considered it was a wonder that they went away without ruining all the rest of the navy that was in that river  this alarm gave england such a sense of the consequence of the river medway and of the docks and yards at chatham and of the danger the royal navy lay exposed to there that all these doors which were open then are locked up and sufficiently barred since and it is not now in the power of any nation unless they were masters at land as well as sea to give us such another affront for besides all these castles lines of guns and platforms on each side the river medway as we go up there is now a royal fort built at the point of the isle of shepey called sheerness which guards that entrance into the river this is a regular fortification and has such a line of heavy cannon commanding the mouth of the river that no fleet of men of war could attempt to pass by as the dutch did without hazarding being torn to pieces i took a view while i was in these parts of cobhamhall six miles from chatham the seat of the earl of darnley a handsome brickhouse remarkable for the excellent marble chimneypieces in most of the rooms  at raynham church near rochester we saw several monuments of the family of the earl of thanet and the steeple is reckoned a seamark  sheerness is not only a fortress but a good town with several streets in it and inhabitants of several sorts but chiefly such whose business obliges them to reside here the officers of the ordnance have here an office they being often obliged to be at this place many days together especially in time of war when the rendezvous of the fleet is at the nore to see to the furnishing every ship with military stores as need requires and to cheque the officers of the ships in their demands of those stores and the like  here is also a yard for building ships with a dock intended chiefly for repairing ships that may meet with any sudden accident but then it is to observed that those are generally but for fifth and sixthrate ships small frigates yachts and such vessels though once when i was there i saw one upon the stocks of sixtyfour guns this yard is a late thing also and built many years since the fort  shepeyisle is supposed to be so called from its being one of the first places in england where sheep were kept or from its affording a great plenty of those useful animals this island is encompassed with the mixed waters of the thames and the medway on the west with the swalle on the south and with the main ocean on the north and east it has great plenty of good corn but wants wood it is about twentyone miles in compass  here are several tumuli in the marshy parts all over the island some of which the inhabitants call coterels these are supposed to have been cast up in memory of some of the danish leaders who were buried here for the danes have often made this island the scene of their ravages and plunder  there was anciently a bridge and causeway between this isle and hearty this was called thrembethebridge as afterward the ferry was called tremodferry the common way into this island from the main land of kent is by kingsferry where a long cable of about a hundred and forty fathom being fastened at each end across the water serves to get over the boat by hand  on the main side of the ferry is a small stonebuilding which will hold nine or ten persons this is said to have been erected by one george fox who staying once there a long while in the cold waiting for the ferryboat and being much affected with it he built this place to shelter others from the like inconvenience for the maintenance of this ferry and keeping up the highway leading to it through the marshes for above a mile in length the land occupiers tax themselves one penny per acre for fresh marshland and one penny for every ten acres of salt marshland per ann this tax together with some lands belonging to the ferry has from time to time kept the said ferry and causeway with a wall against the sea in good repair as also the boats cables and a house for the ferrykeeper who is obliged to tow all travelers over free except on four days yearly viz palmmonday whitmonday st jamessday and michaelmas when a horseman pays twopence and a footman one penny but on sundays or after eight oclock at night there is no passage gratis so that at such times the ferrykeeper will demand sixpence of every horseman and twopence of every footman and in these cases the land occupiers pay as well as strangers the keeper of this ferry is allowed    l per ann by the land occupiers beside what he makes in carrying over passengers in the nightime and on sundays and to this he has another perquisite added which is to dredge for oysters within the compass of his ferryloop which extends one tows length as they term it i e sixty fathoms on each side of the castle  in the upper grounds of this island is great plenty of good corn but equal scarcity of fresh water most of their springs being brackish though within a few years past a well was sunk so deep as to lie below the bed of the sea which has furnished the garrison at sheerness with fresh water but before this the people of the garrison had a yacht which was employed in bringing fresh water from deptford  a great number of marine plants grow in the salt marshes which occasions the curious in botany to visit this island frequently in the midst of summer when the plants are in their perfection  at the southwest point of the isle of shepey where the east swale parts from the west and passes on as above stands queenborough so called by king edward iii in honor of his queen philippa daughter to william earl of hainault and holland here was a castle erected by king edward as a defense of the mouth of the river medway in the building of this castle that prince was assisted by william of wickham who was then surveyor of the kings works and afterward made bishop of winchester this castle was afterward repaired in the year      by king henry viii who at the same time built others at deal walmer etc for the defense of the seacoasts the governors of queenborough castle were formerly honored with the title of constable and by the list of them it appears that many of them were men of great consideration  this castle was standing in the year      for mr johnston in his little book entitled iter plantarum investigationis ergo susceptum tells us that he saw there a noble large dining room or hall round the top of which were placed the arms of the nobility and gentry of kent and in the middle those of queen elizabeth with the following latin verses under in great letters lilia virgineum pectus regale leonis significant vivas virgo regasque leo umbra placet vultus vultus quia mentis imago mentis imago placet mens quia plena deo virgo deum vita regina imitata regendo viva mihi vivi fiat imago dei qui leo de juda est et flos de jesse leones protegat et flores elizabetha tuos a d      in english thus lilies the lions virgin breast explain then live a virgin and a lion reign pictures are pleasing for the mind they show and in the mind the deity we view may she who god in life and empire shows to me the eternal deity disclose may jesses flower and judahs lion deign thy flowers and lions to protect o queen a d       at present there are not any remains of this castle to be seen the ground where it stood is moated round and there is a well about  0 fathom deep still remaining by the several ordinances which were made by king edward iii relating to naval affairs it appears this place was then very famous but at present it is a miserable dirty fishingtown yet has a mayor aldermen etc and sends two burgesses to parliament although the chief traders of this town seem to be alehousekeepers and oystercatchers and their votes at an election for parliament men are the principal branch of their scandalous traffic a pernicious practice too much followed in better towns and which may one day be of fatal consequence to the liberties of britain  here we took boat and went up the east swale to milton or middleton as formerly called which lies as it were hid among the creeks for it is almost out of sight as well by water as by land and yet it is a large town has a considerable saturday market for corn fruit and other provisions and the oysters taken in the grounds about this town are the most famous of any in kent this town is governed by an officer who is called by the old saxon name portreve he is chosen annually on st jamess day and he supervises the weights and measures all over the hundred of milton it had anciently a royal palace for the kentish kings  from hence keeping the coast and the great road together for they are still within view of one another we come to sittingburn formerly a market town but still a considerable thoroughfare and full of good inns  just by the town are the ruins of a fortification raised by king alfred when in pursuit of the danes called bavordcastle they boast here much of one norwood having entertained king henry v on his triumphant return from france and though the entertainment was according to the times very elegant yet the whole expense of it amounted to no more than   s and   d  from sittingburn we came to feversham which is a large fair town having one long and broad street it has a very good markethouse where the market is kept on wednesdays and saturdays and there are two annual fairs in this town of ten days each viz on february the   th and on august the  st this town is well peopled and in a very flourishing state being in the neighborhood of one of the best parts of kent and having a very commodious creek to bring in or carry out their goods but many of the inhabitants have carried on the smuggling trade for years for which this creek lies very convenient brandy and often french wines are sold here at very low rates especially at such times as the smugglers have been apprehensive of discovery to prevent which they have been known to sell their wines to any persons who would venture to purchase them for   d per quart  the fishermen here have a very good custom they will admit no one to take out his freedom unless he be a married man the trade for oysters here with the dutch is so large as to bring in between   and  000 l per annum ready money from holland for this commodity only  at feversham are the remains of a monastery founded by king stephen where he was buried with his family at present nothing is left but two gatehouses of mean structure at the dissolution they say the coffin of lead which held the royal body was taken up and sold but the corpse was thrown into the thames and taken up by some fishermen here in the year  0  king ethelstan enacted laws  it was at the mouth of this swale namely at shellness so called from the abundance of oystershells always lying there that the smack in which the late king james ii embarked for his escape into france ran on shore and being boarded by the fishermen the king was taken prisoner and i must mention it to the reproach of the people of feversham whatever the conduct of that unfortunate prince had been that the fishermen and rabble treated him even after they were told who he was with the utmost indecency using his majesty with such personal indignity and giving him such opprobrious and abusive language and searching him in so rude a manner that the king himself said he was never more apprehensive of losing his life than at that time he was afterward carried by them up to the town where he was not much better treated for some time till some neighboring gentlemen of the county came in who understood their duty better by whom he was preserved from farther violence till coaches and a guard came from london by the prince of oranges order to conduct him with safety and freedom to london where he was much better received  while i was near this town some years before a terrible accident happened namely the blowing up of a powdermill which stood upon the river close to the town the blast shattered the whole town broke the windows blew down chimneys and gableends and several people were killed at the powderhouse itself though not any as i remember in the town but what was most remarkable in it all was that the eldest son of the master of the powdermill a youth of about fifteen years of age who was not in the mill or near it when it blew up but in a boat upon the river rowing cross for his diversion was killed by a piece of the materials of the mill which were blown up into the air and fell down upon him in the boat  after i have mentioned the tombs of king stephen and his queen in feversham i know nothing else this town is remarkable for except the most notorious smuggling trade which i have mentioned and which is carried on partly by the assistance of the dutch in their oysterboats nay even the owling trade or clandestine exporting of wool seems removed from romney marsh to this coast and a great deal of it has been carried on between the mouth of the eastswale and the north foreland  from this eastswale and particularly from these last three towns queenborough milton and feversham the fishmarket at billinsgate is supplied with several sorts of fish but particularly with the best and largest oysters such as some call stewing others milton oysters as they are from the essex side with a smaller and greater sort called wallfleet  i shall now cross the hills from milton to maidstone on the river medway near  0 miles distant from rochester to the southeast  maidstone is a very ancient town the river medway over which it has a bridge is navigable up to it by large hoys of  0 or  0 tons burden the tide flowing quite up to the town in      an act passed for making it further navigable of which i shall take proper notice when i come to speak of the timber in sussex  here is carried on a manufacture of linenthread and likewise in the neighborhood are great plantations of hops which were supposed to be first planted here at the beginning of the reformation which gave occasion to that old distich hops reformation bays and beer came into england all in a year   maidstone is eminent for plenty of provisions for richness of lands and for the best market in the county not excepting either rochester or canterbury it has also a handsome bridge which in the opinion of some is inferior only in length to that of rochester  from this town and the neighboring parts london is supplied with more particulars than from any single market town in england which i mention in pursuance of my first resolution of observing how every part of england furnishes something to the city of london   from the weald of kent which begins but about six miles off and particularly from that part which lies this way they being the large kentish bullocks   from hence are brought great quantities of the largest timber for supply of the kings yards at chatham and often to london most of which is at present brought by landcarriage to maidstone   from the country adjoining great quantities of corn are brought up to london also hops apples and cherries   a kind of paving stone about eight or ten inches square exceeding durable used to pave courtyards etc   fine white sand for the glasshouses esteemed the best in england for melting into flintglass and lookingglass plates and for the stationers use also vulgarly called writingsand   all that side of the county which i have mentioned as it is marshy and unhealthy by its situation among the waters is chiefly inhabited by shipbuilders fishermen seafaringmen and husbandmen and such as depend upon them and very few families of note are found among them but as soon as we come down boxleyhill from rochester or hollingbournhill from milton to the wellwatered plain on the banks of the medway we find the country everywhere bespangled with populous villages and delicious seats of the nobility and gentry and especially on the northside of the river beginning at aylesford on the medway the seat of the earl of that name and looking east toward the sea to eastwell near ashford the seat of the earl of winchelsea  among these are the ancient families of fane colepeper deerham honywood wotton roberts hales etc  this genteel neighborhood makes maidstone a very agreeable place to live in for here is what is not often found namely a town of very great business and trade and yet full of gentry and good company  there is not much manufacturing in this county what is left is chiefly at canterbury and in this town of maidstone and its neighborhood the manufacture of this town is principally linenthread as i have said which they make to pretty good perfection though not extraordinary fine at cranbrook tenterden goudhurst and other villages in the neighborhood of this place was once a considerable cloathingtrade carried on and the yeomen of kent of whom so much has been famed and who inhabited these parts were generally much enriched by it but that trade is now quite decayed and scarce ten clothiers left in all the county  the farmers and descendents of these clothiers upon the elections of members for the county show themselves still there for there are ordinarily    or   00 freeholders brought from this side of the county who for the plainness of their appearance are called the gray coats of kent but are so considerable that whoever they vote for is sure to carry it and therefore the gentlemen are very careful to preserve their interest among them  this town of maidstone is a peculiar of the archbishop of canterbury who is the proper incumbent and puts in a curate to officiate for him the archbishop has a palace here which is esteemed very ancient to which there is a chapel belonging the architecture is gothic but good of the kind and some parts of it have been repaired after the modern manner maidstone is a roman station named vagniacis or madviacis from the british word maedwaeg the meadows on the river vaga which are here beautiful the archiepiscopal palace was founded by john ufford and finished by simon islep the college or hospital was erected by archbishop boniface and a chantry by thomas anindel now the free school about the year    0 several canoes were dug up made of hollowed trees in the marshes of the river medway above maidstone one of which is used for a boat to this day in the hands of dr dodd at addington near malling in the year    0 a british coin of amber was found in the foundation of a stone wall the unequal side was plain on the concave was a british horse rude enough the assizes are generally held here and always the county elections and it is governed by a mayor and twelve jurats  charing not far off was the ancient durolenum situated upon a spring of the river len here the archbishops of canterbury had a castellated palace given them by some of the first saxon kings of which there are large ruins  in my way to maidstone on a former journey i saw mareworth castle a pretty fabric belonging to the earl of westmorland and on a rising ground within a mile of aylesford viewed an antiquity vulgarly called kettscottyhouse which are three great stones piled on each other and deemed the tombs of kentigern and horbus two danish princes slain in battle and there buried  in prosecuting my journey from maidstone to canterbury i cannot help mentioning lenham a town about    miles distant from that city in relation to which the rt rev continuator of camden records the following extraordinary circumstance  at lenham says he is a thing exceeding remarkable mentioned on the tomb of robert thompson esquire in the church there who was grandchild to that truly religious matron mary honeywood wife of robert honeywood of charing esquire she had at her decease lawfully descended from her     children    of her own body     grandchildren     in the third generation and   in the fourth her renown lives with her posterity her body lies in this church and her monument may be seen in markshall in essex where she died  from hence i pursued my journey to canterbury which all writers agree was called by the britons kent and is the duroverno of the romans of which town and its antiquities so much has been said and so accurately that i need do no more than mention it briefly however i observe here    that augustine the monk the first christian preacher that came from rome into this island settled in this place but that he was the first that preached christianity in the island as some have suggested is a mistake as the famous conference between him and the monks of banchor in wales sufficiently testify    that seven bishops of canterbury including that augustine lie buried here in one vault    that thomas a becket archbishop of this see insulted the king his sovereign in an unsufferable manner insomuch that in the reign of henry ii he was here murdered by the connivance as some say of the king and they show what they call his blood upon the pavement at this day    that they show the stonesteps ascending to his shrine he being afterward canonized worn away to a slope by the knees of the pilgrims who visited it    that the bodies of king henry iv and of edward the black prince are buried here and the magnificent effigies of the latter very curiously carved lies on his tomb or monument here is a pretty chapel originally designed for the celebration of masses for the soul of king henry iv    that the immense wealth offered by votaries and pilgrims for several ages to the shrine of becket was such that the famous erasmus who saw it says of it thus all shone sparkled glittered with rare and very large jewels and even in the whole church appeared a profuseness above that of kings in short gold was one of the meanest treasures of his shrine and at the dissolution as dugdale observes the plate and jewels filled two great chests each whereof required eight men to carry out of the church and camden says the name of christ to whom it was dedicated was almost laid aside for that of st thomas    that all this immense treasure with the lands and revenues of the whole monastery were seized upon by king henry viii at the general suppression of religious houses except such as are annexed to the deanery and chapter and to the revenue of the archbishopric which are not very considerable there is an old picture of beckets martyrdom and an ancient painting upon the wall of the siege of jerusalem in the habits of our ancestors    here are also to be seen the monuments of cardinal courticello cardinal pole archbishop chichley bp peckhams carved in wood upwards of   0 years ago bishop wharton the duke of clarence archbishop langton with many others of less account  the cathedral is a large and noble pile of building very curious remnants of painted glass are still to be seen in the windows it is entirely vaulted with stone and of a very pretty model but much too high for its breadth as all gothic buildings were the metropolitan chair is of gray marble standing behind the high altar the cloisters are pretty good and near them a very large chapel called the sermonhouse wainscotted with irish oak under it is a large protestant french church given first by queen elizabeth to the walloons who fled hither from the persecution of the duke dalva the number of these refugees has been since very much increased by french protestants obliged to leave their native country through the cruelty of louis xiv  the close where the houses of the prebendaries stand is very spacious and fair and a great many very good houses are built in it and some with good gardens  here are many remains of roman and saxon buildings the city is strongly walled about and many towers at due intervals a deep ditch close underneath and a great rampart of earth within the materials of the walls are chiefly flint  the castle was built in the reign of king william i of the same form and the walls of the same thickness with that of rochester dungeonhill a very high mount seems to have been part of the old castle opposite to it without the walls is an hill seeming to have been raised by the danes when they besieged the city the top of dungeonhill is equal to the top of the castle and exhibits a fine prospect over the city and country  of augustines monastery two gates remain next the city and both very stately perhaps one belonged to king ethelberts palace the other to the monastery which doubtless was very splendid for it covers a great compass of ground and is surrounded with a very high wall there were continual quarrels between the monks of augustine and of thomas a becket both very rich and very contentious  near this monastery is a vast angular piece of a tower besides half of another about  0 feet high which has been undermined by digging away a course at bottom in order to be thrown down but it happened only to disjoint itself from the foundation and lodged itself in the ground in the present inclining state thus being equally poised it presents a view of terror and forbids a too near access  the adjacent close is full of religious ruins and in a corner of it are the walls of a chapel said to have been a christian temple before augustines time and reconsecrated by him to st pancras near it is a little room said to have been king ethelberts pagan chapel the vulgar say here are the marks of the devils claws  eastward of this and farther out of the city is st martins church said to be augustines first see and the place whither king ethelberts queen used to repair to divine service it is built mostly of roman brick in the middle is a very large old fashioned font supposed to be that where the king was baptized  north of the city is a very small remainder of st gregorys chapel founded probably by augustine to the honor of that pope his patron  the city has been much advantaged by the settlement in it of two or three thousand french protestants men women and children owing to the abovementioned expulsion of the protestants under louis xiv  the employment of those refugees was chiefly broad silk weaving which has suffered several changes and alterations but is still carried on here to some account  but what has added most to the advantage of canterbury is the hopgrounds all round the place to the amount of several thousand acres insomuch that canterbury was for some time the greatest plantation of hops in the whole island but now they have a rival if not an overmatch about farnham as i shall observe in its place  in january      were found in a shave belonging to the estate of sir john hales who lives in this neighborhood and within his manor of tunstall near sittingbourn several hundreds of broad pieces of gold which were thought to be concealed in the time of the late civil wars by an ancestor of sir john they were found by a poor boy who was rambling in the coppice and not knowing what to make of them was playing with some of them at a farmers in the neighborhood of canterbury and the farmer got possession of them but not being able to keep the secret he refunded     of the broadpieces for the use of the crown though sir john laid claim to the whole  the shore from whitstable and the eastswale affords nothing remarkable but seamarks and small towns on the coast till we came to margate noted for king williams frequently landing here in his returns from holland and for shipping a vast quantity of corn for london market most if not all of it the product of the isle of thanet in which it stands there is lately erected here a salt water bath which has performed great cures in nervous and paralytick cases and in numbness of the limbs and seems every day to become more and more in request  but it may not be unacceptable to transcribe a few lines from camden in honor to the industry of the inhabitants in this part of the isle of thanet which i recommend to the admiration for i doubt it would be too much to say imitation of the rest of britain both north and south it is as follows  nor must i here omit the mention of a thing very much to the honor of the inhabitants of thanet those especially who live near the roads or harbors of margate ramsgate and brodstear namely that they are exceeding industrious and are as it were amphibious creatures and get their living both by sea and land they deal in both elements are both fishers and ploughmen both husbandmen and mariners and the selfsame hand that holds the plough steers the ship according to the several seasons they make nets fish for cod herring mackarel etc go to sea themselves and export their own commodities and those very men also dung their ground plough sow harrow reap inn being quick and active in both employments and so the course of their labors runs round and when there happen any shipwrecks as there do here now and then for those shallows and shelves so much dreaded by seamen lie over against it namely the godwin the brakes the fourfoot the whitdick etc they are extremely industrious to save the lading i shall only add that it is highly to the reputation of those people if they continue to deserve this excellent character but i have heard of some late instances that are not at all to their honor in this latter particular  at stanar in the isle of thanet the rutupiae of the romans is to be seen the sepulcher of vortimer king of the ancient britons who having vanquished the saxons in many battles and at last driven them out of the island ordered before his death that he should be buried here on a fond conceit that his corpse would fright them from landing any more upon this coast like the great scipio who having subdued the carthaginians ordered his tomb to be turned toward africa to fright them from the coast of italy but the poor britons soon found the difference between a king in the field and one in the grave  on the northeast point of this land is the promontory or headland which i have often mentioned called the northforeland which by a line drawn due north to the nase in essex about six miles short of harwich makes the mouth of the river of thames and the port of london as soon as any vessels pass this foreland from london they are properly said to be in the open sea if to the north they enter the german ocean if to the south the chanel as it is called that is the narrow seas between england and france and all the towns or harbors before we come this length whether on the kentish or essex shore are called members of the port of london  from this point westward the first town of note is ramsgate a small port the inhabitants are mighty fond of having us call it romansgate pretending that the romans under julius caesar made their first attempt to land here and that being driven back by a storm he soon returned and coming on shore with a good body of troops beat back the britons and fortified his camp just at the entrance of the creek where the town now stands while others as positively assert that that great commander first landed at deal as i shall observe anon  richboroughcastle is a mile distant from stanar and sandwich at the foot of it runs the river coming from canterbury this river at first discharged itself into the sea by ebbesflete north of the roman city rutupiae now stanar till the sand pouring so directly upon it obliged the stream to slide under the cliff by richboroughcastle and so by sandwich the castle is a most noble remnant of roman antiquity the walls on three sides are pretty entire and in some places still about    or  0 feet high without any ditch the side next the sea being upon a kind of cliff the top of the wall is but level with the ground here in the latter times of the empire the legio ii aug was quartered and from the condition of the walls it must have been destroyed with great violence probably by the saxons in the way to sandwich upon an eminence is the remainder of an amphitheatre made of turf probably for the exercise and diversion of the garrison before sandwich gates are two roman tumuli on one of which stands a windmill and south of sandwich on the seashore are six large and broad celtic tumuli at equal distances this flat coast is fenced against the ocean by the sanddowns from sandwich as far as hythe the coast of france was visible all the way as we rode the reverend mr lewis has published within these few years a curious history of the isle of thanet to which i shall refer for several particulars which deserve the attention of a traveller  sandwich one of the cinque ports lies in the bottom of a bay at the mouth of the river stour formerly a town of great repute and trade it decayed in the saxons time and was utterly ruined by the danes being raised again it had the misfortune to be reduced to ashes in king johns reign after which it was rebuilt but in the reign of q mary the mouth of its harbor was so choked up by a ship of great burden which sunk in it and gave opportunity to the sands and beach so to fill it up that it was incurable the town of consequence fell to decay and it is now a very poor place  sandwich is noted for carrots which are brought to london during the winter season and from hence it is that most of the markets are supplied with these roots which are esteemed the sweetest as they are also the largest which are produced in england or perhaps in europe  from this place also the seedsmen in london are furnished with the greatest quantity of their seeds the land being light sandy and fresh is very good for producing most sorts of seeds and the ground being pretty low the seeds do not so often receive a blight as in many other places  not far from hence is wingham which gives title of baron to earl cowper from hence i went to deal called by caesar dola having landed not far from this place it is the famous road for shipping so well known all over the trading world by the name of the downs and where almost all ships which arrive from foreign parts for london or go from london to foreign parts and pass the chanel generally stop the homewardbound to dispatch letters send their merchants and owners the good news of their arrival and set their passengers on shore and the outwardbound to take in fresh provisions to receive their last orders letters and farewels from owners and friends etc sometimes when the wind presents fair ships come in here and pass through at once without coming to an anchor for they are not obliged to stop but for their own convenience  the downs would be a very wild and dangerous road for ships were it not for the southforeland a head of land forming the east point of the kentish shore and is called the south as its situation respects the northforeland and which breaks the sea off which would otherwise come rolling up from the west to the flats or bank of sands which for three leagues together and at about a league or league and half distance run parallel with the shore and are dry at low water so that these two breaking all the force of the sea on the east south and southwest make the downs accounted a very good road  and yet on some particular winds and especially if they overblow the downs proves such a wild road that ships are driven from their anchors and often run on shore or are forced on the said sands or into sandwichbay or ramsgatepier in great distress this is particularly when the wind blows hard at southeast or at eastbynorth or eastnortheast and some other points and terrible havoc has been made in the downs at such times  but the most unhappy instance that can be given of any disaster in the downs was in the time of that terrible tempest which we call by way of distinction the great storm being on the   th of nov   0  unhappy in particular for that there chanced at that time to be a great part of the royal navy come into the downs in their way to chatham to be laid up  five of the biggest ships had the good fortune to push through the downs the day before finding the wind then blew very hard and were come to an anchor at the gunfleet and had they had but one fair day more they had been all safe at the nore or in the river medway at blackstakes  there remained in the downs about    sail when this terrible tempest began at which time england may be said to have received the greatest loss that ever happened to the royal navy at one time either by weather by enemies or by any accident whatsoever the short account of it is as follows  the northumberland a third rate carrying  0 guns and     men the restoration a second rate carrying    guns and     men the sterling castle a second rate carrying  0 guns and  00 men but had only     men on board and the mary a third rate of    guns having     men on board these were all lost with all their men except one man out of the mary and  0 men out of the sterlingcastle who were taken up by boats from deal  all this is besides the loss of merchants ships which was exceeding great not here only but in almost all the ports in the south and west of england and also in ireland  the town of deal carries on some foreign trade and is very much improved of late years to which the great resort of seamen to it from the ships in the downs has not a little contributed  i took a niew of sandowncastle deal and walmercastles  sandowncastle is composed of four lunets of very thick arched work of stone with many portholes for great guns in the middle is a great round tower with a cistern attop and underneath an arched cavern bombproof a fosse encompasses the whole to which is a passage over a drawbridge  dealcastle and walmercastle are like the former all built as i have said by k henry viii to guard this coast between walmercastle and deal was probably the spot where caesar landed in his first expedition because it is the first place where the shore can be ascended north of dover and exactly answers his assigned distance of eight miles in his second expedition with many more ships and upon a perfect knowledge of the country he might land at deal  dover stands in a most romantic situation it is a great valley and the only one about this coast where water is admitted inwards of the cliff which is here very high the sea formerly came a good way higher up and made a large port anchors have been found above the town the roman city dubris was to the south of the river the watling street enters it as bigingate coming very strait from canterbury over barhamdown where it is very perfect some of the walls are left the churches are of a very antique make that of st martin is collegiate founded by wightred king of kent and is a venerable ruin it was built in form of a cross of the priory now a farmhouse are large remains the hospital overagainst it is made a storehouse here the knights hospitalers or templers lodged as they came into or went out of the kingdom the piers which form the haven or large basin are costly and great works above is a fort with four bastions of modern date the broad beach which lies at the mouth of this great valley and was the harbor in caesars time is very delightful one long street here is named snaregate from the most tremendous rocks of chalk which project directly over the houses  dover castle is very large and situated upon a rock rugged and steep on every side but toward the sea it rises to an extraordinary height though of late years neglected it was once so well fortified and of such importance as to be accounted the key of england and william the conqueror when he had an eye upon the kingdom took an oath of harold that he should deliver into his hands this castle with the well which is sixty fathoms deep and said to be the work of julius caesar in short it was the strongest old fortification in the world and takes up thirty acres of ground  in the late war with france   00 prisoners were confined in the great castle the brass gun called queen elizabeth s pocketpistol is a great curiosity twentytwo feet long it is excellently well wrought requires fifteen pounds of powder and carries a ball seven miles here are two very old keys and a brass horn which seem to be the ensigns of authority belonging to the constable of the castle or lord warden of the cinque ports one part of the fortifications consists of a circular work in which stands an old church said to have been built by lucius the first christian king in britain out of some of the roman ruins for there are huge quantities of roman brick laid into the work and the remainder is of stone originally cut by the romans it is in form of a cross and has a square tower in the middle the stone windows are of much later date than the building but the greatest curiosity is the pharos or roman watchtower standing at the west end of the church this building was made use of as a steeple and had a pleasant ring of bells which sir george rooke procured to be carried away to portsmouth since when the lead which covered it has been taken away by order of the officers of ordnance so that this rare piece of architecture is left exposed to the sea and weather here was found a coin of dioclesian the erpinghams arms are patched up against one side of the pharos so that it seems to have been repaired in the days of king henry v when the lord erpingham was warden of dovercastle  upon another rock over against that on which the castle is situated and almost as high are the remains of an old watchtower now vulgarly called bredenstone otherwise devilsdrop from the strength of the mortar here the new constable of the castle is sworn under this place king henry viii built the mole or pile called the pier that ships might ride therein with great safety but though it was done with vast labor and expense by large beams fastened in the sea bound together with iron and great piles of wood and stone heaped upon all yet the fury of the sea was soon too hard for the work and the timbers beginning to disjoint queen elizabeth expended great sums upon it and several acts have passed to repair and restore the same which also including the restoration and preservation of the harbor of rye i shall take notice of both when i mention that of rye  dover the portus dubris of the romans is one of the cinque ports and was formerly bound to send twentyone ships for the wars it affords a see to the suffragan of the archbishop of canterbury as often as any such is appointed most of the business relating to these ports in general is done and all the courts kept here the other cinque ports are hastings hythe romney and sandwich hastings has two appendages namely winchelsea and rye which as well as hastings are in sussex and the others in kent they have all great privileges their burgesses are called barons who on the coronations of our sovereigns support the canopies over their heads have a table at the kings right hand the canopy for their fee and enjoy other privileges the lord warden of these five ports is generally one of the first noblemen in the kingdom  the packets for france go off here as also those for ostend with the mails for flanders and all those ships which carry freights from new york to holland and from virginia to holland come generally hither and unlade their goods enter them with the customhouse officers pay the duties and then enter them again by certificate reload them and draw back the duty by debenture and so they go away for holland  as we pass from dover to the smaller cinque ports of hythe romney and rye we see folkstone a little village now which the sea has made great inroads upon but which formerly made a greater figure a copious spring went through the town two pieces of old wall seemingly roman hang frightfully over the cliff here are some old guns one of iron of a very odd cast doubtless as old as the time of king henry viii many roman coins have also been found and here a nunnery was built by eanswide daughter of eadbald king of kent this place is now principally of note for a multitude of fishingboats belonging to it which are one part of the year employed in catching mackarel for the city of london the folkstone men catch them and the london and barking mackarelsmacks of which i have spoken at large in essex come down and buy them and whisk away to market under such a crowd of sails that one would wonder they could bear them about michaelmas these folkstone barks among others from shoreham brighthelmston and rye go away to yarmouth and leostoff on the coast of suffolk and norfolk and catch herrings for the merchants there it has been observed of some hills in the neighborhood of folkstone as the right rev continuator of camden takes notice that they have visibly sunk and grown lower within the memory of man  sandgate castle situated in the bottom of two hills on the seashore has about sixteen guns to defend the fishingcraft from the insults of privateers in time of war it has several good houses about it and was built by king henry viii  after we have passed this castle we enter upon the beach here are many springs which descending from the higher ground sink immediately into this beach rendering it a little boggy  hythe one of the cinque ports stands on the edge of the less ridge but the marsh has intercepted it from the sea  hythe in saxon signifies a port or station but at present it hardly answers the name for the sands have so choked it up that the sea is shut out from it to a great distance this town as also westhythe from which the sea retired above  00 years ago owe their original to lemanis or limne a roman port of which more anon now a little village adjoining which was formerly a very famous port before it was shut up with sands thrown in by the sea which gave rise to the two hythes beforementioned which in their turns have met with the same fate a particular providence happened at hythe april         about eleven oclock the steeple of their church in which were six bells fell down about ten persons were present when it fell waiting in the church porch for the keys to go up into the steeple for a view but some delay being made in bringing them they happily received no other damage than being terribly frightened in a vault under the church we saw a vast heap of human bones some of an extraordinary size said to be gathered up after a bloody battle fought between the britons and danes  about a mile distant from it is saltwoodcastle a very strong seat of the archbishop of canterbury the outer wall has towers and battlements and a deep ditch within and on one side stands the main body of the palace there are two great and high towers at the gate of this over which are the arms of archbishop courtney the founder this inner work has a stronger and higher wall with a broad embattled parapet at top within is a court but the lodgings are all demolished the floor of the ruinous chapel is strongly vaulted in the middle of the court is a large square well seemingly roman they say that anchors have been dug up hereabouts which makes it likely that the romans had here an iron forge and some will have it that the sea came up formerly to it and ground this opinion on these anchors found here  a little way further at the end of the stanestreet the roman road from canterbury is the port of lemanis or limne mentioned above at limne church from the brow of the hill may be discerned the ruinous roman walls situate almost at the bottom of the marshes a pretty brook which rises from the rock west of the church runs for some space on the east side of the wall then passes through it and so along its lowermost edge by the farmhouse at bottom here coins have been found once the seabank broke and admitted the ocean into all the adjacent marshes the port is now called shipway where the lord warden of the cinque ports was formerly sworn the courts kept and all the pleas relating thereto till dover superseded it the people of limne had a horn and mace the remaining ensigns of their authority  romney is a large fine village and likewise a cinque port it is the chief town of the marshgrounds which were anciently part of the sea called romney marsh and has old romney and lech for its members it is seated on a high hill of gravel and sand and on the west side of it had a pretty large harbor guarded against most of the winds before the sea retired from it in the year      when the town was at its height it was divided into twelve wards had five parish churches a priory and an hospital for the sick but it has been dwindling till it came to its present low condition ever since the reign of edward i when an inundation of the sea destroyed men cattle and houses threw down a whole populous village called promhill and removed the rother in british yz odz which used to empty itself into the sea at romney out of its chanel stopping up its mouth and opening it a nearer passage into the sea by rye leaving here only a little bay for fishingboats  from romneymarsh the shore extends itself a great way into the sea and makes that point of land called dengyness just by the river rother stands the little town of appledore which by disuse has lost its market and is of no note now the sea formerly came up to it  tenterden a mayor market town lies a little to the n w of appledore near the weald it has a very good and high steeple which they say was the cause of the godwinsands which was an estate that belonged to earl godwin and was guarded from the sea by a wall but they were so intent on building the steeple that the wall was neglected and the land overflowed which they could never afterward recover  ashford also a mayortown stands on the great road upon the river stour it is a pretty well built market town the church is large and was formerly collegiate they hold pleas for any thing not exceeding twenty marks  newenden deserves to be mentioned for what it once was having been formerly a fine city which camden calls anderida it was destroyed by the saxons but rebuilt in the reign of edward i and called newenden as much as to say according to camdens etymology a new city in a little valley it had then an harbor much frequented but it is now a most miserable village with a few poor houses in it the best an alehouse and the church is illbuilt and out of repair it has a very indifferent bridge over the rother a rapid river which divides at this place kent from sussex and about nine miles off empties itself into the harbor of rye roman coins have been dug up here  northwest of newenden is cranbrook a large market town noted for having been one of the first places where the clothmanufacture was set up in england which is now very much in its wane here but here i will conclude my third letter and am sir  yours etc  letter iv containing a description of the county of sussex other parts of kent and part of hants surrey etc sir i now enter the county of sussex and shall begin my letter with the account of rye  it is situated in the most eastern part of sussex upon an hill which is encompassed with rocks that are inaccessible on the seaside there is nothing now but some remains of its old walls to be seen and the ditches are almost filled up its trade is in hops wool timber kettles cannon chimneybacks etc which are cast at the ironworks at bakely about four miles from rye on the northwest and breed about five miles distant southwest it is a very great misfortune that its harbor has been so much damaged by the sea and neglected for it is almost filled up in several places where it was formerly the deepest and most convenient some considerable families who have lands near have taken advantage of this to extend them further upon those sands which the sea in storms has thrown up against them and by digging ditches and making drains there are now fields and meadows where anciently was nothing but water by this means ships only of a middle size can come within any convenient distance of the town whereas formerly the largest vessels and even whole fleets together could anchor just by the rocks on which the town stands and as this port lies over against dieppe in france and that there is no other port between portsmouth and dover which can receive ships of burden not only the danger of the sea but in time of war of the enemy were escaped by the convenience of this harbor but it being by the means i have mentioned and by the inning of the chanel and waste lands which prevented the flux and reflux of the tide in danger of being utterly lost an act of parliament passed in      which enacts that no new walls banks dams or stops shall thereafter be erected on either side of the water that might stop or alter the flux or reflux of the sea between the mouth of the harbor bounded by the camber and castlepoints and new shutt near craven sluice  in      another act passed for completing the repairs of the harbor of dover and for restoreing the harbor of rye to its ancient goodness which still continued to be choked up and almost ruined by the shifting of the beach without and settling of the sullage within and stopping the flux of the tide which this act proposed should have its free course through the scotchflat and craven sluices or into such other cut or chanel as should be found most proper and expedient  and in      another act passed for making the last act more effectual so far as it related to the harbor of rye in which a power was given to change the design of making a passage by the abovenamed sluices and to open a new cut from the winchelsea chanel right out to the sea and they actually began in pursuance of this act to cut a broad and deep canal which was to be carried to the sea on the side of winchelsea for the use of the two boroughs but still these provisions being found insufficient another act passed in       for continuing the term and powers granted by the former acts for repairing the harbor of dover and for restoring that of rye to its ancient goodness to which i must refer the reader  the houses of rye are wellenough built and of brick though generally oldfashioned but there are some very neat ones of a modern taste there is a small settlement of french refugees in this town mostly fishermen they have a minister of their own who is paid by the archbishop of canterbury the church is handsome and large but there are so many dissenters in the town and so few of the established church that they have walled off and converted the western part of it into a magazine for planks but there are two well built meeting houses one for the presbyterians and the other for the quakers another church which belonged to a monastery now demolished is also turned into a kind of storehouse for planks hops and other merchandise at the northeast of rye are the remains of an old fort which commands the town and harbor and serves for the towngaol  his late majesty king george i on his return from hanover january         was obliged to put in here after a very dangerous and tempestuous passage the fleet being unable to make dover and it was then experienced what a benefit it would have been to have had this only considerable haven as it formerly was between portsmouth and dover restored to its pristine flourishing state for his majesty was under great difficulties to land there and the larger ships were unable to follow him  this town was as i have said one of the appendages as winchelsea was the other to hastings as a cinqueport and enjoyed the same privileges  old winchelsea stood upon the seashore about two or three miles from the place where the new stands it had formerly a large and spacious harbor was a place of great trade and had no less than eighteen churches in it but it was entirely destroyed by the sea and that small part which is not buried in the sands is now marsh and meadowland to the s e of rye and the n w of new winchelsea is still to be seen in the midst of a large plain an old tower which probably stood by the sea  new winchelsea is said to have been built by king edward i partly on a hill about two miles from the old and the like distance from rye and partly in a little valley where it had an harbor but anno    0 the latter part of this met with the same fate as the former it never was comparable to the old town having but three parish churches when it flourished and now there only remains the chancel of one which is more than large enough for the inhabitants but yet the town was everywhere accommodated with fine stone arched vaults for stowing of merchandise and was laid out with admirable regularity the streets being divided into    quarters some of the stonework of the three gates are still to be seen the sea is now above a mile distant from it the harbor being choked up with sands and grass grows not only where the harbor was but even in the streets and indeed there are only a few houses remaining in the upper part of the town among the ruins of the walls to the s e are the remains of a castle as some say or of a monastery as others will have it  hastings is the chief of the five cinque ports and with its two members above was obliged to furnish the king with twenty ships for any naval expedition in recompense for the ample immuninities it enjoyed as one of the five ports it is about eight miles from winchelsea it consists of two great streets with a parish church in each and has several good houses but its harbor formerly so famous is now a poor road for small vessels having been ruined by the storms that from time to time have been so fatal to its neighboring ports of rye and winchelsea we saw here the ruins of an ancient castle and about three miles off bullhide haven where william the conqueror is said to have landed in his invasion of england though some say it was at hastings and others at pevensey an harbor more westward which has likewise been destroyed by the sea but be that as it will it was at hastings that he mustered his army after he had burnt his ships being determined to conquer or perish in the attempt or rather as another author has observed that he might not be obliged to divide his army which must have been the case if he had preserved his ships and probably while he made an advance into the country at the head of part of his army harold might have stepped in between and cut off those who were left to guard the ships and then with more ease have attacked and perhaps beat that part commanded by the norman himself  the decisive battle which he fought anno  0   with king harold was upon a plain called heathfield about seven miles from hastings for an account of which i shall refer to the historians in the place where harolds body was found the norman instituted an abbey of benedictine monks dedicating it to st martin and from the fight aforesaid it is called battleabbey and soon drew to it by a fair held every sunday and holiday such a resort that it became a handsome town it still retains the name of battle and some remains of the abbey are yet to be seen and make part of the house of the lord viscount montacute a roman catholic peer of which more in another place  a little beyond hastings to bourn we ride upon the sands in a strait line for eighteen miles all upon the coast of sussex passing by pemsey or pevensey haven aforementioned and the mouth of the river which comes from battle without so much as knowing that there was a river the tide being out and all the water sinking away in the sands this town of battle is remarkable for little now but making the finest gunpowder and the best perhaps in europe near battle they show us a hill with a beacon upon it now called beaconhill but was formerly called standardhill where the norman set up his great standard of defiance the day before the decisive battle with harold and the english  from the beginning of romneymarsh that is to say at sandgate or sandfoot castle near hythe to this place the country is a rich fertile soil full of feeding grounds and an incredible number of large sheep are fed every year upon them and sent up to london market these romneymarsh sheep are counted rather larger than the leicestershire and lincolnshire sheep of which so much is said elsewhere  besides the vast flocks of sheep as above abundance of large bullocks are fed in this part of the country and especially those they call stalld or housefed oxen from their being kept within the farmers sheds or yards all the latter season where they are fed for the wintermarket and generally deemed the largest beef in england  in romneymarsh as in other parts of england are found great timber trees lying at length under ground as black as ebony and fit for use when dried in the sun  from hence it was that turning north and traversing the deep dirty but rich part of these two counties my curiosity led me to see the great founderies or ironworks which are in this county and where they are carried on at such a prodigious expense of wood that even in a country almost all overrun with timber they begin to complain of the great consumption of it by those furnaces and the apprehension of leaving the next age to want timber for building their navies i must own however that i conceived that complaint was entirely groundless the three counties of kent sussex and hampshire all which lie contiguous one to another being an inexhaustible storehouse of timber for this purpose  after i had been fatigued in passing this deep and heavy part of the country i thought it would not be foreign to my design if i refreshed myself with a view of tunbridgewells which were not then above    miles out of my way  when i came to the wells which were five miles nearer to me than the town supposing me then at battle to the southward of them i found a great deal of good company there and particularly made an observation that those people who have nothing to do anywhere else seem to be the busiest people at tunbridge  after the appearance is over at the wells where the ladies are all in deshabile and at the chapel the company go home and as if it was another species of people or a collection from another place you are surprised to see the walks covered with ladies completely dressed and gay to profusion where rich clothes jewels and beauty dazzle the eyes from one end of the range to the other  as for gaming sharping intriguing as also fops beaux and the like tunbridge used to be as full of these as most other public places but the act lately passed against gaming has in a great measure cured this evil of this act i shall say more when i come to bath  the air here is excellent and the provisions of all sorts very reasonable particularly they are supplied with excellent fish of almost all sorts from rye and other towns on the seacoast and i saw a turbut of near twenty pounds weight sold there for three shillings in the season of mackarel they have them here from hastings within three hours of their being taken out of the sea and the difference which that makes in their goodness i need not mention  they have likewise here abundance of wildfowl of the best sorts such as pheasants partridges woodcocks snipes quails etc particularly they have from the southdowns the bird called a wheatear or which i think i may call the english ortolan  the most delicious taste for one mouthful for it is hardly more that can be imagined but these are very dear at tunbridge they are much cheaper at seaford jews and that side of the country  tunbridge is situated upon the little river tunn which runs into the medway hard by on the southern bank of the river are to be seen the ruins of an old castle built by a natural son of richard i duke of normandy who as mr camden tells us exchanged his lordship of bryany in that duchy for tunbridge the church is a modern building the houses in the town are mostly illbuilt and the streets sorrily paved  the wells are about four miles from the town and the rocks about ten miles from them and worth a travellers curiosity to see as they are several prodigious heaps of firm stone rocks though some miles distant from the sea  the buildings at the wells have much the advantage of those in tunbridge and may be said to constitute a large and populous town themselves there is a church or rather chapel of ease which is very neat this new town as i may call it stands in a bottom between two hills one of which is called mount sion and the other mount ephraim which are generally covered with good houses fine gardens and fruit trees the wells might be more properly called spelhurst wells for the water rises in a parish of that name the well which contains them is wellpaved like a cistern and surrounded with a low wall with a pair of stairs to go down the company walk upon the two abovenamed hills after they have drank the waters and divert themselves with bowls dancing or other exercises as the weather will permit and the physicians prescribe near the well is a long gallery paved and covered over wherein to walk in bad weather and while they are taking the waters and where likewise the band of music have place there are also rooms to drink chocolate or coffee and to play at cards etc likewise a hall to dance in not far off the well is a market well stored with provisions of all sorts  a very eminent physician is of opinion that the waters of bath tunbridge chiltenham or scarborough which partake of the same qualities and bristol make the general kinds of most of the various mineral waters on the globe and that he therefore who understands these cannot be much at a loss to determine the virtues and efficacy of any new kind and as this learned gentleman has favored me with his opinion of these several waters i shall communicate the same in their respective places  and first this is what he says of the nature efficacy and qualities of these of tunbridge   tunbridge waters says he are nothing but an impregnation of rain or compressed cloudwaters in some of the eminencies of the neighboring country and indeed all hills and conspicuous elevations are mere hollow nests of some minerals iron and sulphur are the most common and universal minerals and almost all kinds of stone fit for making fences or edifices have in their composition one or both of them all the varieties of hard black dark or greyish stones abound with ferrugineous particles and iron is so necessary especially in countries between the tropicks and the poles for husbandry that there is scarce a mile square within this compass where it may not be found with its impregnated waters this is demonstrable by the action of the loadstone on most minerals the magnet itself seeming to be scarce any thing but a purer clod of iron and pure polished iron we know with very simple management becomes highly magnetic hence we account for the frequency of chalybeat mineral waters of some degree of strength or other so readily to be found between the poles and tropicks and this is a bountiful provision of nature to those colder climates where animal food and fermented liquors are so necessary for the support comfort and greater proportion of animal force required in them for their defense from the swarming of ravenous animals and for hunting animal food where the vegetable is neither so proper nutritive nor abounding as in these kindlier climates between the tropicks toward each side of the equator mineral chalybeat waters brace the solids which animal food and fermented liquors in any plenty are apt to relax and wind up the springs of animal motion to keep the blood fluid which the just mentioned indulgencies are disposed to thicken soft stone marl alkalious clay and all kinds of bituminous earths have a larger quantity of sulphur in them for sulphur oil and bitumen always leave earth brittle spongy and alkalious alkalies being only an harder earthy sponge and when the watery impregnations meet they naturally produce by fermentation some degree of heat in the mixture there is in nature as this learned gentleman thinks but one kind of salt which is nitre and that the variety arises from a mixture of sulphur earth or iron in different proportions combined in their composition nitre however and seasalt have their principal efficacy from the predominant principle in their texture and thus tunbridge waters are only a finer solution of blue vitriol or natural salt of steel or rainwaters inimitable by art in such salutary effects as nature always produces for example though art may imitate in precious stones all the varieties of colors reflections refractions and emissions of light yet there is always some one peculiar property as of hardness weight or water which discovers the sophistication in like manner all the wines on the globe may be so imitated that neither eye nor palate nor the perception of their effects on animal bodies can discover the fiction and this without one drop of the juice of the grape from the saccharine quality only of almost all fruits seeds or herbs yet by analyzing them in some proper menstruum the cheat may be found out thus we may imitate all the several mineral waters on the earth and pretty nearly conciliate all their general or grosser salutary virtues on diseased animals yet there is an unaccountable something in the taste lightness on the stomach cheerfulness and alacrity they give which all our skill can never bestow the principle of individuation the size of their last and least particles the proportion of the several parts of the composition to the watery menstruum and the due time of their impregnation are and ever will be unknown to us as will consequently the degree required to wind up strengthen and contract the relaxed solids of diseased human bodies to such a height that they may be enabled to grind dissolve and thin the concreted juices as these active strong and invigorating waters of tunbridge usually do for in all robust constitutions but partially depraved in the cold chronical distempers of such habits in nervous disorders and low spirits in weak digestions and gross habits they are extremely successful especially in the hotter seasons of the year thus far this learned gentleman  during the time i was at tunbridge formerly i made an excursion to knowlhouse about seven miles from tunbridge and one from sevenoak belonging to the duke of dorset it is situated in the middle of a park and at that time was an ancient stone fabric but had nothing more remarkable in it than some excellent pictures  i left tunbridge and came to jews through the deepest dirtiest but in many respects the richest and most profitable country in all that part of england  the timber i saw here was prodigious as well for size as plenty and seemed in some places suffered to grow only because it was so far off of any navigation that it was not worth carrying away in dry summers indeed a great deal is carried away to maidstone and other places on the medway and sometimes i have seen one tree on a carriage which they call there a tug drawn by    oxen and even then it is carried so little a way being thrown down and left for other tugs to take up and carry on that sometimes it is two or three years before it gets to chatham for if once the rains begin it stirs no more that year and sometimes a whole summer is not dry enough to make the roads passable  and here i shall observe according to my promise p     that in the year      0 an act passed entitled an act to revive explain and amend an act made in the    th and    th years of the reign of his late majesty k charles ii entitled an act for making the river of medway navigable in the counties of kent and sussex and which when completed must be of very great use to the public as well as to the counties of kent and sussex in particular  the preamble to this act will set this matter in a proper light and it is to this effect that the abovementioned act of parliament of the   th and   th of charles ii was never yet carried into execution although the making the said river navigable was likely to be of great utility to the public by reason of great quantities of timber growing on the wealds of kent and sussex which is allowed to be the best in the kingdom for the use of the royal navy and which now through the badness of the roads in those parts cannot be conveyed to any market but at a large expense  that therefore the present undertakers being desirous to begin carry on and complete the navigation of such part of the ancient river medway and streams falling into it as run from forestrow in sussex to maidstone in kent this act incorporates them for that purpose by the name of the company of proprietors of the navigation of the river medway  we must refer to the act itself for farther particulars and shall only observe that when this work is completed it will be of inconceivable advantage to the public not only for the excellent timber which it will be a means of conveying to proper markets but for the easy and speedy carriage of iron ordnance balls and other materials of war forged in or near the said river which at some times of the year cannot be brought through the wealds of the two counties and for the carriage of wood corn grain hay hops wool leather and all manner of provisions as also of coals lime stone wares and all other necessaries and commodities to the great improvement of trade and commerce  a few miles northwest of tunbridge lies sevenoak so called from seven large oaks that grew near the place it is a market town governed by a warden and assistants but is noted for nothing more than being a great thoroughfare town it has a good hospital for maintaining and teaching poor children erected by sir william sevenoak lord mayor of london who was a foundling and took his name from the town  jews is a pleasant town large well built agreeably situated in the middle of an open champain country and on the edge of the southdowns the most delightful of their kind in the nation it lies on the bank of a little wholesome fresh river within    miles of the sea and was formerly encompassed with a wall but there are few remains of it now to be seen but what contributes to the advantage of this town is that both it and the country adjacent are full of gentlemen of good families and fortunes of which the pelhams must be named with the first whose chief is his grace the duke of newcastle here are also the ancient families of gage shelly etc formerly roman catholics but now protestants with many others jews has five churches in it near it is an old demolished castle in the neighborhood of which was fought that bloody battle between king henry iii and his barons the event of which constrained the king to accept of hard conditions of peace and to give his son as an hostage for performance  i ought not to forget that newhaven in this neighborhood was formerly noted for its safe and good harbor for ships of considerable burden but for want of a provision for maintaining the timber piers which it had for time immemorial it was quite neglected and the harbor choked up with sand and beach and the piers were rotten and decayed to remedy these evils an act passed anno      for repairing and keeping in repair the said piers and harbor and when brought to effect not only jews but the adjacent parts as well as the whole kingdom will be the better for it  from jews following still the range of the southdowns west we ride in view of the sea and on a fine carpet ground for about    miles to brighthelmston a poor fishingtown oldbuilt and on the very shore of the sea hence again as i mentioned at folkstone and dover the fishermen having large barks go away to yarmouth on the coast of norfolk to the fishing fair there and hire themselves out for the season to catch herrings for the merchants and they tell us that these make a very good business of it  the sea is very unkind to brighthelmston having by its continual encroachments so gained upon the town that in a little time more the inhabitants may reasonably expect it will eat away the whole place above  00 houses having been devoured by the water in a few years past  from hence still keeping the coast on the left we come to shoreham a seafaring town chiefly inhabited by shipcarpenters shipchandlers and all the several trades depending upon the building and fitting up of ships which is their chief business they are indeed justly noted for good sailors and for building neat and stout seaboats which yet in strength and duration do not come up to those of yarmouth ipswich and the north  the builders of ships seem to have settled here chiefly because of the exceeding quantity and cheapness of timber in the country behind them being the same wooded country i mentioned above which still continues through this county and the next the river this town stands upon though not navigable for large vessels yet serves to bring down this large timber in floats from bramber steyning and the country adjacent which is in a manner all covered over with timber  here in the compass of about six miles are three borough towns sending members to parliament viz shoreham bramber and steyning shoreham and steyning are pretty little market towns but bramber after i have mentioned the ruins of an old castle hardly deserves the name of a town having not above  0 families in it and of them but few above asking alms as you ride by the chief house in the town when i was there was a publickhouse the landlord whereof boasted that upon an election just then over he had made  00 l of one pipe of canary  this is not the only town in this county where the elections have been scandalously mercenary insomuch that it has been said there was in one kings reign more money spent at elections than all the lands in the parishes were worth at  0 years purchase i shall name in particular but one more and that is winchelsea which is rather the skeleton of an ancient city than a real town where the old gates stand near three miles from one another over the fields and the very ruins are so buried that they have made good corn fields of the streets and the plough goes over the foundations nay over the first floors of the houses and where nothing of a town seems to remain yet at one election for members the struggle was such between sir john banks and colonel draper a neighboring gentleman that i was assured the latter spent   000 l and lost it too what the other spent who opposed him may be guessed at seeing he who spent most was always sure to carry it  near steyning the famous baronet of the name of fagg has an ancient seat and thence passing by the seat of sir john shelly prettily situated in the middle of a grove we come to arundel a decayed town also it stands near the mouth of the river arun which heretofore had a good harbor called arundel port or the harbor of little hampton capable of receiving ships and vessels of a considerable burden but a beach being thrown up by the sea it was quite choked up and the navigation of the arun obstructed so that the harbor was rendered in a manner useless but in the year      an act passed for erecting piers in and for repairing and keeping in repair the harbor there by cutting a chanel through the beach and old piers and erecting locks etc  one great advantage to the country from this river is the shipping off great quantities of large timber here which is carried up the thames to woolwich and deptford and up the medway to chatham as also westward to portsmouth and even to plymouth to the new dock there and indeed to all the kings yards where the business of the navy is carried on the timber shipped off here is esteemed the best and largest that is brought by sea from any part of england also great quantities of knee timber are had here the largest of which is valuable in its kind above the strait timber  this river and the old decayed once famous castle at arundel which has the privilege to give to its possessor the title of an earl and peer of the realm without creation and which belongs to the noble family of howard earls of arundel and dukes of norfolk is all that is remarkable here except it be that in the church are four old and stately monuments of the earls of arundel and that in this river are caught the best and largest mullets in england a fish very good in itself and much valued by the gentry round and often sent up to london  from hence to the city of chichester are    of the most pleasant and beautiful miles in england whether we go by the hill or downs or by the plain or enclosed country  to the north of arundel and at the bottom of the hills and consequently in the weald is the town of petworth a large handsome country market town and very populous and as it stands upon an ascent and is dry and healthy it is full of gentlemens families and good well built houses both in the town and neighborhood but the beauty of petworth is the ancient seat of the old family of piercy earls of northumberland now extinct whose daughter the sole heiress of all his vast estates married charles seymour duke of somerset and among other noble seats brought his grace this of petworth  the duke pulled down the ancient house and on the same spot built from the ground one of the bestmodelld houses then in britain it had the misfortune to be once almost demolished by fire but the damage has been fully repaired  the apartments are very noble well contrived and richly furnished but it cannot be said that the situation of the house is chosen so happily as to boast of equal judgment with the rest the avenues to the front want space the house stands as it were with its elbow to the town its front has no vista answerable and the west front looked not to the parks or fine gardens but to the old stables  to rectify this when it was too late to order it any other way the duke was obliged to pull down those noble buildings i mean the meuse or stables the finest of their kind in all the south of england and equal to some noblemens whole houses and yet even the demolishing the pile has done no more than opened a prospect over the country whereas had the house been set on the rising ground on the side of the park over against the north wing of the house and a little more to the westward the front had been south to the town the back front to the parks but now all these advantages lie on one angle or opposite to one wing of the house nevertheless it is a noble pile of building and by far the finest in all this part of britain  from petworth west the country is a little less woody than the weald and a great many fine seats begin to show their heads above the trees as the duke of richmonds seat at godwood near chichester the seats of the late earl of tankerville and the earl of scarborough and a great many others  but the seat of the right honorable the lord visc montacute called cowdrey near midhurst the midae of the romans deserves a particular mention it is situated in a valley encompassed with lawns hills and woods thrown into a park the river running underneath which renders the place very agreeable in summer but makes it dampish in winter the house is square and at each corner is a gothic tower which have a very good effect when viewed from the rising grounds the hall is ceiled with irish oak after the ancient manner the walls are painted with architecture by roberti the statues by goupe the staircase by pelegrini the large parlour or room at the end of the hall is of holbeins painting where that great artist has described the exploits of king henry viii before boloigne calais his landing at portsmouth his magnificent entry into london etc in the other rooms are many excellent pictures of the ancestors of the family and other history paintings of holbein relating to their actions in war the whole circuit of rooms are stately and wellfurnished adorned with many pictures there is a long gallery with the twelve apostles as big as the life another very neat one wainscotted with norway oak where are many ancient wholelength pictures of the family in their proper habits there are four historypieces two copies of raphaels marriage of cupid and psyche several old religious and military paintings from battleabbey  the park is very noble having a great variety of grounds in it and is well wooded with pines firs and other evergreentrees which are grown to a large size and here are some of the largest chesnuttrees perhaps in england the valleys which run through the park are well supplied with water which keeps the grass in a constant verdure  chichester is a neat and pretty large city walled round the river lavant runs under part of the walls two principal streets cross it at right angles upon the cardinal points where stands a curious cross and markethouse upon pillars erected by bishop read the church takes up one of these quadrants it is remarkable for two sideisles on both sides and the pictures of all the kings and queens of england since cissa the south saxon monarch who made this his royal seat and repaired the ancient roman castle or walls leaving his name to the place on the southern wall as on the opposite wall all the bishops the spire is a piece of excellent workmanship but it received such a shock some years ago that it was almost miraculous that the steeple did not fall down which if it had would probably have demolished the whole church  it was what the inhabitants call a fireball or rather lightning which broke upon the steeple with such irresistible force that it drove several great stones out of it and carried them clear off to a prodigious distance from the steeple one of these stones of at least a ton weight was blown over the south side or row of houses in the west street and fell on the ground in the street at a gentlemans door on the other side of the way and another of them almost as big was blown over both sides of the said west street into the same gentlemans garden and no hurt done by either of them this account i relate from a person of undoubted credit who was an eyewitness and saw the stones the breach made thereby in the spire though within about    feet of the top was incredibly large and yet the steeple stood fast and is now very substantially repaired which shows that it was originally an admirably sound and well finished piece of workmanship the monuments of bishop carleton and bishop king are in this church whose effigies are curiously done in marble  in the year      in digging a foundation at chichester was found pretty deep in the ground a large stone six feet long and three broad with a roman inscription on it in digging up the stone a few of the letters were erasd but they were easily supplied neptuno et minervae templum pro salute domus divinae ex auctoritate tiberii claudii cogidubni regis legati augusti in britannia collegium fabrorum et qui in eo a sacris vel honorati sunt de suo dedicaverunt donante aream pudente pudentini filio that is this temple was dedicated to neptune and minerva for the safety of the imperial family by the authority of tiberius claudius it was erected by the college of artificers of king cogidubnus augustuss lieutenant in britain and by those who officiated as priests or were honored in it at their own expense the ground being given by pudens the son of pudentinus  this stone was presented to his grace the duke of richmond who has placed it in a temple on a mount in his garden at godwood between two statues of neptune and minerva  this city is not a place of much trade nor is it very populous but within these few years they are fallen into a new way of managing the corn trade here which turns very well to account for whereas the farmers generally speaking used to carry all their wheat to farnham market which is very near forty miles by landcarriage and from some parts of the country more than that some moneyed men of chichester emsworth and other places adjacent joined their stocks together and built large granaries near the crook where the vessels come up and here they buy and lay up all the corn which the country on that side can spare and having good mills in the neighborhood they grind and dress the corn and send it to london in the meal by long sea  this is a great lessening to farnham market but if the market at london is supplied the coming by sea from chichester is every whit as much a public good as the encouraging of farnham market which is of itself the greatest cornmarket in england hempstead in hertfordshire and london excepted this carrying of meal by sea is now practiced from several other places on this coast even as far as southampton  chichester besides the cathedral has five small churches about three miles from it is a house of his grace the duke of richmond called godwood it was the ancient seat of the earls of northumberland and in a very ruinous condition but the duke of richmond has lately built some offices which are to correspond with a mansion house designed by colin campbel and published by him in his vitruvius britannicus  his grace has a noble menagerie where he keeps a great variety of foreign animals and birds but the park is small and illplanted  however it has an easy descent to the east south and southwest with the prospect of a rich and beautiful landscape bounded by the sea for thirty miles in length the isle of wight terminates the southwest prospect and the famous st rookshill covers it from the north  about three miles to the east of godwood lies charlton a small village remarkable for being the seat of foxhunters here are many small huntinghouses built by persons of quality who reside there during the season for foxhunting but the most beautiful of these buildings is that of his grace the duke of richmond  here is also a large room which was designed by the right hon the earl of burlington where the gentlemen foxhunters dine every day together during their stay at the village  by the side of this village is a forest which was formerly in the possession of the lumlies but has been for some years his grace the duke of richmonds who has greatly beautified it by cutting fine ridings through the several parts of it and making many new plantations therein  from chichester the road lying still west we pass in sight of the earl of scarboroughs fine seat at stansted a house surrounded with thick woods through which there are the most agreeable vistas cut that are to be seen anywhere in england and particularly at the west opening which is from the front of the house they sit in the dineingroom and see the town and harbor of portsmouth the ships at spithead and also at st helens which when the royal navy happens to be there is a most glorious sight  in our passage to portsmouth we passed by fareham and by portchester a castle built out of a roman city  in portsmouth haven a thousand sail of the biggest ships may ride secure the mouth is not so broad as the thames at westminster and that secured on gosport side by charles fort james fort borough fort and blockhouse fort which has a platform of above  0 great guns level with the water on the other side by portsmouth stands south sea castle built by king henry viii the government has within these few years bought more ground for additional works and no doubt it may be made impregnable for a shallow water may be brought quite round it the yards the docks the storehouses where all the furniture is laid up in the exactest order so that the workmen can find any implement in the dark exceed imagination as do the immense quantities of all sorts of military and naval stores the ropehouse is   0 feet long one continued room almost a quarter of a mile i had the pleasure of seeing a great cable made here it requires  00 men to work at it and so hard is the labor that they can work but four hours in the day the smallest number of men continually employed in the yard is  000 and that but barely sufficient  here is also a good counterscarp and double mote with ravelins in the ditch and double palisadoes and advanced works to cover the place from any approach where it may be practicable the strength of the town is also considerably augmented on the landside by the fortifications raised of late years about the docks and yards and those parts made a particular strength by themselves and though they are indeed in some sense independent one of another yet they cover and strengthen one another so that they cannot be separately attacked on that side while they are both in the same hands  edw iv began these fortifications henry vii considerably augmented them charles ii much improved them and king james ii greatly added to them i was sorry to leave this amazing scene of naval grandeur for the sight of a wretched statue of king william iii gilt indeed in an extraordinary manner but the very worst of all the bad works of this kind i have yet seen i observed the great quantity of water and ditches hereabout is apt to render the place aguish  these docks and yards are now like a town by themselves and are a kind of marine corporation within themselves there being particular large rows of dwellings built at the public charge within the new works for all the principal officers of the place especially the commissioner the agent of the victualling and suchlike  the town of portsmouth is a well inhabited thriving corporation and has been greatly enriched of late by the fleets having so often and so long lain there as well as large fleets of merchantmen besides the constant fitting out of men of war here and the often paying them at portsmouth has made a great resort of people to it mr camden so long ago as the reign of queen elizabeth takes notice that portsmouth was populous in time of war but not so in time of peace but now the business of the navy is so much increased and so much of it always done here that it may be said that there is more to do at portsmouth now in time of peace than was then in time of war  the government of the place is by a mayor and aldermen etc and the civil government is no more interrupted by the military than if there was no garrison there so that we have very seldom had any complaint either of want of discipline among the soldiers or want of prudence in the magistrates  since the increase of business at this place the confluence of people has been so great that the town not admitting any enlargement for buildings a kind of suburb or rather a new town has been built on the heathy ground adjoining which is so considerable that it threatens to outdo for numbers of inhabitants and beauty of buildings even the town itself and the rather as it is unconfined by the laws of the garrison and unincumberd with the corporation burdens freedoms townduties services and the like  next we arrived at the portsdown hills which are of chalk and at a reasonable distance from the shore extend themselves into sussex  here we turned to admire the face of the ground we had passed the ports creeks bays ocean castles and ships the isle of wight portchester the considerable town of gosport portsmouth southampton chichester and all the coast from portland isle to sussex were comprehended under one view  from portsmouth west the country lies low and flat is full of creeks and inlets of the sea and rivers all the way to southampton so that we ferry over three times in about    miles besides going over the bridge at tichfield the first of these ferries is at portsmouth itself viz cross the mouth of the harbor from the point abovementioned to gosport a large town and of great trade especially in time of war from thence we ride to tichfield as above where we pass the river alre which rises in the same county at alresford or near it which is not above twentytwo miles off and yet it is a large river here and makes a good road below called tichfieldbay thence at about four miles we pass another river at busselton narrow in breadth but exceeding deep and eminent for its being able to carry the largest ships here is a buildingyard for ships of war and in king williams time two eightygun ships were launched here it seems the safety of the creek and the plenty of timber in the country behind it is the reason of building so much in this place  from hence when we come opposite to southampton we pass another creek being the mouth of the river alre which comes down from winchester and is both very broad and deep and the ferrymen having a very sorry boat we found it dangerous enough passing it on the opposite bank stands the ancient town of southampton on the other side of which comes down another large river called the test entering southampton water by redbridge so that the town of southampton stands upon a point running out into the sea between two very fine rivers both navigable for some way up the country and particularly useful for the bringing down timber out of one of the best wooded counties in britain for the river on the west side of the town comes by the edge of newforest here we saw a prodigious quantity of timber of an uncommon size vastly large lying on the shore of the river for above two miles in length which they told us was brought thither from the forest and left there to be fetched by the builders at portsmouthdock as they had occasion for it  in riding over the south part of hampshire i made this observation that notwithstanding the very great consumption of timber since the revolution by building or rebuilding almost the whole navy and notwithstanding so many of the kings ships were built hereabouts besides abundance of large merchantships which were about that time built at southampton at redbridge and at busselton etc yet i saw the gentlemens estates within six eight or ten miles of southampton so overgrown with wood and their woods so full of large wellgrown timber that it seemed as if they wanted sale for it and that it was of little worth to them in one estate at hurseley in particular near winchester formerly belonging to mr cromwell grandson to oliver cromwell though the whole estate was not above  00 l per ann in rent they might have cut twenty thousand pounds worth of timber down and yet have left the woods in a thriving condition in another estate between that and petersfield of about  000 l per ann they told me they could fell a thousand pounds a year in good large timber fit for building for twenty years together and do the woods no harm the late colonel norton also whose seat at southwick was within six miles of portsmouth and within three of the watercarriage had as i was told at that time an immense quantity of timber upon it some growing within sight of the very docks in portsmouth farther west it is all the same and as i rode through newforest i saw the ancient oaks of many hundred years standing grown white with age and perishing with their withered tops in the air  i shall give other hints of the like when i come to speak of hertfordshire buckinghamshire berkshire and the counties which we call inland where the timber is but of small value for want of watercarriage to bring it away likewise again of the counties northward bordering upon the humber and upon all the northern rivers not to say a word of ireland which is still a storehouse of timber more inexhaustible if possible than england  but having mentioned the late col norton we cannot pass over in silence his extraordinary will which made so much noise in the world  this gentleman died in dec      and left his real estate of about  000 l per ann and a personal said to be to the value of  0000 l to the poor hungry and thirsty naked and strangers sick and wounded and prisoners to the end of the world and appointed the parliament of great britain to be his executors and in case of their refusal the bishops and left his pictures and other valuables to the king but his will has been since set aside on the score of insanity strong marks of which it carried in the face of it  this gentleman was famous for acting several parts in plays with great propriety particularly the part of falstaff in shakespeares henry the fourth and the merry wives of windsor at a neat theater erected by himself at his house at southwick to which in a vacation he often drew down and entertained the most celebrated london actors  this gentlemans seat at southwick was formerly an old monastery and many of the walls of it are yet remaining the house being a part of it the situation is very low and wet having a great deal of boggy ground about it but from the house the park rises to the highest point of portsdown mentioned above where there are two very large clumps of scots firtrees which were planted by the late col norton and have thriven so well though greatly exposed to the sea winds as to become a landmark at a considerable distance at sea and may be seen near twenty miles at land between these two clumps of trees i was informed that gentleman intended to have erected a lofty building which must have had an exceeding good effect for from the level ground on this spot you have a full view of portsmouth town harbor and docks under the eye and st helens in the isle of wight is another point of view with an unbounded prospect of the sea to the southeast and on the landside a large extensive vale well planted and cultivated bounded with hills spread with woods and the south downs covered with sheep just under the eye so that this prospect may be justly esteemed one of the finest in england  southampton is a truly ancient town which having been many years decaying in its trade of late has very much improved in that of portugal wines which are imported here and sent into many places inland where formerly the london merchants used to deal and that in great measure owing to the duties being easier at southampton than at london they also carry on some trade with the isles of jersey and guernsey and not a little as their enemies say of the smuggling trade the town is large and populous has a fair high street a spacious key and if its trade should thoroughly revive is able to contain great numbers of people there is a french church and no inconsiderable congregation belonging to it here are still some merchants who trade to newfoundland for fish which they carry to the streights etc and some shipbuilding also is carried on here though not near so much as formerly  this town had formerly the sole privilege from the crown of importing wines from thence which though a vast advantage to it the corporation either wantonly or corruptly sold to london  the situation of southampton between two rivers was to its advantage formerly in point of strength and is besides strongly walled with very large stones full of those little white shells like honeycombs which grow upon the back of oysters this is a sort of stone extremely hard and seems to be gathered near the beach of the sea these walls have many lunets and towers in some places double ditchd but the sea encompasses near half the town it was built in the reign of edward iii  i observe they have a method of breaking the force of the waves here by laying a bank of seaore as they call it it is composed of long slender and strong filaments like pilld hemp very tough and durable i suppose thrown up by the sea and this performs its work better than walls of stone or natural cliff  at the southeast corner near the quay is a fort with some guns upon it called the tower on one was an inscription denoting its being erected by king henry viii in the year      in the northwest corner was a strong castle with a mount walled about attop as a keep upon this a round stone tower with a winding ascent  the main of this town consists of one broad street running through its length there are many old religious ruins and great warehouses cellars storehouses etc the old roman city called trausantum stood more eastward upon the banks of the river itching coming from winchester where now is a hamlet named st marys there is a handsome new church built upon the ruins of an old one which they say was burnt in some french wars it is near the present ferry and opposite to bittern where was an old roman castle surrounded with a ditch into which the seawater flowed it was ruined in the danish wars and southampton arose from its ashes this place is memorable for the experiment of king canute who to silence the vain flattery of his courtiers seated himself on the banks of the river with all his regal apparatus and commanded the tide not to approach his footstool  about a mile from this town on the banks of the river itching is a vast large pile of earth which rises in the form of a cone from a large wide foundation of great extent and circumference which they call bevismount it is supposed to be an ancient fortification thrown up by the saxons under the command of bevis to oppose the passage of the danes over the river who lay encamped on the other side the river is not very large but the tide running up into it a good way beyond the town forms a kind of bay just under this great mount which being contiguous to an estate belonging to the late earl of peterborough his lordship purchased it and converted it into a kind of wilderness and as it is full of trees and brambles he has cut through them diverse circular walks and labyrinths so very intricate that it is hardly possible to avoid being lost in them his lordship used frequently to divert himself by dropping his friends in the midst of this wilderness and stealing away let them wander up and down till they found their way out of it the mount terminates above as is feigned of parnassus in a kind of fork and between the two spires is a bowlinggreen or parterre adorned with fine italian marble statues brought by his lordship from abroad it lies open on the sidefacing the river and when the tide is in gives a most agreeable prospect on one side of this parterre declining gradually from the top of one of the spires to the green is planted a little vineyard exposed to the south and on the other side on the very summit of the spire stands a fine summer house very elegantly built and contrived with a good cellar under it where his lordship kept his wines having no good cellerage at his house which is near a quarter of a mile from the mount from which his lordship called it bevismount he intended to rebuild the house and convert all the grounds lying between it and the mount into gardens had he lived a little longer the beauty of the improvements which his lordship has made in this mount are hardly to be conceived he has adorned it with statues grottoes and alcoves and diversified it up and down with something new and surprising at every turn peculiar to his own fine taste and genius in gardening wherein no nobleman excelled and few equaled him in europe he left this little seat and lands about it to his lady who now enjoys them  there are as many things fabled here of bevis as there are in wales and cornwall of king arthur both of whom have suffered much from legendary writers and tradition for as king arthur performed many brave and valiant acts in war and was of great bodily strength so bevis who was a saxon lord was a man of much military courage and conduct as well as personally strong he was a great opposer of the normans and followed them down to wales and gave them battle near caerdiff in glamorganshire but was there defeated it is said his sword may be still seen at arundel castle yet there are some who from the fables with which their stories are mingled doubt whether ever there were such persons as either of them  i here took a passage over to the isle of wight and in two hours arrived at cowes by the way passing by calshot castle where some years ago were to be seen the maintopmast head of a dutch man of war sunk in that place a very dangerous sand lying there in the middle of the current  cowes is the chief seaport town in this island and in time of war the general place of rendezvous for merchantships waiting for convoys being secured in some measure by the guns of the castle but more by the neighborhood of portsmouth we walked four miles and came to  newport the principal town in the island large and populous at a pretty strong castle about a mile distant resides the governor  the island is very pleasant and so fruitful that one years crop will serve the inhabitants for seven years who therefore supply portsmouth and the parts adjacent with the surplus it abounds particularly in corn cattle hares rabbets wildfowl fish etc it is sixty miles in circumference its militia is the best disciplined in england its wool in fineness is next to that of cotswold carisbrook castle is famous for being the place of imprisonment of king charles i sanham in this island has also a castle so has southyarmouth so called to distinguish it from greatyarmouth in norfolk spithead between portsmouth and this island and st helens near to the isle of wight are famous for the rendezvous of the royal navy of england appledorecome is a very beautiful seat in this isle belonging to sir robert worsley brt  this island is also noted for having been once advanced to the title of a kingdom by king henry vi in behalf of henry beauchamp earl of warwick his great favorite who was crowned king of wight and of the isles of jersey and guernsey in      but dying two years after the isle lost the title of a kingdom for king edward iv who succeeded henry bestowed this island upon his fatherinlaw richard woodville earl rivers with the title of lord of wight as the late earl of derby was lord of the isle of man  returning to southampton i was at the extent of my intended journey west intending to look no farther this way for the present i went northeast leaving winchester a little on the left and came into the portsmouth road at petersfield a town chiefly noted for good inns and standing in the middle of a country overgrown with a prodigious quantity of oaktimber from hence we came to alton and in the road thither began a little to taste the pleasure of the western downs which reach from winchester almost to that place  the duke of bolton has two very noble seats in this country one between alton and alresford and one at basing of which hereafter alton is a small market town of no note neither is there any considerable manufacture in all this part of england except a little drugget and shalloonmaking otherwise the whole counties of kent sussex surrey and hampshire are not employed in any considerable woollen manufacture  from alton we came to farnham a large populous market town the farthest that way in the county of surrey from london and excepting hempstead and london as we observed above the greatest cornmarket in england particularly for wheat of which so vast a quantity is brought hither every market day that a gentleman told me he once counted   00 teams of horse all drawing wagons or carts laden with wheat every team of which is supposed to bring a load which is forty bushels in the whole   000 bushels but i do not take upon me to affirm this for truth of my own knowledge though i know some have thought the quantity has been much more but this also was i suppose before the people of chichester and emsworth on one side and southampton tichfield and redbridge on the other took to the trade of sending their wheat in meal to london by sea as i mentioned before  the tolldish some marketdays used to amount to above a load of wheat and yet about  00 years ago it was so short of it that one busk whose property it was sold it for forty shillings so greatly was this manufacture increased within that period but if farnham has been a loser by the method lately fallen upon by the people of chichester and southampton it has made itself amends by another product which it has taken to within these twenty years past and that is hops which it has so vastly improved in that it may be said to outdo canterbury maidstone and any of the places in kent most noted for that commodity and this not only in quantity but goodness in short all the neighborhood about farnham is one general hopground and to show the excellency of the product farnham hops now lead the price at all the markets in england  at this town is a castle built by a bishop of winchester which has been in a constant succession possessed by the bishops of the diocese ever since king stephens time to this day and is their usual place of residence this palace is a magnificent structure deeply moated and strongly walled with towers at proper distances it stands upon the edge of an hill where is a fine park one large and broad street of the town belowhill fronts the castle the main of the rest of the town consists of a long strait street crossing it at right angles the river went parallel to it on the south  about two miles from farnham is morepark formerly the seat of sir william temple who by his will ordered his heart to be put into a chinabason and buried under a sundial in his garden which was accordingly performed this house is situated in a valley surrounded on every side with hills having a running stream through the gardens which with a small expense might be made to serpent through all the adjoining meadows in a most delightful manner at about a quarter of a mile from the house is a large grotto in the side of a hill from whence you may command a prospect of the meadows and woods which lie below it and these are bounded again by hills which makes the whole one of the most romantic places imaginable  from farnham that i might take in the whole county of surrey i took the coach road over bagshotheath and that great forest as it is called of windsor  bagshotheath which at present is a horrid barren country is capable of great improvement as may be judged by the several enclosures on the borders of it and some in the center also which from being in the same condition as we at present see the whole face of the country thereabouts very barren producing nothing but heath and whorts now produces good corn and grass and in some parts are good plantations of trees which thrive well on the edge of this heath are several seats of noblemen but those which require notice are first the right hon the earl of arrans which is a large enclosure the woodwalks and other plantations being upward of two miles in circumference and the park which runs on the other side of the house is upward of three miles the plantations in this enclosure have made good progress which is a proof that the soil thereabout is capable of great improvement  the next seat is that of the right hon the earl of anglesea which is an ancient house situated very near the church and almost surrounded with large trees so that only the front appears to view  the duke of roxborough has also a seat in this place where his grace used to reside a great part of the summer and autumn for the pleasure of shooting being very fond of that sport  this desert lies extended so much that some say there is not less than  00000 acres of this barren land that lies all together reaching out every way in the three counties of surrey hampshire and berkshire besides a great quantity of land almost as bad as that between godalmin and petersfield on the road to portsmouth including some hills called the hindhead and others  it may not be amiss to take notice of a common mistake in relation to bagshot mutton so much valued by the gentry which they suppose to be fed there and from the poorness of the soil rendered smaller than most other mutton in england whereas i am credibly informed that none of the sheep are fed at bagshot being brought from and fed upon hampshire downs and all killed by the butchers of bagshot and sent to london  through this desert for i can call it no less we come into the great western road leading from london to salisbury exeter etc and pass the thames at stanes  the bridge of stanes and egham causeway which are part of the highway from london to the west of england having been for some time in a ruinous and dangerous condition and the tolls and duties laid by an act passed in the reign of henry viii and another in that of queen elizabeth amounting to no more than the clear sum of    l per annum the bridgemasters were obliged to exact at the ferry there exorbitant rates for conveying passengers over the thames in order the better to support the said bridge and causeway and yet all proving insufficient as well as burdensome an act passed in the session of      0 for the more effectual maintenance and wellkeeping of them both and will be a great benefit to passengers as also to the river and the towns adjacent and the act provides that in case of the reparation of the bridge or any other accident which shall hinder passengers or carriages going over the bridge the ferry shall exact no higher rate for conveying over such passengers etc than are laid for passing over the bridge  here recollecting that i had yet left the inland towns of the two counties of kent and sussex and great part of the county of surrey out of my account and that having as it were taken a circuit round the coast only i had a great many places worth viewing to give an account of i therefore left windsor on one side of the river and hampton court on the other to be the subject of another letter and resolved to finish my present purpose in the order i had begun it that is to say to take in the whole country as i came on that i might make as few transitions as possible from one remote part of england to another  from stanes therefore i turned s and s e to chertsey another market town and where there is a bridge over the thames this town is noted for the burialplace of henry vi whence his bones were afterward removed to windsor by henry vii and also by its being the retreat of the incomparable cowley where he lived distant from the hurries of the court and town entirely taken up in country business farming and husbandry for his diversion and where he also died  from this town wholly employed in malting and in barge carriages down the river to london i went away south to working a private country market town so out of the way that it is very little heard of in england it claims however some honor from its being once the residence of a royal branch of the family of plantagenet the old countess of richmond mother to king henry vii who made her last retreat here where the king her son built or rather repaired an old royal house on purpose for her residence and where she ended her days in honor and peace the former part of her life having been much exposed to storms and dangers under the turbulent reigns of the two preceding monarchs  from hence we came to guilford a well known and considerable market town here sometimes the assizes are held but always elections for parliament men for the county the river which according to mr camden is called the wey and which falls into the thames at oatlands is made navigable to this town which adds greatly to its trade and by this navigation a very great quantity of timber is brought down to london not from the neighborhood of this town only but even from the woody parts of sussex and hampshire above thirty miles from it the country carriages bringing it hither in the summer by land this navigation is also a great support to the cornmarket at farnham for as the mealmen and other dealers buy the corn at that market a good deal of it is brought to the mills on this river which is not above seven miles distant and being first ground and dressed is then sent down in the meal by barges to london at a small expense  here is a small remainder of an old manufacture in the clothingtrade and it extends itself to godalmin haselmere and the vale country on the side of the holmwood of which i shall speak on another occasion quite to darking these cloths of a middling price have formerly been in great repute but afterward lost their credit for some time till by the application and skill of the clothiers of late they revived whilst the clothiers of cranbrook and tenterden in kent whose goods are of the same kind are almost sunk to nothing as i have already observed  this clothingtrade however small is yet very assisting to the poor of this part of the country where the lands as i have noted are but indifferent the inhabitants generally cottagers living chiefly by the commons and heath ground thereabouts  on wednesday the   d of april    0 the upper church at guilford in surrey fell down it was an ancient building and not long before   0 l was expended upon it in repairs there was preaching in it on the sunday before and workmen were employed in taking down the bells who providentially had quitted the spot about a quarter of an hour before the accident happened so that not one person received any hurt though great numbers were spectators three bells had been taken down and the other three fell with the steeple which broke the body of the church to pieces though the steeple received but little damage by the fall  from guilford the road to farnham is very remarkable for it runs along west from guilford upon the ridge of a high chalky hill no wider than the road itself and the declivity begins on either hand at the very hedge that bounds the highway and is very steep and high from this hill is a prospect either way so far that it is surprising insomuch that one sees to the north or northwest over bagshotheath one way to the southeast into sussex the other way almost to the southdowns and west to an unbounded length where the horizon only restrains the eye this hill being all chalk a traveller feels the effect of it in a hot summers day when the reflection of the sun make the heat almost insupportable this hill reaches from guilford so far as within a mile and a half of farnham  the hill or rather the ascent of it from guilford is called st catharineshill on the summit whereof stands the gallows which is so placed that the townspeople from the high street may sit at their shopdoors and see the criminals executed  near guilford on the left hand side of the road leading to godalmin are the remains of an ancient chapel situated on the summit of a hill so as to be seen at a considerable distance every way this is called st catharines chapel the materials with which this was built are a sort of tile which when broken has the appearance of iron within and the cement which joins these titles is now so hard as scarcely to be penetrated with the strongest instrument the only remains of this chapel are the outside walls which being built with these materials have resisted the weather and the common fate of things  the great road from london to chichester and from london to portsmouth lying through guilford it is consequently a town very well furnished with inns for accommodation of travelers as is godalmin also the next town within three miles of it noted likewise of late years for the place of residence of the impostor mary tofts who so long amused statesmen physicians anatomists and in short all degrees of men learned and unlearned with her infamous rabbetproductions etc  from guilford lies a crossroad as it may be called to london not frequented by coaches or carriers or the ordinary passengers to london though it is by some reckoned the nearest way and is without question much the pleasanter road if not the pleasantest in this part of england viz from this town to leatherhead  0 miles from leatherhead to london over bansteaddowns    miles or if you please by epsom    miles which though it is called the farthest way makes amends abundantly by the advantage and pleasantness of the road  in the road from guilford to epsom being    miles you meet with a town almost at every two miles end in or near which is a handsome seat the road is always good being a very hard gravel on the right hand of the road lie the downs which have constantly a great number of sheep feeding on them and on the left the parks gardens and cultivated fields belonging to the several gentlemen who inhabit those seats all which render the road very pleasant and agreeable  the seat of the lord onslow which is the first on the road from guilford is but indifferently situated the front which faces the road is obscured by the wood so that it can be seen only in one point of view and the house standing very low does not command any prospect from the neighboring downs the avenues to it are very narrow and the building though very large is executed in a very bad taste  on the same road lies an ancient seat now in the possession of james fox esquire which though an old building yet having an open situation in front toward the downs is rendered very pleasant and the present possessor being a person of fine taste is beautifying the house within and making pleasant plantations about it which will be a great embellishment to the seat  near this road also lies the seat of the honorable sir conyers darcy which is situated on an eminence so as to be seen many miles distant the house is a large new edifice having a park behind it and is pretty well timbered on every side i ought not to omit mentioning the seat of the late arthur moore esquire at fetcham near leatherhead now in the possession of thomas revel esquire where no cost has been spared to make a most beautiful situation by nature more delightful by art  two miles from guilford on the banks of the wey is a fine seat which belonged when i saw it to the late denzil onslow esquire called pyrford and is exceeding pleasant especially for the beautiful intermixture of wood and water in the park gardens and grounds adjoining whereby that gentleman whose genius lay wonderfully in improving lands and rendering things more profitable and pleasant brought pyrford to such a perfection as to be inferior to very few if any of the finest houses in surrey adjoining to the park is a very convenient and ingenious decoy the first of the kind in this part of england  at the northeast end of this range of fine seats is leatherhead a little thoroughfaretown with a stone bridge over the mole a river so called from its remarkable sinking into the earth at the foot of boxhill near a village called mickleham and working its way under ground like a mole rising again at or near this town of leatherhead where its wandering streams are united again and form a pretty large river as they were before running together under leatherhead bridge and from thence to cobham and so it pursues its course to the thames which it joins at molesey which doubtless takes its name from the river  and here i cannot but take notice of an unaccountable error into which all the writers i have met with have unwarily fallen on account of this little river hiding itself in the earth and finding its way under ground from the foot of beechworth or betsworthcastle near boxhill and then rising again at leatherhead as above as if the water had at once ingulphd itself in a chasm of earth or sunk in a whirlpit the great camden has not a little contributed to this error in his account thereof but as he is in some measure set right by an observation and note in the last edition of his britannia by the right rev continuator i shall have the less occasion to insist upon the matter and shall therefore refer to them and only mention what i have myself observed on this occasion having resided some time in the neighborhood  the current of the river being much obstructed by the interposition of boxhill which interrupting its free course forces the waters to find their way through as well as they can and in order to this coming near that part called the stomacher the waters sink insensibly away lessening the stream for near two miles and these channels they call the swallows and the whole ground on the bank of the river where it is flat and low is full of these subterraneous passages so that if on any sudden rain the river swells over the banks it is observed not to go back into the chanel again when the flood abates but to sink away into the earth in the meadows where it spreads  these swallows for there are many and not one called the swallow as is said in mr camden though they diminish the stream much do not so drink it up as to make it disappear but when it crosses the roof near mickleham it runs very sharp and broad nor did i ever know it without water in the driest summer in that place on the contrary i have known it so deep the wagons and carriages have not dared to go through  below this place the hills rise again on the other side very high and particularly on the ridge which the country people call the ashcombhills and they seem to force the river again west so it surrounds most of the park formerly belonging to sir richard studdolph and has several bridges upon it and by this time indeed so much of it is sunk away that sometimes the chanel though full of water in pits and holes cannot be perceived to run but this must be in a very dry season and still the chanel is visible where it runs at other times rapidly enough  this part which has the least water continuing about half a mile we then perceive the stream very visibly to be increased so that it takes vent again now in thousands of little springs till in another half mile it is an ample river again and passes in full streams under leatherhead bridge as above  a further proof of the gradual sinking away of the water take as follows in october      there happened a very sudden hasty landflood which swelled the river to a very great height and particularly so high that at beechworthcastle and at other gentlemens seats near the river where they had fish ponds that were fed by the river it overflowed their ponds and carried off all their fish sir adam brown lived then at beechworthcastle and his son and the young gentlemen of the neighboring families disturbed at the loss of their fish came all down to darking where they raised a little troop of the young fellows and boys of the town and all went together to that part of the river which runs by the foot of the stomacher of boxhill  there was a low flat piece of meadowground lying close to the river on one side just opposite to which the hill lying also close to the river made up the bank on the other this piece of ground might contain about four or five acres and lying hollow in the middle like the shape of a drippingpan was by the overflowing of the river so full of water that the bank which lay close to the river though higher than the rest was not to be seen  the gentlemen set themselves to raise this bank so as to separate the water in the hollow part of the field from that in the river and then made a return to it at the upper or east end of the field so that no more water could run into the field from any part of the river and the event was that in about two nights and a day exclusive of the time they took in making their dams the water sunk all away in the field and the fish being surrounded were caught as it were in a trap and the purchase fully recompensed their labor for the like quantity of fish great and small i believe was never taken at once in this kingdom out of so small a river  this story i mention as a demonstration of the manner of this river losing itself under ground or being swallowed up as they call it for this field where the water sunk away is just at the place which mr camden calls swallow near the village of mickleham and under the precipice of the hill and yet the water was two nights and a day sinking leisurely off and in this manner and no other does so much of the river as passes under ground sink away  the town of darking is eminent for several little things worth observation as first for the great roman highway called stoneystreet which passes through the churchyard of this town secondly for a little common or heath called the cottman dean or the heath of poor cottages for so the word signifies belonging to the town and where their almshouse stands which some learned physicians believe to be the best air in england thirdly for mr howards house and garden called deepden which stand in a small valley environed with steep hills on every side the levelground about the house was laid out into pleasant walks and gardens which were planted with a great variety of exotic trees and plants and the hills were planted with trees on every side excepting the south aspect which was planted with vines and formerly there has been some tolerable good wine made there though the hill is so steep that it is very difficult to walk up it at present the gardens and vineyard are neglected and many of the exotic trees have been destroyed on the summit of the hill above the vineyard is a summer house from which in a clear day you may discern the sea over the southdowns near arundel  the market of darking is the most famous in england for poultry and particularly for the fattest geese and the largest capons they are brought hither from as far as horsham in sussex and it is the business of all the country on that side for many miles to breed and fatten them up and some are so large as to be little inferior to turkeys i have seen them sold for   s to   s   d each and weighing from   to   or   lb apiece  on holy thursday here is also a fair chiefly for lambs and the greatest in england of that kind i have passed over the so much celebrated house of mr evelyn at wotton near darking not that it is not worth notice but because so many others have said so much of it  from boxhill and particularly from this part of it is a fair view in clear weather quite over the weald of sussex to the southdowns and by the help of glasses the town of horsham ashdown forest the duke of somersets house at petworth and the southdowns as they range between brighthelmston and arundel may be plainly seen besides an unbounded prospect into kent  the vale beneath this hill is for many miles east and west called the holmward or holmsdale in the woody part of which are often found outlying red deer and in the days of king james ii or while he was duke of york they have hunted the largest stags here that have been seen in england the duke took great care to have them preserved for his own sport but they have since that been most of them destroyed  this holmward is now chiefly overgrown with furz but was famous for producing such quantities of strawberries that they were carried to market by horseloads  it is suggested that this place was in ancient times the retreat for many ages of the native britons whom the romans could never drive out and after that it was the like to the saxons when the danes harassed the nation and ravaged the country wherever they came on this account they retain here in memory the following lines this is holmesdale never conquered never shall   the country though wild still and perhaps having the same countenance now in many places as it had a thousand years ago yet in other places is cultivated and has roads passable enough in the summer quite through it on every side and the woods are in a great measure cleared off  keeping along the bottom of these hills and yet not entering into this vale the country is dry sandy or gravelly and full of gentlemens houses and good towns though if we go but a little to the right hand south into the wild part it is a deep strong and in the wet season an unpassable clay  in passing through holmesdale upon the ridge of mountains which extend from kent to the landsend you come to wotton a small village near which is the ancient seat of the evelyns which is situated amongst meadows having pleasant streams of water passing through them and the neighboring hills covered with woods which renders the situation pleasant in the summerseason but the roads about it being very bad in winter it is not so convenient an habitation at that season  near this place is situated lithhill which rises gradually from hence for near three miles to the south from the top of which you have a full prospect of the whole counties of surrey and sussex part of hampshire berkshire oxfordshire buckinghamshire hertfordshire middlesex kent and essex the whole extent of this prospect being thought near  00 miles and that without the help of glasses  traveling east at the foot of the hills we came to rygate a large market town situated in the valley of holmesdale where are still to be seen the ruins of a castle with a long vault and a room at the end of it in which it is said the barons who were in arms against king john held their private meetings  near this also are two miserable borough towns which nevertheless send each of them two members to parliament to wit gatton under the side of the hill almost at rygate and bleechingly more eastward  at nutfield between rygate and beechingly is another branch of the family of evelyn who have flourished there many years  from hence crossing still all the roads leading from london into sussex we came again to a village called godstone which lies on the road from london to jews  and keeping on east we came to westerham a neat handsome well built market town the first in kent on that side the late earl of jersey built or rather finished for it was begun by a private gentleman a very noble house here called squirries which is now in the possession of john ward esquire son to sir john ward who was lord mayor of london in the year      the house stands on a small eminence regarding the land in the front but on the back of the house the ground rises very high and is divided into several steep slopes which renders the situation damp and cold near the house are some woods through which the present possessor has cut several ridings and on the other side of the hill behind the house arise nine considerable springs which unite at a small distance and these form the river dart which runs through dartford and afterward discharges itself into the thames  all this part of the country from guilford to this place is very agreeably pleasant healthy and fruitful and is overspread with good towns gentlemens houses populous villages abundance of fruit with hopgrounds and cherryorchards and the lands well cultivated but all on the right hand that is to say south is overgrown with timber has abundance of waste and wild grounds and forests and woods with many large ironworks at which they cast ironcaldrons chimneybacks furnaces retorts boilingpots iron cannon bombshells stinkpots handgrenadoes cannonball etc  from hence going forward east we come to riverhead a town on the road from london to tunbridge and then having little to speak of in kent except some petty market towns such as wrotham commonly called rootham townmalling cranbrook and the like of which i have taken some notice before i turned north and came to bromley a market town made famous by an hospital or college built there by dr john warner lord bishop of rochester for the relief of  0 poor widows of loyal and orthodox clergymen who are allowed each  0 l per annum and a chaplain  0 l and has had many gifts and charities bestowed on it since  near this town we turned away by beckenham and through norwood to croyden in the way we saw dulwich or sydenhamwells where great crowds of the lower class of people throng every summer from london to drink the waters there and at stretham and the rather because it lies so near london that they can walk to it in the morning and return at night  croydon has a great cornmarket but chiefly for oats and oatmeal for the service of london the town is large and full of citizens from london in it is the ancient palace of the archbishops of canterbury and several of them lie buried in the church here particularly archbishop whitgift who not only repaired the palace but built and endowed the famous hospital which is for a warden and    men and women and the free school  from hence we passed by beddington where is the seat or mansion house of the ancient family of the carews the house is noble and the gardens fine yet architects say that the two wings are too deep for the body of the house that they should either have been more asunder or not so long the court before them is extremely fine as is the canal in the park before the court having a river running through it the gardens take up all the flat part of the park with vistas or prospects for two or three miles the orange trees continue and are the only ones in england that grow in the natural ground they have moving houses to shelter them in the winter from the inclemencies of our climate and are loaded with fruit in the summer they have stood in the ground where they now grow above  00 years  from hence it is but a little mile to cashalton a country village situate among innumerable springs of water which all together form a river in the very street of the town and joining the other springs which come from croydon and beddington make one stream called the wandell this village though lying among such delightful springs is yet upon firm chalk and having the downs adjoining makes the most agreeable spot on this side of london as is abundantly testified by its being crowded as it were with fine houses of the citizens of london some of which are built with such a profusion of expense that they look rather like seats of the nobility than the countryhouses of citizens and merchants mr scawen knight of the shire for this county designed a noble house here but it is not proceeded with that which once belonged to sir john fellows subgovernor of the south sea company in the fatal year    0 was built by dr ratcliff but the gardens were made by sir john it was purchased by the right honorable philip lord hardwick lord high chancellor of great britain by whom it was lately sold to william mitchel of huntingdon who now possesses it i cannot dwell on the description of all the fine houses in this and the neighboring villages i shall speak of them again in bulk with their neighbors of mitcham stretham tooting clapham and others but i must take a trip here cross the downs to epsom  bansteaddowns need no description other than this that being so near london and surrounded as they are with pleasant villages the ground smooth soft level and dry even in but a few hours after rain they conspire to make the most delightful spot of ground of that kind in all this part of britain  about four miles over those delicious downs bring us to epsom a well built large and handsome village which abounds with fine houses the retreats principally of the london merchants it was very much frequented a few years ago on account of its mineral waters which issue from a rising ground nearer ashted than epsom but they are now though not impaired in their virtues yet pretty much so in their reputation possibly owing more than any thing else to the place being too near london for a journey for the quality and gentry according to the old saying farfetched and dearbought is fittest for the ladies the hall galleries and other public apartments are run to decay and there remains but one house on the spot which is inhabited by a countryman and his wife who carry the waters in bottles to the adjacent places  there are a great many fine seats around this place which we have not room to describe such as the lord baltimores lady fieldings mr mitchells at cashalton just mentioned mr scawens and many others particularly that formerly called nonsuch which was once a royal palace and finely situated king charles ii gave it to the duchess of cleveland and she sold it to my lord berkeley who built a fine seat with the materials of it near epsom called durdans nonsuch is now but a farmhouse and durdans is in the possession of the lord north and guilford but his royal highness frederick prince of wales has lately taken it for a pleasurable retreat when he is not disposed to go so far as cliefden in bucks  from epsom that i might thoroughly visit the county of surrey i rode over stiff clays and through very bad roads to kingston from whence i had a fine view of hampton court at a distance but that i reserve for another journey  kingston is a good market town remarkable for a free school erected and endowed by queen elizabeth an almshouse built in    0 by alderman cleaver of london and endowed with lands of  0 l a year a house were formerly resided the great earl of warwick surnamed makeking besides coomb which was likewise his but now in the family of the harveys from whence the waters of certain springs are said to be conveyed in leaden pipes under the road and the thames to hampton court three miles in length several of the old saxon kings were not only crowned but had their actual residence here whence it took its name of kingstown it had once the privilege of sending burgesses to parliament but now that is lost  from hence turning southward on the road to guilford we come to esher where was formerly a seat built by cardinal wolsey to which during his ministry he frequently retired for amusement the gate to this gothic building remaining was turned into a dwelling house which was lately sold to the right honorable henry pelham esquire who has beautified the old part and made additional buildings to it in the same gothic style and laid out the grounds about it in so elegant a taste as makes it one of the finest seats in the neighborhood of london but the house stands so low as not to be seen until you come very near it and the river mole running near the back of the house renders it very damp which greatly diminishes the pleasure of the place though there has been no cost spared to render it elegant  near esher on the left hand of the great road lies claremont which was a small house built under a hill covered with wood by the late sir john vanbrugh and purchased by his grace the duke of newcastle who has been at a great expense in beautifying the gardens etc and has added to the house a great extent of buildings in the same style with the original house and has also built one large room in which his grace entertains foreign ambassadors and where all the magnificent dinners which the duke makes in the country are served up the house is situated so near the hill that the moisture issuing from thence occasions it to be very damp and the winds being reverberated back from the woods on the house cause most of the chimneys to smoke so that this is a bad habitation in winter but as it is the place to which his grace usually retires from public business whenever his leisure will permit he has not spared expense to render it as agreeable as possible though as several persons have had the contrivance of his gardens and buildings there is not any uniform taste to be found in either which is greatly to be regretted since the noble owner has been so much intent on having it worthy of himself  from hence turning on the right toward the river of thames we pass walton and weybridge where are several fine seats but particularly those of the earls of lincoln and portmore  in the first of these is a noble terracewalk elevated so high above the level of the neighboring ground as to afford a prospect of the country as also a view of the river  the other seat was beautified by the countess of dorchester in the reign of king james ii here is a walk planted with acacia trees which at that time were esteemed great curiosities  the country hereabout is very low and flat so that in winter the meadows are generally flooded which renders the air damp and cold and the roads are sometimes almost impassable but in summer the meadows afford a good quantity of hay which sufficiently recompenses the owner for the disadvantage of situation  near weybridge is a pleasant small seat now in the possession of philip southcoat esquire called wobournfarm the house is situated low but is not very damp and has the advantage of being screend from the violence of strong winds by tall trees in the neighborhood in the front of the house is a small island which in summer is stocked with sheep who are constantly feeding in view of the principal rooms of the house the water surrounding this island is conducted in a serpentine form so as to have little resemblance to art the fields above the house are kept very neat being rolled and fed so that there is a fine carpet of grass the walks round them being made dry by gravel and on each side planted with sweet shrubs and flowers in a rural manner at the upper part of these fields is a spot of ground laid out in gardens which being too regular do not so well correspond with the other parts which are laid out to answer the name of a farm very properly but this part has something of too much stiffness and regularity to agree with the rest  from this spot of ground is a most delightful prospect over a large extent of meadows bounded by the river thames which winds in an agreeable manner and having frequently large west country barges floating in it with their broad sails appear as so many moving objects in a picture and greatly enliven the prospect  from hence also are seen ten or twelve villages and several fine houses and chertsey bridge appears as if it were intended for a principal object indeed the whole spot may justly be deemed one of the sweetest retirements near london  keeping the river now on my left as i did before on my right hand drawing nearer to london we came to ham and petersham little villages the first famous for a most pleasant palace of the late duke of lauderdale close by the river now possessed by the earl of dysert a house king charles ii used to be frequently at and was exceedingly pleased with the avenues of this fine house to the landside lead up to the end of the village of petersham where the wall of new park comes also close to the town on the other side in an angle of which stood a most delicious house built by the late earl of rochester lord high treasurer in king james iis reign as also in part of queen annes reign this fine house was burnt down in the year    0 by an accidental fire so sudden and furious that the family who were all at home had scarce time to save their lives  nor was the house though so exquisitely finished so beautiful within and without the greatest loss sustained the rich furniture the curious collection of paintings and the inestimable library of the first earl of clarendon lord chancellor of england and author of that most excellent history of the rebellion of which the world knows so much were here wholly consumed a loss irreparable as the latter contained among other valuable things several manuscripts relating to those times and to things transacted by himself and by the king his master both at home and abroad besides other rare and curious collections made by that noble and learned author in foreign countries  the offices escaped the fate the house met with and on the same spot of ground where the house stood the right honorable the lord harrington secretary of state erected another after the design of the right honorable the earl of burlington and when i have said this i need not say it is equally a convenient and elegant edifice the front indeed next the court has not a very striking appearance being very plain and the entrance into the house not greatly to be praised but the south front next the garden though very plain yet is bold and regular the apartments next the garden which are chiefly designed for state are also very elegant and beautifully finished  the gardens which before were crowded with pluntations near the house are now laid open in lawns of grass and the kitchengarden which was situated on the east side of the house is removed out of sight and that ground is now converted to an open slope of grass which leads up to a terrace of great length from which is a prospect of the river thames the town of twickenham and all the beautiful seats round about that part of the country almost to kingstonbridge on the other side of the terrace on a rising ground is a large plantation of wood and on the summit of the hill is erected a fine pleasurehouse which commands a prospect of the country every way for many miles so that by foreigners this view is esteemed the most beautiful of any near london  from hence we came to richmond lately the delightful retreat of his majesty and his royal consort the queen who took great delight therein to the time of her death and made not only vast improvements and alterations there but purchased several fine houses on kewgreen as that of lady air for his royal highness the duke that of sir thomas abney for the princesses and his royal highness prince frederick mean while made considerable improvements in the fine house and gardens belonging formerly to the lady capell while her majesty was used to divert herself at her royal dairyhouse and in her beautiful hermitage merlins cave and in other charming improvements which she made in the park and gardens of this delightful place all which are so well known that we need not insist upon them  the court being so near must needs have filled richmond which was before a most agreeable retreat for the first and secondrate gentry with a great deal of the best company in england and indeed this town and the country all round it have much increased in buildings lately  the lord viscount palmerston the worthy son and successor to the honor and estate of the great sir william temple has a fine seat and gardens hard by at sheen the gardens were finished as well as contrived by the great genius of sir william and as they were his last delight in life so they were every way suited to be so to a man of his sense and capacity who knew what kind of life was best fitted to make a mans last days happy  it is not easy to describe the beauty with which the banks of the thames shine on either side of the river from hence to london much more than our ancestors even but one age ago knew any thing of if for pleasant villages great houses palaces gardens etc it was true in queen elizabeths time according to the poet that the thames with royal tyber may compare what may be said of it now when for one fine house to be seen then there are for aught i know an hundred even as you sit in a boat and pass up and down the river  first beginning from hamhouse as above richmond palace salutes the eye being formerly no more than a lodge in the park but now makes a royal figure  from richmond to london the river sides abound with villages and those villages so full of beautiful buildings charming gardens and rich habitations of gentlemen of quality that nothing can equal it no not the country for  0 miles round paris though that indeed is a kind of prodigy  it is impossible to view these countries from any rising ground and not be ravished with the delightful prospect for example suppose you take your view from the little rising hills about clapham if you look to the east there you see the pleasant villages of peckham and camberwell with some of the finest dwellings about london then turning south we see loughborough house near kennington the duchess of bedfords at stretham other fine seats about croydon a whole town of fine houses at cashalton sir nicolas carews and others at beddington sir theodore janssens and that lately built by the duchess dowager of marlborough at wimbleton other fine houses at tooting besides a very great number in clapham itself on the southwest also you have mr harveys at coomb formerly the palace of the aforementioned makeking earl of warwick and from him called coombnevil with all the villages mentioned above and the country adjoining filled with the palaces of the british nobility and gentry already spoken of looking north behold to crown all a fair prospect of the city of london the most glorious sight without exception that the world at present can show or perhaps could since the sacking of rome  it is impossible in one journey to describe effectually this part of the county of surrey lying from kingston to london and greenwich where i set out that is including the villages of richmond petersham eastsheen mortlake putney wandsworth barnelms battersea wimbleton tooting clapham camberwell peckham and deptford and i must therefore quit the ample subject and come to southwark a suburb to rather than a part of london but of which this may be said with justice that it would be a royal city were not london by  to give you a brief description of southwark it might be called a long street of about nine miles in length as it is now built on eastward reaching from vauxhall to london bridge and from the bridge to deptford and up to deptford bridge which parts it from greenwich all the way winding and turning as the river does except only in that part which reaches from cuckoldspoint to deptford which winds somewhat more than the river  in the center which is opposite to the bridge it is thickened with buildings and may be reckoned near a mile broad viz from the bridge to the end of kentstreet and blackmanstreet and about the mint  the borough of southwark is exceeding populous take it as it was anciently bounded it contained nine parishes but as it is now extended and joins with deptford it contains eleven large parishes  the first thing we meet with considerable is at the springgarden just at the corner where the road turns away to go from vauxhall turnpike toward newington there are the remains of the lines cast up in the time of the romans which were repaired in the civil wars as a fortification to this part of the town at the corner was a very large bastion or fort which commanded the pass on that side and farther on at the corner of st georgesfields by the ducking pond was another the water of what is now called the ducking pond still appears to have been the moat to the fort and the lines are still so high and undemolished that it would be no difficult matter to repair and perfect them again  that this was formerly a roman camp or station is plain from the many roman urns and coins opera tessellata and other antiquities which have been frequently dug up hereabouts and as there are pretty good authorities of ancient london lying on the south side of the thames it is but a reasonable conjecture that these lines were cast up and fortified to prevent the incursions of the britons into kent for the military way crossed the river at the horseferry at lambeth from thence proceeded to vauxhall then turned round to the ducking pond went on to the windmill in st georgesfields where it crossed the road to the end of kentstreet where there was a very strong fortification of stone the foundations of which were dug up in the year      this ran cross a garden about a quarter of a mile from the stonesend in digging up of this foundation there appeared two ancient pillars of a large gate upon each of them had been placed heads with two faces curiously cut in stone one of which was taken up but the other lying in a quicksand from whence the springs flowed out pretty freely was rendered more difficult to be taken up and the curiosity of the people being not very great they contented themselves with getting up one of the heads which was placed over the gardeners door where it remained for several years until it was known to the learned dr woodward who purchased it and kept it in his valuable collection of curiosities these lines were drawn from hence to the grange near bermondseystreet where you see another fort so plain and so undemolished the grass now growing over the works and though on the bastion itself there is frequently corn sowed that it is almost as visible as it was when it was first thrown down by the direction of these lines it is very manifest that southwark was once well fortified for these lines seem to have been thrown up from the thames at lambeth quite round to the thames at deptford which takes in the whole extent on the land and the thames was a barrier on the other side  a farther description of southwark i refer till i come to speak of london as one general appellation for the two cities of london and westminster for all the borough of southwark and all the buildings and villages included within the bills of mortality make but one london in the general appellation i am etc  letter v containing a description of part of the county of middlesex part of hants and the county of wilts etc sir as i came down from kingston in my last circuit by the south bank of the thames on the surrey side of the river so i go up to hampton court now on the north bank and on the middlesex side which i mention because as the sides of the country bordering on the river lie parallel so the beauty of the country the pleasant situations the splendour of innumerable fine buildings noblemens and gentlemens houses and citizens retreats are so equal a match to what i had described on the other side that one knows not to which to give the preference but as i must speak of them again when i come to write of the county of middlesex which i have now purposely omitted i pass them over here except the palace of hampton only which i mentioned in middlesex for the reasons above  hampton court lies on the north bank of the river thames about two small miles from kingston it was built by cardinal wolsey and fell to the crown when the king seized his effects and estate as did also whitehall another house of the cardinals building  whoever knew hampton court before it was begun to be rebuilt or altered by the late king william must acknowledge it was a very complete palace then and fit for a king and though it might not according to the modern method of building or of gardening pass for a thing exquisitely fine yet it showed a situation exceedingly capable of improvement and of being made one of the most delightful palaces in europe  this her majesty queen mary was so sensible of that while the king had ordered the pulling down the old apartments and building them up in that most beautiful form which we see them now appear in her majesty impatient of enjoying so agreeable a retreat fixed upon a building formerly made use of chiefly for landing from the river and therefore called the water gallery here she ordered all the little neat curious things to be done which suited her own convenience and made it the pleasantest little place within doors that could possibly be made though its situation would not allow it to stand after the great building was finished  the queen had here her gallery of beauties being the pictures at full length of the principal ladies in her retinue her majestys apartments for her private retreat only were exquisitely furnished and there were among the furniture several curious pieces of her own work  the ground on the southwest side of the building has received many alterations since the pulling down of the watergallery which stood before this handsome front of the house and intercepted the prospect of it from the river this spot was then laid out into small enclosures surrounded with tall hedges to break the violence of the winds and render them proper for the reception of such exotic plants in summer as were removed out of the conservatories during that season in each of these places is contrived a basin which is constantly supplied with water for the support of these plants in dry weather and as these are situated near the great apartments most of the plants may be viewed from the windows and the lower part of the house under the great apartments being contrived for a greenhouse the plants need not be carried far when they are removed out or into the conservatory which was very properly contrived by the designers  at the west end of this spot was a large hothouse for the maintaining such tender exotic plants as require a large share of warmth to preserve them in this climate of all these parts of gardening queen mary was so very fond that she allowed a handsome salary to dr plukenet a very learned botanist for overlooking and registering the curious collection of plants which were then in that garden but since the death of that queen these things have been so much neglected that very few of the most curious plants are now in being there which is much to be lamented for however the taste for this part of gardening may have with reason been neglected by private persons yet surely at a royal palace all these things should be kept up in the utmost magnificence as an encouragement to ingenuity and for the honor of the kingdom this taste was by lewis xiv of france carried to a very great height and had the persons employed by that prince been so well acquainted with the construction of these conservatories as many of the english are at this day we might have expected in his royal gardens to have seen most of the curious plants in the known parts of the world  here stand advanced on two pedestals of stone two marble vases or flowerpots of exquisite workmanship the one done by an englishman and the other by a german it is hard to say which is the best performance though the doing of it was a kind of trial of skill between them but it gives us room without any partiality to say they were both masters of their art  the parterre on that side descends from the terracewalk by steps and on the left a terrace goes down to the waterside overlooking the garden on the eastward front and affords a most pleasant prospect  this part of the garden was at first laid out in a parterre of scrollwork in box which was not only very costly at first making but was also very expensive in keeping constantly clipped which together with the ill scent which frequently reached to the royal apartments occasioned its being demolished and the ground disposed into another form and if at the same time all the shorn evergreen trees had been thrown out and a finer disposition made of the ground it would have much better corresponded with the noble apartments which overlook it than it does at present  on the north side of the house where the chapel and some part of the old buildings required to be covered from view the ground was laid out in a wilderness with a labyrinth surrounded by high espalier hedges and this was at that time thought one of the finest disposed parts of the garden but as the whole contrivance of the plantations is in regular strait walks bounded on each side by tall clipped hedges which divide the whole ground into angular quarters to every person of taste it must be very far from affording any pleasure since nothing can be more disagreeable than to be immured between hedges so as to have the eye confined to a strait walk and the beauty of the trees growing in the quarters entirely secluded from the eye and at the same time as you are walking in this unmeaning plantation you are denied the benefit of shade by being confined to these regular walks where it would be deemed an unpardonable fault to suffer the neighboring trees to diffuse their branches over these shorn hedges so that in the midst of a wood a person may faint for shade in a sultry day the air being excluded from these walks by the taller trees in the quarters and pent up air is much more troublesome in hot weather than the heat of the sun in the most open exposed plain  as this wilderness lies opposite to bushypark so there was designed a grand entrance through it to the palace fronting the gates of the park where two large pillars were erected to support a magnificent iron gate which was designed to have been put up there but how it came to be left unfinished and the pitiful low gates which by no means correspond with the pillars put in the place i could never learn  the house itself is every way answerable on the outside to the beautiful prospect and the two fronts are the largest and beyond comparison the finest of the kind in england the great stairs go up from the second court of the palace on the righthand and lead you to the south prospect  king william brought into england and placed here in a gallery built purposely for them the famous cartoons as they are called which are five pieces of such paintings as are not to be matched in europe it is reported but with what truth i know not that the late french king offered  00000 louis dors for these pictures the king brought a great many other fine pieces to england and from him the love of fine paintings so universally spread itself among the nobility and persons of figure all over the kingdom that it is incredible what collections have been made by english gentlemen since that time and how all europe has been romaged as we may say for pictures to bring over hither where for twenty years together they brought in vast profit to such as collected them for sale but the rates are abated since and we are now glutted with the copies and frauds of the dutch and flemish painters who have imposed grossly upon us  queen mary lived not to see this palace completely finished and it is said king william designed to have made it more capacious and noble had he lived  after the death of king william hampton court seemed in a manner neglected it is an observation made by some that hampton court has ever since the time of king charles i been favored by every alternate prince king charles i delighting in country retirements took great pleasure here and had he lived had purposed to improve it considerably but it became at last one of his prisons  king charles ii may well be said to have a dislike to the place for the treatment his royal father met with there and particularly as cromwell afterward made it his summer residence he therefore chose windsor and bestowed a vast sum in beautifying the castle there which brought it to the perfection we see it in at this day some few alterations excepted made in the time of king william  king james took but little delight in retired palaces his bent and taste inclining another way but king william fixed upon hampton court and improved it as beforementioned  queen anne being taken up for one part of her reign in her kind regards to the prince her spouse was obliged to consult his health and reside where that confined him which for the most part was at kensington where he died but her majesty always discovered her delight for windsor where she chose the little house as twas called opposite to the castle and frequently took the air in her chaise in the parks and forest  in the reign of king george i hampton court came into request again  from hampton court i directed my course for a journey into the southwest part of england and to take up my beginning where i concluded my last i crossed to chertsey on the thames a town i mentioned before from whence crossing the black desert of bagshot i took in my way to hampshire ockingham in berkshire lying on the skirts of windsor forest it is a pretty large town and has a wellfrequented market and a good markethouse in the middle it is governed by an alderman recorder and burgesses has a free school and likewise an hospital with a chaplain belonging to it it carries on a good trade in silk stockens and cloth  from hence i fell down toward basingstoke which is situate in the midst of woods and rich fertile pastures the country round about is spread with the houses of the nobility and gentry a little before we came to the town we passed by a house built out of the ruins and on the site of old basinghouse a famous fortress in the time of the civil wars belonging to the then marquis of winchester ancestor of the duke of bolton  this house garrisoned by a resolute band of old soldiers under the command of the marquis was a great curb to the parliament party throughout that whole war till after a vigorous defense it was taken and the brave marquis in it by cromwell who in revenge for the obstinate resistance it made put almost all the garrison to the sword and burnt down the noble fabric to the ground which he said was fitter for the residence of an emperor than a subject the present house is in no wise equal to the magnificence which fame gives to the ancient house whose strength of building was such as to resist the battery of cannon in several attacks it is incredible what booty the garrison of this place picked up lying as they did just on the great western road where they intercepted the carriers plundered the wagons and suffered nothing to pass to the great interruption of the trade of the city of london  basingstoke is a corporation and a large populous town it has a good market for corn especially barley as there are a great many maltsters there some few years ago a manufacture of making druggets and shalloons was set up here and as successfully carried on which employs a great number of poor people  near this town a bloody battle was fought in     between the saxons and danes  from this town the great western road goes on to whitchurch a mean town which however has a market and is governed by a mayor northeast of which lies kingsclere a pleasant market town on the oxford road from basingstoke it was anciently famous for having been the seat of the saxon kings and from thence takes its name  but i had like to have forgot the famous vindomia or silchester which is situated in hants on the borders of berkshire and is famous for its antiquity  its situation is very high hid with wood many were the roman roads which met here though now scarce any which is one reason why it is so little known another is its want of inns for the accommodation of travelers for aldermaston a pretty neat village beautifully situated which is three miles distant is the nearest town where lodging is to be found the walls of this city are standing more or less perfect quite round perhaps the most entire in the roman empire especially the northside which is a most agreeable sight it is composed of flint and ragstone there was a broad ditch quite round and now almost impassable and full of springs hereandthere roman bricks are left in the walls though on the outside they are of a considerable height yet the ground within is so raised as nearly to be equal to the top and that quite round covered with oaks and other timbertrees of no mean bulk constantius the son of constantine the great is said to have built it and sowed corn in the track of the walls as an omen of their perpetuity now indeed the whole city is arable and in the fields roman bricks and other relics are scattered and coins daily found it has only one farmhouse and a church the reverend and learned mr betham late minister of this place is buried under the north wall of the chancel withoutside within is another monument of a person of quality they both were drowned in fleetditch a spring rises from under the wall of the churchyard  five hundred feet without the city on the northeast side is a great curiosity which the vulgar think was a castle but in reality an amphitheatre in all respects like that of dorchester this noble antiquity has from time immemorial been a yard for cattle and a wateringpond so that it is a wonder their trampling has not defaced it much more than it has my resolution being to take in my way what i had passed by before i was obliged to go off to the left hand to alresford and winchester  alresford was a flourishing market town and though it had no great trade and very little if any manufactures yet what is very remarkable there was no collection made in the town for the poor nor any low enough to take alms of the parish  but this happy circumstance which so distinguished alresford from all her neighbors was brought to an end in    0 when by a sudden and surprising fire the whole town with both the church and markethouse was reduced to a heap of rubbish and except a few poor huts at the remotest ends of the town not a house left standing the town is since very handsomely rebuilt and the neighboring gentlemen contributed largely to the relief of the people especially by sending in timber toward their building  here is a very large pond or lake of water kept up to a head by a strong battre deau or dam which it is said was made by the romans and is part of the great roman highway which leads from winchester to alton and as supposed on to london though we nowhere see any remains of it except between winchester and alton and chiefly between this town and the last mentioned  near this town a little northwest the duke of bolton has another seat which though not large is a very handsome beautiful palace and the gardens not only very exact but very finely situate the prospect and vistas noble and great and the whole very well kept his grace has no less than three seats almost within sight of one another viz abbotstone basing and hawkwood  from hence at the end of seven miles over the downs we come to the very ancient city of winchester called in british caer gwent which signifies the white town from the chalky hills near it not only the great church which is so famous all over europe and has been so much talked of but even the whole city has at a distance a venerable and ancient face and yet here are many modern buildings too and some very handsome as the college schools with the episcopal palace built by bishop morley since the civil wars the old palace of the bishop having been ruined by that known churchincendiary sir william waller and his crew of plunderers who if my information is not wrong destroyed more monuments of the dead and defaced more churches than all the roundheads in england beside  this church and the schools also are accurately described by several writers especially by the monasticon where their antiquity and original is fully set forth the outside of the church is as plain and coarse as if the founders had abhorred ornaments there is neither statue nor a niche for a statue to be seen on all the outside no carved work no spires towers pinacles balustrades or any thing but mere walls buttresses windows and quoins necessary to the support and order of the building it has no steeple but a short tower covered flat as if the top of it had fallen down and it had been covered in haste to keep the rain out till they had time to build it up again  but the inside of the church has many very good things in it and worth observation it was for some ages the buryingplace of many english saxon and norman kings whose remains the impious soldiers in the civil wars threw against the painted glass the relics of some of these at the repair of the church were collected by bishop fox and being put together into six large wooden chests lined with lead were again interred at the foot of the great wall in the choir three on one side and three on the other with an account whose bones are in each chest viz rufus egbert adulphus edredus edmundus canutus and those of queen emma queen mary was here married to philip of spain the chair used in that ceremony is still preserved in the body of the church is a pretty cross of gothic workmanship but ill repaired the steps ascending to the choir make a fine show having the statues of king james i and his son charles in copper finely cast the first on the right hand and the other on the left as you go up to the choir  the choir is said to be the longest in england the ornaments of the choir are the effects of the bounty of several bishops the fine altar the noblest in england by much was given by bishop morley the roof and the coat of arms of the saxon and norman kings by bishop fox and the fine throne for the bishop in the choir was given by bishop mew in his lifetime and it was well it was for if he had ordered it by will there is reason to believe it had never been done that reverend prelate notwithstanding he enjoyed so rich a bishopric scarce leaving money enough behind him to pay for his coffin  there are a great many persons of rank buried in this church besides the saxon kings mentioned above particularly here lies as they told us under a gray marble lucius the first christian king of this island who died   0 years after christ and as is pretended founded the church where the cathedral now stands there are also the monuments of bishop fox founder of corpus christi college oxon bishop wainfleet founder of magdalen college in the same university in regard to whose memory the said college keep his monument in neat repair he is represented lying at length with a heart in his hand the tomb of william of wickham the magnificent founder of this cathedral very richly gilt just under the altar lies a son of william the conqueror without any monument and behind the altar under a very fine monument lies the famous lord treasurer weston earl of portland lord high treasurer of england in the reign of king charles i his effigies is in copper armor at full length with his head raised on three cushions of the same and is a very magnificent work there is also a very fine monument of cardinal beaufort in his cardinals robes and hat  the monument of sir john cloberry deserves notice more for his story than for any thing extraordinary in the figure this gentleman was the person solely entrusted with the secret of the restoration of king charles ii as the messenger that passed between general monk on one hand and mr montague and others entrusted by king cha ii on the other by which service sir john then a private musqueteer only raised himself to the honor of a knight with the reward of a good estate from the bounty of the king  it may not be amiss to say a word or two of the famous william of wickham who built the body of the church  he was a courtier before a bishop and though he had no large share of learning he was a great promoter of it his natural genius was much beyond his acquired parts and his skill in politics beyond his ecclesiastic knowledge he is said to have put his master king edward iii to whom he was secretary of state upon the two great projects which made his reign so glorious viz   upon setting up his claim to the crown of france which brought on the war with france in which that prince was three times victorious in battle   upon instituting the order of the garter in which he obtained the honor for the bishops of winchester to be always prelates of the order as an appendix to the bishopric and he himself was the first the ensigns of that honor are joined with his episcopal ornaments in the robing of his effigies on the monument above  to the great honor of this bishop there are other foundations of his as much to his fame as that of this church of which i shall speak in their places but particularly the college in this city which is a noble foundation indeed the building consists of two large courts in which are the lodgings for the masters and seventy scholars and in the center a very noble chapel beyond that in the second court are the schools with a large cloister beyond them and some enclosures laid open for the diversion of the scholars there also is a great hall where the scholars dine in the chapel window belonging to the college is good painted glass of imagery in the middle of the cloisters is the library a strong stone building well contrived to prevent fire  in digging the foundation of a house near the college in a stone coffin was found a stone set in a gold ring with this inscription in very odd characters supposed to be about the sixth century domino comite fidele meo i e the lord being my guide and faithful companion  over the door of the school stands a very good statue of the founder made by cibber whose workmanship are the two excellent figures over bethlehemgate the father of that excellent comedian colley cibber poetlaureat  the scholars have exhibitions at a certain time of continuance here if they please to study in the new college at oxford built by the same noble benefactor  the clergy here live very elegantly in the close belonging to the cathedral where besides the bishops palace mentioned above are very good houses and very handsomely built for the prebendaries canons and other dignitaries of this church the deanery is a very pleasant dwelling the gardens are large and the river runs through them but the floods in winter sometimes much incommode them  this school has fully answered the end of the founder who though he was no great scholar resolved to erect a house for making the ages to come more learned than those that went before and many learned and great men have been educated here  as the city stands in a vale on the bank and at the conjunction of two small rivers so the country rising every way but just as the course of the water keeps the valley open you must necessarily as you go out of the gates go up hill every way but when once ascended you come to the most charming plains and most pleasant country of that kind in england which continues with very small intersections of rivers and valleys for above fifty miles as i shall observe more particularly in the sequel of this journey  at the west gate of this city was anciently a castle in which it is said the saxon kings kept their court which however is doubtful and must be meant of the west saxons only as to the tale of king arthurs round table and his two dozen of knights which table being one piece of wood supported by marble pillars they still show in the town hall said to be part of the said castle as a piece of antiquity of   00 years standing and has as they pretend the names of the said knights in saxon characters and yet such as no man can read all this story i see no ground to give the least credit to  where this castle was said to stand the late king charles ii marked out a very noble design which had he lived would certainly have made that part of the country the resort of the quality and gentry of all parts of the kingdom for the country hereabout far exceeds that of newmarketheath for all kinds of sport and diversion  the building was so far prosecuted that the front next the city was carried up to the roof and covered but what was further intended was not proceeded on there was a street of houses designed from the gate of the palace down to the town but it was never begun to be built the park marked out was exceeding large near ten miles in circumference and ended west upon the open downs in view of stockbridge  this house with a royal revenue was afterward settled by parliament as an appenage upon prince george of denmark for his life in case he had outlived the queen but his royal highness dying before her majesty all hope of seeing this design perfected or the house finished is now vanished and his late majesty king george i made a present to the duke of bolton of the fine pillars of italian marble which were to have supported its staircase  there are several other public edifices in this city and in the neighborhood which i have not room to describe as the hospitals and building adjoining near the eastgate toward the north is a piece of an old monastery undemolishd and which is still preserved to the religion being the residence of some private roman catholic gentlemen where they have an oratory and as they say live still according to the rules of st benedict this building is called hidehouse and as they live very usefully and to the highest degree obliging among their neighbors they meet with no obstruction from any body  beyond the river eastward is a high hill called st giless from an hospital whose ruins only are now visible and a churchyard seeming to have been a camp besides the marks of bastions and works of fortifications in the modern style here waltheof earl of northumberland and huntingdon was beheaded by order of king william i whose body was carried to crowland and said to work miracles  winchester is a place of no trade other than is naturally occasioned by the inhabitants of the city and neighboring villages one with another here is no manufacture no navigation there was indeed an attempt to make the river navigable from southampton and it was once made practicable but it never answered the expense so as to give encouragement to the undertakers to keep it up  here is a great deal of good company and abundance of gentry being in the neighborhood it adds to the sociableness of the place the clergy also here are generally speaking rich and very numerous  the magnificent hospital called holycross on the south of this city at a miles distance on the road to southampton is worth notice it was founded by bishop blois the church is in the form of a cross and has a large square tower every traveller that knocks at the door of this house in his way and asks for it claims the relief of a piece of white bread and a cup of beer and this donation is still continued a quantity of good beer is set apart every day to be given away and what is left is distributed to other poor but none of it kept to next day  how the revenues of this hospital which should maintain the master and thirty private gentlemen whom they call fellows but ought to call brothers are now reduced to maintain only fourteen while the master lives in a figure equal to the best gentleman in the county would be well worth the inquiry of a proper visitor if such can be named it is a thing worthy of notice when public charities designed for the relief of the poor are imbezzled by the rich and turned to the support of luxury and pride  an infirmary is established lately in this town by voluntary subscription after the laudable examples of those of st jamess westminster and st georges at hydepark corner and has met with great success being principally owing to the zeal and pains of the reverend doctor alured clarke i have not room to say all that might be said on this head and so must refer you to the account given by the doctor of the rise and progress rules and orders of this excellent institution  i made an excursion from winchester to see the ancient town of romsey noted for its delightful situation having all round it woods cornfieldsd meadows and pastures the river and rivulets which are many have a rapid course the town was questionless roman and its name declares as much the church is a noble pile of architecture arched with stone in form of a cross with semicircular chapels in the upper angles the churches hereabouts called minsters as wimburnminster in the neighboring county of dorset were built by the saxon kings as soon as they became christian at the west end is the piece of an old wall probably belonging to the nunnery built here by king edgar  returning to winchester we struck up northwest and came to stokebridge a poor sorry borough town noted for its corruption in electing members of parliament and being a great thoroughfare on the southwestern road it has however a great many good inns and as well provided as any on that road though it has no market  the ingenious sir richard steel once represented this town in parliament and though he was powerfully opposed yet carried his election by a stratagem which made all the women of his side having made a great entertainment for the burgesses and their wives and after having been very free and facetious among them he took up a large apple and stuck it full of guineas and declared it the prize of that man whose wife should be first brought tobed after that day nine months this occasioned a great deal of mirth and what with the entertainment and with the hopes of getting the prize the good women prevailed on their husbands to vote for sir richard whom they to this day commemorate and as it is said once made a strong push to get a standing order of the corporation made that no man should be received as a candidate for that borough who did not offer himself upon the same terms  still rising northward we arrived at andover a mayor market and borough town and also noted for being a great thoroughfare on the direct western road as well from newbury to salisbury as from london to taunton and all the manufacturing towns of somersetshire whereby it is greatly enriched and is a thriving handsome well built and populous town it is very healthy and pleasantly situated just on the borders of those downs which are commonly though not properly called salisburyplain near this town is a village called weyhill where the open down country begins and here upon these downs is the famous weyhill where the greatest fair for sheep in the nation is kept and principally of ewes for storesheep for the farmers of the counties of berks oxford bucks bedford hertford middlesex kent surrey and sussex who send for them to this place  from andover we bent our way toward wiltshire by quarleyhills on the west side of which are the remains of a great fortification consisting of two outward trenches and other works of great strength and then entering that county and leaving luggershall a small hamlettown noted only for having been formerly the castle of jeoffrey fitzpiers on the north of us we came to ambresbury a very ancient town pretty large standing on the river avon and having several good inns but its market is much decayed and almost discontinued it is said to have taken its name from ambrius who founded here a monastery of benedictines long before the coming in of the saxons who destroyed it or from aurelius ambrose a british prince who rebuilt it and filled it with  00 monks to pray for the souls of those noble britons who were slain by the treachery of the perfidious hengist the saxon who massacred here  00 of the ancient british nobility in cold blood whom he had invited with their king vortigern to meet him there without arms to treat of a league of amity and rejoice together  the treacherous saxon saved only the king whom he obliged to give him near a third of his kingdom eastward before he would set him at liberty  the monastery at ambresbury was converted into a nunnery and eleanor king henry iiis queen retired and died here whose example induced the princess mary king edwards second daughter and thirteen noblemens daughters to take the veil together in this house  the stupendous piece of antiquity called stonehenge deserves our particular notice and i shall therefore borrow from dr stukeleys piece lately published entitled stonehenge a temple restored to the british druids the following brief account and description of it referring to that elaborate performance itself which well deserves the attention of the learned and curious for a more satisfactory account and for the doctors reasons for his hypothesis which we think he has made out with as much certainty as the nature of the subject will admit  the wiltshire downs or salisburyplain as this gentleman observes is one of the most delightful spots in britain and stonehenge by the extravagant grandeur of the work has attracted the admiration of all ages mr camden himself says of it that he was grieved that the founders of it could not be traced out but dr stukeley has very happily made it more than probable that it was a temple of the british druids and the cathedral as it may be called the chief of all their temples in this island  the stones of which it was composed are not factitious for that would have been a greater wonder than to bring them together to the place where they are but undoubtedly were brought fifteen or sixteen miles off prodigious as they are from those called the gray weathers near abury on marlborough downs all the greater stones except the altar being of that sort for that being designed to resist fire is of a still harder kind it is a composition of crystals of red green and white colors cemented by nature with opaque granules of flinty or stony matter the stone at the upper end of the cell which is fallen down and broken in half the doctor tells us weighs above forty tons and would require above   0 oxen to draw it and yet is not the heaviest stone neither judge then what a stupendous labor it was to bring together so many miles such a number as were used here and this has induced many inconsiderate people to imagine that the founders had an art of making stone which has been lost for so many ages  the present name is saxon though the work is beyond all comparison older signifying a hanging rod or pole i e a gallows from the hanging parts architraves or rather imposts and pendulous rocks are still in yorkshire called henges but the ancient name was most probably the ambres for which our learned author to whom we refer gives very satisfactory reasons and hence the adjacent town of ambresbury which i have taken notice of has its name  stonehenge stands not upon the summit of a hill but near it however at half a mile distance the appearance is awful but as you come up the avenue in the northeast of it which side is most perfect the greatness of its contour fills the eye in an astonishing manner it is enclosed in a circular ditch which having passed we ascend thirtyfive yards before we come at the work the stones are chisselld and far from rude though not cut to that preciseness as the ruins in old rome and the inside of them had more pains taken with them then the outside for so as our author observes the polite architects of the eastern world were wont to do not like our london builders who carve every moulding and crowd every ornament they borrow from books on the outside of the public structures that they may the more commodiously gather the dust and smoke  when you enter the building whether on foot or horseback and cast your eyes around upon the yawning ruins you are struck into an ecstatick reverie which no one can describe and they only can be sensible of who feel it other buildings fall by piecemeal but here a single stone is a ruin yet is there as much undemolishd as enables us sufficiently to recover its form when in its most perfect state when we advance farther the dark part of the ponderous imposts over our heads the chasms of sky between the jambs of the cell the odd construction of the whole and the greatness of every part surprises if you look upon the perfect part you fansy entire quarries mounted up into the air if upon the rude havoc below you see as it were the bowels of a mountain turned inside out  the whole work being of a circular form is about  0  feet in diameter from out to out the intention of the founders was this the whole circle was to consist of thirty stones each stone to be this cubit is the old hebrew phoenician or egyptian cubit and what the founders of stonebenge went by and amounts to twenty inches fourfifths english measure four cubits broad each interval two cubits thirty times four cubits is twice sixty thirty times two cubits is sixty so that thrice sixty cubits completes a circle whose diameter is sixty a stone being four cubits broad and two thick is double the interval which is a square of two cubits change the places between the stones and their intervals and it will make a good groundplot for a circular portico of greek or roman work though these bodies of stone which are in the nature of imposts or cornices never had or were intended to have any mouldings upon them like greek and roman works they are wrought perfectly plain and suitable to the stones that support them and the chisseling of the upright stones is only above ground for the four or five feet in length below ground is left in the original natural form the upright stones are made very judiciously to diminish a little every way so that attop they are but three cubits and a half broad and so much nearer as to suffer their imposts to meet a little over the heads of the uprights both withinside and without by which means the uprights are less liable to fall or swerve  it is to be feared some indiscreet people have been digging about the great entrance with ridiculous hopes of finding treasure and so have loosened the chalky foundation for the upper edge of the impost overhangs no less than two feet seven inches which is very considerable in a height of eighteen the whole breadth at the foundation is but two feet and an half and this noble front is now chiefly kept up by the masonry of the mortaise and tendon of the imposts  the contrivance of the founders in making mortaises and tenons between the upright stones and the imposts is admirable but so contrary to any practice of the romans that it alone oversets their claim to the work these tenons and mortaifes of this outer circle are round and fit one another very aptly they are ten inches and one half in diameter and resemble half an egg rather than an hemisphere and so effectually keep both uprights and imposts from luxation that they must have been thrown down with great difficulty and labor the whole height of upright and impost is ten cubits and an half the upright nine the impost over the grand entrance is in its middle length eleven feet ten inches and so is larger than the rest and it is also a little broader measuring on the inside  of the outer circle of stonehenge which in its perfection consisted of sixty stones thirty uprights and thirty imposts there are seventeen uprights left standing eleven of which remain continuous by the grand entrance five imposts upon them one upright at the back of the temple leans upon a stone of the inner circle there are six more lying upon the ground whole or in pieces so that twentyfour out of thirty are still visible at the place there is but one impost more in its proper place and but two lying upon the ground so that twentytwo are carried off hence our author infers this temple was not defaced when christianity prevailed but that some rude hands carried the stones away for other uses so much for the larger circle of stones with imposts  as to the lesser circle which never had any imposts it is somewhat more than eight feet from the inside of the outward one and consists of forty lesser stones forming with the outward circles as it were a circular portico a most beautiful work and of a pretty effect they are flat parallelograms as those of the outer circle and their general and designed proportion is two cubits or two and an half as suitable stones were found they are a cubit thick and four and one half high which is more than seven feet this was their stated proportion being every way the half of the upper uprights these stones are of a harder composition than the rest as the better to resist violence as they are lesser and they have sufficient fastenings in the ground there are but nineteen of the forty left but eleven of them are standing in situ five in one place contiguous three in another two in another  the walk between these two circles which is  00 feet in circumference is very noble and very delightful  the adytum or cell into which we may suppose none but the upper order of druids were to enter is composed of certain compages of stones which our author calls trilithons because made each of two upright stones with an impost at top and there are manifestly five of these remaining three of which are entire two are ruined in some measure but the stones remain in situ it is a magnificent niche twentyseven cubits long and as much broad measuring in the widest place the stones that compose it are really stupendous their height breadth and thickness are enormous and to see so many of them placed together in a nice and critical figure with exactness to consider as it were not a pillar of one stone but a whole wall a side an end of a temple of one stone to view them curiously create such a motion in the mind as words cannot express one very remarkable particular in the constitution of this adytum has escaped all observers before our author which is this as this part is composed of trilithons set two and two on each side and one right before they rise in height and beauty of the stones from the lower end of the adytum to the upper end that is the two hithermost trilithons corresponding or those next the grand entrance on the right hand and on the left are exceeded in height by the two next in order and those are exceeded by that behind the altar in the upper end of this choir and their heights respectively are thirteen cubits fourteen cubits fifteen cubits  the imposts of these are all of the same height and ten cubits may be supposed their medium measure in length the artifice of the tenons and mortaises of these trilithons and their imposts what conformity they bear to that of the outer circle is exceedingly pretty every thing being done very geometrically and as would best answer every purpose from plain and simple principles and it is wonderful that in the management of such prodigious stones as these are fixed in the ground and rammd in like posts there is not more variation in the height distance etc  of these greater stones of the adytum as is observed before there are none wanting being all on the spot ten uprights and five cornices the trilithon first on the left hand is entire in situ but vastly decayed especially the cornice in which such deep holes are corroded that in some places the daws make their nests in them the next trilithon on the left is entire composed of three most beautiful stones the cornice happening to be of a very durable english marble has not been much impaired by the weather our author took a walk on the top of it but thought it a frightful situation the trilithon of the upper end was an extraordinary beauty but probably through the indiscretion of some body digging between them and the altar the noble impost is dislodged from its airy seat and fallen upon the altar where its huge bulk lies unfracturd the two uprights that supported it are the most delicate stones of the whole work they were our author thinks above thirty feet long and well chisselld finely taperd and proportioned in their dimensions that southward is broken in two lying upon the altar the other still stands entire but leans upon one of the stones of the inward oval the rootend or unhewn part of both is raised somewhat above ground the trilithon toward the west is entire except that some of the end of the impost is fallen clean off and all the upper edge is very much diminished by time the last trilithon on the right hand of the entrance into the adytum has suffered much the outer upright being the jamb of the entrance is still standing the other upright and impost are both fallen forwards into the adytum and broke each into three pieces as supposed from digging near it that which is standing has a cavity in it which two or three persons may it in warm from the weather  stonehenge is composed of two circles and two ovals respectively concentrick the stones that form these ovals rise in height as nearer the upper end of the adytum and their mediate measure is four cubits and four palms they are of a much harder kind than the larger stones in the lesser circle the founders no doubt intending that their lesser bulk should be compensated by solidity of these there are only six remaining upright the stumps of two are left on the south side by the altar one lies behind the altar dug up or thrown down by the fall of the upright there one or two were probably thrown down by the fall of the upright of the first trilithon on the right hand a stump of another remains by the upright there still standing  the whole number of stones may be thus computed the great oval consists of ten uprights the inner with the altar of twenty the great circle of thirty the inner of forty which are one hundred upright stones five imposts of the great oval thirty of the great circle the two stones on the bank of the area the stone lying within the entrance of the area and that standing without there seems to be another lying on the ground by the vallum of the court directly opposite to the entrance of the avenue all added together make just one hundred and forty stones the number of which stonehenge a whole temple is composed behold the solution of the mighty problem the magical spell which has so long perplexed the vulgar is broken they think it an ominous thing to count the true number of the stones and whoever does so shall certainly die after it  as to the altar it is laid toward the upper end of the adytum at present flat on the ground and squeezed into it as it were by the weight of the ruins upon it it is a kind of blue coarse marble such as comes from derbyshire and laid upon tombs in our churches and churchyards our author believes its breadth is two cubits three palms and that its first intended length was ten cubits equal to the breadth of the trilithon before which it lies but it is very difficult to come at its true length it is twenty inches thick a just cubit and has been squared it lies between the two centres that of the compasses and that of the string leaving a convenient space quite round it no doubt as much as was necessary for this ministration  the heads of oxen deer and other beasts have been found upon digging in and about stonehenge undoubted relics of sacrifices together with woodashes mr camden says mens bones have been found hereabouts he means in the adjacent barrows and such our author saw thrown out by the rabbets which have been brought hither of late years and by their burrowing threaten these noble ruins as the greedy plough more and more invades the neighboring plain  but eternally as he observes is to be lamented the loss of that tablet of tin which was found at this place in the time of henry viii inscribed with many letters but in so strange a character that neither sir thomas elliot a learned antiquary nor mr lilly first high master of st pauls school could make any thing out of and which no doubt was a memorial of the founders written by the druids and had it been preserved till now would have been an invaluable curiosity  in the year      as they were plowing by the barrows about normantonditch they found so large a quantity of excellent pewter as at a low price they sold for five pounds there are several of these ditches being very narrow which run across the downs which perhaps are boundaries of hundreds parishes etc these pewter plates might very possibly have been tablets with inscriptions but falling into such rude hands they could no more discern the writing than interpret it no doubt says dr stukeley this was some of the old british stannum which the tyrian hercules surnamed melcarthus first brought ex cassiteride insula or britain which hercules lived in abrahams time or soon after  mr webb tells us the duke of buckingham dug about stonehenge perhaps much to the prejudice of the work mr webb also did the like and found what he imagined was the corner of a thuribulum  mr hayward late owner of stonehenge likewise dug about it and found heads of oxen and other beasts bones and nothing else  dr stukeley himself in      dug on the inside of the altar about the middle four feet along the edge of the stone six feet forward toward the middle of the adytum at a foot deep he came to the solid chalk mixed with flints which had never been stirred the altar was exactly a cubitthick i e twenty inches fourfifths but broken in two or three pieces by the ponderous masses of the imposts and one upright stone of that trilithon which stood at the upper end of the adytum being fallen upon it hence appears the commodiousness of the foundation for this huge work they dug holes in the solid chalk which would of itself keep up the stones as firm as if a wall was built round them and no doubt but they rammd up the interstices with flints but he says he had too much regard to the work to dig anywhere near the stones he took up an oxs tooth above ground without the adytum on the right hand of the lowermost trilithon northward  the time our author assigns for the building of stonehenge is not long after cambysess invasion of egypt when he committed such horrid outrages there and made such dismal havoc with the priests and inhabitants in general that they dispersed themselves to all the parts of the world some as far as the east indies and some it is not questioned as far westward into britain and introduced some of their learning arts and religion among the druids and perhaps had a hand in this very work the only one where the stones are chisselld all other works of theirs being of rude stones untouched of the tool exactly after the patriarchal and jewish mode and therefore older than this and this conjecture is the more probable because at the time mentioned the phoenician trade was at its height which afforded a readier conveyance hither this was before the second temple at jerusalem was built before the grecians had any history  for farther particulars of this stupendous work and other curious matters relating and adjacent to it such as its antiquity before the time of the belgae the romans the saxons and danes of the wansdike of vespasians camp at ambresbury the introduction of the druids into britain which he puts about abrahams time its ancient name the ambres the water vases of stonehenge the avenue to it the cursus we must refer our readers to the work itself having already exceeded the narrow bounds to which the nature of our design confines us but this we may add that doubtless they had some method in former days in foreign countries as well as here to move heavier weights than we now find practicable how else did solomons workmen build the battlement or additional wall to support the precipice of mountmoriah on which the temple was erected which was all built of parian marble each stone being forty cubits long fourteen broad and eight cubits thick and so much for this celebrated temple of stonehenge  we shall now proceed to give some account of the famous barrows on these downs and we shall borrow from the same learned author the following curious particulars relating to them  the tops of all the hills or rather easy elevations round stonehenge are in a manner covered over with thse barrows which make an agreeable appearance adorning the bare downs with their figures this ring of barrows however reaches no farther than till you lose sight of the temple as we now make no doubt to call stonehenge or thereabouts many from the great number of these sepulchral tumuli here injudiciously conclude that there have been great battles upon the plain and that the slain are buried there but they are really no other than family buryingplaces set near this temple for the same reason as we bury in churchyards and consecrated ground  we may readily count fifty at a time in sight from the place especially in the evening when the sloping rays of the sun shine on the ground beyond them they are most of them of a very elegant belllike form and done with great nicety in general they are always upon elevated ground and in sight of the temple as we have said for they all regard it and are assuredly the single sepulchers of kings and great personages buried during a considerable space of time and in peace there are many groups of them together as if family burialplaces and the variety in them seems to indicate some preeminence in the persons interred most of them have little ditches around in many is a circular ditch  0 cubits in diameter with a very small tumulus in the center sixty or even  00 cubits is a very common diameter in the large barrows often they are set in rows and equidistant so as to produce a regular and pretty appearance and with some particular regard to the parts of the temple the avenues or the cursus upon every range of hills quite round stonehenge are successive groups of barrows for some miles and even that named kingbarrow by lord pembrokes park wall at wilton which our author calls the tomb of carvilius is set within view of stonehenge  in      the late lord pembroke opened a barrow in order to find the position of the body observed in those early days he pitched upon one of the double barrows where two are enclosed in one ditch he made a section from the top to the bottom an entire segment from center to circumference the composition was good earth quite through except a coat of chalk of about two feet thick covering it quite over under the turf hence it appears that the method of making these barrows was to dig up the turf for a great space round till the barrow was brought to its intended bulk then with the chalk dug out of the invironing ditch they powdered it all over and the notion of sanctity annexed to them forbad people trampling on them till perfectly settled and turfed over whence the neatness of their form to this day at the top or center of this barrow not above three feet under the surface my lord found the skeleton of the interred perfect of a reasonable size the head lying northward toward stonehenge  the year following by my lords order dr stukeley began upon another double barrow he began upon the lesser and made a large cut on the top from east to west after the turf he came to the layer of chalk as before then fine garden mould about three feet below the surface a layer of flints humouring the convexity of the barrow which are gathered from the surface of the downs in some places especially where it has been ploughed this being about a foot thick rested on a layer of soft mould another foot in which was enclosed an urn full of bones the urn was of unbaked clay of a dark reddish color crumbled into pieces it had been rudely wrought with small mouldings round the verge and other circular channels on the outside with several indentions between made with a pointed tool the bones had been burnt and crowded all together in a little heap not so much as a hatcrown would contain the collarbone and one side of the underjaw remaining very entire it appears to have been a girl of about fourteen years old by their bulk and the great quantity of female ornaments mixed with the bones as great numbers of glass beads of all sorts and of diverse colors most yellow one black many single many in long pieces notched between so as to resemble a string of beads and these were generally of a blue color there were many of amber of all shapes and sizes flat squares long squares round oblong little and great likewise many of earth of different shapes magnitude and color some little and white many large and flattish like a button others like a pully but all had holes to run a string through either through their diameter or sides many of the button sort seemed to have been covered with metal there being a rim worked in them wherein to turn the edge of the covering one of these was covered with a thin film of pure gold these were the young ladys ornaments and had all undergone fire so that what would easily consume fell topieces as soon as handled much of the amber burnt half through this person was a heroine for we found the head of her javelin in brass at bottom are two holes for the pin that fastened it to the staff besides there was a sharp bodkin round at one end square at the other where it went into the handle our author preserved whatever is permanent of these trinkets but recomposd the ashes of the illustrious defunct and covered them with earth leaving visible marks at top of the barrow having been opened to dissuade any other from again disturbing them and this was his practice in all the rest  he then opened the next barrow to it enclosed in the same ditch which he supposed the husband or father of this lady at    inches deep the mould ng mixed with chalk he came to the entire ton of a man the skull and all the bones ingly rotten and perished through length of time though this was a barrow of the latest sort as he ctured the body lay north and south the head to the north as that lord pembroke ed  next he went westward to a group of barrows  stonehenge bears eastnortheast here is a large barrow ditchd about but of an ancient make on that side next stonehenge are ten lesser small  were crowded together south of the great  barrow larger than those of the grup but not equalling the first it would seem that a man and his wife were buried in the two larger and that the rest were of their children or dependents one of the small ones  0 cubits in diameter he cut through with a pit nine feet in diameter to the surface of the natural chalk in the center of the barrow where was a little hole cut a childs body as it seems had been burnt here and covered up in that hole but through length of time consumed from three feet deep he found much woodashes soft and black as ink some little bits of an urn and black and red earth very rotten some small lumps of earth red as vermilion some flints burnt through toward the bottom a great quantity of ashes and burnt bones from this place he counted     barrows in sight  going from hence more southerly is a circular dishlike cavity  0 cubits in diameter dug in the chalk like a barrow reversed it is near a great barrow the least of the southwestern group this cavity is seven feet deep in the middle extremely well turned and out of it no doubt the adjacent barrow is dug the use of it seems to have been a place for sacrificing and feasting in memory of the dead as was the ancient custom it is all overgrown with that pretty shrub erica vulgaris then in flower and smelling like honey he made a large cross section in its center upon the cardinal points and found nothing but a bit of red earthen pot  he then dug up one of those he calls druids barrows a small tumulus enclosed in a large circular ditch stonehenge bears hence northeast he made a cross section ten feet each way three feet broad over its center upon the cardinal points at length he found a squarish hole cut in the solid chalk in the center of the tumulus it was three feet and an half i e two cubits long and near two feet broad i e one cubit pointing to stonehenge directly it was a cubit and an half deep from the surface this was the domus exilis plutonia covered with artificial earth not above a foot thick from the surface in this little grave he found all the burnt bones of a man but no signs of an urn the bank of the circular ditch is on the outide and is    cubits broad the ditch is six cubits broad the druids staff the area is  0 cubits in diameter the whole  00  he opened another of these of like dimensions next to that lord pembroke first opened south of stonehenge and found a burnt body in a hole in the chalk as before  in some other barrows he opened were found large burnt bones of horses and dogs along with human also of other animals as seemed of fowl hares boars deer goats or the like and in a great and very flat oldfashioned barrow west from stonehenge among such matters he found bits of red and blue marble chippings of the stones of the temple so that probably the interred was one of the builders homer tells of achilles slaying horses and dogs at the funeral of his friend patroclus  lord pembroke told the doctor of a brass sword dug up in a barrow here which was sent to oxford in that very old barrow near little ambresbury was found a very large brass weapon of  0 pounds weight like a poleax said to be given to colonel wyndham in the great long barrow farthest north from stonehenge which our author supposes to be an archdruids was found one of those brass instruments called celts which he thinks belonged to the druids wherewith they cut off the misleto mr stallard of ambresbury gave it to lord burlington now in sir hans sloanes cabinet    inches long they dug a cell in a barrow east of ambresbury and it was inhabited for some time there they saw all the bones of a horse we find evidently adds the doctor these ancient nations had the custom of burning their dead bodies probably before the name of rome so lacrymatories we read of in scripture antienter than greek or roman times psalm lvi   salisbury plains are certainly the most charming that can anywhere be seen the numerous flocks of sheep all around which way soever we turn are a fine sight it is ordinary for these flocks to contain from  000 to  000 each and several private farmers hereabouts have two or three such flocks  but it is more remarkable still how a great part of these downs comes by a new method of husbandry not only to be made arable but to bear plentiful crops of wheat though never known to our ancestors to be capable of any such thing nay they would probably have laughed at any one that had gone about to plough up the wild downs and hills which they thought only fit for sheepwalks but experience has made the present age wiser and more skilful in husbandry for by only folding the sheep upon those lands after they are turned up with the plough which generally goes within three or four inches of the solid rock of chalk they become abundantly fruitful and bear very good wheat as well as rye and barley i shall say more of this when i come to speak of the same practice farther in the country  this plain open country continues in length from winchester to salisbury    miles from thence to dorchester    miles thence to weymouth six miles so that they lie near  0 miles in length and breadth they reach also in some places fron    to  0 miles those who would make any practicable guess at the number of sheep which usually feed on these downs may take it from a calculation made as i was told at dorchester that there were  00000 sheep fed within the circumference of six miles around that town  as we passed this open plain country we saw the ruins of a great many old roman and british camps and other remains of the ancient inhabitants of this kingdom and of their wars battles entrenchments encampments buildings and other fortifications which are indeed very agreeable to a traveller that has read the history of the country  old sarum which is the next place we come to is as remarkable as any of these where there is a double entrenchment with a deep graff or ditch to either of them it is said it was a roman station and the ancient sorbiodunum it was deserted in king henry iiis time for want of water when the inhabitants founded new sarum the old city is of an orbicular form erected on one of the most elegant designs imaginable it was first a fortress of the ancient britons the prospect of this place is at present very august and would have afforded us a most noble sight when in perfection in the angle to the northwest stood the cathedral and episcopal palace the city fills up the summit of an high and steep hill near the bottom of which runs the river avon here synods and british parliaments have formerly been held and hither the states of the kingdom were summoned to swear fealty to william i in this city was the palace of the british and saxon kings and of the roman emperors near it is one farmhouse and that is all which is left of this ancient city yet this is called the borough of old sarum and sends two members to parliament who are chosen by the proprietors of certain lands whom those members can justly say they represent would however be hard for them to answer  salisbury is a large well built and pleasant city and the founders of it seemed to have run from one extreme to another for as the old city wanted water this has rather too much the water running through the middle of every street which i think does not add to the beauty of the town but just the contrary for it keeps the streets always dirty full of wet and filth and weeds even in the middle of summer  the city lies at the confluence of two rivers the avon and the willy each of them singly a considerable river but very large when joined together and yet much larger when they receive the nadder a third river which joins them near clarendon park about three miles below the city when with a deep chanel and a current less rapid they run down to christchurch where they empty themselves into the sea from that town upwards to within two miles of salisbury they are made navigable but the strength of the stream would not permit to make them so up to the city  salisbury and all the county of wilts are full of a great variety of manufactures and those too of the most considerable in england as the clothing trade and that of flanels druggets and also several other sorts of manufactures of which in their place  salisbury has in particular two remarkable manufactures that flourish in it which employ the poor all around namely fine flanels and long cloths for the turkey trade called salisbury whites  the close adjacent to the cathedral in which live the canons and prebendaries is so large and well built that it looks like a fine city of itself  the cathedral is famous for the height of its spire which is without exception the highest and the handsomest in england being from the ground   0 feet and yet the walls so exceeding thin that at the upper part of the spire upon a view made by the late sir christopher wren the wall was found to be less than five inches thick upon which a consultation was had whether the spire or at least the upper part of it should be taken down it being supposed to have received some damage by the great storm in the year   0  but it was resolved in the negative and sir christopher ordered it to be strengthened with bands of iron plates which have effectually secured it and i have heard some of the best architects say it is stronger now than when it was first built  they tell us here long stories of the great art used in laying the first foundation of this church the ground being marshy and wet occasioned by the channels of the rivers that it was laid upon piles according to some and upon woolpacks according to others but this is not to be believed by those who know that the whole country is one rock of chalk even from the tops of the highest hills to the bottom of the deepest rivers and the foundation of woolpacks is no doubt allegorical and has respect to the woollen trade  this church was begun by bishop poor continued by robert bingham and william of york and finished by giles de brideport bishop of this see all in the space of  0 years the model is after the figure of a cross and it cost an immense sum of money but it must be acknowledged that the inside of the work is not answerable in the decoration of things to the workmanship without the painting in the choir is mean and more like the ordinary method of a common drawingroom or tavernpainting than that of a church the carving is good but there is very little of it and it is rather a fine church than finely set off  but it now makes a better appearance than it has done having very lately been repaired by the contributions of the bishop and prebendaries set on foot by bishop sherlock who it seems thought that the dignitaries ought to support what supported them and that all they got by the church was not designed merely to make or enrich their families  the ordinary boast of this building in the following verses must not be omitted as many days as in one year there be so many windows in one church we see as many marble pillars there appear as there are hours throughout the fleeting year as many gates as moons one year do view strange tale to tell yet not more strange than true   some of the windows which escaped the fury of the zealots of      are well painted  there are some very fine monuments in this church particularly in that they call the virgin marys chapel behind the altar is a noble monument for a late duke and duchess of somerset with their pourtraits at full length the late duchess of somerset of the piercy family also her daughter the marchioness of caermarthen and a second son of her grace both by the present duke are likewise interred here  the figure of one bennet who endeavored to imitate our savior in fasting forty days and forty nights as is there represented carried his point so far that being reduced to a skeleton he fell a victim to his presumptuous and enthusiastic folly the bodies of the bishops jewel uvall chest were also interred here here is likewise a monument to the beneficent dr seth ward bishop of this see who founded amidst other benefactions which we shall take notice of in hertfordshire a handsome college for the widows of ten ministers allowing to each    l per annum and which has been since obliged to dr gilbert burnet bishop of this see  they show you also the monument of the lord stourton in the reign of philip and mary which is made remarkable by a particular incident as follows  this lord stourton being guilty of a murder which was aggravated with very bad circumstances could not obtain the usual grace of the crown to be beheaded but queen mary positively ordered that like a common malefactor he should die at the gallows after he was executed his friends desiring to have him buried at salisbury the bishop would not consent that he should be buried in the cathedral unless as a farther mark of infamy they would submit to this condition  viz that the silken halter in which he was hanged should be placed over his grave in the church as a monument of his crime which was accordingly done and there it is to be seen at this day  the putting this halter up here was not so wonderful to me as it was that the posterity of that lord who remained in good rank some time after should never prevail to have that mark of infamy taken from the tomb of their ancestor  the cloister is   0 feet square the inner cioister  0 feet wide with  0 arches on each side the top vaulted and covered with lead over the east walk of the cloister is a spacious library but not overwell stocked with books the chapter house is octagon and is   0 feet in circumference the roof bearing all upon one small marble pillar in the center which seems so feeble that it is hardly to be imagined it can be any great support to it which makes it the more curious and indeed i believe it is hardly to be matched in europe  the corporation of sarum have lately purchased a very fine original piece of painting of her late majesty queen anne drawn by the celebrated dahl and have put it up in the council chamger of the city this picture formerly belonged to the society of gentlemen all members of parliament known by the name of the october club and was set up in the great room belonging to the bell now crown tavern in westminster where they used to meet till the death of queen anne  in       an act passed for the better repairing and paving the highways streets and watercourse within this city and for enlightening the streets lanes and passages and better regulating the nightly watch  from hence directing my course to the seaside in pursuit of my first design of viewing the whole coast of england i left the great road and went down the east side of the river toward newforest and lymington and here i saw the ancient house and seat of clarendon which gives title to the earl of that name this place should be called clorendon from the memorable roman camp half a mile off the park near the roman road made or repaired by constantius chlorus father of constantine it is a beautiful fortification of a round form upon a dry chalky hill within is a circular ditch supposed to be a less sort of camp for the summer the park is a sweet and beautiful spot here king john built a palace where several parliaments have been held part of the fabric is still left though they have for many years been pulling it down the meterials are chiefly flint and it was built upon the side of an hill but no way fortified though it took up much ground this palace is called the manor and from it lies a subterraneous passage to the queens manor between the camp and the park was a roman road from sorbiodunum or old sarum to winchester  but this being a large county and full of memorable branches of antiquity and modern curiosity i made several little excursions from this beautiful spot to view the northern parts of the county  i have mentioned that this county is generally a vast continued body of high chalky hills whose tops spread themselves into fruitful and pleasant downs and plains upon which great flocks of sheep are fed etc but the reader is desired to observe these hills and plains are most beautifully intersected and cut through by the course of diverse pleasant and profitable rivers along and near the banks of which there always is a chain of fruitful meadows and rich pastures and those interspersed with a great many pleasant towns villages and houses and among them many of considerable magnitude so that while you view the downs and think the country wild and uninhabited yet when you come to descend into these vales you are surprised with the most pleasant and fertile country in england  no less than four of these rivers meet all together at or near the city of salisbury the waters of three of which run through the streets of the city viz the nadder the willy and the avon   the nadder rises near the end of the blow mill course and passes by chilmark a pleasant village noted for its quarries of very good white stone which rises in many dimensions insomuch that there is now a single stone lying over the mouth of the quarry like an architrave full  0 feet long    in thickness and perfectly without flaw   the willy rises about warminster runs by yarnbury a vast roman camp where some distinguish vespasians name a great semicircular work at the entrance over against which on the other side the willy is another camp then running by orchestra remarkable for a kind of grass    feet in length with which they fatten hogs it gives name to wilton and forms the canal before the front of wilton house and then joining the nadder runs through the gardens at the end of the avenue   the avon rises from under a great ridge of hills which divide wiltshire into north and south adorned with the wansdike it passes southward through a great number of villages to ambresbury  what is most worth a man of curiositys seeing in this county is wilton house it is situated in a pleasant vale having wilton town on one side and a spacious park on the other  the building was begun in the reign of hen viii the great quadrangle was finished in the time of edward vi and the porch was designed by hans holbein the hallside being burnt down some years ago was rebuilt by the late thomas earl of pembroke then lord highadmiral of england in a very noble and sumptuous manner the other parts rebuilt by the first philip earl of pembroke were all designed by the famous inigo jones and finished by him in the year    0  the canal before the house lies parallel with the road and receives into it the whole river willy or at least is able to do so it may indeed be said that the river is made into a canal when we come into the courtyards before the house there are several pieces of antiquity to entertain the curious as particularly a noble column of porphyry with a marble statue of venus on the top of it which as they told me is    feet high and of excellent workmanship and that it came last from candia but formerly from alexandria  as the late earl of pembroke was a nobleman of great learning beyond most men of his high rank and a master of antiquity he took delight in collecting such valuable pieces of painting and sculpture as made wilton house a perfect museum or receptacle of rarities and we meet with several things there which are to be found nowhere else in the world i shall particularize but a few for a volume might be employed in a full description of them  the piece of our saviors washing his disciples feet which they show you in one of the first rooms you go into is admirable at the foot of the great staircase is a bacchus as large as the life done in fine peloponnesian marble carrying a young bacchus on his arm the young one eating grapes and showing by his countenance he is pleased with the taste of them one ought to stop every two steps of this staircase as we go up to contemplate the vast variety of pictures that cover the walls and of some of the best masters in europe and yet this is but an introduction to what is beyond them  the great geometrical staircase itself is deservedly admired and was the first of this kind in england and the rich and magnificent doorcase can hardly be paralleled  it is universally acknowledged that the grand apartment is one of the noblest pieces of architecture that has been hitherto produced particularly the salon which is  0 feet long  0 high and  0 broad and when you are entered these grand apartments such variety strikes upon you every way that you scarce know to which hand to turn yourself first on one side you see several rooms filled with paintings all so curious and various that it is with reluctance you leave them and looking another way you are called off by a vast collection of busts and pieces of the greatest antiquity of the kind both greek and roman  in one end of the grand room is the celebrated familypicture by vandyke  0 feet long and    feet high containing    figures as big as the life which rather appear as so many real persons than the production of art and all the other pictures there are of the same incomparable hand it would be endless to describe the whole set of the familypictures which take up this room unless we would enter into the rooftree of the family and set down a genealogical line of the whole house  after this fine range of beauties are seen we are far from being at an end of our surprise there are three or four rooms still upon the same floor filled with wonders nothing can be finer than the pictures themselves nothing more surprising than the number of them at length you descend the backstairs which are large though not like the other where not a hands breadth is left vacant between the pictures and even the upper rooms have some very good pieces in them  in most of the apartments are marble chimneypieces of the most exquisite workmanship all carved in italy with many curious statues basso relievos and pictures of the most famous masters the loggio in the bowlinggreen which has pillars beautifully rusticated and is enriched with niches and statues the grotto the front of which is curiously carved without as it is all marble within and has black pillars of the ionic order with capitals of white marble and four fine basso relievos from florence the stables and other offices are all beauties in their kind which would tire description  the collection of headpieces coats of mail and other armor for both horse and man are also a curiosity they show those of king henry viii edward vi and of an earl of pembroke nicknamed black jack which he wore when he besieged and took bulloign in france being the general who commanded in chief under the king they are very curious and imbossd twelve other complete suits of armor of extraordinary workmanship are also there the rest being about  00 are only for common horsemen  the garden front is justly esteemed one of the best pieces of the renowned inigo jones and is     feet long  the gardens are on the south of the house and extend themselves beyond the river a branch of which runs through one part of them and still south of the gardens is the great park which reaches beyond the vale the view opens to the great down which is properly called by way of distinction salisburyplain and leads from the city of salisbury to shaftsbury here also his lordship has a harewarren as it is called though improperly it has indeed been a sanctuary for the hares for many years but the gentlemen complain that it mars their game for that as soon as they put up a hare for their sport if it be anywhere within two or three miles away she runs for the warren and there is an end of their pursuit on the other hand it makes all the countrymen turn poachers and destroy the hares by what means they can the present earl of pembroke who as his father had has also a fine taste in architecture has made a further improvement with regard to prospect at this noble house throwing down the walls of the garden and making instead of them the newly introduced hawhaw walls which afford a boundless view all around the country from every quarter his lordship has also built a most magnificent bridge over the river in his garden which is esteemed the principal ornament without doors of this noble seat  from this pleasant and agreeable place i returned to clarendon the road from wilton to shaftsbury called the ten mile course is a fine ridge of downs continued upon the southern bank of the river nadder with a sweet prospect to the right and left all the way over the towns and the country on both sides the late earl of pembroke has placed a numbered stone at every mile for the benefit of travelers between the  th and  th mile is a pretty large camp called chiselbury probably roman in the decline of the empire at the end of this course are three or four celtic barrows in this hill is a quarry of stone very full of sea shells not far off in the parish of tisbury near wardercastle is a great entrenchment in a wood which was probably a british town near the nadder  returning we see upon the highest eminence which overlooks wilton and the fertile valley at the union of the nadder and willy the noted place called kingbarrow mentioned p     this is certainly celtick says dr stukeley and with great probability the very tomb of that carvilius who attacked caesars seacamp in order to divert his renowned enemy from his close pursuit of cassibelan this prince is supposed to have kept his royal residence at carvilium now wilton near which place king edgars queen spent the latter part of her life in a religious retirement and for that purpose built a house there  the downs and plains in this part of england being so open and the surface so little subject to alteration there are more remains of antiquity to be seen upon them than in other places and as they tell us no less than threeandfifty ancient incampments or fortifications in this one county some of which are very visible and are of different forms and erected by different nations as british danish saxon and roman particularly at ebbdown burywood oldburghhill cummerford roundwaydown st anneshill brattoncastle clayhill stourntonpark whitecolehall battlebury scrathbury yanesbury frippsbury suthburyhill ambresbury mentioned before great bodwyn easterley merdon aubery martenscilhill barburycastle etc at aubery or aukbury in particular on the east side of the avon by great dornford is a very large camp covering the whole top of a hill on the other side of the river a little higher up is vespasians camp called the walls near these are two other camps which seem remains of vespasians victories and intimate that he subdued the country by inches  north of these is martinshallhill a vast stationary roman camp on two sides the precipice is dreadfully steep the earl of winchelsea has a brass alexander severus found here on the reverse jupiter fulminans on the west side at top of the hill without the camp is a round pit full of good spring water always to the brim but never overflowing in the dryest summers which at those seasons is of the greatest service to the country round and thousands of cattle are every day driven thither from a considerable distance to drink i am informed there is such another upon the top of chutehill southeast from hence very high and no other water within some miles of it the prospect from martinshall is exceeding fine  at farlo not far from clarendonpark was the birthplace of sir stephen fox and where the town sharing in his good fortune shows several marks of his bounty as particularly the building a new church from the foundation and getting an act of parliament passed for making it parochial it being but a chapel of ease before to an adjoining parish also sir stephen built and endowed an almshouse here for six poor women with a master and a free school the master is to be a clergyman and to officiate in the church which including the school is a very good maintenance  i am now to pursue my first design and shall take the west part of wiltshire in my return where are several things to be still taken notice of in the mean time i went on to langbro a fine seat of my lord colerain which is very well kept  from hence in my way to the seaside i came to newforest of which i have said something already with relation to the great extent of ground which lies waste and has a vast quantity of large timber  this part of the country is a lasting monument of the conquerors tyranny and oppression who laid it open and waste for a forest and for game for which purpose he unpeopled the country pulled down the houses and the churches of several parishes and towns and of abundance of villages turning the poor people out of their habitations and possessions for the sake of his deer the same histories likewise record that two of his own sons and particularly his immediate successor william rufus lost their lives in this forest william rufus being shot with an arrow directed at a deer which glancing on a tree changed its course and striking the king full on the breast killed him and another son whilst in hot pursuit of the game was caught up by the boughs of a tree and hanged like absalom these they relate as just judgments of god on the cruel devastation made here by the conqueror and they still show the tree on which the arrow glanced in king charles iis time the tree was ordered to be surrounded with a pale great part of which is now fallen down and whether the tree be really so old or not is to me a great question the action being about  00 years ago  i cannot omit mentioning here a proposal made some years ago to the lord treasurer godolphin for repeopling this forest which i can be more particular in than any other man because i had the honor to draw up the scheme and argue it before that noble lord and some others who were principally concerned at that time in bringing over or rather providing for when they were come over the poor inhabitants of the palatinate a thing in itself commendable but as it was managed made of no benefit to england and miserable to those poor people  some persons being ordered by the noble lord abovementioned to consider of measures how those poor people should be provided for without injury to the public new forest in hampshire was singled out to be the place for them  here it was proposed to draw a great square line containing  000 acres of land marking out two large highways or roads through the center crossing both ways so that there should be  000 acres in each division exclusive of the land contained in the said crossroads  then to single out  0 men and their families who should be recommended as honest industrious people expert in or at least capable of being instructed in husbandry to each of these should be parcelled but in equal distributions  00 acres of this land so that the whole  000 acres should be distributed to the said  0 families for which they should have no rent to pay and be liable to no taxes but such as would provide for their own sick or poor repairing their own roads etc this exemption to continue for  0 years and then to pay each  0 l a year to the crown  to each of these families it was proposed to advance  00 l in ready money as a stock to set them to work and to hire and pay laborers to enclose clear and cure the land which it was supposed the first year could not be so much to their advantage as following years allowing them timber out of the forest to build themselves houses and barns sheds and offices as they should have occasion also for carts wagons ploughs harrows and the like necessary things  these  0 families would by the consequence of their own settlements employ and maintain such a proportion of others of their own people that the whole number of palatines would have been provided for had they been many more than they were and that without being any burden upon or injury to the people of england on the contrary they would have been an advantage and an addition of wealth and strength to the nation and to the country in particular where they should be thus seated  two things would have been answered by the execution of this scheme viz   that the annual rent to be received for all those lands after  0 years would abundantly pay the public for the first disburses which would amount to  0000 l that rent being then to amount to  0000 l per annum   more money than would have done this was thrown away upon them here to keep them in suspense and afterward starve them sending them a begging all over the nation and shipping them off to perish in other countries   the spot where the design was laid out was near lindhurst in the road from rumsey to lymington whither i now directed my course  lymington is a little but populous seaport standing opposite to the isle of wight in the narrow part of the straight which ships sometimes pass through in fair weather called the needles and right against the ancient town of southyarmouth in that isle which i have mentioned before this town of lymington is chiefly noted for making excellent salt from whence all these south parts of england are supplied as well by water as landcarriage  from hence are but few towns on the seacoast west though several considerable rivers empty themselves into the sea nor are there any harbors or seaports of note except pool as for christchurch though it stands at the mouth of the avon which as i have said comes down from salisbury and brings with it all the waters of south and east parts of wiltshire and receives also the stour and piddle two dorsetshire rivers which bring with them all the waters of the north part of dorsetshire yet it is a very inconsiderable poor place scarce worth seeing and less worth mentioning in this account but here i will close this my fifth letter with assuring you that i am  yours etc  letter vi containing a description of the county of dorset part of somersetshire devonshire cornwall etc sir  now enter into the county of dorset and first i rode northwest into it to see the ancient town of wimburn or wimburnminster it stands  large extended fertile vale like a mow with much wood about it  with fish here was a nunnery  year     by cuthberga sister to king  the church is a very great one ancient and well built with a very firm strong square tower  high but was without doubt much  it stood a most ex  may be cre  its situation  question   in this church are the monuments of several noble families and of king etheldred who was slain in battle by the danes he was a prince famed for piety and religion and according to the zeal of those times was esteemed a martyr because he died fighting for his religion and his country against the pagan danes the inscription upon his grave is preserved and has been carefully repaired so as easily to be read and is as follows in hoc loco quiescit corpus s etheldredi regis west saxonum martyris qui anno dom dccclxxii xxiii aprilis per manus danorum paganorum occubuit that is here rests the body of st etheldred king of the west saxons and martyr who fell by the hands of the pagan danes in the year of our lord     the   d of april  here also are the monuments of the great marchioness of exeter mother of edward courtney earl of devonshire and last of the family of courtneys who enjoyed that honor as also of john de beaufort duke of somerset and his wife grandmother of king henry vii by her daughter margaret countess of richmond  this last lady i mention because she was foundress of a very fine free school which has since been enlarged and had a new benefactress in queen elizabeth who augmented the stipend and annexed it to the foundation the famous cardinal pool was dean of this church before his exaltation  the inhabitants of wimburnminster are numerous but poor and chiefly maintained by the manufacture of knitting stockens which employs great part of the county of dorset of which this is the first town eastward  wimbourn st giless in this neighborhood is a very handsome seat belonging to the earl of shaftesbury  from hence i went to ringwood upon the river avon over a deep sandy moor it is a large thriving place full of good new brick houses seated by the side of a great watery valley the river dividing itself into several streams and frequently overflowing large quantities of the meadow here they deal pretty much in leather stockens druggets and narrow cloth  south of wimburn over a sandy wild and barren country we came to pool a considerable seaport and indeed the most considerable in all this part of england for here i found some ships some merchants and some trade especially here was a good number of ships fitted out every year to the newfoundland fishing in which the pool men have been particularly successful for many years past  the town sits in the bottom of a great bay or inlet of the sea which entering at one narrow mouth opens to a great breadth within the entrance and comes up to the very shore of this town it runs also west up almost to warcham a little below which it receives the froom and piddle the two principal rivers of the county  this place is famous for the best and biggest oysters in all this part of england which the people of pool pretend to be famous for pickling and they are barrelld up here and sent not only to london but to the west indies and to spain italy and other parts it is observed more pearl are found in the pool oysters and larger than in any others in england  as the entrance into this large bay is narrow so it is made narrower by an island called branksey which lying in the very mouth of the passage divides it into two and where there is an old castle called branksey castle built to defend the entrance and was of no small advantage to the trade of this port in the time of the late war with france  wareham has been a roman town there has been a castle by the waterside west of the bridge built by king william i perhaps upon the roman it is an old corporation now decayed the sands obstructing the passage of the vessels and pool being better seated from a fishertown has risen to be a rich seaport they say here have been a mint and many parishchurches of which three remain i saw a ruinous religious house as i passed by the river from this haven is of vast extent like a sea having a narrow entry two rocks about corfcastle have an odd appearance hence  south of wareham and between the bay i have mentioned and the sea lies a large track of land which being surrounded by the sea except on one side is called an island though it is really more properly a peninsula this track of land is better inhabited than the sea coast of this west end of dorsetshire generally is and the manufacture of stockens is carried on there also it is called the isle of purbeck and has in the middle of it a large market town called corf and from the famous castle there the whole town is now called corfcastle  this part of the country is eminent for vast quarries of stone which is cut out flat and used in london in great quantities for paving courtyards alleys avenues to houses kitchens footways on the sides of the highstreets and the like and is very profitable to the place as also in the number of shipping employed in bringing it to london there are also several rocks of very good marble only that the veins in the stone are not black and white as the italian but gray red and other colors it is also noted for excellent tobaccopipe clay sold at london for thirty shillings per ton  from hence to weymouth we rode in view of the sea the country is open and in some respects pleasant but not like the northern parts of the country which are all fine carpet ground and the herbage so sweet that their sheep are esteemed the best in england and their wool extremely fine  from hence we turned up to dorchester the county town it is regular and clean the iseningsreet enters it by the north of winterburn at westgate this is by the ignorant country people referred to the work of the devil who they say cast it up in a nights time the foundations of the ancient roman wall appear quie round the town but eastward a street is built upon it and the ditch filled up it is still called the walls for that way the town is swelled out into a considerable village with a church and handsome tower named fordington or farington there are three other churches in the town and the streets are wide and handsome on the south and west side without the walls a handsome walk of trees is planted looking pleasantly into the country though being common scamores they are inconvenient by harboring flies the banks of the river here are steep for the town stands on high ground beyond the river are meadows and warm sandy lands on this side the fine chalky downs pleasant for riding and profitable in excellent grain the air must needs be wholesome the climate warm and a sufficient distance from the sea the people of fordington rose in arms and prevented the farmers from levelling a great barrow the late rev mr place known for his philosophical works lived here and possessed a great quantity of roman coins called here dornmoney or king dors money near this place is a noble roman amphitheatre the vulgar call it maumbury but have no notion of its purpose though it is a common excursion for the inhabitants and the terrace on the top is a noted place of rendezvous affording an agreeable circular walk a prospect of the town and wide plains of corn fields all around  dorchester is a regular town with handsome wide streets but the houses though built of stone are old and low it is kept very clean by reason of its high situation and the river on which it is situated  the inhabitants care in setting the able poor to work and relieving the aged and impotent is highly praiseworthy and sir josiah child in his treatise on trade recommends their example as worthy to be followed by other places it is famous also for excellent beer  on the pleasant downs round this town they told me there were  00000 sheep fed within six miles of the town every way which is    miles in diameter and    miles in circumference and when i viewed the country round i confess i could not but incline to believe it  it is observable of these sheep that they are exceedingly fruitful and the ewes generally bringing two lambs they are for that reason bought by all the farmers through the east part of england who come to burford fair in this county for that purpose and carry them into kent and surrey eastward and into buckinghamshire bedfordshire and oxfordshire north even our bansteaddowns in surrey so famed for good muton is supplied from this place the herbage of these downs is full of the most aromatic plants such as nourish the sheep to a great degree and the sheeps dung again nourishes that so that the valleys are rendered extremely fruitful by the washing of the water in hasty showers from off these hills  from dorchester it is six miles to the seaside south and the ocean in view almost all the way the first towns we come to are weymouth and melcomb two towns lying at the mouth of a little rivulet called the wey for it scarce deserves the name of a river however the entrance makes a very good though small harbor and they are joined by a wooden bridge so that nothing but the harbor parts them yet they are separate corporations and choose each of them two members of parliament  weymouth is a sweet clean agreeable town considering its low situation and close to the sea it is well built and has a great many substantial merchants in it who drive a considerable trade and have a great number of ships belonging to the town they carry on in time of peace a trade with france but besides this they trade also to portugal spain newfoundland and virginia and have a large correspondence up in the country for the consumption of their returns the wine and newfoundland trade are both considerable here and they have a customhouse and good key  without the harbor is an old castle called sandfoot castle and over against them is portland castle situated in the isle of that name and the road called portland road which affords a safe harbor for ships in bad weather  from this isle of portland comes our best and whitest freestone with which the cathedral of st pauls the monument and all the public edifices in the city of london are chiefly built and the quarries whence these stones are dug are well worth the observation of a traveller  the island is indeed little more than one continued rock of freestone about seven miles in compass and the height of the land is such that from this island they see in clear weather above half over the chanel to france though here it is very broad the sea off this island and especially to the west of it is counted the most dangerous part of the british chanel due south there is almost a continued disturbance in the waters by reason of what they call two tides meeting which i take to be no more than the sets of the currents from the french coast and from the english shore this they call portland race and several ships not aware of these currents have been embayd to the west of portland and driven on shore on the beach of which i shall speak presently where they have been lost  to prevent this danger and guide the mariner in these distresses they have set up two lighthouses on the two points of that island which are very useful and serviceable to ships  this island though seemingly miserable and thinly inhabited yet the inhabitants being almost all stonecutters we found there were no very poor people among them and when they collected money for the rebuilding st pauls they got more in this island than in the great town of dorchester  though portland stands a league from the main land of britain yet it is almost joined by a prodigious riff of beach that is to say of small stones cast up by the sea which runs from the island so near the shore of england that they ferry over with a boat and a rope the water not being above half a stonesthrow over and the said riff of beach ending as it were at that inlet of water turns away west and runs parallel with the shore quite to abbotsbury a town about seven miles beyond weymouth  i name this to explain what i said before of ships being embayd and lost here this is when coming from the westward they omit to keep a good offing or are taken short by contrary winds and cannot weather the high land of portland but are driven between portland and the main land and run on shore on that vast beach  on the inside of this beach and between it and the land is the said inlet of water which they ferry over as above to pass and repass to and from portland this inlet opens at about two miles west grows very broad and makes a kind of lake within the land of a mile and a half broad and near three miles in length the breadth unequal at the farthest end west of this water is a large decoy and the verge of the water well grown with wood and proper groves of trees for cover for the fowl in the open lake or broad part is a continual assembly of swans here they live feed and breed and the number of them is such that i believe i did not see so few as   or  000 we saw several of them upon the wing very high in the air whence we supposed they flew over the riff of beach which parts the lake from the sea to feed on the shores  from this decoy west the lake narrows and at last almost closes till the beach joins the shore and so portland may be said not to be an island but part of the continent and now we came to abbotsbury a town anciently famous for a great monastery and now eminent for nothing but its ruins  from hence we went on to bridport a pretty large but not well built corporation town on the sea shore here we saw boats all the way on the shore fishing for mackerel which they take in the easiest manner imaginable and in such prodigious plenty that there has been a watch set to prevent farmers dunging their land with them which it was thought might be apt to infect the air  in the year      an act passed for restoring and rebuilding the haven and piers of bridport in order to bring it to its ancient flourishing state for heretofore it was a place of great trade and commerce but by reason of a great sickness which formerly swept away the greatest part of its most wealthy inhabitants and by other accidents the haven became neglected and choked with sands the piers fell to ruin and the town of consequence to decay so that there was no security for ships that happened to be driven by stress of weather into the deep and dangerous bay wherein the haven formerly was which occasioned frequent shipwrecks the act therefore authorizes the bailiffs and burgesses of bridport to levy certain tolls and duties on diverse merchandises etc in order to restore the said piers and harbor  bridport was formerly the only place for twisting of ropes for the royal navy and it is still used for that purpose the neighboring lands yielding plenty of hemp  from bridport we came to lyme a town particularly made famous by the landing of the duke of monmouth june         in the time of king james ii with only twelve men many of his party were afterward put to death on the spot and their limbs hung up in the town before that time the duke of tuscany set footing here in his tour to england  this is called lymeregis it is a town of good figure and has in it several eminent merchants who carry on a considerable trade to france spain newfoundland and the streights and though they have neither creek or bay road or river they have a good harbor and such as is not in all britain besides if in the world  it is a massy pile of building consisting of high and thick walls of stone raised at first with all the methods that art could devise and maintained now with very little difficulty the walls are raised in the main sea at a good distance from the shore it consists of one main and solid wall of stone large enough for carts and carriages to pass on the top and to admit houses and warehouses to be built on it so that it is broad as a street opposite to this but farther into the sea is another wall of the same workmanship which crosses the end of the first and comes about with a tail parallel to that  between the point of the first or main wall is the entrance into the port and the second or opposite wall breaking the violence of the sea from the entrance the ships go into the basin and ride there as secure as in a millpond or wetdock  this work is called the cobb the customhouse officers have a lodge and warehouse upon it it might be strengthened with a fort and the walls themselves are firm enough to carry what guns they please to plant upon it but they did not seem to think it needful and as the shore is convenient for batteries they have some guns planted in proper places for the defense of the cobb and the town  this town is under the government of a mayor and aldermen and may pass for a place of wealth considering the bigness of it here we found the merchants began to trade in the pilchard fishing though not to so considerable a degree as they do farther west the pilchards seldom coming up so high eastward as portland and not very often so high as lyme  i visited from hence some of the towns in the northwest part of this country as blandford on the river stour in the road between salisbury and dorchester a handsome well built town pleasantly seated in a flexure of the river before charming meadows and rich lands wood thrives exceedingly here indeed this county is a fine variety of downs woods lawns arable and pasture land rich valleys and an excellent air the dry easterly winds the cold northern and the western moisture are tempered by the warm southern saline breezes wasted hither from the ocean but blandford is chiefly famous for making the finest bonelace in england where they showed me in my first visit to it some so exquisitely fine as i think i never saw better in flanders france or italy and which they said they rated at above  0 l sterling a yard  this was the state and the trade of the town when i was there in my first journey but june        the whole town except twentysix houses was consumed by fire together with the church the consternation of the people was so great and the fire so furious that few saved any goods  an act passed in      for the better and more easy rebuilding of this town and for determining differences touching houses and buildings burnt down or demolished therein and as several wise regulations were made by it blandford now makes a much better appearance than ever  from blandford i went west to stourbridge which and the country round is employed in the manufacture of stockens it was once famous for making the finest best and highestpricd knit stockens in england but that trade is much decayed by the increase of the knittingstocken engine or frame which has destroyed the hand knittingtrade for fine stockens through the whole kingdom of which i shall speak in another place  from hence i came to shireburn a large and populous town with one collegiate or conventual church and may justly claim to have more inhabitants in it than any town in dorsetshire though it is neither the county town nor sends members to parliament it was once a bishops see which was removed to salisbury the church is still a reverend pile and shows the face of great antiquity here begins the wiltshire medley clothing though this town be in dorsetshire of which i shall speak at large in its place  shaftesbury is also on the edge of this county adjoining to wiltshire and dorsetshire being fourteen miles from salisbury over that fine down or carpet ground called salisburyplain it is not an extraordinary town but situated upon the top of a high hill and which closes the plain or downs and whence a new scene is presented  viz a prospect of somerset and wiltshire where it is all enclosed and grown with woods forests and planted hedgerows the country rich fertile and populous the towns and houses standing thick and being large and full of inhabitants and those inhabitants fully employed in the richest and most valuable manufacture in the world  viz the english clothing as well the medley or mixed clothing as whites both for the home and foreign trade on which i shall be more particular in my return through the west and north part of wiltshire  shaftesbury has however lately received some improvements from the generosity of a neighboring gentleman and particularly in a fine plantation on the top of parkhill which he was so kind as to indulge the inhabitants with for a place of walking and diversion but attempting on the strength of his good offices to the town to prescribe to them in the choice of a member of parliament he has not met with the grateful return he might have expected violence having been done to the very plantation he had so generously devoted to the public service and pleasure of the inhabitants  in my return to my western progress i passed some little part of somersetshire as through evil or yeovil upon the river ivil in going to which we descend a long steep hill called babylonhill but from what original i could find none of the country people able to inform me  northward upon an high sandy hill by the bank of the river ivel is a roman camp called chesterton under which lies the town of sandy the salinae of the romans where abundance of roman and british antiquities have been found and immense quantities of coins  yeovil is a market town of good resort and some little clothing is carried on in and near it its main manufacture at this time is gloves it deals also in corn cheese hemp and all sorts of provisions  it cannot pass my observation here that when we are come this length from london the dialect of the english tongue or the country way of expressing themselves is not easily understood it is true that it is so in many parts of england besides but in none in so gross a degree as in this part as this way of boorish speech is in ireland called the brogue upon the tongue so here it is named jouring it is not possible to explain this fully by writing because the difference is not so much in the orthography as in the tone and accent their abridging the speech cham for i am chill for i will don for do on or put on and doff for do off or put off and the like  from evil or yeovil we came to crookorn thence to chard which immediately brought me into devonshire  it may not be unacceptable here to insert a general description of this large county which may convey to the reader some idea of the nature of the soil its productions and the method of improvement as well as the manufactures and merchandises on which the trading part of the inhabitants subsist  to begin then the western part of the county bordering on cornwall viz about tavystock briddestow oakhampton holsworthy bideford great torrington chulmleigh chagford moreton hampsted and all round the skirts of dartmore as well as that large forest itself consists of a very coarse moory or fenny soil very barren in its nature in some places productive of nothing but a dwarf kind of furze of little or no value at other places grow nothing but rushes or a coarse four kind of pasturage which the cattle will not feed upon and therefore it dries up and withers into a sedge the soil here is generally a stiff clay through which the water cannot soak away this renders it very unhealthy especially to sheep which in those parts are of a small kind and very subject to the rot which in wet seasons especially destroys them in great numbers and what adds to the malady is that neither the industry of the husbandman for which this county is deservely famous nor any compost that has yet been found out will to any purpose cure this sterility  the principal and indeed the only profitable return that the inhabitants can make out of those lands is by breeding black cattle for which they are very well adapted for here are bred those fine oxen in great numbers which by the drovers of somersetshire and thereabouts are brought up and in their flat feeding lands betwixt bridgewater and wells which i have seen almost covered with them fattened fit for smithfield market where they drive and sell them to the londoners who have not so good beef from any other part of the kingdom  the northern parts of the county are of a quite different nature from the former for this generally consists of a dry healthy soil especially about ilfordcombe south moulton dulverton and all along the brim of the forest of exmore those downs are far from being a luxuriant feeding but are very good grazing for sheep and being well dressed with lime which is brought over hither by water from wales dung sand and other compost manured by the indefatigable labor of the inhabitants produce tolerable crops of corn i say tolerable ones for though they far exceed the productions in dorset wilts hants etc where sluggishness so far prevails as to leave dame nature destitute of the least human assistance the fertility is by no means comparable to that of the eastern and middle parts of the county in the former of which a rich marl in some parts and a fertile sandy soil in others and in the latter a fat strong soil of a deepred color intermixed with veins of different kinds of loam produce very great crops of corn and pease of the best kind not to be excelled in the whole island neither does it fall behind in meadow ground and pasturage clover eaver and trefoil grass and turnips as is evident to a person who goes through any of the markets and beholds the fine wellfed beef and mutton with which they are plentifully stored  about teingmouth dartmouth totnes modbury plymouth ashburton and all the south parts of the county called the southhams the lands are generally of a different kind from any of the former in most places very good for arable and pasture but especially for cider fruits a great part of this large track lies on a stratum of marble which the inhabitants break up and burn into lime and therewith dress their lands to their very great improvement neither is this all the advantage they make of those quarries for in many of them is found stone which for its hardness soundness and beautiful veinings rivals the best italian marbles and falls very little if any thing short of them in luster great quantities of this stone are sent to london and other places where they are wrought up for the noblest purposes at other places on this southcoast are quarries of slate for covering houses and this likewise of the best kind which are not only fetched away by landcarriage to the distance of ten twelve and sixteen miles but great quantities of them are sent coastwise to all the towns on the british shore and exported to holland flanders and other places beyond sea  the reader will not by this description conclude that the lands in any part of the county are all one and the same kind downs fens rocks and woodgrounds are interspersed among the best lands as there are also some good arable and pasture amongst the most desolate and barren and whoever looks round him in his own situation will know in what sense to take this general description to proceed  at diverse places are found large quantities of very good oak timber as well as ash elm beech etc and such of it as grows in places whence it can be conveyed either by land or watercarriage to plymouth dock are there served in for the use of his majestys navy  coppicewood is so very plenty that although the woollen manufacturers take off great quantities in charcoal and yet greater quantities are expended in common firing there being no coal raised in this county yet the price is so low that the lands where it thrives well will not generally produce more than   s per acre communibus annis the lands in devonshire save only the forest of dartmore halldenhill and some heaths moors and coarse downs of no very large extent which for the most part are not capable of improvement not even by devonshire husbandry are divided into small enclosures and in places where any shrubs will grow by quickset hedges banked up four or five feet high with earth and as the enclosures are small so are the farms or tenements in these parts even to a very manifest inconvenience for the general method here is for gentlemen to lease out the tenements of their manors for    years determinable on three lives taking fines for such leases and reserving no more than about one shilling in the pound of the yearly value  by this means men of small fortunes find an opportunity to lay out the little money they have in what they call purchasing an estate which likewise serves for a settlement upon a wife for the money she brings hence a family comes on and craves a maintenance out of a farm of perhaps  0 l a year which surely can produce but a very poor one whereas   or  00 l sunk in this purchase would have enabled him to manage a farm of  00 l a year out of which by industry and good management the family might not only live in a more plentiful manner the children be better educated and instructed to understand the business of the farm but money likewise laid up every year toward setting them out in the same method of living this i take to be the principal cause of the poverty and hardship that appears in country places and of the difficulty of getting a good tenant at rackrent for any farm whose value exceeds  00 l a year  i should have mentioned that in my way to chard i passed through axminster a pretty considerable market town and the first in the county of devon the great western road to london goes through this town here my curiosity led me to go into the church and view the monuments of the saxon princes or rather the bishop of sherburne and two dukes who were slain at the battle of brunaburgh in that neighborhood fought by king athelstane with seven danish princes over whom he obtained the victory in a field thence called kingsfield to this day the monuments of those saxon worthies were under arches in the walls of the church two of which have been lately filled up  here in memory of the victory king athelstane founded a minster for seven priests which in afterages were reduced to two for whom a portion of land was allotted called priestaller which with the parsonage now belongs to two prebendaries of the church of york the manor continued in the crown till the reign of king john who gave it to the lord brewer a daughter and coheir of which family alicia brought it in marriage to lord mobun of dunstar whose posterity with consent of king henry iii anno gratiae        id jan regnant h fill johann reginaldus mohun filius reginaldi and aliciae brewer fundavit abbatiam de newnham in manner de axminster in com devon abbot gill the  th of march    hen viii surrendered it to the king the yearly value at that time was     l   s   d  ford abbey is in this neighborhood heretofore a stately fabric lofty and very magnificent adorned with curious carvings and embellishments of the gothic kind some of whose beauties still remain as may be seen in a modern print thereof published by mr buck it was first founded by adeliza daughter of baldwin de brioniis baron of oakhampton anno    0 and dedicated to the virgin mary for cistercian monks at the surrender it was valued at     l  0 s   d halfpenny yearly  near axminster lies kilmington quasi killmentown from the great slaughter there made at the battle beforementioned and membury i e maimburgh whither the maimed in that battle were sent to be relieved now famous for the best devonshire cheese  at northleigh or rather at uplime which manor was formerly the inheritance of the abbey of glastonbury was born mr nathanael carpenter the author of the treatise of geography and diverse others tracts that bear his name  cullyford in this neighborhood was the habitation of sir thomas gates who in   0  bound to virginia of which colony he was then made governor was in a violent tempest shipwrecked and with sir george summers cast on shore by which accident they were made the first possessors of the island of bermudas or summer island  this track abounds with lands which were formerly appropriated to churches and religious houses viz at smallridge axmouth farwood salcombe dunkerwell a monastery of cistercian monks sidbury sidmouth branscombe monketon luppit awlscombe and at diverse other places which from the richness of the soil makes good the observation that the religious of those days made it their chief endeavor to possess themselves of the best things of this world  at tidwell alias tideswell is a pond or pool which boils up like that of the same name at weeden in derbyshire the same road i was before in brought me from axminster to honiton  this is a large and beautiful market town very populous and well built and is so very remarkably paved with small pebbles that on both sides the way a little chanel is left shouldered up so that it holds a small stream of fine clear running water with a little square dippingplace left at every door so that every family in the town has a clear clean running rivulet as it may be called just at their own door and this is much finer pleasanter and more agreeable to look on than that at salisbury which they so much boast of  here we see the first of the sergemanufacture of devonshire a trade too great to be described in miniature it takes up this whole county which is the largest and most populous in england yorkshire excepted but devonshire is so full of great towns and those towns so full of people and those people so universally employed in trade and manufactures that it cannot be equaled in england nor perhaps in europe  honiton stands in the best and pleasantest part of the whole county and i cannot but recommend it to gentlemen who travel this road that if they observe the prospect at honiton for half a mile till they come down the hill and to the very entrance into honiton the view of the country is the most beautiful landscape in the world and i do not remember the like in any one place in england it is observable that the market of this town was kept originally on the sunday till it was changed by the direction of king john this town is now much employed in the trade of lacemaking  on the road from honiton they have a beautiful prospect almost all the way to exeter which is    miles  on the left hand of this road lies the town of st mary ottery so called as some say from the river otter and that from the otters found formerly in it this town was given by king edward the confessor to the church of st mary at roan in normandy but was afterward bought by grandison bishop of exeter who made of it a quarter college in  0 edward iii and therein placed secular priests with other ministers to whom he gave the whole manor parish tithes fines spiritual profits etc which amounted to  0  l   s  0 s yearly  bicton formerly bicheton was given by william the conqueror to one of his servants called william porto it afterward reverted to the crown and by henry i was given to one john janitor so called from his office for by his tenure he was to keep the prison for this county by which service it is held to this day by the worthy owner thereof henry roll esquire who is at this time knight of this shire his ancestor sir henry roll esquire had it by marriage with anne the daughter of sir thomas dennis to whose family it came from the beforementioned janitor through ballister sackville and coplestone  from hence we came to exeter the capital of the county of devon a city which has often changed its name for it was the pencaer and caereske of the britons the augusta of the romans the isca of ptolemy the iscadamnoniorum of antonine the exancester of the saxons which was afterward abreviated to excester and exeter from the great number of monks there it had for some time the name of monketon but at length from that large river which washes its walls and bears the name of exe whether from the forest of that name where it rises or the forest from it i cannot determine it retains that of exeter which it seems now to be varying for exon it was first fortified with a stone wall which still remains entire by king athelstane and was for some time the seat of the west saxon kings  that the romans were here is highly probable among other proofs from their coins that have been dug up at diverse places in particular a gold one of nero at exeter one of theodosius near barnstaple several silver ones of severus and other emperors but especially from a great quantity of them dug up about twenty years since at exeter within the close together with the urn in which they were buried i saw a great number of those some of which were of silver but the greatest part of them were a mixture of tin and copper they had the impression of gordianus philippus and other emperors  king athelstane founded here a monastery to st mary and st peter for monks of the order of st benedict the chapel of st mary now fitted up for a library and furnished with a pretty great number of books which are but of little use because placed in a very confused order is the very eastermost part of the cathedral and was doubtless the first beginning of that now handsome fabric king etheldred founded also within the close a house for monks and another for nuns diverse other religious houses as the priories of st james st nicolas st john baptist the gray friars etc were the work of afterages  the walls are in pretty good repair and make a walk round the city with the pleasure of seeing a fine country on opposite hills full of wood rich ground orchards villages and gentlemens houses the beauty of the place consists of one long street called high street broad and strait the houses are of a very old but good model spacious commodious and not inelegant this street is full of shops well furnished and all sorts of trades look brisk the people are industrious and courteous the fair sex are truly such as well as numerous their complexion and generally their hair of a fair cast they are genteel disengaged of easy carriage and good mien there has been of late a vast increase of buildings within and without the city the situation renders it of necessity clean dry and airy the soil thither from honyton is rather sandy than stony whence it must needs be very healthful there are many booksellers in dr musgraves garden an head of the empress julia domna of a colossean size was dug up the headdress is suitable to those times and neither the manner nor carving are despicable though the graver has not done it justice it is the noblest relic of british antiquity which we know of this sort it is    inches from the top of the attire to the chin and belonged to a statue of    feet proportion originally set upon some temple or palace there is also an inscription of camillus  this country remarkably abounds with persons afflicted with the gout which is attributed to the custom of marling the lands with lime and the great use of poor sweet cider especially among the meaner people  in the northern angle of the city and highest ground stands rugemontcastle once the residence of the west saxon monarchs afterward of the earls of cornwall it is of a squarish figure not very large environed with a high wall and deep ditch it has a rampire of earth parallel to the top of the wall forming a terrace which overlooks the city and country here are the assizehouse and a chapel  the bridge over the exe is of great length and has houses on both sides and at both ends with a considerable vacancy in the middle in the guild hall are the pictures of general monk and the princess henriettamaria  the bishops see of this western diocese has had several removes for it was first at bodmyn for the county of cornwall and since that at tawton for this county afterward both were joined and placed at crediton and lastly about the year  0 0 king edward the confessor and his queen edyth inthroned leofricus who had been three years bishop of crediton into the sea of exeter in the following very solemn manner  on the south side of the high altar in the cathedral were erected and are there still to be seen perfect as when first made three seats or alcoves adorned with gothic carvings to the height of about    feet which are supported with brass pillars in the middle of these was the bishop installed by the king and queen the form of words thus  i king edward taking leofricke bye the right aunde and edythe my queen bye the least do installe him the first and most famous byschoppe of ron with a grate desire of abundance of blessings to all such as shall further and increase the same but with a fearful and execrable curse on all such as shall diminish or take any thing from it the church was about  00 years in building and very remarkable it is to behold the uniformity with which it was carried on for nobody can discover the least incongruity in the parts so much is it like the workmanship of one and the same architect  there are some ancient funeral monuments in the cathedral but first as matter of the greatest antiquity let me take notice of the bishops throne in the choir which at the dissolution of episcopacy in king charles is time was as a useless thing taken down but whether the workman employed to do it were well affected to that order or else had some private instructions from somebody in power who foresaw that it would some time or other be of use again certain it is that a great deal of care was taken of the materials for it is now replaced and every part of it as sound and good as when first made the gothic carvings about the canopy are at least  0 feet high and a vast deal of good workmanship of that kind there is about it it is i believe coeval with the sea  the antique monuments as i before mentioned to be seen here are particularly those of humphry bohun earl of hereford hugh courtenay earl of devon and his lady the lord chichester sir peter carew sir thomas speak sir richard stapleton dowrich of dowrich the bishops leofricus stafford branscombe oldham bradbridge lacy carry and others especially that of bishop stapleton the pious founder of exetercollege in oxford which society in grateful remembrance of their benefactor have lately repaired and beautified his monument which in regard to some of the carvings about it excess any thing i ever saw of so old a date in the gothic way  the altarpiece done  00 years ago is a representation of the inside of the church in perspective an exquisitely fine piece of painting and excepting only a little injury it received from the swords of the saints militant in the great rebellion exceedingly well preserved the fine painted glass of which there is a great deal underwent the fury of the same pious reformers who after they had made a forcible entry and taken to themselves this house of god in possession under the umbrage of an ordinance of parliament of the   th of august      broke out the best of those paintings and irretrievably ruined all the scripture history therein represented neither was their rage confined to those brittle materials for the carved figures of the patriarchs prophets kings etc of which there were a great many became objects of their furious zeal and ignorance for there the maimed bodies are now to be seen some without the head others have lost one or both legs or arms etc all of them some way or other mangled and having by this means taken away what they feared would draw them into  they divided this cathedral by a partition wall betwixt the choir and the main body of it one of which divisions was made use of by an independent and the other by a presbyterian congregation  and now that i am taking notice of the decorations of this magnificent piece of antiquity let me just mention that in one of its towers is a very large bell of about sixty hundred weight and in the other a fine ring of ten large ones an organ of very good workmanship and supported by a tetrastyle of very beautiful gothic columns stands where the beforementioned partition wall did the largest pipes in this instrument are of a great length and    inches in diameter which is said to be two inches more than those at ulm which is so famed for its largeness  the wellfinished alcove of modern work for the bishop and the pulpit and pews of the like in the nave or body of the church together with the neat marble font and the two suits of hangings for the choir one of tapestry and the other of velvet and the fine suit of gilt plate for the communion service is all that i shall further add about the grave and welladapted ornaments and furniture of this temple or house of god  to complete this description with a circumstance which i think ought by no means to be passed over the solemnity decency and affecting harmony with which the service and music vocal and instrumental is generally performed by the choralvicars organist and choristers and which is well worthy of imitation it is no uncommon thing to see  00 people here in a morning which is at least five times as many as usually attend at st pauls or any other six oclock chapel i was ever at and it is commendable that the reader does not here curtail the morning service by leaving out any part thereof as in other places they do here are two morning lectures preached weekly viz tuesday and friday mornings  the numerous congregation which winter and summer attend the daily prayers at six in the morning and their grave and pious behavior there i say all this together render this cathedral a glory to the diocese the envy of other choirs and the admiration of strangers  other antique buildings of a public nature are the chapter house and cloisters the bishops palace the houses belonging to the dean the chancellor treasurer and other dignitaries of the church the guildhall the walls and gates of the city with those of the castle and the close the hospital of st john the baptist  0 parish churches within the city and liberties thereof the bridge over the river exe a large and very handsome conduit for water in the center of the four principal streets to which may be added some chapels and almshouses yet standing and the ruins of diverse others which are monuments of the piety of their founders and the impiety of those who neglect them  modern buildings of a public nature this city has not many to boast of st pauls one of the twenty churches beforementioned the chancellors house a very handsome and well contrived workhouse for the poor three or four meeting houses a quay for landing goods and a customhouse include all that have been erected within  0 years past  the civil government of this city is by a mayor aldermen and common council a recorder sheriff four stewards a chamberlain and town clerk who are attended by a sword bearer who wears the cap and carries the sword given by king henry vii before them to church and on all public processions four sergeants at mace and as many staffbearers the former in gowns and the latter in liveries with badges and which adds not a little to their splendour they keep a band of four musicians in constant pay  there are moreover twelve companies of incorporated trades who on public occasions and on gaudydays walk in the mayors train dressed in gowns each company having a beadle in a laced cloak bearing the ensigns of their several professions to usher them  for supplying the inhabitants with water there is broughtin a pretty large quantity by subterraneous pipes from some springs in the parish of st sidwell without eastgate part of which is reposited for common use in the conduit beforementioned and another part is conveyed to the houses of the bishop dean canons etc within the close and to a common pump just at the west entrance of the cathedral but all this would be far short of a sufficient supply and therefore an exceeding good engine is fixed in the river the great wheel of which working by the same water forces the river water through elmtrees bored for that purpose into a large reservoir fixed about  0 feet above ground in the highest part of the city adjoining to the guildhall from whence through other pipes it is dispersed to all parts of the city in great plenty the expense of which to each housekeeper that will have it is from    to  0 s a year according to the quantity their occasions require  the river exe was heretofore in its main stream navigable to the walls of the city but on a difference between the mayor and the then earl of devon on a very trifling occasion viz which of their purveyors should be first served with a pot of fish in the market that earl revenged himself by choking the mouth of the river and by making weirs with timber sand etc thereby entirely ruining the navigation thereof farther up than topsham and so great was the power and obstinacy of the earl at that time that though the citizens obtained a decree in equity for their relief it was never executed  to remove this inconvenience the inhabitants about  0 years since by aid of an act of parliament at a great expense perfected a work which had been begun above  00 years before they cut a new chanel for the water cross which they placed sluices or floodgates through the lowermost of those gates they let in the flowing tide the ebb of which immediately shuts the gate and that keeps up a body of water for about two miles sufficient to carry up the vessels so far in their way at which place another of those gates shuts after the vessel is past it by capsterns there fixed for that purpose it must be considered that the floor of the dyke is thus far on a level and consequently the water of an equal depth without the inconvenience of any current the lower sluice being shut as before  the whole declivity from the quay at exeter to the lowermost floodgate at topsham which gives the river its current is about eight or ten feet all which is sunk at once here above this second sluice and therefore in order to bring up ships over this fall it was necessary that a third floodgate should be added which is accordingly done at about  00 feet from the former and now the ship being between these two floodgates the lower being kept shut the uppermost of the two is opened and by this means the water between them raised to a level with that of the remainder of the dyke above and the ship by this contrivance floats freely over the rising ground and thence on the fresh water for the tide is of no farther use for about two miles more which brings her to the head of the works where there is another floodgate and this ponds the whole river so as to throw the waste water over a strong stone weir into its natural chanel the water so kept back by this uppersluice and the weir makes a stagnant pool above and here the vessels lie at their moorings and unload at a quay adjoining to the city walls  semper fidelis is the motto to the city arms and how just a title they have thereto will appear from their behavior when they have been attacked by the enemies of their lawful sovereign of which take the following short sketch    when the town was quitted by the romans the citizens defended it against the saxons for their then lawful masters the britons and held it out for  00 years after the eastern parts of the island had submitted    when they had been compelled to admit the saxons into a sort of coordinate power with them they courageously withstood the danes and though at last overcome by them they took the first opportunity and joined with king alfred who with their assistance routed the danes    after this as long as they were able they upheld a share of government with the saxons until king athelstane wholly subdued them and as beforementioned fortified the town with a wall and gates this generous prince was so well pleased with their bravery that he granted them many privileges and immunities    in the year     the citizens again defended themselves stoutly against the danes who came upon them by sea but landed and formed a camp on the northside thereof in a place called danescastle to this day where their trenches are yet to be seen    the town held out for a month against swain king of denmark and was at last taken by treachery    when william the conqueror came against it the citizens defended themselves until a part of the city wall fell down    the loyal townsmen took part with maud their undoubted sovereign against king stephen and were at last reduced by famine    in      the earl of devon came before it in behalf of the then rightful claimant king edw iv and the citizens delivered it up sending away the lords and others of the lancastrian party to calais    they showed their loyalty to king henry vii by defending the town against perkin warbeck the pretender of that time in testimony whereof that king gave them the sword and cap which regalia are no small part of their pomp to this day   0 the rebellious commons of devon and cornwall met with a very stout resistance here and though grievously pinched with famine the town held it out until the  th of august when they were relieved by the lord russel in memory of which that is still a gaudyday and a sermon is preached yearly on the occasion by the mayors chaplain     in the grand rebellion it was twice besieged and held out for the royal cause until the kings affairs grew everywhere desperate and as soon as general monk appeared in opposition to the illegal powers the citizens assembled themselves and declared for a free parliament     when the prince of orange landed at torbay and sent a detachment to take possession of this city the inhabitants received them but coldly and though they knew themselves incapable of making any resistance and were as sensible as other parts of the kingdom of the danger they were in from arbitrary power yet were they very tender of joining in any affair that might be construed a rebellion to their lawful prince  to the account of religious houses and lands formerly appropriated thereto let me add here the priory of polesloe and that of cowick each of them but one mile from exeter at a greater distance but must be mentioned here or not at all canonsleigh canonsteing indio and larger than either of these the abbey of buckfastleigh part of whose ruins are yet to be seen and not one instance is there amongst them all that contradicts my former observations in relation to the goodness of the soil  near the mouth of the river exe on the west banks thereof is powderhamcastle now and for many ages past the seat of a family of courtenays descendants from the earl of devon of that name this seat built in the manner of a castle is a very grand piece of antiquity and was the work of isabel the daughter of baldwin de rivers and widow of william de fortibus in the reign of king henry iii  halldown is a pretty large dry heathy common of about seven miles in length and about three in breadth which though separated by some enclosed grounds of a pretty good nature seems to be the same vein of land of which the forest of dartmore and the downy part of ashburton ilsington bridford etc consist  on the north and quite home to the brink of this down is that rich track of land which i have already described as part of the most fertile soil in this county  though this down is in itself a very flinty barren soil yet is its situation so delightful the open prospect both by sea and land so engaging and the whole circuit thereof so adapted to rural recreations that the like number of gentlemens seats as lie round the skirts thereof within so little compass of ground are not to be met with at any place that i know of save only about london which is not only a confirmation of what i have observed but a very great addition to the delight arising from the large extent of the view  and here it cannot be foreign to my subject to insert the names of those genteel habitations and that of their several worthy owners and possessors    ugbrook the lord clifford baron of chudleigh a family of great honor

seat of    petre ancestor of the present lord petre exeter is particularly famous for two things which we seldom find united in the same town viz that it is full of gentry and yet full of trade and manufactures  the sergemarket held here every week is very well worth a strangers seeing and next to the brigg market at leeds in yorkshire is the greatest in england the people assured me that at this market is generally sold from  0 to  0 to  0 and sometimes a hundred thousand pounds value in serges in a week  the exe or esk is a very considerable river and the principal in the whole county and by the contrivance we have mentioned ships of   0 tons now come up to the city  exeter drives a very great correspondence with holland as also directly to portugal spain and italy shipping off vast quantities of their woollen manufactures especially to holland the dutch giving very large commissions here for the buying of serges perpetuanas and such goods which are made not only in and about exeter but at crediton honiton culliton st mary ottery newtonbushell ashburton and especially at tiverton cullumpton bampton and all the northeast part of the county which part is as it may be said fully employed the people made rich and the poor well maintained by it some are of opinion however that exeter has of late years visibly diminished in its trade some part of which has it is said removed itself to other quarters  on the northside of the castle and which was formerly its counterscarp is a very beautiful terracewalk bounded by a double row of fine elms and extended round one quarter of the city viz from the eastgate to the northgate this for the fineness of the air length of the walk and the landschape in view is not perhaps inferior to any thing of the kind in england  this county and this part of it in particular has been famous for the birth of several persons eminent as well for learning and arts as for war particularly   sir william petre who was secretary of state and privycounsellor to king henry viii edward vi queen mary and queen elizabeth and seven times sent ambassador into foreign countries    sir thomas bodley famous and of grateful memory to all learned men and lovers of letters for his collecting and establishing the best library in britain which is now at oxford and is called after his name the bodleian library    sir francis drake born at plymouth    sir walter raleigh    the learned mr richard hooker author of the ecclesiastical polity etc    dr arthur duck a civilian well known by his works among the learned advocates of doctors commons    dr john moreman of southold famous for being the first clergyman in england who ventured to teach his parishioners the lords prayer creed and ten commandments in the english tongue and reading them publicly in the parish church of mayenhennet in this county of which he was vicar    dr john de brampton a man of great learning who flourished in the reign of henry vi was famous for being the first that read aristotle publicly in the university of cambridge and for writing several learned books which are now lost    peter blundel a clothier who built the free school at tiverton and endowed it very handsomely   0 sir john glanvill a noted lawyer and one of the judges of the common pleas     sergeant glanvill his son as great a lawyer as his father     sir john maynard an eminent lawyer of later years one of the commissioners of the great seal under king william iii all these three were born at tavistock     sir peter king recorder of london lord chief justice of the common pleas several years lord highchancellor of england and created a peer of this realm     general monk the great instrument in the restoration of our civil and ecclesiastical government laws and liberty     the great duke of marlborough captain general of the english forces in q annes wars  i shall take the north part of this county in my return from cornwall so i must now lean to the southcoast for in going on indeed we go southwest  about    miles from exeter and through newtonbushel a large but meanly built market town we go into the ancient town of totness on the river dart it was formerly of great note and still is a pretty good town and has some trade but has more gentlemen in it than tradesmen of note they have a very fine stone bridge here over the river which being within   or   miles of the sea is very large and the tide flows  0 or    feet at the bridge here we had the diversion of seeing them catch fish with the assistance of a dog in this manner on the south side of the river and on a slip or narrow cut or chanel made on purpose stands a cornmill the milltail or floor for the water below the wheels is wharfed up on either side with stone above high water mark and for above  0 or  0 feet in length below it on that part of the river toward the sea at the end of this wharfing is a grating of wood the cross bars of which stand bearing inward sharp at the end and pointing toward one another as the wires of a mousetrap  when the tide flows up the fish can with ease go in between the points of these crossbars but the mill being shut down they can go no farther upwards and when the water ebbs again are left behind not being able to pass the points of the grating which like a mousetrap keeps them in so that they are left at the bottom with about a foot or a foot and half water we were carried hither at low water where we saw about  0 or  0 small salmon from    to  0 inches long which the country people call salmon peal and to catch these they throw in a net on a hoop at the end of a pole the pole going cross the hoop which in some places they call a shove net the net being fixed at one end of the place they put in a dog who is taught his trade beforehand at the other end and he drives all the fish into the net so that only holding the net still in its place the man took up two or threeandthirty salmon peal at the first time  of these we had six for our dinner for which they asked a shilling only and for such sized fish and not so fresh i have seen   s   d each given at a london fishmarket whither they are sometimes brought from chichester by landcarriage they have also delicate trouts here  this excessive plenty of so good fish other provisions being cheap in proportion makes the town of totness a very good place to live in especially for such as have large families and but small estates and many such are said to come into those parts on purpose for saving money  this town made itself remarkable for the address of the inhabitants to king george i on the union of the emperor and king of spain by the treaty of vienna they professed their zeal and loyalty to his person and when the good town of totness had but a very insignificant share of property assured the king of their readiness to grant not only   s a pound land tax but to give into the bargain the other    s if his majestys service required it together with several other extravagant declarations of zeal and ostentation which made them the subject of ridicule all over the kingdom for being so lavish in their professions when as a corporation they had little or nothing to give  about ten miles north of totness lies ashburton a good market town and thoroughfare from exeter to plymouth this is one of the four stannary towns for the county of devon and lies but a little way in from the forest of dartmore the principal trade of this town and indeed all the towns and villages in the whole county is in the woollen manufacture  the three other stannary towns are tavistock plympton and chagford the last of which is a very poor inconsiderable place and neither that nor plympton are capable of entertaining the suitors if the lord warden should be ever inclined to adjourn the court thither  and now having mentioned this court of stannary it may not be improper to give a further description thereof  by diverse charters granted to the tinners by king edward i etc the court is to be held at crockeren torr a noted hill and rock in the middle of the forest far distant from any house the lord warden of the stannaries is the judge of this court on whose summons the jurors appear who are generally gentlemen within the jurisdiction i had my information from a gentleman who if i mistake not told me he had served as a juror and that when the earl of bath was lord warden and held a court there he was attended by  00 gentlemen well mounted  at this desolate place where no refreshment is to be had but what the company bring with them no shelter from the weather nor any thing to sit upon but a moorstone bench the court is called but then the next act of the steward is to adjourn to one of the stannary towns usually tavistock and the company immediately makes the best of their way thither  at this court in former times when the tin mines in this county were in a flourishing state a great deal of business was dispatched the price of the tin was fixed differences in relation to the works adjusted and acts made for regulation of every thing relating thereto several presentiments of the jurors are printed and this meeting is vulgarly called the parliament for the stannaries the place of meeting in the forest the parliament house and the presentment of the jurors acts of parliament  the abbey of tavistock the priory at plympton and the monastery at buckland monachorum were very large endowments and their site well establishes the observation i have several times before made in relation to the fertility of the soil where those orders of men generally seated themselves an observation i have made rather to confirm that of other writers than as matter of wonder or reflection for would it not be strange if the ecclesiastics should not be as capable of choosing for themselves as other people or that they should choose the worst if they might have the best  at tavistock i saw some stately remains of that grand building and among other things part of the butments of the arch of a bridge over the tavy which the inhabitants call guilebridge and relate the following story viz that one child owner of the manor of plymstock made his will and gave the said lands to the church where his body should be buried and that afterward hunting in the forest he lost his company and his way and though as his last shift he killed his horse and got into the warm belly of him he at length died there with the extremity of cold the body after some search was found by the tavistoch men who had by some means come to the knowledge of his will and by them carried away toward their abbey the plymstock men hearing thereof lay in ambush for them at a bridge where they apprehended they must pass but in this they were deceived for the priests built a slight bridge on purpose over which they carried the corpse by which statagem they obtained the said land and hence says the tradition this is called guilebridge  from totness we went still south about seven miles all in view of the river to dartmouth a town of note seated at the mouth of the river dart where it empties itself into the sea at a very narrow but safe entrance the opening into dartmouth harbor is not broad but the chanel deep enough for the biggest ship in the royal navy the sides of the entrance are high mounded with rocks without which just at the first narrowing of the passage stands a good strong fort beyond a platform of guns which commands the port  the narrow entrance is not much above half a mile and then it opens and makes a basin or harbor able to receive  00 sail of ships where they may ride with the greatest safety and the entrance may be chained up on occasion i went out in a boat to view this entrance and the castle or fort that commands it and coming back with the tide of flood i observed some small fish to skip and play upon the surface of the water upon which i asked what fish they were immediately one of the rowers or seamen started up in the boat and throwing his arms abroad as if he had been mad cries out as loud as he could bawl a scool a scool the word was taken on the shore as hastily as it would have been on land if he had cried fire and by that time we reached the quays the town was all in a kind of an uproar  the matter was that a great shoal or as they call it a scool of pilchards came swimming with the tide directly out of the sea into the harbor the boatowner lamented his being unprepared for them for he said that if he could but have had a day or twos warning he might have taken  00 tun of them in short nobody was ready for them except a small fishingboat or two one of which went into the middle of the harbor and at two or three hawls took about  0000  it was observed that beyond the mouth of the harbor was a whole army of porpoises which it seems pursued these pilchards and it is probable drove them into the harbor the scool drove up the river a great way even as high as totness bridge as we heard afterward so that the country people who had boats and nets caught as many as they knew what to do with  dartmouth is situated on the west side of this basin or harbor in a kind of a semicircle on the ascent of a steep hill which though large and populous is but meanly built yet the quay is large and the street before it spacious here live some very flourishing merchants who trade very prosperously and to the most considerable trading ports of spain portugal italy and the plantations but especially to newfoundland and from thence to spain and italy with fish and they drive a good trade also in their own fishery of pilchards which is hereabouts carried on with the greatest number of vessels of any port in the west except falmouth  dartmouth like other towns in devonshire is full of dissenters who have here a very large meeting house the french burnt it in richard is time and attempted it afterward but were bravely repulsed and chiefly by the women who fought desperately and took monsieur castle their general three lords and twentythree knights prisoners and made a great slaughter among them besides but how this glorious action fell to the share of the women and whether the men were inactive or absent is not mentioned  a little to the southward of this town and to the east of the port is torbay a very good road for ships about twelve miles in circuit though sometimes especially with a southerly or southeast wind ships have been obliged to quit the bay and put out to sea or run into dartmouth for shelter  in the bottom of this bay is a beautiful well built and finelysituated house called torrabbey formerly a religious house but now the inheritance of  carry esquire vespasian is said to have landed here when he came to attack arviragus king of britain and here it was that king william iii entered with a fleet of  000 transports and  0 sail of men of war under the conduct of admiral herbert since lord torrington  about three miles to the west of dartmouth is a little fishingtown called brixham remarkable for a spring of water that ebbs and flows very sensibly a description of which may not be unacceptable especially as the account i give of it is the result of my own observations for i had so much patience as to sit by it for fourteen hours together and carefully observe its periods and the quantity of its ebbing and flowing  the situation of this spring is pretty near the foot of a large ridge of hills and the quantity of water that flows from it is considerable it falls into a large basin where it is very easy to observe by lying in an inclining plain the perpendicular height of its ebbing and flowing as well as the time between high and low water  by a careful observation of a great number of fluxes and refluxes i find that when it proceeds regularly as it does sometimes for eight hours together it is eleven times in an hour for thus the  0th of july      i observed it high water at  h    in the morning and continued to observe it until  h   in the afternoon in which interval of seven hours it had ebbed and flowed exactly seventyseven times  there happens sometimes an intermission of those ebbings and flowings for in the morning of the same day i observed that from  h    to  h    it had no motion at all and at another time i found it to intermit for an hour or more  the basin which receives the water contains as i guess about twenty feet in area and the perpendicular height of the flowing when i observed it which was in the middle of summer and at a dry season was various viz sometimes an inch and three quarters and at other times not above half an inch but generally about one inch and one eighth  the reader will be rather pleased with this description as it may in some measure confirm that ingenious and very probable hypothesis which was read by dr atwell before the royal society and is published in their transactions touching reciprocating springs and of this which is called laywell in particular  from dartmouth we went to plympton beforementioned as a poor town though it was formerly of great account and the glory of the ancient earls of devon where are tenures at this day called castleguard for defending and repairing the walls of the castle which however is now in ruins from thence the road lies to plymouth distance about six miles  plymouth is indeed a town of consideration and importance the situation of it is between two very large inlets of the sea and in the bottom of a large sound or bay which is encompassed on every side with hills and the shore generally steep and rocky though the anchorage is good and it is pretty safe rideing in the entrance to this bay lies a large and most dangerous rock which at high water is covered but at lowtide lies bare where many a good ship has been lost when they have thought all their dangers at an end  upon this rock which was called the eddystone from its situation the ingenious mr winstanley whom i have mentioned before p  0  undertook to build a lighthouse for the direction of sailors and with great art and expedition finished it which work considering its height the magnitude of its building and the little hold there was to fasten it to the rock stood to admiration and bore out many a bitter storm  mr winstanley often visited and frequently strengthened the building by new works and was so confident of its firmness and stability that he usually said to those who doubted its standing in hard weather that he only desired to be in it when a storm should happen  but in the dreadful tempest of nov      0  when he happened to be so unhappy as to have his wish he would fain have been on shore making signals for help but no boats durst go off to him and in the morning after the storm nothing was to be seen but the bare rock the lighthouse being gone in which mr winstanley and all that were with him perished and a few days after a merchants ship called the winchelsea homewardbound from virginia not knowing the lighthouse was down ran foul of the rock and was lost with all her ladeing and most of her men but there is now another lighthouse built on the same rock by the corporation of trinityhouse in pursuance of an act of parliament passed in the fifth of queen anne  as plymouth lies in the bottom of this sound in the center between the two waters so there lies against it in the same position an island which they call st nicolas on which is a castle that commands the entrance into hamouze and indeed that also into catwater in some sort on the shore over against this island is the citadel of plymouth a small but regular fortification inaccessible by sea but not exceeding strong by land except that they say the works are of a stone hard as marble and would not soon yield to the batteries of an enemy but that is a language our modern engineers laugh at it is surrounded with a deep trench out of which was dug the stone that built the whole citadel which is about three quarters of a mile in circumference and has  00 great guns on its walls which stand thickest toward the sea several guns are also planted on part of the old fort lying almost level with the water all which gives the greatest security to the ships in the harbor  the town stands above the citadel upon the same rock and lies sloping on the side of it toward the east the inlet of the sea which is called catwater and is a harbor capable of receiving any number of ships and of any size washing the eastern shore of the town where they have a kind of natural mole or haven with a quay and all other conveniences for bringing in vessels for loading and unloading nor is the trade carried on here inconsiderable in itself  the other inlet of the sea as i term it is on the other side of the town and is called hamouze being the mouth of the river tamar a considerable river which parts the two counties of devon and cornwall here the war with france making it necessary that the ships of war should have a retreat nearer hand than at portsmouth the late king william ordered a wet dock with yards dry docks launches and conveniences of all kinds for building and repairing of ships to be built these wet and dry docks are about two miles up the hamouze and for the neatness and excellency of the work exceed all that were ever built of the kind being hewn out of a mine of slate and lined with portland stone the dry dock is built after the mould of a firstrate man of war and the wet dock will contain five of the same bigness what followed these as it were of course was the building of storehouses and warehouses for the rigging sails naval and military stores etc of such ships as may be appointed to be laid up there with very handsome houses for the commissioners clerks and officers of all kinds usual in the kings yards to dwell in it is in short now become as complete an arsenal or yard for building and fitting out men of war as any the government are masters of and perhaps much more convenient than some of them though not so large and this has occasioned a proportional increase of buildings to the town  here are two fine churches and two or three meeting houses for dissenters and french refugees as also a free school and an hospital for bluecoat boys  opposite to this place on the other side hamouze is situated mount edgcumbe the seat of richard edgcumbe esquire deemed one of the noblest prospects in england overlooking at once the sea the harbor citadel and town of plymouth and the county adjacent for a great way  from plymouth we pass the tamar over a ferry to saltash a little poor shattered town the first we set foot on in the county of cornwall the tamar here is very wide and the ferryboats bad so that i thought myself well off when i got safe on shore in cornwall  mr carew published in the reign of king james i a very judicious survey of this county dedicated to sir walter raleigh the reader may there inform himself in a very particular manner of its natural history and the produce customs and rarities which it abounds with among other curiosities he may there find complete lists of the knights fees barons knights and men at arms together with the survey of the acres taken by solomon de roff and his fellows justices itinerant at launceston in the reign of king edward i by which survey it appears that this county contained at that time      acres and the author tells us that a cornish acre or one fourth part of a knights fee contained nine farthings land each of which was as he thinks about thirty of our statute acres if all this be true then that county contained at that time one million and five hundred thousand acres which is more by one third than it is now estimated to be and does in some measure strengthen the conjecture that a great part of the land on this coast is devoured by the sea and that the scilly rocks were formerly a part of the land though now ten leagues distant  among the natural productions of this county ought not to be omitted their slate the best in europe for covering of houses the moorstone which by a very laborious polishing a matter very lately attempted equals in beauty the egyptian granate i take no notice of the gold silver copper tin lead the marble agat coral and even diamonds which are here found because these have been observed by all who mention the productions of this western county and for the same reason shall omit the manner of their working their mines and refining the ore  the inhabitants have been remarkable for their strength of body witness among numberless others john bray who carried on his back six bushels of meal of fifteen gallons to the bushel and the miller a man of twentyfour years of age on the top of it also john roman who carried at one time the whole carcass of an ox  saltash seems to be the ruins of a larger place it is governed by a mayor and aldermen has many privileges sends members to parliament has the sole oysterfishing in the whole river which is considerable it has also jurisdiction upon the river tamar down to the mouth of the port so that they claim anchorage of all small ships that enter the river their coroner sits upon all bodies that are found drowned in the river and the like here is a good market and it is very much benefited by the increase of the inhabitants of plymouth as lying near the dock at the mouth of hamoze for those people choose rather to go to saltash to market by water than to walk to plymouth by land for their provisions because first as they go in the townboat the same boat brings home what they buy so that it is much less trouble secondly because provisions are bought much cheaper at saltash than at plymouth and of late they have some ships that use the newfoundland fishery  there is no other town up the tamar till we come to launceston the county town which i shall take in my return except kellington a pretty good market and portreve town where is a good markethouse and a neat church which as well as the other buildings in the town are in good condition so i turned west keeping the south shore of the county to the landsend  from saltash i went to leskard about seven miles this is a considerable town well built has people of fashion in it and a very great market it is one of the five stannary towns and was once still more eminent and had a good castle and a large house where the ancient dukes of cornwall kept their court it also enjoyed several considerable privileges especially by the favor of the black prince who as prince of wales and duke of cornwall resided here and in return they say this town and the country round it raised a great body of stout young fellows who entered into his service and followed his fortunes in his wars but these buildings are so decayed that there are now scarce any of the ruins of the castle or of the princes court remaining here was also anciently a chapel much resorted to by pilgrims in popish times and in the town is a fountain of very clear water to which many miraculous cures were attributed  it still boasts of its guild or town hall on which is a turret with a fine clock a good free school well provided a very fine conduit in the marketplace an ancient large church dedicated to st martin and a large newbuilt meeting house for the dissenters which i name because they assured me there were but three more and those inconsiderable in all the county of cornwall whereas in devonshire which is the next county there are reckoned about  0 some of which are exceeding large and fine  this town is also remarkable for the defeat of the parliament army by sir ralph hopton and for a very great trade in all manfactures of leather such as boots shoes gloves purses breeches etc and some spinning of late years is set up here encouraged by the woollen manufacturers of devonshire  between these two towns of saltash and leskard is the borough of st germans now a village decayed and without any market but the largest parish in the whole county in the bounds of which are contained    villages and the town of saltash among them for saltash church it seems was but a chapel of ease to st germans it has been anciently a bishops see which was translated from bodmyn hither and afterward from st germans to crediton then one of the best towns in the county and thence to exeter this town takes its name from st german bishop of auxerre in burgundy who came over from france to preach against the heresy of pelagius which then began to spread in england and took up his residence here the ruins of the episcopal palace at cuttenbeck a mile and half from the town which afterward dwindled into a farmhouse are still visible a gentleman of the name of elliott was lately a great benefactor to this town having endowed a public school there repaired the sessions house and beautified the church where he was buried and has a fine italian partycolored marble monument erected to his memory by his widow there is still an episcopal chair in the church and several other seats belonging to canons the town stands on a rising ground and is built in the form of an amphitheatre  in the neighborhood of these towns are many pleasant seats of cornish gentry who are indeed very numerous and the most sociable generous and kind neighbors to one another that are to be found and usually intermarry among themselves from whence they say the proverb that all the cornish gentlemen are cousins it is the very same in wales where the greatest compliment that one gentleman can make to another of the same county is to call him cousin there is a great conformity of manners customs and usages between the welsh and cornish who are accounted of the same origin and descendants also of the ancient britons and there is likewise a great affinity between the old cornish and welsh language  on the hills north of leskard and in the way between that town and launceston are many tin mines and some of the richest veins of that metal in the whole county which when cast at the blowinghouses into blocks are sent to leskard to be coined  from leskard in our course west we are necessarily carried to the seacoast because of the river fowey which empties itself into the sea at a very large mouth and hereby this river rising in the middle of the breadth of the county and running south and the river camel rising not far from it and running north with a like large chanel the land from bodmyn to the western part of the county is almost made an island and in a manner cut off from the eastern the isthmus or neck of land between being not above twelve miles over  in the parish of st clear is a piece of antiquity which they call the other halfstone which are indeed two stones fixed in the ground and by mortaises in each they seem to have been heretofore joined together both of them were curiously wrought by diaperworkcarvings but one of them has an inscription in very antique characters as follows inscription on stone which seem to express thus much doniert rogavit pro anima implying that dungarth or doniert king of cornwall who was drowned a d     gave this land for the good of his soul  not far distant is a heap of large stones under which lies a great stone fashioned like a cheese and seems to the eye as if it were pressed into that form by the weight that lies upon it and hence they call it wringcheese  on the south from leskard we come to foy or fowey an ancient boroughtown and formerly very large and potent for the foyens as they were then called were able to fit out large fleets not only for merchants ships but even of men of war and with these not only fought with but several times vanquished and routed the squadron of the cinqueport men who in those days were very powerful  mr camden observes that the town of foy quarters some part of the arms of every one of those cinque ports with their own intimating that they had at several times triumphed over them all and indeed they were once so powerful that they fitted out their fleets against the french and took several of their men of war when they were at variance with england and enriching their town by the spoil of their enemies  edward iv favored them much and because the french threatened to come up their river with a powerful navy to burn their town he caused two forts to be built at the public charge for its security the ruins of which are still to be seen but the same king edward was some time after so disgusted at the townsmen for officiously falling upon the french after a truce was proclaimed that he effectually disarmed them took away their whole fleet ships tackle apparel and furniture and since that time we do not read of any of their naval exploits nor that they ever attempted to recover their strength at sea however foy at this time is a very fair town it lies extended on the east sid of the river for above a mile the buildings fair and there are a great many flourishing merchants in it who have a great share in the fishingtrade especially for pilchards in this town is also a coinage for the tin of which a great quantity is dug up in the country north and west of the town the church at fowey is ancient and very fine  the river fowey which is very broad and deep here was formerly very navigable by ships of good burden as high as the boroughtown of lestwithiel an ancient and once a flourishing but now a decayed place and as to trade and navigation quite destitute which is occasioned by the river being filled up with sand  lestwithiel was called in the british times pen uehel coed i e an high place with wood it became since the ancient residence of the dukes of cornwall the ruins of a castle belonging to them are still to be seen on a rising ground at a little distance from the town the church is an handsome edifice but the steeple carries the marks of the civil wars in the reign of charles i when the great hall and exchequer of the said dukes of cornwall were also utterly defaced some say this town was formerly the county town and still retains several advantages which supports its figure as   that it is one of the coinage or stannary towns   the common gaol for the whole stannary is here as are also the county courts for cornwall  there is a mock cavalcade kept up at this town which is very remarkable the particulars as they are related by mr carew in his survey of cornwall take as follows  upon little easter sunday the freeholders of this town and manor by themselves or their deputies did there assemble amongst whom one as it fell to his lot by turn bravely apparelled gallantly mounted with a crown on his head a scepter in his hand and a sword borne before him and dutifully attended by all the rest also on horseback rode through the principal street to the church the curate in his best beseen solemnly received him at the churchyard style and conducted him to hear divine service after which he repaired with the same pomp to a house provided for that purpose made a feast to his attendants kept the tablesend himself and was served with kneeling assay and all other rights due to the estate of a prince with which dinner the ceremony ended and every man returned home again the pedigree of this usage is derived from so many descents of ages that the cause and author outreach remembrance howbeit these circumstances afford a conjecture that it should betoken royalties appertaining to the honor of cornwall  behind foy and nearer to the coast at the mouth of a small river which some call lo though without any authority stand two boroughtowns opposite to one another bearing the name of east lo and west lo these are both good trading towns and especially for fish and which is very particular are like weymouth and melcomb in dorsetshire separated only by the creek or river and yet each of them sends members to parliament these towns are joined together by a very beautiful and stately stone bridge having    arches  east lo was the antienter corporation of the two and some ages ago the greater and more considerable town but now they tell us west lo is the richest and has the most ships belonging to it but has neither church or chapel nor meeting house in it were they put together they would make a very handsome seaport town  passing from hence and ferrying over foy river we come into a large country without many towns in it of note but very well furnished with gentlemens seats and a little higher up with tin works  the sea making several deep bays here they who travel by land are obliged to go higher into the country to pass above the water especially at trewardrethbay which lies very broad above ten miles within the country which passing at trewardreth a town of no great note though the bay takes its name from it the next inlet of the sea is the famous firth or inlet called falmouth haven it is certainly next to milford haven in south wales the fairest and best road for shipping that is in the whole isle of britain whether we consider the depth of water for above  0 miles within land the safety of riding sheltered from all kind of winds or storms the good anchorage and the many creeks all navigable where ships may run in and be safe  there are six or seven very considerable places upon this haven and the rivers from it viz grampound tregony truro penryn falmouth st mawes and pendennis the four first of these send members to parliament although the town of falmouth as big as all of them together truro excepted and richer than ten such sends none but how so considerable a seaport and town comes to be debarred that privilege does not appear it is certain that a great number of small inconsiderable boroughs in this county do now enjoy it but until the  th of edward vi none but launceston leskard lestwithiel truro bodmyn helston and bossiney sent any and whether it were then imposed on the rest as a punishment or conferred as a favor is uncertain i cannot agree with those who think it was obtained at their request by the interest of their duke because they were invested with it by king edward vi and queen elizabeth when no person bore that title  st mawes and pendennis or pendinas which signifies in the old british the end or head of a city are two fortifications placed at the points or entrance of this haven opposite to one another though not with a communication or view they are very strong the former principally by sea having a good platform of guns pointing thwart the chanel and planted on a level with the water but pendennis castle is strong by land as well as by water is regularly fortified has good outworks and generally a strong garrison and each of them has a governor  st mawes otherwise called st marys has a town annexed to the castle and is a borough sending members to parliament but has neither church chapel meeting house fair or market in it  the town of falmouth is by much the richest and best trading town in this county though not so ancient as its neighbor town of truro and indeed is in some things obliged to acknowledge its seigniority and the truro men receive several duties collected in falmouth particularly wharfage for the merchandises landed or shipped off but the town of falmouth has gotten the trade at least the best part of it from the other which is chiefly owing to the situation for lying upon the sea but within the entrance ships of the greatest burden come up to the very quay and the whole royal navy might ride safely in the road whereas the town of truro lying far within and at the mouth of two fresh rivers is not navigable for vessels of above   0 tons or thereabouts the trade at truro being chiefly if not altogether for the shipping off of block tin and copper ore the latter being lately found in large quantities in some of the mountains between truro and st michaels and which is much improved since the several mills are erected at bristol and other parts for the manufactures of batteryware as it is called  falmouth is well built has abundance of shipping belonging to it is full of rich merchants and has an increasing trade because of the setting up of late years the english packets between this port and lisbon which occasions a new commerce between portugal and this town amounting to a very great value  it is true part of this trade was founded in a clandestine commerce carried on by the said packets at lisbon where being the kings ships and claiming the privilege of not being searched or visited by the customhouse officers they found means to carry off great quantities of british manufactures which they sold on board to the portuguese merchants and they conveyed them on shore as it is supposed without paying custom  but the government there getting intelligence of it and complaint being made in england also where it was found to be prejudicial to the fair merchant that trade has been effectually stopped but the falmouth merchants having by this means gotten a taste of the portuguese trade have maintained it ever since in ships of their own these packets bring over vast quantities of gold in specie either in moidores or in bars of gold on account of the merchants at london  the customhouse for all the towns in this port and the headcollector is established at this town where the duties including those of the other ports are very considerable here is also a very great fishing for pilchards and the merchants of falmouth have the chiefest stroke in that gainful trade  truro though it gives place to falmouth is however a considerable town it stands up the water northandbyeast from falmouth in the utmost extended branch of the haven at the conflux of two rivers which though not of any long course have a very good appearance for a port and make a large wharf between them in the front of the town and the water here makes a very good port for small ships though it be at the influx but not for ships of burden there are at least three churches in it but no dissenters meeting house that i could hear of  tregony or tregenen which in british signifies the mouthtown is a boroughtown upon the same water northeast from falmouth distant about    miles from it but is a town of very little trade nor indeed have any of the towns so far within the shore notwithstanding the benefit of the water any considerable trade but what is carried on under the merchants of falmouth or truro  grampound is a market town and borough about four miles farther up the water this place indeed has a claim to antiquity and is an appendix to the duchy of cornwall of which it holds at a freefarm rent and pays to the prince of wales as duke  0 l    s   d per annum it has no parish church but only a chapel of ease to an adjacent parish here are some remains to be seen of the famous coedfala which in the british signifies felonwood granted with all the lands in it to the town in king edward iiis time  penryn another boroughtown is up the same branch of the haven as falmouth but stands four miles higher toward the west upon a hill yet ships come to it of as great a size as can come to truro it is a very pleasant agreeable town and for that reason has many merchants in it who would perhaps otherwise live at falmouth the chief commerce of these towns as to their seaaffairs is the pilchards and newfoundland fishing which is very profitable to them all it had formerly a conventual church with a chantry and a religious house a cell to kirton but they are all demolished and scarce the ruins of them distinguishable enough to know one part from another this town is full of orchards and looks like a town in a wood the sea embraces it on each side its name is british as all those words beginning with pen and tree and lan which occur often in this county are  quitting falmouth haven from penryn west we came to helston another boroughtown at about seven miles distance it stands upon the little river cober which however admits the sea so into its bosom as to make a tolerable good harbor for ships a little below the town it is the fifth town allowed for the coining tin and several of the ships called tin ships are laden here  this town is large and populous and has four spacious streets an handsome church and a good trade beyond this is a market town though of no resort for trade called marketjew it lies indeed on the seaside but has no harbor or safe road for shipping  at helford is a small but good harbor between falmouth and this port where many times the tin ships go in to load for london also here are a good number of fishing vessels for the pilchard trade and abundance of skilful fishermen  pensance in british pensand i e the head or end of the sand is the farthest town of any note west being     miles from london and within about ten miles of the promontory called the landsend so that this promontory is from london     miles or thereabouts this is a market town of good business well built and populous has a good trade and a great many ships belonging to it notwithstanding it is so remote here are also a great many good families of gentlemen though in this utmost angle of the nation and which is yet more strange the veins of lead tin and copper ore are said to be seen even to the utmost extent of land at low water mark and in the very sea so rich so valuable a treasure is contained in these parts of great britain though they are supposed to be very poor because so remote from london which is the center of our wealth  between this town and st burien a town midway between it and the landsend stands a circular temple of the druids consisting of    stones the distance between each being    feet and a  0th in the center much higher than the rest and are not unlike those at stonehenge in wiltshire the parish where they stand is called biscardwoune from whence the ancient and now noble family of boscawen derives its name  in clear parish in this county six or eight stones of prodigious bigness likewise stand up in a circle a monument of the like nature  these are probably as those at stonehenge and burien remains of druids temples  and we shall mention in this place that at stantondrew in somersetshire is another temple of the druids called the weddings  the maenamber near this town of pensance was also a very remarkable stone which as mr camden tells us though it be of a vast bigness yet might be moved with one finger notwithstanding a great number of men could not remove it from its place it was destroyed as one of the same sort was in fifeshire scotland by one of olivers governors for these reformers had a notion of these works being of a superstitious kind  maen is a british word for a great stone there is one of these stones as dr stukely tells us in derbyshire and mr toland acquaints us that there are also such in ireland as well as wales he gives the following account of this piece of antiquity  at a place called maenamber says he is a heap of stones roundish and of vast bulk but so artificially pitched on flat stones sometimes more sometimes fewer in number that touching the great stone lightly it moves and seems to totter to the great amazement of the ignorant but stirs not at least not sensibly when one uses his whole strength  near pensance but open to the sea is that gulf they call mountsbay named so from a high hill standing in the water which they call st michaels mount the seamen call it only the cornish mount it has been fortified though the situation of it makes it so difficult of access that like the bass in scotland there needs no fortification like the bass too it was once made a gaol for prisoners of state but now it is wholly neglected here is a very good road for shipping which makes the town of pensance a place of good resort  a little up in the country toward the northwest is godolchan which though a hill rather than a town gives name to the ancient and now noble family of godolphin and nearer on the northern coast is ryalton which gives the second title to the earl godolphin this place also is infinitely rich in tin mines  but i must not end this account at the utmost extent of the island of great britain west without visiting those kind of excrescences of the island the rocks of scilly where many good ships are almost continually dashed in pieces and many brave lives lost in spite of the mariners best skill or the lighthouses and other seamarks best notice  these isles called in latin silurum insulae are supposed by some to be the cassiterides of the ancients they lie about  0 miles from the landsend and are a cluster of small islands to the number as some reckon of     scilly was once the chief in estimation but st mary being the fruitfullest and largest though but nine miles about has now the preeminence and it has a very good harbor fortified with a castle built by queen elizabeth these isles were conquered by athelstane one of the saxon kings and from his time they are deemed a part of the county of cornwall  these islands lie so in the middle between the two vast openings of the north and south narrow seas or as the sailors call them the bristol chanel and the chanel so called by way of eminence that it cannot or perhaps never will be avoided but that several ships in the dark of the night and in stress of weather may by being out in their reckonings or other unavoidable accidents mistake and if they do they are sure as the sailors call it to run bump ashore upon scilly where they find no quarter among the breakers but are beat to pieces without any possibility of escape  one can hardly mention the rocks of scilly without letting fall a tear to the memory of sir cloudesly shovel and all the gallant spirits with him who in the admiral ship with three men of war and all their men running upon these rocks right before the wind in a dark night were lost and not a man saved in his return from a fruitless expedition against toulon  they tell us of eleven sail of merchant ships homewardbound and richly laden from the southward who had the like fate in the same place a great many years ago and that some of them coming from spain and having a great quantity of bullion or pieces of eight on board the money frequently drives on shore still and that in good quantities especially after stormy weather  this may be the reason why as we observed during our short stay here several mornings after it had blown something hard in the night the sands were covered with country people running to and fro to see if the sea had cast up any thing of value this the seamen call going a shoring and it seems they often find good purchase sometimes also dead bodies are cast up here the consequence of shipwrecks among those fatal rocks and islands as also broken pieces of ships casks chests and almost every thing that will float or roll on shore by the surges of the sea  nor is it seldom that the savage country people scuffle and fight about the right to what they find and that in a desperate manner so that this part of cornwall may truly be said to be inhabited by a fierce and ravenous people like those on the coast of sussex for they are so greedy and eager for prey that they are charged with strange bloody and cruel dealings even sometimes with one another but especially with poor distressed seamen when they are forced on shore by tempests and seek help for their lives and where they find the rocks themselves not more merciless than the people who range about them for their prey  here also as a farther testimony of the immense riches which have been lost at times upon this coast we found several engineers and projectors with diving engines attempting to recover what had been lost and that not always unsuccessfully  from the tops of the hills on this extremity of the land you may see out into what they call the chaps of the chanel which as it is the greatest inlet of commerce and the most frequented by merchant ships of any place in the world so one seldom looks out to seaward but something new presents of ships passing or repassing either on the great or lesser chanel  this point of the lizard which runs out to the southward and the other promontory mentioned above make the two angles or horns as they are called from whence it is supposed this country received its first name of cornwall or as mr camden says cornubia in the latin and in the british kerneu as running out in two vastly extended horns  the lizard point is still more useful though not so far west than the other which is more properly called the landsend being more frequently first discovered from the sea and is therefore the general guide and the land which the ships choose to make first being then sure that they are past scilly  nature has fortified this part of the island of britain in a strange manner and so as is worth a travellers observation  first there are the islands of scilly and the rocks about them which are placed like outworks to resist the first assaults of this enemy the ocean and so break the force of it as the piles or stirlings as they are called are placed before the solid stonework of london bridge to fence off the force either of the water or ice or any thing else that might be dangerous to the work  then there are a vast number of sunk rocks so the seamen call them besides such as are visible and above water which gradually lessen the quantity of water that would otherwise lie with an infinite weight and force upon the land it is observed that these rocks lie under water for a great way off into the sea on every side the said two horns or points of land so breaking the force of the water and lessening the weight of it  but besides this the whole terra firma or body of the land which makes this part of the isle of britain seems to be one solid rock as if it was formed by nature to resist the otherwise irresistible power of the ocean and indeed if one was to observe with what fury the sea comes on sometimes against the shore here especially at the lizard point where there are but few if any outworks as i call them to resist it how high the waves come rolling forward storming on the back of one another particularly when the wind blows off sea one would wonder that even the strongest rocks themselves should be able to resist and repel them but as i said the country seems to be one great body of stone and prepared so on purpose  and yet as if all this was not enough nature has provided another strong fence and that is that these vast rocks are in a manner cemented together by the solid and weighty ore of tin and copper especially the latter which is plentifully found upon the very outmost edge of the land and with which the stones may be said to be solderd together lest the force of the sea should separate and disjoint them and breaking in upon these fortifications of the island destroy its chief security  this is certain that there is a more than ordinary quantity of tin copper and lead also fixed by the great author of nature in these very remote angles so that the ore is found upon the very surface of the rocks a good way into the sea and does not only lie as it were upon or between the stones among the earth which in that case might be washed from it by the sea but is even blended or mixed in with the stones themselves so that the stones must be split into pieces to come at it by this mixture the rocks are made exceedingly weighty and solid and thereby still the more qualified to repel the force of the sea  upon this remote part of the island we saw great numbers of that famous kind of crows which is known by the name of the cornish chough they are the same kind which are found in switzerland among the alps and which pliny pretended were peculiar to those mountains and calls the pyrrhocorax the body is black the legs feet and bill of a yellow almost to a red i could not find that it was affected for any good quality it had nor is the flesh good to eat for it feeds much on fish and carrion it is counted little better than a kite for it is of a ravenous quality and is very mischievous it will steal and carry away any think it finds about the house that is not too heavy though not fit for its food as knives forks spoons and linen cloths or whatever it can fly away with sometimes they say it has stolen bits of firebrands or lighted candles and lodged them in the stacks of corn and the thatch of barns and houses and set them on fire  i might take up many sheets in describing the valuable curiosities of this little chersonese called the landsend in which lies an immense treasure and many things worth notice besides those to be found upon the surface but i am too near the end of this letter if i have opportunity i shall take notice of some part of what i omit here in my return by the northern shore of the county in the mean time  i am etc  the end of vol i index to the
