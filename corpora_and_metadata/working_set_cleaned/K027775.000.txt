i remember glory built on selfish principles is shame and guilt the deeds that men admire as half divine stark naught because corrupt in their design strange doctrine this that without scruple tears the laurel that the very lightning spares brings down the warriors trophy to the dust and eats into his bloody sword like rust  b i grant that men continuing what they are fierce avaricious proud there must be war and never meant the rule should be applied to him that fights with justice on his side let laurels drenched in pure parnassian dews reward his memory dear to every muse who with a courage of unshaken root in honors field advancing his firm foot plants it upon the line that justice draws and will prevail or perish in her cause it is to the virtues of such men man owes his portion in the good that heaven bestows and when recording history displays feats of renown though wrought in ancient days tells of a few stout hearts that fought and died where duty placed them at their countrys side the man that is not moved with what he reads that takes not fire at their heroic deeds unworthy of the blessings of the brave is base in kind and born to be a slave but let eternal infamy pursue the wretch to naught but his ambition true who for the sake of filling with one blast the post horns of all europe lays her waste think yourself stationd on a towering rock to see a people scattered like a flock some royal mastiff panting at their heels with all the savage thirst a tiger feels then view him selfproclaimd in a gazette chief monster that has plagued the nations yet the globe and scepter in such hands misplaced those ensigns of dominion how disgraced the glass that bids man mark the fleeting hour and deaths own scythe would better speak his power then grace the boney phantom in their stead with the kings shoulder knot and gay cockade cloth the twin brethren in each others dress the same their occupation and success  a it is your belief the world was made for man kings do but reason on the self same plan maintaining yours you cannot theirs condemn who think or seem to think man made for them  b seldom alas the power of logic reigns with much sufficiency in royal brains such reasoning falls like an inverted cone wanting its proper base to stand upon man made for kings those optics are but dim that tell you so  say rather they for him that were indeed a kingenobling thought could they or would they reason as they ought the diadem with mighty projects lined to catch renown by ruining mankind is worth with all its gold and glittering store just what the toy will sell for and no more oh bright occasions of dispensing good how seldom used how little understood to pour in virtues lap her just reward keep vice restrained behind a double guard to quell the faction that affronts the throne by silent magnanimity alone to nurse with tender care the thriving arts watch every beam philosophy imparts to give religion her unbridld scope nor judge by statute a believers hope with close fidelity and love unfeigned to keep the matrimonial bond unstained covetous only of a virtuous praise his life a lesson to the land he sways to touch the sword with conscientious awe nor draw it but when duty bids him draw to sheath it in the peacerestoring close with joy beyond what victory bestows blessed country where these kingly glories shine blessed england if this happiness be thine  a guard what you say the patriotic tribe will sneer and charge you with a bribe  b a bribe the worth of his three kingdoms i defy to lure me to the baseness of a lie and of all lies be that one poets boast the lie that flatters i abhor the most those arts be theirs that hate his gentle reign but he that loves him has no need to feign  a your smooth eulogium to one crown addressed seems to imply a censure on the rest  b quevedo as he tells his sober tale asked when in hell to see the royal jail approved their method in all other things but where good sir do you confine your kings there  said his guide the groupe is full in view indeed replied the don  there are but few his black interpreter the charge disdained  few fellow there are all that ever reigned wit undistinguishing is apt to strike the guilty and not guilty both alike i grant the sarcasm is too severe and we can readily refute it here while alfreds name the father of his age and the sixth edwards grace the historic page  a kings then at last have but the lot of all by their own conduct they must stand or fall  b true while they live the courtly laureat pays his quitrent ode his peppercorn of praise and many a dunce whose fingers itch to write adds as he can his tributary mite a subjects faults a subject may proclaim a monarchs errors are forbidden game thus free from censure overawed by fear and praised for virtues that they scorn to wear the fleeting forms of majesty engage respect while stalking over lifes narrow stage then leave their crimes for history to scan and ask with busy scorn was this the man i pity kings whom worship waits upon obsequious from the cradle to the throne before whose infant eyes the flattrer bows and binds a wreath about their baby brows whom education stiffend into state and death awakens from that dream too late oh is servility with supple knees whose trade it is to smile to crouch to please if smooth dissimulation skilled to grace a devils purpose with an angels face is smiling peeresses and simpring peers in compassing his throne a few short years if the gilt carriage and the pampered steed that wants no driving and disdains the lead if guards mechanically formed in ranks playing at beat of drum their martial pranks shouldring and standing as if struck to stone while condescending majesty looks on if monarchy consist in such base things sighing i say again i pity kings to be suspected thwarted and withstood even when he labors for his countrys good to see a band called patriot for no cause but that they catch at popular applause careless of all the anxiety he feels hook disappointment on the public wheels with all their flippant fluency of tongue most confident when palpably most wrong if this be kingly then farewell for me all kingship and may i be poor and free to be the table talk of clubs up stairs to which the unwashd artificer repairs to indulge his genius after long fatigue by diving into cabinet intrigue for what kings deem a toil as well they may to him is relaxation and mere play to win no praise when wellwrought plans prevail but to be rudely censured when they fail to doubt the love his favorites may pretend and in reality to find no friend if he indulge a cultivated taste his gallries with the works of art well graced to hear it called extravagance and waste if these attendants and if such as these must follow royalty then welcome ease however humble and confined the sphere happy the state that has not these to fear  a thus men whose thoughts contemplative have dwelt on situations that they never felt start up sagacious covered with the dust of dreaming study and pedantic rust and prate and preach about what others prove as if the world and they were hand and glove leave kingly backs to cope with kingly cares they have their weight to carry subjects theirs poets of all men ever least regret increasing taxes and the nations debt could you contrive the payment and rehearse the mighty plan oracular in verse no bard however majestic old or new should claim my fixed attention more than you  b not brindley nor bridgewater would essay to turn the course of helicon that way nor would the nine consent the sacred tide should purl amidst the traffic of cheapside or tinkle in change alley to amuse the leathern ears of stockjobbers and jews  a vouchsafe at least to pitch the key of rhyme to themes more pertinent if less sublime when ministers and ministerial arts patriots who love good places at their hearts when admirals extolled for standing still or doing nothing with a deal of skill generals who will not conquer when they may firm friends to peace to pleasure and good pay when freedom wounded almost to despair though discontent alone can find out where when themes like these employ the poets tongue ear as mute as if a siren sung or tell me if you can what power maintains a britons scorn of arbitrary chains that were a theme might animate the dead and move the lips of poets cast in lead  b the cause though worth the search may yet elude conjecture and remark however shrewd they take perhaps a welldirected aim who seek it in his climate and his frame liberal in all things else yet nature here with stern severity deals out the year winter invades the spring and often pours a chilling flood on summers drooping flowers unwelcome vapors quench autumnal beams ungenial blasts attending curl the streams the peasants urge their harvest plie the fork with double toil and shiver at their work thus with a rigor for his good designed she rears her favorite man of all mankind his form robust and of elastic tone proportioned well half muscle and half bone supplies with warm activity and force a mind well lodged and masculine of course hence liberty sweet liberty inspires and keeps alive his fierce but noble fires patient of constitutional control he bears it with meek manliness of soul but if authority grow wanton woe to him that treads upon his freeborn toe one step beyond the boundry of the laws fires him at once in freedoms glorious cause thus proud prerogative not much revered is seldom felt though sometimes seen and heard and in his cage like parrot fine and gay is kept to strut look big and talk away born in a climate softer far than ours not formed like us with such herculean powers the frenchman easy debonair and brisk give him his lass his fiddle and his frisk is always happy reign whoever may and laughs the sense of misery far away he drinks his simple bevrage with a gust and feasting on an onion and a crust we never feel the alacrity and joy with which he shouts and carols vive le roy filled with as much true merriment and glee as if he heard his king say  slave be free thus happiness depends as nature shows less on exterior things than most suppose vigilant over all that he has made kind providence attends with gracious aid bids equity throughout his works prevail and weighs the nations in an even scale he can encourage slavery to a smile and fill with discontent a british isle  a freeman and slave then if the case be such stand on a level and you prove too much if all men indiscriminately share his fostring power and tutelary care as well be yoked by despotisms hand as dwell at large in britains charterd land  b no freedom has a thousand charms to show that slaves however contented never know the mind attains beneath her happy reign the growth that nature meant she should attain the varied fields of science ever new opening and wider opening on her view she ventures onward with a prosperous force while no base fear impedes her in her course religion richest favor of the skies stands most revealed before the freemans eyes no shades of superstition blot the day liberty chaces all that gloom away the soul emancipated unoppressd free to prove all things and hold fast the best learns much and to a thousand listening minds communicates with joy the good she finds courage in arms and ever prompt to show his manly forehead to the fiercest foe glorious in war but for the sake of peace his spirits rising as his toils increase guards well what arts and industry have won and freedom claims him for her firstborn son slaves fight for what were better cast away the chain that binds them and a tyrants sway but they that fight for freedom undertake the noblest cause mankind can have at stake religion virtue truth whatever we call a blessing freedom is the pledge of all oh liberty the prisoners pleasing dream the poets muse his passion and his theme genius is thine and thou art fancys nurse lost without thee the ennobling powers of verse heroic song from thy free touch acquires its clearest tone the rapture it inspires place me where winter breathes his keenest air and i will sing if liberty be there and i will sing at libertys dear feet in africs torrid clime or indias fiercest heat  a sing where you please in such a cause i grant an english poets privilege to rant but is not freedom at least is not ours too apt to play the wanton with her powers grow freakish and over leaping every mound spread anarchy and terror all around  b agreed but would you sell or slay your horse for bounding and curvetting in his course or if when ridden with a careless rein he break away and seek the distant plain no his high mettle under good control gives him olympic speed and shoots him to the goal let discipline employ her wholesome arts let magistrates alert perform their parts not skulk or put on a prudential mask as if their duty were a desperate task let active laws apply the needful curb to guard the peace that riot would disturb and liberty preserved from wild excess shall raise no feuds for armies to suppress when tumult lately burst his prison door and set plebeian thousands in a roar when he usurped authoritys just place and dared to look his master in the face when the rude rabbles watchword was destroy and blazing london seemed a second troy liberty blushed and hung her drooping head beheld their progress with the deepest dread blushed that effects like these she should produce worse than the deeds of galleyslaves broke loose she loses in such storms her very name and fierce licentiousness should bear the blame incomparable gem thy worth untold cheap though bloodbought and thrown away  sold may no foes ravish thee and no false friend betray thee while professing to defend prize it ye ministers ye monarchs spare ye patriots guard it with a misers care  a patriots alas the few that have been foun where most they flourish upon english ground the countrys need have scantily supplied and the last left the scene when chatham died  b not so  the virtue still adorns our age though the chief actor died upon the stage in him demosthenes was heard again liberty taught him her athenian strain she clothed him with authority and awe spoke from his lips and in his looks gave law his speech his form his action full of grace and all his country beaming in his face he stood as some inimitable hand would strive to make a paul or tully stand no sycophant or slave that dared oppose her sacred cause but trembled when he rose and every venal stickler for the yoke felt himself crushed at the first word he spoke such men are raised to station and command when providence means mercy to a land he speaks and they appear to him they owe skill to direct and strength to strike the blow to manage with address to seize with power the crisis of a dark decisive hour so gideon earned a victory not his own subserviency his praise and that alone poor england thou art a devoted deer beset with every ill but that of fear the nations hunt all mark thee for a prey they swarm around thee and thou standst at bay undaunted still though wearied and perplexed once chatham saved thee but who saves thee next alas the tide of pleasure sweeps along all that should be the boast of british song it is not the wreath that once adorned thy brow the prize of happier times will serve thee now our ancestry a gallant christian race patterns of every virtue every grace confessed a god they kneeled before they fought and praised him in the victories he wrought now from the dust of ancient days bring forth their sober zeal integrity and worth courage ungracd by these affronts the skies is but the fire without the sacrifice the stream that feeds the wellspring of the heart not more invigorates lifes noblest part than virtue quickens with a warmth divine the powers that sin has brought to a decline  a the inestimable estimate of brown rose like a paperkite and charmed the town but measures planned and executed well shifted the wind that raised it and it fell he trod the very selfsame ground you tread and victory refuted all he said  b and yet his judgment was not framed amiss its error if it erred was merely this  he thought the dying hour already come and a complete recovry struck him dumb but that effeminacy folly lust enervate and enfeeble and needs must and that a nation shamefully debased will be despised and trampled on at last unless sweet penitence her powers renew is truth if history itself be true there is a time and justice marks the date for longforbearing clemency to wait that hour elapsed thincurable revolt is punished and down comes the thunderbolt if mercy then put by the threatening blow must she perform the same kind office now may she and if offended heaven be still accessible and prayer prevail she will it is not however insolence and noise the tempest of tumultuary joys nor is it yet despondence and dismay will win her visits or engage her stay prayer only and the penitential tear can call her smiling down and fix her here but when a country one that i could name in prostitution sinks the sense of shame when infamous venality grown bold writes on his bosom to be let or sold when perjury that heaven defying vice sells oaths by tale and at the lowest price stamps gods own name upon a lie just made to turn a penny in the way of trade when avarice starves and never hides his face two or three millions of the human race and not a tongue enquires how where or when though conscience will have twinges now and then when profanation of the sacred cause in all its parts times ministry and laws bespeaks a land once christian fallen and lost in all that wars against that title most what follows next let cities of great name and regions long since desolate proclaim nineveh babylon and ancient rome speak to the present times and times to come they cry aloud in every careless ear stop while ye may suspend your mad career o learn from our example and our fate learn wisdom and repentance ever too late not only vice disposes and prepares the mind that slumbers sweetly in her snares to stoop to tyrannys usurped command and bend her polished neck beneath his hand a dire effect by one of natures laws unchangeably connected with its cause but providence himself will intervene to throw his dark displeasure over the scene all are his instruments each form of war what burns at home or threatens from afar nature in arms her elements at strife the storms that overset the joys of life are but his rods to scourge a guilty land and waste it at the bidding of his hand he gives the word and mutiny soon roars in all her gates and shakes her distant shores the standards of all nations are unfurled she has one foe and that one foe the world and if he doom that people with a frown and mark them with the seal of wrath pressed down obduracy takes place callous and tough the reprobated race grows judgment proof earth shakes beneath them and heaven roars above but nothing scares them from the course they love to the lascivious pipe and wanton song that charm down fear they frolic it along with mad rapidity and unconcern down to the gulf from which is no return they trust in navies and their navies fail gods curse can cast away ten thousand sail they trust in armies and their courage dies in wisdom wealth in fortune and in lies but all they trust in withers as it must when he commands in whom they place no trust vengeance at last pours down upon their coast a long despised but now victorious host tyranny sends the chain that must abridge the noble sweep of all their privilege gives liberty the last the mortal shock slips the slaves collar on and snaps the lock  a such lofty strains embellish what you teach mean you to prophecy or but to preach  b i know the mind that feels indeed the fire the muse imparts and can command the lyre acts with a force and kindles with a zeal whatever the theme that others never feel if human woes her soft attention claim a tender sympathy pervades the frame she pours a sensibility divine along the nerve of every feeling line but if a deed not tamely to be borne fire indignation and a sense of scorn the strings are swept with such a power so loud the storm of music shakes the astonished crowd so when remote futurity is brought before the keen enquiry of her thought a terrible sagacity informs the poets heart he looks to distant storms he hears the thunder ever the tempest lowrs and armed with strength surpassing human powers seizes events as yet unknown to man and darts his soul into the dawning plan hence in a roman mouth the graceful name of prophet and of poet was the same hence british poets too the priesthood shared and every hallowed druid was a bard but no prophetic fires to me belong i play with syllables and sport in song  a at westminster where little poets strive to set a distich upon six and five where discipline helps opening buds of sense and makes his pupils proud with silverpence i was a poet too  but modern taste is so refined and delicate and chaste that verse whatever fire the fancy warms without a creamy smoothness has no charms thus all success depending on an ear and thinking i might purchase it too dear if sentiment were sacrificed to sound and truth cut short to make a period round i judged a man of sense could scarce do worse than caper in the morrisdance of verse  b thus reputation is a spur to wit and some wits flag through fear of losing it give me the line that plows its stately course like a proud swan conquering the stream by force that like some cottage beauty strikes the heart quite unindebted to the tricks of art when labor and when dullness club in hand like the two figures at st dunstans stand beating alternately in measured time the clockwork tintinabulum of rhyme exact and regular the sounds will be but such mere quarterstrokes are not for me from him who rears a poem lank and long to him who strains his all into a song perhaps some bonny caledonian air all birks and braes though he was never there or having whelpd a prologue with great pains feels himself spent and fumbles for his brains a prologue interdashd with many a stroke an art contrived to advertise a joke so that the jest is clearly to be seen not in the words  but in the gap between manner is all in all whatever is writ the substitute for genius sense and wit to dally much with subjects mean and low proves that the mind is weak or makes it so neglected talents rust into decay and every effort ends in pushpin play the man that means success should soar above a soldiers feather or a ladys glove else summoning the muse to such a theme the fruit of all her labor is whiptcream as if an eagle flew aloft and then  stooped from his highest pitch to pounce a wren as if the poet purposing to wed should carve himself a wife in gingerbread ages elapsed ever homers lamp appeared and ages ever the mantuan swan was heard to carry nature lengths unknown before to give a milton birth asked ages more thus genius rose and set at ordered times and shot a dayspring into distant climes ennobling every region that he chose he sunk in greece in italy he rose and tedious years of gothic darkness passed emergd all splendour in our isle at last thus lovely halcyons dive into the main then show far off their shining plumes again  a is genius only found in epic lays prove this and forfeit all pretense to praise make their heroic powers your own at once or heartily confess yourself a dunce  b these were the chief each interval of night was graced with many an undulating light in less illustrious bards his beauty shone a meteor or a star in these the sun the nightingale may claim the topmost bough while the poor grasshopper must chirp below like him unnoticd i and such as i spread little wings and rather skip than fly perched on the meagre produce of the land an ell or two of prospect we command but never peep beyond the thorny bound or oaken fence that hems the paddoc round in eden ever yet innocence of heart had faded poetry was not an art language above all teaching or if taught only by gratitude and glowing thought elegant as simplicity and warm as exstasy unmanacld by form not prompted as in our degenerate days by low ambition and the thirst of praise was natural as is the flowing stream and yet magnificent a god the theme that theme on earth exhausted though above it is found as everlasting as his love man lavished all his thoughts on human things the feats of heroes and the wrath of kings but still while virtue kindled his delight the song was moral and so far was right twas thus till luxury seduced the mind to joys less innocent as less refined then genius danced a bacchanal he crowned the brimming goblet seized the thyrsus bound his brows with ivy rushed into the field of wild imagination and there reeled the victim of his own lascivious fires and dizzy with delight profaned the sacred wires anacreon horace played in greece and rome this bedlam part and others nearer home when cromwell fought for power and while he reigned the proud protector of the power he gained religion harsh intolerant austere parent of manners like herself severe drew a rough copy of the christian face without the smile the sweetness or the grace the dark and sullen humor of the time judged every effort of the muse a crime verse in the finest mould of fancy cast was lumber in an age so void of taste but when the second charles assumed the sway and arts revived beneath a softer day then like a bow long forced into a curve the mind released from too constrained a nerve flew to its first position with a spring that made the vaulted roofs of pleasure ring his court the dissolute and hateful school of wantonness where vice was taught by rule swarmed with a scribbling herd as deep inlaid with brutal lust as ever circe made from these a long succession in the rage of rank obscenity debauched their age nor ceased till ever anxious to redress the abuses of her sacred charge the press the muse instructed a well nurtured train of abler votaries to cleanse the stain and claim the palm for purity of song that lewdness had usurped and worn so long then decent pleasantry and sterling sense that never gave nor would endure offense whipped out of sight with satyr just and keen the puppy pack that had defiled the scene in front of these came addison in him humor in holiday and sightly trim sublimity and attic taste combined to polish furnish and delight the mind then pope as harmony itself exact in verse well disciplined complete compact gave virtue and morality a grace that quite eclipsing pleasures painted face levied a tax of wonder and applause even on the fools that trampled on their laws but he his musical finesse was such so nice his ear so delicate his touch made poetry a mere mechanic art and every warbler has his tune by heart nature imparting her satyric gift her serious mirth to arbuthnot and swist with droll sobriety they raised a smile at follys cost themselves unmoved the while that constellation set the world in vain must hope to look upon their like again  a are we then left  b not wholly in the dark wit now and then struck smartly shows a spark sufficient to redeem the modern race from total night and absolute disgrace while servile trick and imitative knack confine the million in the beaten track perhaps some courser who disdains the road snuffs up the wind and flings himself abroad cotemporaries all surpassed see one short his career indeed but ably run churchill himself unconscious of his powers in penury confumd his idle hours and like a scattered seed at random sown was left to spring by vigor of his own lifted at length by dignity of thought and dint of genius to an affluent lot he laid his head in luxurys soft lap and took too often there his easy nap if brighter beams than all he threw not forth twas negligence in him not want of worth surly and slovenly and bold and coarse too proud for art and trusting in mere force spendthrift alike of money and of wit always at speed and never drawing bit he struck the lyre in such a careless mood and so disdained the rules he understood the laurel seemed to wait on his command he snatched it rudely from the muses hand nature exerting an unwearied power forms opens and gives scent to every flower spreads the fresh verdure of the field and leads the dancing naiads through the dewy meads she fills profuse ten thousand little throats with music modulating all their notes and charms the woodland scenes and wilds unknown with artless airs and concerts of her own but seldom as if fearful of expense vouchsafes to man a poets just pretense fervency freedom fluency of thought harmony strength words exquisitely sought fancy that from the bow that spans the sky brings colors dipped in heaven that never die a soul exalted above earth a mind skilled in the characters that form mankind and as the sun in rising beauty dressed looks to the westward from the dappld east and marks whatever clouds may interpose ever yet his race begins its glorious close an eye like his to catch the distant goal or ever the wheels of verse begin to roll like his to shed illuminating rays on every scene and subject it surveys thus graced the man asserts a poets name and the world cheerfully admits the claim pity religion has so seldom found a skilful guide into poetic ground the flowers would spring wherever she deigned to stray and every muse attend her in her way virtue indeed meets many a rhiming friend and many a compliment politely penned but unattird in that becoming vest religion weaves for her and half undressed stands in the desert shivering and forlorn a wintry figure like a withered thorn the shelves are full all other themes are sped hackneyd and worn to the last flimsy thread satyr has long since done his best and cursed and loathsome ribaldry has done his worst fancy has sported all her powers away in tales in trifles and in childrens play and it is the sad complaint and almost true whatever we write we bring forth nothing new twere new indeed to see a bard all fire touched with a coal from heaven assume the lyre and tell the world still kindling as he sung with more than mortal music on his tongue that he who died below and reigns above inspires the song and that his name is love for after all if merely to beguile by flowing numbers and a flowery style the taedium that the lazy rich endure which now and then sweet poetry may cure or if to see the name of idol self stamped on the wellbound quarto grace the shelf to float a bubble on the breath of fame prompt his endeavor and engage his aim debased to servile purposes of pride how are the powers of genius misapplied the gift whose office is the givers praise to trace him in his word his works his ways then spread the rich discovry and invite mankind to share in the divine delight distorted from its use and just design to make the pitiful possessor shine to purchase at the foolfrequented fair of vanity a wreath for self to wear is profanation of the basest kind proof of a trifling and a worthless mind  a hail sternhold then and hopkins hail  b amen if flattery folly lust employ the pen if acrimony slander and abuse give it a charge to blacken and traduce though butlers wit popes numbers priors ease with all that fancy can invent to please adorn the polished periods as they fall one madrigal of theirs is worth them all  a twould thin the ranks of the poetic tribe to dash the pen through all that you proscribe  b no matter  we could shift when they were not and should no doubt if they were all forgot  the progress of error si quid loquar audiendum hor lib   od   sing muse if such a theme so dark so long may find a muse to grace it with a song by what unseen and unsuspected arts the serpent error twines round human hearts tell where she lurks beneath what flowery shades that not a glimpse of genuin light pervades the poisonous black insinuating worm successfully conceals her loathsome form take if ye can ye careless and supine counsel and caution from a voice like mine truths that the theorist could never reach and observation taught me i would teach not all whose eloquence the fancy fills musical as the chime of tinkling rills weak to perform though mighty to pretend can trace her mazy windings to their end discern the fraud beneath the specious lure prevent the danger or prescribe the cure the clear harangue and cold as it is clear falls soporific on the listless ear like quicksilver the rhetric they display shines as it runs but grasped at slips away placed for his trial on this bustling stage from thoughtless youth to ruminating age free in his will to choose or to refuse man may improve the crisis or abuse else on the fatalists unrighteous plan say to what bar amenable were man with naught in charge he could betray no trust and if he fell would fall because he must  love reward him or if vengeance strike his recompense in both unjust alike divine authority within his breast brings every thought word action to the test warns him or prompts approves him or restrains as reason or as passion takes the reins heaven from above and conscience from within cry in his startled ear abstain from sin the world around solicits his desire and kindles in his soul a treacherous fire while all his purposes and steps to guard peace follows virtue as its sure reward and pleasure brings as surely in her train remorse and sorrow and vindictive pain man thus endued with an elective voice must be supplied with objects of his choice wherever he turns enjoyment and delight or present or in prospect meet his sight these open on the spot their honeyd store those call him loudly to pursuit of more his unexhausted mine the sordid vice avarice shows and virtue is the price here various motives his ambition raise power pomp and splendour and the thirst of praise there beauty woes him with expanded arms even bacchanalian madness has its charms nor these alone whose pleasures less refined might well alarm the most unguarded mind seek to supplant his unexperienced youth or lead him devious from the path of truth hourly allurements on his passions press safe in themselves but dangerous in the excess hark how it floats upon the dewy air o what a dying dying close was there it is harmony from yon sequestered bower sweet harmony that sooths the midnight hour long ever the charioteer of day had run his morning course the enchantment was begun and he shall gild yon mountains height again er yet the pleasing toil becomes a pain is this the rugged path the steep ascent that virtue points to can a life thus spent lead to the bliss she promises the wise detach the soul from earth and speed her to the skies ye devotees to your adored employ enthusiasts drunk with an unreal joy love makes the music of the blessed above heavens harmony is universal love and earthly sounds though sweet and well combined and lenient as soft opiates to the mind leave vice and folly unsubdud behind gray dawn appears the sportsman and his train peckle the bosom of the distant plain it is he the nimrod of the neighboring lairs ave that his scent is less acute than theirs for persevering chase and headlong leaps true beagle as the staunchest hound he keeps charged with the folly of his lifes mad scene he takes offense and wonders what you mean the joy the danger and the toil oerpays it is exercise and health and length of days again impetuous to the field he flies leaps every fence but one there falls and dies like a slain deer the tumbril brings

who mar what ye would mend snivling and drivling folly without end whose corresponding misses fill the ream with sentimental frippery and dream caught in a delicate soft silken net by some lewd earl or rakehell baronet ye pimps who under virtues fair pretense steal to the closet of young innocence and teach her unexperienced yet and green to scribble as you scribble at fifteen who kindling a combustion of desire with some cold moral think to quench the fire though all your engineering proves in vain the dribbling stream never puts it out again oh that a verse had power and could command

by bundles left behind it is granted and no plainer truth appears our most important are our earliest years the mind impressible and soft with ease imbibes and copies what she hears and sees and through lifes labyrinth holds fast the clue that education gives her false or true plants raised with tenderness are seldom strong mans coltish disposition asks the thong and without discipline the

bowing smirking smart abbe remarks two loitrers that have lost their way and being always primed with politesse for men of their appearance and andress with much compassion undertakes the task to tell them more than they have wit to ask points to inscriptions wheresoeer they tread such as when legible were never read but being cankered now and half worn out craze antiquarian brains with endless

strange contortions of his face how much a dunce that has been sent to roam excels a dunce that has been kept at home accomplishments have taken virtues place and wisdom falls before exterior grace we slight the precious kernel of the stone and toil to polish its rough coat alone a just deportment manners graced with ease elegant phrase and figure formed to please are qualities that seem to comprehend whatever parents guardians schools intend hence an unfurnished and a listless mind though busy trifling empty though refined hence all that interferes and dares to clash with indolence and luxury is trash while learning once the mans exclusive pride seems verging fast toward the female side learning itself received into a mind by nature weak or viciously inclined serves but to lead philosophers astray where children would with ease discern the way and of all arts sagacious dupes invent to cheat themselves and gain the worlds assent the worst is scripture warped from it is intent the carriage bowls along and all are pleased if tom be sober and the wheels well greased but if the rogue have gone a cup too far left out his linchpin or forgot his tar it suffers interruption and delay and meets with hindrance in the smoothest way when some hypothesis absurd and vain has filled with all its fumes a critics brain the text that sorts not with his darling whim though plain to others is obscure to him the will made subject to a lawless force all is irregular and out of course and judgment drunk and bribed to lose his way winks hard and talks of darkness at noon day a critic on the sacred book should be candid and learned dispassionate and free free from the wayward bias bigots feel from fancys influence and intemprate zeal but above all or let the wretch refrain nor touch the page he cannot but profane free from the domineering power of lust a lewd interpreter is never just how shall i speak thee or thy power address thou god of our idolatry the press by thee

and wise thou everbubbling spring of endless lies like edens dread probationary tree knowledge of good and evil is from thee no wild enthusiast ever yet could rest till half mankind were like himself possessed philosophers who darken and put out eternal truth by everlasting doubt church quacks with passions under no command who fill the world with doctrines contraband discovrers of they know not what confined within no bounds the blind that lead the blind to streams of popular opinion drawn deposit in those shallows all their spawn the wriggling fry soon fill the creeks around poisning the waters where their swarms abound scorned by the nobler tenants of the flood minnows and gudgeons gorge the unwholesome food the propagated myriads spread so fast even leuwenhoek himself would stand aghast employed to calculate the enormous sum and own his crabcomputing powers overcome is this hyperbole the world well known your sober thoughts will hardly find it one fresh confidence the speculatist takes from every harebraind proselyte he makes and therefore prints himself but halfdeceivd till others have the soothing tale believed hence comment after comment spun as fine as bloated spiders draw the flimsy line hence the same word that bids our lusts obey is misapplied to sanctify their sway if stubborn greek refuse to be his friend hebrew or syriac shall be forced to bend if languages and copies all cry no  somebody proved it centuries ago like trout pursued the critic in despair darts to the mud and finds his safety there women whom custom has forbid to fly the scholars pitch the scholar best knows why with all the simple and unlettered poor admire his learning and almost adore whoever errs the priest can never be wrong with such fine words familiar to his tongue ye ladies for indiffrent in your cause i should deserve to forfeit all applause whatever shocks or gives the least offense to virtue delicacy truth or sense try the criterion it is a faithful guide nor has nor can have scripture on its side none but an author knows an authors cares or fancys fondness for the child she bears committed once into the public arms the baby seems to smile with added charms like something precious ventured far from shore it is valued for the dangers sake the more he views it with complacency supreme solicits kind attention to his dream and daily more enamored of the cheat kneels and asks heaven to bless the dear deceit so one whose story serves at least to show men loved their own productions long ago wooed an unfeeling statue for his wife nor rested till the gods had given it life if some mere drivler suck the sugared fib one that still needs his leading string and bib and praise his genius he is soon repaid in praise applied to the same part his head for it is a rule that holds for ever true grant me discernment and i grant it you patient of contradiction as a child affable humble diffident and mild such was sir isaac and such boil and lock your blundrer is as sturdy as a rock the creature is so sure to kick and bite a muleteers the man to set him right first appetite enlists him truths sworn foe then obstinate selfwill confirms him so tell him he wanders that his error leads to fatal ills that though the path he treads be flowery and he see no cause of fear death and the pains of hell attend him there in vain the slave of arrogance and pride he has no hearing on the prudent side his still refuted quirks he still repeats new raised objections with new quibbles meets till sinking in the quicksand he defends he dies disputing and the contest ends but not the mischiefs they still left behind like thistleseeds are sown by every wind thus men go wrong with an ingenious skill bend the strait rule to their own crooked will and with a clear and shining lamp supplied first put it out then take it for a guide halting on crutches of unequal size one leg by truth supported one by lies they sidle to the goal with awkward pace secure of nothing but to lose the race faults in the life breed errors in the brain and these reciprocally those again the mind and conduct mutually imprint and stamp their image in each others mint each sire and dam of an infernal race begetting and conceiving all that is base none sends his arrow to the mark in view whose hand is feeble or his aim untrue for though ever yet the shaft is on the wing or when it first forsakes the elastic string it err but little from the intended line it falls at last far wide of his design so he that seeks a mansion in the sky must watch his purpose with a steadfast eye that prize belongs to none but the sincere the least obliquity is fatal here with caution taste the sweet circaean cup he that sips often at last drinks it up habits are soon assumed but when we strive to strip them off it is being flayed alive called to the temple of impure delight he that abstains and he alone does right if a wish wander that way call it home he cannot long be safe whose wishes roam but if you pass the threshold you are caught die then if power almighty save you not there hardning by degrees till double steeled take leave of natures god and god revealed then laugh at all you trembled at before and joining the freethinkers brutal roar swallow the two grand nostrums they dispense that scripture lies and blasphemy is sense if clemency revolted by abuse be damnable then damned without excuse some dream that they can silence when they will the storm of passion and say peace be still but  thus far and no farther  to the wild wave or wilder human breast implies authority that never can that never ought to be the lot of man but muse forbear long flights forebode a fall strike on the deeptoned chord the sum of all hear the just law the judgment of the skies he that hates truth shall be the dupe of lies and he that will be cheated to the last delusions strong as hell shall bind him fast but if the wanderer his mistake discern judge his own ways and sigh for a return bewildered once must he bewail his loss for ever and for ever no  the cross there and there only though the deist rave and atheist if earth bear so base a slave there and there only is the power to save there no delusive hope invites despair no mockry meets you no deception there the spells and charms that blinded you before all vanish there and fascinate no more i am no preacher let this hint suffice the cross once seen is death to every vice else he that hung there suffered all his pain bled groaned and agonizd and died in vain truth pensentur trutina hor man on the dubious waves of error tossed his ship half foundered and his compass lost sees far as human optics may command a sleeping fog and fancies it dry land spreads all his canvass every sinew plies pants for it aims at it enters it and dies then farewell all selfsatisfying schemes his well built systems philosophic dreams deceitful views of future bliss farewell he reads his sentence at the flames of hell hard lot of man to toil for the reward of virtue and yet lose it  wherefore hard he that would win the race must guide his horse obedient to the customs of the course else though unequalled to the goal he flies a meaner than himself shall gain the prize grace leads the right way if you choose the wrong take it and perish but restrain your tongue charge not with light sufficient and left free your willful suicide on gods decree oh how unlike the complex works of man heavens easy artless unincumberd plan no meretricious graces to beguile no clustring ornaments to clog the pile from ostentation as from weakness free it stands like the caerulean arch we see majestic in its own simplicity inscribed above the portal from afar conspicuous as the brightness of a star legible only by the light they give stand the soulquickning words  believe and live too many shocked at what should charm them most despise the plain direction and are lost heaven on such terms they cry with proud disdain incredible impossible and vain  rebel because it is easy to obey and scorn for its own sake the gracious way these are the sober in whose cooler brains some thought of immortality remains the rest too busy or too gay to wait on the sad theme their everlasting state sport for a day and perish in a night the foam upon the waters not so light who judged the pharisee what odious cause exposed him to the vengeance of the laws had he seduced a virgin wronged a friend or stabbed a man to serve some private end was blasphemy his sin or did he stray from the strict duties of the sacred day sit long and late at the carousing board such were the sins with which he charged his lord no  the mans morals were exact what then twas his ambition to be seen of men his virtues were his pride and that one vice made all his virtues gewgaws of no price he wore them as fine trappings for a show a praying synagogue frequenting beau the selfapplauding bird the peacock see  mark what a sumptuous pharisee

sequestered green and shines without desiring to be seen the plea of works as arrogant and vain heaven turns from with abhorrence and disdain not more affronted by avowed neglect than by the mere dissemblers feigned respect what is all righteousness that men devise what but a fordid bargain for the skies but christ as soon would abdicate his own as sloop from heaven to sell the proud a throne

suffer less than he the truth is if the truth may suit your ear and prejudice have left a passage clear pride has attained its most luxuriant growth and poisoned every virtue in them both pride may be pampered while the flesh grows lean humility may cloth an english dean that grace was cowpers  his confessed by all  though placed in golden durhams second stall not all the plenty of a bishops board his palace and his lacqueys and my lord more nourish pride that condescending vice than abstinence and beggary and lice it thrives in misery and abundant grows in misery fools upon themselves impose but why before us protestants produce an indian mystic or a french recluse their sin is plain but what have we to fear reformed and well instructed you shall hear yon ancient prude whose withered features show she might be young some forty years ago her elbows pinioned close upon her hips her head erect her fan upon her lips her eyebrows arched her eyes both gone astray to watch yon amorous couple in their play with boney and unkerchiefd neck defies the rude inclemency of wintry skies and sails with lappethead and mincing airs duly at clink of bell to morning prayers to thrift and parsimony much inclined she yet allows herself that boy behind the shivering urchin bending as he goes with slipshod heels and dew drop at his nose his predecessors coat advanced to wear which furture pages are yet doomed to share carries her bible tucked beneath his arm and hides his hands to keep his fingers warm she half an angel in her own account doubts not hereafter with the saints to mount though not a grace appears on strictest search but that she fasts and item goes to church conscious of age she recollects her youth and tells not always with an eye to truth who spannd her waist and who wherever he came scrawld upon glass miss bridgets lovely name who stole her slipper filled it with tokay and drank the little bumper every day of temper as envenomed as an asp censorious and her every word a wasp in faithful memory she records the crimes or real or fictitious of the times laughs at the reputations she has torn and holds them dangling at arms length in scorn such are the fruits of sanctimonious pride of malice fed while flesh is mortified take madam the reward of all your prayers where hermits and where bramins meet with theirs your portion is with them nay never frown but if you please some fathoms lower down artist attend  your brushes and your paint  produce them  take a chair  now draw a saint oh sorrowful and sad the streaming tears channel her cheeks a niobe appears is this a saint throw tints and all away true piety is cheerful as the day will weep indeed and heave a pitying groan for others woes but smiles upon her own what purpose has the king of saints in view why falls the gospel like a gracious dew to call up plenty from the teeming earth or curse the desert with a tenfold dearth is it that adams offspring may be saved from servile fear or be the more enslaved  loose the links that galled mankind before or bind them faster on and add still more the freeborn christian has no chains to prove or if a chain the golden one of love no fear

doubt say you  and so he ought one act that from a thankful heart proceeds excels ten thousand mercenary deeds thus heaven approves as honest and sincere the work of generous love and filial fear but with averted eyes thomniscient judge scorns the base hireling and the slavish drudge where dwell these matchless saints old curio cries  even at your side sir and before your eyes the favored few the enthusiasts you despise and pleased at heart because on holy ground sometimes a canting hypocrite is found reproach a people with his single fall and cast his filthy raiment at them all attend  an apt similitude shall show whence springs the conduct that offends you so see where it smoaks along the sounding plain blown all aslant a driving dashing rain peal upon peal redoubling all around shakes it again and faster to the ground now flashing wide now glancing as in play swift beyond thought the lightenings dart away ere yet it came the traveller urged his steed and hurried but with unsuccessful speed now drenched throughout and hopeless of his case he drops the rein and leaves him to his pace suppose unlooked for in a scene so rude long hid by interposing hill or wood some mansion neat and elegantly dressed by some kind hospitable heart possessed offer him warmth security and rest think with what pleasure safe and at his ease he hears the tempest howling in the trees what glowing thanks his lips and heart employ while danger past is turned to present joy so fares it with the sinner when he feels a growing dread of vengeance at his heels his conscience like a glassy lake before lashed into foaming waves begins to roar the law grown clamorous though silent long arraigns him charges him with every wrong asserts the rights of his offended lord and death or restitution is the word the last impossible he fears the first and having well deserved expects the worst then welcome refuge and a peaceful home oh for a shelter from the wrath to come crush me ye rocks ye falling mountains hide or bury me in oceans angry tide  the scrutiny of those all seeing eyes i dare not  and you need not god replies the remedy you want i freely give the book shall teach you read believe and live it is done  the raging storm is heard no more mercy receives him on her peaceful shore and justice guardian of the dread command drops the red vengeance from his willing hand a soul redeemed demands a life of praise hence the complexion of his future days hence a demeanor holy and unspeckd and the worlds hatred as its sure effect some lead a life unblameable and just their own dear virtue their unshaken trust they never sin  or if as all offend some trivial slips their daily walk attend the poor are near at hand the charge is small a slight gratuity atones for all for though the pope has lost his interest here and pardons are not sold as once they were no papist more desirous to compound than some grave sinners upon english ground that plea refuted other quirks they seek mercy is infinite and man is weak the future shall obliterate the past and heaven no doubt shall be their home at last come then  a still small whisper in your ear he has no hope that never had a fear and he that never doubted of his state he may perhaps  perhaps he may  too late the path to bliss abounds with many a snare learning is one and wit however rare the frenchman first in literary fame mention

pride and fumed with frankincense on every side he begs their flattery with his latest breath and smothered in it at last is praised to death yon cottager who weaves at her own door pillow and bobbins all her little store content though mean and cheerful if not gay shuffling her threads about the livelong day just earns a scanty pittance and at night lies down secure her heart and pocket light she for her humble sphere by nature fit has little understanding and no wit receives no praise but though her lot be such toilsome and indigent she renders much just knows and knows no more her bible true a truth the brilliant frenchman never knew and in that charter reads with sparkling eyes her title to a treasure in the skies oh happy peasant oh unhappy bard his the mere tinsel here is the rich reward he praised perhaps for ages yet to come she never heard of half a mile from home he lost in errors his vain heart prefers she safe in the simplicity of hers not many wise rich noble or profound in science win one inch of heavenly ground and is it not a mortifying thought the poor should gain it and the rich should not no  the voluptuaries who never forget one pleasure lost lose heaven without regret regret would rouse them and give birth to prayer prayer would add faith and faith would fix them there not that the former of us all in this or aught he does is governed by caprice the supposition is replete with sin and bears the brand of blasphemy burnt in not so  the silver trumpets heavenly call sounds for the poor but sounds alike for all kings are invited and would kings obey no slaves on earth more welcome were than they but royalty nobility and state are such a dead preponderating weight that endless bliss how strange soever it seem in counterpoise flies up and kicks the

seed sown there how vigorous is the plant no soil like poverty for growth divine as leanest land supplies the richest wine earth gives too little giving only bread to nourish pride or turn the weakest head to them the sounding jargon of the schools seems what it is a cap and bells for fools the light they walk by kindled from above shows them the shortest way to life and love they strangers to the controversial field where deists always foiled yet scorn to yield and never checked by what impedes the wise believe rush forward and possess the prize envy ye great the dull unlettered small ye have much cause for envy  but not all we boast some rich ones whom the gospel sways and one that wears a coronet and prays like gleanings of an olive tree they show here and there one upon the topmost bough how readily upon the gospel plan that question has its answer  what is man sinful and weak in every sense a wretch an instrument whose chords upon the stretch and strained to the last screw that he can bear yield only discord in his makers ear once the blessed residence of truth divine glorious as solymas interior shrine where in his own oracular abode dwelt visibly the lightcreating god but made long since like babylon of old a den of mischiefs never to be told and she once mistress of the realms around now scattered wide and no where to be found as soon shall rise and reascend the throne by native power and energy her own as nature at her own peculiar cost restore to man the glories he has lost go bid the winter cease to chill the year replace the wandering comet in his sphere then boast but wait for that unhopdfor hour the selfrestoring arm of human power but what is man in his own proud esteem hear him himself the poet and the theme a monarch clothed with majesty and awe his mind his kingdom and his will his law grace in his mien and glory in his eyes supreme on earth and worthy of the skies strength in his heart dominion in his nod and thunderbolts excepted quite a god so sings he charmed with his own mind and form the song magnificent the theme a worm himself so much the source of his delight his maker has no beauty in his sight see where he sits contemplative and fixed pleasure and wonder in his features mixed his passions tamed and all at his control how perfect the composure of his soul complacency has breathed a gentle gale over all his thoughts and

over the christians thorny road the soul reposing on assured relief feels herself happy amidst all her grief forgets her labor as she toils along weeps tears of joy and bursts into a song but the same word that like the polished share ploughs up the roots of a believers care kills too the flowery weeds whereer they grow that bind the sinners bacchanalian brow oh that unwelcome voice of heavenly love sad messenger of mercy from above how does it grate upon his thankless ear crippling his pleasures with the cramp of fear his will and judgment at continual strife that civil war imbitters all his life in vain he points his powers against the skies in vain he closes or averts his eyes truth will intrude  she bids him yet beware  and shakes the skeptic in the scorners chair though various foes against the truth combine pride above all opposes her design pride of a growth superior to the rest the subtlest serpent with the loftiest crest swells at the thought and kindling into rage would

own grant her indebted to what zealots call grace undeserved yet surely not for all  some beams of rectitude she yet displays some love of virtue and some power to praise can lift herself above corporeal things and soaring on her own unborrowd wings possess herself of all that is good or true assert the skies and vindicate her due past indiscretion is a venial crime and if the youth unmellowd yet by time bore on his branch luxuriant then and rude fruits of a blighted size austere and crude maturer years shall happier stores produce and meliorate the well concocted juice then conscious of her meritorious zeal to justice she may make her bold appeal and leave to mercy with a tranquil mind the worthless and unfruitful of mankind hear then how mercy slighted and defied

creed persuades me well employed may save while he that scorns the noonday beam perverse shall find the blessing unimprovd a curse let heathen worthies whose exalted mind left sensuality and dross behind possess for me their undisputed lot and take unenvied the reward they sought but still in virtue of a saviors plea not blind by choice but destined not to see their fortitude and wisdom were a flame celestial though they knew not whence it came derived from the same source of light and grace that guides the christian in his swifter race their judge was conscience and her rule their law that rule pursued with reverence and with awe led them however faultring faint and slow from what they knew to what they wished to know but let not him that shares a brighter day traduce the splendour of a noontide ray prefer the twilight of a darker time and deem his base stupidity no crime the wretch that slights the bounty of the skies and sinks while favored with the means to rise shall find them rated at their full amount the good he scorned all carried to account marshalling all his terrors as he came thunder and earthquake and devouring flame from sinais top jehovah gave the law life for obedience death for every flaw when the great sovereign would his will express he gives a perfect rule what can he less and guards it with a sanction as severe as vengeance can inflict or sinners fear else his own glorious rights he would disclaim and man might safely trifle with his name he bids him glow with unremitting love to all on earth and to himself above condemns the injurious deed the slandrous tongue the thought that meditates a brothers wrong brings not alone the more conspicuous part his conduct to the test but tries his heart hark universal nature shook and groaned twas the last trumpet  see the judge enthroned rouse all your courage at your utmost need now summon every virtue stand and plead what silent is your boasting heard no more that selfrenouncing wisdom learned before had shed immortal glories on your brow that all your virtues cannot purchase now all joy to the believer he can speak  trembling yet happy confident yet meek since the dear hour that brought me to thy foot and cut up all my follies by the root i never trusted in an arm but thine nor hoped but in thy righteousness divine my prayers and alms imperfect and defiled were but the feeble efforts of a child however performed it was their brightest part that they proceeded from a grateful heart cleansd in thine own allpurifying blood forgive their evil and accept their good i cast them at thy feet  my only plea is what it was dependence upon thee while struggling in the vale of tears below that never failed nor shall it fail me now angelic gratulations rend the skies pride falls unpitied never

move the muse to tears from side to side of her delightful isle is she not clothed with a perpetual smile can nature add a charm or art confer a new found luxury not seen in her where under heaven is pleasure more pursued or where does cold reflection less intrude her fields a rich expanse of wavy corn poured out from plentys overflowing horn ambrosial gardens in which art supplies the fervor and the force of indian skies her peaceful shores where busy commerce waits to pour his golden tide through all her gates whom fiery suns that scorch the russet spice of eastern groves and oceans floord with ice forbid in vain to push his daring way to darker climes or climes of brighter day whom the winds waft wherever the billows roll from the worlds girdle to the frozen pole the chariots bounding in her wheelworn streets her vaults below where every vintage meets her theaters her revels and her sports the scenes to which not youth alone resorts but age in spite of weakness and of pain still haunts in hope to dream of youth again all speak her happy  let the muse look round from east to west no sorrow can be found or only what in cottages confined sighs unregarded to the passing wind then wherefore weep for england what appears in englands case to move the muse to tears the prophet wept for israel wished his eyes were fountains fed with infinite supplies for israel dealt in robbery and wrong there were the scorners and the slandrers tongue oaths used as playthings or convenient tools as interest biased knaves or fashion fools adultry neighing at his neighbors door oppression laboring hard to grind the poor the partial balance and deceitsul weight the treacherous smile a mask for secret hate hypocrisy formality in prayer and the dull service of the lip were there her women insolent and selfcaressd by vanitys unwearied finger dressed forgot the blush that virgin fears impart to modest cheeks and borrowed one from art were just such trifles without worth or use as silly pride and idleness produce curled scented furbelowd and flouncd around with feet too delicate to touch the ground they stretched the neck and rolled the wanton eye and sighed for every fool that fluttered by he saw his people slaves to every lust lewd avaricious arrogant unjust he heard the wheels of an avenging god groan heavily along the distant road saw babylon set wide her two leaved brass to let the military deluge pass jerusalem a prey her glory soiled her princes captive and her treasures spoiled wept till all israel heard his bitter cry stamped with his foot and smote upon his thigh but wept and stamped and smote his thigh in vain pleasure is deaf when told of future pain and sounds prophetic are too rough to suit ears long accustomed to the pleasing lute they scorned his inspiration and his theme pronounced him frantic and his fears a dream with selfindulgence winged the fleeting hours till the foe found them and down fell the towers long time assyria bound them in her chain till penitence had purged the public stain and cyrus with relenting pity moved returned them happy to the land they loved there proof against prosperity awhile they stood the test of her ensnaring smile and had the grace in scenes of peace to show the virtue they had learned in scenes of woe but man is frail and can but ill sustain a long immunity from grief and pain and after all the joys that plenty leads with tiptoe step vice silently succeeds when he that ruled them with a shepherds rod in form a man in dignity a god came not expected in that humble guise to sift and search them with unerring eyes he found concealed beneath a fair outside the filth of rottenness and worm of pride their piety a system of deceit scripture employed to sanctify the cheat the pharisee the dupe of his own art selfidolized and yet a knave at heart when nations are to perish in their sins it is in the church the leprosy begins the priest whose office is with zeal sincere to watch the fountain and preserve it clear carelessly nods and sleeps upon the brink while others poison what the flock must drink or waking at the call of lust alone infuses lies and errors of his own his unsuspecting sheep believe it pure and tainted by the very means of cure catch from each other a contagious spot the foul forerunner of a general rot then truth is hushed that heresy may preach and all is trash that reason cannot reach then gods own image on the soul impressed becomes a mockry and a standing jest and faith the root whence only can arise the graces of a life that wins the skies loses at once all value and esteem pronounced by gray beards a pernicious dream then ceremony leads her bigots forth prepared to fight for shadows of no worth while truths on which eternal things depend find not or hardly find a single friend as soldiers watch the signal of command they learn to bow to kneel to sit to stand happy to fill religions vacant place with hollow form and gesture and grimace such when the teacher of his church was there people and priest the sons of israel were stiff in the letter lax in the design and import of their oracles divine their learning legendary false absurd and yet exalted above gods own word they drew a curse from an intended good puffed up with gifts they never understood he judged them with as terrible a frown as if not love but wrath had brought him down yet he was gentle as soft summer airs had grace for other sins but none for theirs through all he spoke a noble plainness ran rhetric is artifice the work of man and tricks and turns that fancy may devise are far too mean for him that rules the skies the astonished vulgar trembled while he tore the mask from faces never seen before he stripped the impostors in the noonday sun showed that they followed all they seemed to shun their prayers made public their excesses kept as private as the chambers where they slept the temple and its holy rites profaned by mummries he that dwelt in it disdained uplifted hands that at convenient times could act extortion and the worst of crimes washed with a neatness scrupulously nice and free from every taint but that of vice judgment however tardy mends her pace when obstinacy once has conquered grace they saw distemper healed and life restored in answer to the fiat of his word confessed the wonder and with daring tongue blasphemed the authority from which it sprung they knew by sure prognostics seen on high the future tone and temper of the sky but grave dissemblers could not understand that sin let loose speaks punishment at hand ask now of historys authentic page and call up evidence from every age display with busy and laborious hand the blessings of the most indebted land what nation will you find whose annals prove so rich an interest in almighty love where dwell they now where dwelt in ancient day a people planted watered blessed as they let egypts plagues and canaans woes proclaim the favors poured upon the jewish name their freedom purchased for them at the cost of all their hard oppressors valued most their title to a country not their own made sure by prodigies till then unknown for them the state they left made waste and void for them the states to which they went destroyed a cloud to measure out their march by day by night a fire to cheer the gloomy way that moving signal summoning when best their host to move and when it stayed to rest for them the rocks dissolved into a flood the dews condensed into angelic food their very garments sacred old yet new and time forbid to touch them as he flew streams swelled above the bank enjoined to stand while they passed through to their appointed land their leader armed with meekness zeal and love and graced with clear credentials from above themselves secured beneath the almighty wing their god their captain vide joshua v     lawgiver and king crowned with a thousand victries and at last lords of the conquered soil there rooted fast in peace possessing what they won by war their name far published and revered as far where will you find a race like theirs endowed with all that man ever wished or heaven bestowed they and they only amongst all mankind received the transcript of the eternal mind were trusted with his own engraven laws and constituted guardians of his cause theirs were the prophets theirs the priestly call and theirs by birth the savior of us all in vain the nations that had seen them rise with fierce and envious yet admiring eyes had sought to crush them guarded as they were by power divine and skill that could not err had they maintained allegiance firm and sure and kept the faith immaculate and pure then the proud eagles of allconquring rome had found one city not to be overcome and the twelve standards of the tribes unfurled had bid defiance to the warring world but grace abused brings forth the foulest deeds as richest soil the most luxuriant weeds cured of the golden calves their fathers sin they set up self that idol god within viewed a delivrer with disdain and hate who left them still a tributary state seized fast his hand held out to set them free from a worse yoke and nailed it to the tree there was the consummation and the crown the flower of israels infamy full blown thence date their sad declension and their fall their woes not yet repealed thence date them all thus fell the best instructed in her day and the most favored land look where we may philosophy indeed on grecian eyes had poured the day and cleared the roman skies in other climes perhaps creative art with power surpassing theirs performed her part might give more life to marble or might fill the glowing tablets with a juster skill might shine in fable and grace idle themes with all the embroidry of poetic dreams twas theirs alone to dive into the plan that truth and mercy had revealed to man and while the world beside that plan unknown deified useless wood or senseless stone they breathed in faith their welldirected prayers and the true god the god of truth was theirs their glory faded and their race dispersed the last of nations now though once the first they warn and teach the proudest would they learn keep wisdom or meet vengeance in your turn if we escaped not if heaven spared not us peeled scattered and exterminated thus if vice received her retribution due when we were visited what hope for you when god arises with an awful frown to punish lust or pluck presumption down when gifts perverted or not duly prized pleasure oervalued and his grace despised provoke the vengeance of his righteous hand to pour down wrath upon a thankless land he will be found impartially severe too just to wink or speak the guilty clear oh israel of all nations most undone thy diadem displaced thy scepter gone thy temple once thy glory fallen and rased and thou a worshipper even where thou may thy services once holy without spot mere shadows now their ancient pomp forgot thy levites once a consecrated host no longer levites and their lineage lost and thou thyself over every country sown with none on earth that thou can call thine own cry aloud thou that sit in the dust cry to the proud the cruel and unjust knock at the gates of nations rouse their fears say wrath is coming and the storm appears but raise the shrillest cry in british ears what ails thee restless as the waves that roar and fling their foam against thy chalky shore mistress at least while providence shall please and tridentbearing queen of the wide seas  why having kept good faith and often shown friendship and truth to others findst thou none thou that have set the persecuted free none interposes now to succor thee countries indebted to thy power that shine with light derived from thee would smother thine thy very children watch for thy disgrace a lawless brood and curse thee to thy face thy rulers load thy credit year by year with sums peruvian mines could never clear as if like arches built with skilful hand the more twere pressed the firmer it would stand the cry in all thy ships is still the same speed us away to battle and to fame thy mariners explore the wild expanse impatient to descry the flags of france but though they fight as thine have ever fought return ashamed without the wreaths they sought thy senate is a scene of civil jar chaos of contrarieties at war where sharp and solid phlegmatic and light discordant atoms meet ferment and fight where obstinacy takes his sturdy stand to disconcert what policy has planned where policy is busied all night long in setting right what faction has set wrong where flails of oratory thresh the floor that yields them chaff and dust and nothing more thy racked inhabitants repine complain taxed till the brow of labor sweats in vain war lays a burden on the reeling state and peace does nothing to relieve the weight successive loads succeeding broils impose and sighing millions prophecy the close is adverse providence when pondered well so dimly writ or difficult to spell thou can not read with readiness and ease providence adverse in events like these know then that heavenly wisdom on this ball creates gives birth to guides consummates all that while laborious and quickthoughted man snuffs up the praise of what he seems to plan he first conceives then perfects his design as a mere instrument in hands divine blind to the working of that secret power that balances the wings of every hour the busy trifler dreams himself alone frames many a purpose and god works his own states thrive or wither as moons wax and wane even as his will and his decrees ordain while honor virtue piety bear sway they flourish and as these decline decay in just resentment of his injured laws he pours contempt on them and on their cause strikes the rough thread of error right athwart the web of every scheme they have at heart bids rottenness invade and bring to dust the pillars of support in which they trust and do his errand of disgrace and shame on the chief strength and glory of the frame none ever yet impeded what he wrought none bars him out from his most secret thought darkness itself before his eye is light and hells close mischief naked in his sight stand now and judge thyself  have thou incurred his anger who can waste thee with a word who poises and proportions sea and land weighing them in the hollow of his hand and in whose awful sight all nations seem as grasshoppers as dust a drop a dream have thou a sacrilege his soul abhors claimed all the glory of thy prosperous wars proud of thy fleets and armies stolen the gem of his just praise to lavish it on them have thou not learned what thou art often told a truth still sacred and believed of old that no success attends on spears and swords unblest and that the battle is the lords that courage is his creature and dismay the post that at his bidding speeds away ghastly in feature and his stammring tongue with doleful rumor and sad presage hung to quell the valor of the stoutest heart and teach the combatant a womans part that he bids thousands fly when none pursue saves as he will by many or by few and claims for ever as his royal right the event and sure decision of the fight have thou though suckld at fair freedoms breast exported slavery to the conquered east pulled down the tyrants india served with dread and raised thyself a greater in their stead gone thither armed and hungry returned full fed from the richest veins of the mogul a despot big with power obtained by wealth and that obtained by rapine and by stealth with asiatic vices stored thy mind but left their virtues and thine own behind and having truckd thy soul brought home the fee to tempt the poor to sell himself to thee have thou by statute should from its design the saviors feast his own blessed bread and wine and made the symbols of atoning grace an officekey a picklock to a place that infidels may prove their title good by an oath dipped in sacramental blood a blot that will be still a blot in spite of all that grave apologists may write and though a bishop toil to cleanse the stain he wipes and scours the silver cup in vain and have thou sworn on every slight pretense till perjuries are common as bad pence while thousands careless of the damning sin kiss the books outside who never look within have thou when heaven has clothed thee with disgrace and long provoked repaid thee to thy face for thou have known eclipses and endured dimness and anguish all thy beams obscured when sin has shed dishonor on thy brow and never of a sabler hue than now have thou with heart perverse and conscience seared despising all rebuke still perseverd and having chosen evil scorned the voice that cried repent  and gloried in thy choice thy fastings when calamity at last suggests the expedient of an yearly fast what mean they can thou dream there is a power in lighter diet at a later hour to charm to sleep the threatnings of the skies and hide past folly from allseeing eyes the fast that wins deliverance and suspends the stroke that a vindictive god intends is to renounce hypocrisy to draw thy life upon the pattern of the law to war with pleasures idolized before to vanquish lust and wear its yoke no more all fasting else whatever be the pretense is wooing mercy by renewed offense have thou within thee sin that in old time brought fire from heaven the sexabusing crime whose horrid perpetration stamps disgrace baboons are free from upon human race think on the fruitful and wellwaterd spot that fed the flocks and herds of wealthy lot where paradise seemed still vouchsafed on earth burning and scorched into perpetual dearth or in his words who damned the base desire suffering the vengeance of eternal fire then nature injured scandalized defiled unveiled her blushing cheek looked on and smiled beheld with joy the lovely scene defaced and praised the wrath that laid her beauties waste far be the thought from any verse of mine and farther still the formed and fixed design to thrust the charge of deeds that i detest against an innocent unconscious breast the man that dares traduce because he can with safety

earthly opulence they choose gods better gift they scoff at and refuse the rich the produce of a nobler stem are more intelligent at least try them oh vain enquiry they without remorse are altogether gone a devious course where beckning pleasure leads them wildly stray have burst the bands and cast the yoke away now borne upon the wings of truth sublime review thy dim original and prime this island spot of unreclaimd rude earth the cradle that received thee at thy birth was rocked by many a rough norwegian blast and danish howlings scared thee as they passed for thou wast born amid the din of arms and sucked a breast that panted with alarms while yet thou wast a groveling puling chit thy bones not fashioned and thy joints not knit the roman taught thy stubborn knee to bow though twice a caesar could not bend thee now his victory was that of orient light when the suns shafts disperse the gloom of night thy language at this distant moment shows how much the country to the conquror owes expressive energetic and refined it sparkles with the gems he left behind he brought thy land a blessing when he came he found thee savage and he left thee tame taught thee to cloth thy pinkd and painted hide and grace thy figure with a soldiers pride he sowed the seeds of order where he went improved thee far beyond his own intent and while he ruled thee by the sword alone made thee at last a warrior like his own religion if in heavenly truths attired needs only to be seen to be admired but thine as dark as witchries of the night was formed to harden hearts and shock the sight thy druids struck the wellstrung harps they bore with fingers deeply died in human gore and while the victim slowly bled to death upon the tolling chords rung out his dying breath who brought the lamp

ever dragged a chain or tugged an oar thy monarchs arbitrary fierce unjust themselves the slaves of bigotry or lust disdained thy counsels only in distress found thee a goodly sponge for power to press thy chiefs the lords of many a petty fee provoked and harrassd in return plagued thee called thee away from peaceable employ domestic happiness and rural joy to waste thy life in arms or lay it down in causeless feuds and bickrings of their own thy parliaments adored on bended knees the sovreignty they were convened to please whatever was asked too timid to resist complied with and were graciously dismissed and if some spartan soul a doubt expressed and blushing at the tameness of the rest dared to suppose the subject had a choice he was a traitor by the general voice oh slave with powers thou did not dare exert verse cannot stoop so low as thy desert it shakes the sides of splenetic disdain thou selfentitled ruler of the main to trace thee to the date when yon fair sea that clips thy shores had no such charms for thee when other nations flew from coast to coast and thou had neither fleet nor flag to boast kneel now and lay thy forehead in the dust blush if thou can not

eternal sleep and this delightful earth and that fair sky leaped out of nothing called by the most high by such a change thy darkness is made light thy chaos order and thy weakness might and he whose

faithful and faithfully informed unfold candid and just with no false aim in view to take for truth what cannot but be true to learn in gods own school the christian part and bind the task assigned thee to thine heart happy the man there seeking and there found happy the nation where such men abound how shall a verse impress thee by what name shall i adjure thee not to court thy shame by theirs whose bright example unimpeachd directs thee to that eminence they reached heroes and worthies of days past thy sires or his who touched their hearts with hallowed fires their names alas in vain

remain with thee or leave thee at his word that gratitude and temperance in our use of what he gives unsparing and profuse secure the favor and enhance the joy that thankless waste and wild abuse destroy but above all reflect how cheap soever those rights that millions envy thee appear and though resolved to risk them and swim down the tide of pleasure heedless of his frown that blessings

bolder still a contest with the skies remember if he guard thee and secure whoever assails thee thy success is sure but if he leave thee though the skill and power of nations sworn to spoil thee and devour were all collected in thy single arm and thou could laugh away the fear of harm that strength would fail opposed against the push and feeble onset of a pigmy rush say not and if the thought of such defense should spring within thy bosom drive it thence what nation amongst all my foes is free from crimes as base as any charged on me their measure filled  they too shall pay the debt which god though long forborne will not forget but know that wrath divine when most severe makes justice still the guide of his career and will not punish in one mingled crowd them without light and thee without a cloud muse hang this harp upon yon aged beech still murmuring with the solemn truths i teach and while at intervals a cold blast sings through the dry leaves and pants upon the strings my soul shall sigh in secret and lament a nation scourged yet tardy to repent i know the warning song is sung in vain that few will hear and fewer heed the strain but if a fweeter voice and one designed a blessing to my country and mankind reclaim the wandering thousands and bring home a flock so scattered and so wont to roam then place it once again between my knees the sound of truth will then be

not that his hours devoted all to care holloweyd abstinence and lean despair the wretch may pine while to his smell taste sight she holds a paradise of rich delight but gently to rebuke his awkward fear to prove that what she gives she gives sincere to banish hesitation and proclaim his happiness her dear her only aim it is grave philosophys absurdest dream that heavens intentions are not what they seem that only shadows are dispensed below and earth has no reality but woe thus things terrestrial wear a different hue as youth or age persuades and neither true so floras wreath through colored crystal seen the rose or lily appears blue or green but still the imputed tints are those alone the medium represents and not their own to rise at noon sit slipshod and undressed to read the news or fiddle as seems best till half the world comes rattling at his door to fill the dull vacuity till four and just when evening turns the blue vault gray to spend two hours in dressing for the day to make the sun a bauble without use save for the fruits his heavenly beams produce quite to forget or deem it worth no thought who bids him shine or if he shine or not through mere necessity to close his eyes just when the larks and when the shepherds rise is such a life so tediously the same so void of all utility or aim that poor jonquil with almost every breath sighs for his exit vulgarly called death for he with all his follies has a mind not yet so blank or fashionably blind but now and then perhaps a feeble ray of distant wisdom shoots across his way by which he reads that life without a plan as useless as the moment it began serves merely as a soil for discontent to thrive in an encumbrance ever half spent oh weariness beyond what asses feel that tread the circuit of the cistern wheel a dull rotation never at a stay yesterdays face twin image of today while conversation an exhausted stock grows drowsy as the clicking of a clock no need he cries of gravity stuffed out

in deeps profound yet seldom sought where only to be found while passion turns aside from its due scope the enquirers aim that remedy is hope life is his gift from whom whatever life needs and every good and perfect gift proceeds bestowed on man like all that we partake royally freely for his bounty sake transient indeed as is the fleeting hour and yet the seed of an immortal flower designed in honor of his endless love to fill with fragrance his abode above no trifle howsoever short it seem and howsoever shadowy no dream its value what no thought can ascertain nor all an angels eloquence explain men deal with life as children with their play who first misuse then cast their toys away live to no sober purpose and contend that their creator had no serious end when god and man stand opposite in view mans disappointment must of course ensue the just creator condescends to write in beams of inextinguishable light his names of wisdom goodness power and love on all that blooms below or shines above to catch the wandering notice of mankind and teach the world if not perversely blind his gracious attributes and prove the share his offspring hold in his paternal care if led from earthly things to things divine his creature thwart not his august design then praise is heard instead of reasoning pride and captious cavil and complaint subside nature employed in her allotted place

but if perchance on some dull drizzling day a thought intrude that says or seems to say if thus the important cause is to be tried suppose the beam should dip on the wrong side i soon recover from

claim to scourge him weariness his only blame remember heaven has an avenging rod to smite the poor is treason against god trouble is grudgingly and hardly brookd while lifes sublimest joys are overlooked we wander over a sunburned thirsty soil murmuring and weary of our daily toil forget to enjoy the palmtrees offered shade or taste the fountain in the neighboring glade else who would lose that had the power to improve the occasion of transmuting fear to love oh it is a godlike privilege to save and he that scorns it is himself a slave  inform his mind one flash of heavenly day would heal his heart and melt his chains away beauty for ashes is a gift indeed and slaves by truth enlarged are doubly freed then would he say submissive at thy feet while gratitude and love made service sweet my dear delivrer out of hopeless night whose bounty bought me but to give me light i was a bondsman on my native plain sin forged and ignorance made fast the chain thy lips have shed instruction as the dew taught me what path to shun and what pursue farewell my former joys i sigh no more for africas once loved benighted shore serving a benefactor i am free at my best home if not exiled from thee some men make gain a fountain whence proceeds a stream of liberal and heroic deeds the swell of pity not to be confined within the scanty limits of the mind disdains the bank and throws the golden sands a rich deposit on the bordring lands these have an ear for his paternal call who makes some rich for the supply of all gods gift with pleasure in his praise employ and thornton is familiar with the joy oh could i worship aught beneath the skies that earth has seen or fancy can devise thine altar sacred liberty should stand built by no mercenary vulgar hand with fragrant turf and flowers as wild and fair as ever dressed a bank or scented summer air duly as ever on the mountains height the peep of morning shed a dawning light again when evening in her sober vest drew the gray curtain of the fading west my soul should yield thee willing thanks and praise for the chief blessings of my fairest days but that were sacrilege  praise is not thine but his who gave thee and preserves thee mine else i would say and as i spoke bid fly a captive bird into the boundless sky this triple realm adores thee  thou art come from sparta hither and art here at home we feel thy force still active at this hour enjoy immunity from priestly power while conscience happier than in ancient years owns no superior but the god she fears propitious spirit yet expunge a wrong thy rights have suffered and our land too long teach mercy to ten thousand hearts that share the fears and hopes of a commercial care prisons expect the wicked and were built to bind the lawless and to punish guilt but shipwreck earthquake battle fire and flood are mighty mischiefs not to be withstood and honest merit stands on slippery ground where covert guile and artifice abound let just restraint for public peace designed chain up the wolves and tigers of mankind the foe of virtue has no claim to thee but let insolvent innocence go free patron of else the most despised of men accept the tribute of a strangers pen verse like the laurel its immortal meed should be the guerdon of a noble deed i may alarm thee but i fear the shame charity chosen as my theme and aim i must incur forgetting howards name blessed with all wealth can give thee to resign joys doubly sweet to feelings quick as thine to quit the bliss thy rural scenes bestow to seek a nobler amidst scenes of woe to traverse seas range kingdoms and bring home not the proud monuments of greece or rome but knowledge such as only dungeons teach and only sympathy like thine could reach that grief sequestered from the public stage might smooth her feathers and enjoy her cage speaks a divine ambition and a zeal the boldest patriot might be proud to feel oh that the voice of clamor and debate that pleads for peace till it disturbs the state were hushed in favor of thy generous plea the poor thy clients and heavens smile thy fee philosophy that does not dream or stray walks arm in arm with nature all his way compasses earth dives into it ascends whatever steep enquiry recommends sees planetary wonders smoothly roll round other systems under her control drinks wisdom at the milky stream of light that cheers the silent journey of the night and brings at his return a bosom charged with rich instruction and a soul enlarged the treasured sweets of the capacious plan that heaven spreads wide before the view of man all prompt his pleased pursuit and to pursue still prompt him with a pleasure always new he too has a connecting power and draws man to the center of the common cause aiding a dubious and deficient sight with a new medium and a purer light all truth is precious if not all divine and what dilates the powers must needs refine he reads the skies and watching every change provides the faculties an ampler range and wins mankind as his attempts prevail a proudcer station on the general scale but reason still unless divinely taught whatever she learns learns nothing as she ought the lamp of revelation only shows what human wisdom cannot but oppose that man in natures richest mantle clad and graced with all philosophy can add though fair without and luminous within is still the progeny and heir of sin thus taught down falls the plumage of his pride he feels his need of an unerring guide and knows that falling he shall rise no more unless the power that bade him stand restore this is indeed philosophy this known makes wisdom worthy of the name his own and without this whatever he discuss whether the space between the stars and us whether he measure earth compute the sea weigh sunbeams carve a fly or spit a flea the solemn trifler with his boasted skill toils much and is a solemn trifler still blind was he born and his misguided eyes grown dim in trifling studies blind he dies selfknowledge truly learned of course implies the rich possession of a nobler prize for self to self and god to man revealed two themes to natures eye for ever sealed are taught by rays that fly with equal pace from the same center of enlightninggrace here stay thy foot how copious and how clear the overflowing well of charity springs here hark it is the music of a thousand rills some through the groves some down the sloping hills winding a secret or an open course and all supplied from an eternal source the ties of nature do but feebly bind and commerce partially reclaims mankind philosophy without his heavenly guide may blow up selfconceit and nourish pride but while his province is the reasoning part has still a veil of midnight on his heart it is truth divine exhibited on earth gives charity her being and her birth suppose when thought is warm and fancy flows what will not argument sometimes suppose an isle possessed by creatures of our kind endued with reason yet by nature blind let supposition lend her aid once more and land some grave optician on the shore he claps his lens if happily they may see close to the part where vision ought to be but finds that though his tubes assist the sight they cannot give it or make darkness light he reads wise lectures and describes aloud a sense they know not to the wondering crowd he talks of light and the prismatic hues as men of depth in erudition use but all he gains for his harangue is  well  what monstrous lies some travelers will tell the soul whose sight allquickning grace renews takes the resemblance of the good she views as dimonds stripped of their opaque disguise reflect the noonday glory of the skies she speaks of him her author guardian friend whose love knew no beginning knows no end in language warm as all that love inspires and in the glow of her intense desires pants to communicate her noble fires she sees a world stark blind to what employs her eager thought and feeds her flowing joys though wisdom hail them heedless of her call flies to save some and feels a pang for all herself as weak as her support is strong she feels that frailty she denied so long and from a knowledge of her own disease learns to compassionate the sick she sees here see acquitted of all vain pretense the reign of genuine charity commence though scorn repay her sympathetic tears she still is kind and still she perseveres the truth she loves a sightless world blaspheme it is childish dotage a delirious dream the danger they discern not they deny laugh at their only remedy and die but still a soul thus touched can never cease whoever threatens war to speak of peace pure in her aim and in her temper mild her wisdom seems the weakness of a child she makes excuses where she might condemn reviled by those that hate her prays for them suspicion lurks not in her artless breast the worst suggested she believes the best not soon provoked however stung and teased and if perhaps made angry soon appeased she rather waves than will dispute her right and injured makes forgiveness her delight such was the pourtrait an apostle drew the bright original was one he knew heaven held his hand the likeness must be true when one that holds communion with the skies has filled his urn where these pure waters rise and once more mingles with us meaner things it is even as if an angel shook his wings immortal fragrance fills the circuit wide that tells us whence his treasures are supplied so when a ship well freighted with the stores the sun matures on indias spicy shores has dropped her anchor and her canvas furled in some safe haven of our western world twere vain enquiry to what port she went the gale informs us laden with the scent some seek when queazy conscience has its qualms to lull the painful malady with alms but charity not feigned intends alone anothers good  theirs centers in their own and too shortlived to reach the realms of peace must cease for ever when the poor shall cease flavia most tender of her own good name is rather careless of a sisters fame her superfluity the poor supplies but if she touch a character it dies the seeming virtue weighed against the vice she deems all safe for she has paid the price no charity but alms aught values she except in porcelain on her mantletree how many deeds with which the world has rung from pride in league with ignorance have sprung but god oerules all human follies still and bends the tough materials to his will a conflagration or a wintry flood has left some hundreds without home or food extravagance and avarice shall subscribe while fame and selfcomplacence are the bribe the brief proclaimed it visits every pew but first the squires a compliment but due with slow deliberation he unties his glittering purse that envy of all eyes and while the clerk just puzzles out the psalm slides guinea behind guinea in his palm till finding what he might have found before a smaller piece amidst the precious store pinched close between his finger and his thumb he half exhibits and then drops the sum gold to be sure  throughout the town it is told how the good squire gives never less than gold from motives such as his though not the best springs in due time supply for the distressed not less effectual than what love bestows except that office clips it as it goes but lest i seem to sin against a friend and wound the grace i mean to recommend though vice derided with a just design implies no trespass against love divine once more i would adopt the graver style a teacher should be sparing of his smile unless a love of virtue light the flame satyr is more than those he brands to blame he hides behind a magisterial air his own offenses and strips others bare affects indeed a most humane concern that men if gently tutored will not learn that muleish folly not to be reclaimed by softer methods must be made ashamed but i might instance in st patricks dean too often rails to gratify his spleen most satrists are indeed a public scourge their mildest physic is a farriers purge their acrid temper turns as soon as stirred the milk of their good purpose all to curd their zeal begotten as their works rehearse by lean despair upon an empty purse the wild assassins start into the street prepared to poignard whomsoeer they meet no skill in swordsmanship however just can be secure against a madmans thrust and even virtue so unfairly matched although immortal may be pricked or scratched when scandal has new minted an old lie or taxed invention for a fresh supply it is called a satyr and the world appears gathering around it with erected ears a thousand names are tossed into the crowd some whispered softly and some twangd aloud just as the sapience of an authors brain suggests it safe or dangerous to be plain strange how the frequent interjected dash quickens a market and helps off the trash the important letters that include the rest serve as a key to those that are suppressed conjecture gripes the victims in his paw the world is charmed and scrib escapes the law so when the cold damp shades of night prevail worms may be caught by either head or tail forcibly drawn from many a close recess they meet with little pity no redress plunged in the stream they lodge upon the mud food for the famished rovers of the flood all zeal for a reform that gives offense to peace and charity is mere pretense a bold remark but which if well applied would humble many a towering poets pride perhaps the man was in a sportive fit and had no other playplace for his wit perhaps enchanted with the love of fame he sought the jewel in his neighbors shame perhaps  whatever end he might pursue the cause of virtue could not be his view at every stroke wit flashes in our eyes the turns are quick the polished points surprise but shine with cruel and tremendous charms that while they please possess us with alarms so have i seen and hastened to the sight on all the wings of holiday delight where stands that monument of ancient power named with emphatic dignity the tower guns halberts swords and pistols great and small in starry forms disposed upon the wall we wonder as we gazing stand below that brass and steel should make so fine a show but though we praise the exact designers skill account them implements of mischief still no works shall find acceptance in that day when all disguises shall be rent away that square not truly with the scripture plan nor spring from love to god or love to man as he ordains things sordid in their birth to be resolved into their parent earth and though the soul shall seek superior orbs whatever this world produces it absorbs so self starts nothing but what tends apace home to the goal where it began the race such as our motive is our aim must be if this be servile that can never be free if self employ us whatsoever is wrought we glorify that self not him we ought such virtues had need prove their own reward the judge of all men owes them no regard true charity a plant divinely nursed fed by the love from which it rose at first thrives against hope and in the rudest scene storms but enliven its unfading green exubrant is the shadow it supplies its fruit on earth its growth above the skies to look at him who formed us and redeemed so glorious now though once so disesteemd to see a god stretch forth his human hand to uphold the boundless scenes of his command to recollect that in a form like ours he bruised beneath his feet the infernal powers captivity led captive rose to claim the wreath he won so dearly in our name that throned above all height he condescends to call the few that trust in him his friends that in the heaven of heavens that space he deems too scanty for the exertion of his beams and shines as if impatient to bestow life and a kingdom upon worms below that sight imparts a neverdying flame though feeble in degree in kind the same like him the soul thus kindled from above spreads wide her arms

accomplishments all knowledge meet to make the shining prodigy complete whoever boasts that name  behold a cheat were love in these the worlds last doting years as frequent as the want of it appears the churches warmed they would no longer hold such frozen figures stiff as they are cold relenting forms would lose their power or cease and even the dipped and sprinkled live in peace each heart would quit its prison in the breast and flow in free communion with the rest the statesman skilled in projects dark and deep might burn his useless machiavel and sleep his budget often filled yet always poor might swing at ease behind his study door no longer prey upon our annual rents nor scare the nation with its big contents disbanded legions freely might depart and slaying man would cease to be an art no learned disputants would take the field sure not to conquer and sure not to yield both sides deceived if rightly understood pelting each other for the public good did charity prevail the press would prove a vehicle of virtue truth and love and i might spare myself the pains to show what few can learn and all suppose they know thus have i sought to grace a serious lay with many a wild indeed but flowery spray in hopes to gain what else i must have lost the attention pleasure has so much engrossed but if unhappily deceived i dream and prove too weak for so divine a theme let charity forgive me a mistake that zeal not vanity has chanced to make and spare the poet for his subject sake conversation nam neque me tantum venientis sibilus austri nec percussa juvant fluctu tam

hostile arts a deep memorial graven on their hearts the recollection like a vein of ore the farther traced enriched them still the more they thought him and they justly thought him one sent to do more

searched so well the tender theme on which they chose to dwell that reaching home the night they said is near we must not now be parted sojourn here  the new acquaintance soon became a guest and made so welcome at their simple feast he blessed the bread but vanished at the word and left them both exclaiming twas the lord did not our hearts feel all he deigned to say did they not burn within us by the way now theirs was converse such as it behooves man to maintain and such as god approves their views indeed were indistinct and dim but yet successful being aimed at him christ and his character their only scope their object and their subject and their hope they felt what it became them much to feel and wanting him to loose the sacred seal found him as prompt as their desire was true to spread the newborn glories in their view well  what are ages and the lapse of time matched against truths as lasting as sublime can length of years on god himself exact or make that fiction which was once a fact no  marble and recording brass decay and like the gravers memory pass away the works of man inherit as is just their authors frailty and return to dust but truth divine for ever stands secure its head as guarded as its base is sure fixed in the rolling flood of endless years the pillar of the eternal plan appears the raving storm and dashing wave defies built by that architect who built the skies hearts may be found that harbor at this hour that love of christ in all its quickening power and lips unstained by folly or by strife whose wisdom drawn from the deep well of life tastes of its healthful origin and flows a jordan for the ablution of our woes oh days of heaven and nights of equal praise serene and peaceful as those heavenly days when souls drawn upward in communion sweet enjoy the stillness of some close retreat discourse as if released and safe at home of dangers past and wonders yet to come and spread the sacred treasures of the breast upon the lap of covenanted rest what always dreaming over heavenly things like angelheads in stone with pigeonwings canting and whining out all day the word and half the night fanatic and absurd mine be the friend less frequent in his prayers who makes no bustle with his souls affairs whose wit can brighten up a wintry day and chase the splenetic dull hours away content on earth in earthly things to shine who waits for heaven ever he becomes divine leaves saints to enjoy those altitudes they teach and plucks the fruit placed more within his reach well spoken advocate of sin and shame known by thy bleating ignorance thy name is sparkling wit the worlds exclusive right the fixed feesimple of the vain and light can hopes of heaven bright prospects of an hour that come to waft us out of sorrows power obscure or quench a faculty that finds its happiest soil in the serenest minds religion curbs indeed its wanton play and brings the trifler under rigrous sway but gives it usefulness unknown before and purifying makes it shine the more a christians wit is inoffensive light a beam that aids but never grieves the sight vigorous in age as in the flush of youth it is always active on the side of truth temperance and peace insure its healthful state and make it brightest at its latest date oh i have seen nor hope perhaps in vain ever life go down to see such sights again a vetran warrior in the christian field who never saw the sword he could not wield grave without dullness learned without pride exact yet not precise though meek keeneyed a man that would have foiled at their own play a dozen wouldbes of the modern day who when occasion justified its use had wit as bright as ready to produce could fetch from records of an earlier age or from philosophys enlightened page his rich materials and regale your ear with strains it was a privilege to hear yet above all his luxury supreme and his chief glory was the gospel theme there he was copious as old greece or rome his happy eloquence seemed there at home ambitious not to shine or to excel but to treat justly what he loved so well it moves me more perhaps than folly ought when some green heads as void of wit as thought suppose themselves monopolists of sense and wiser mens ability pretense though time will wear us and we must grow old such men are not forgot as soon as cold their fragrant memory will out last their tomb embalmed for ever in its own perfume and to say truth though in its early prime and when unstained with any grosser crime youth has a sprightliness and fire to boast that in the valley of decline are lost and virtue with peculiar charms appears crowned with the garland of lifes blooming years yet age by long experience well informed well read well tempered with religion warmed that fire abated which impells rash youth proud of his speed to overshoot the truth as time improves the grapes authentic juice mellows and makes the speech more fit for use and claims a reverence in its shortning day that it is an honor and a joy to pay the fruits of age less fair are yet more sound than those a brighter season pours around and like the stores autumnal suns mature through wintry rigours unimpaired endure what is fanatic frenzy scorned so much and dreaded more than a contagious touch i grant it dangerous and approve your fear that fire is catching if you draw too near but sage observers often mistake the flame and give true piety that odious name to tremble as the creature of an hour ought at the view of an almighty power before his presence at whose awful throne all tremble in all worlds except our own to supplicate his mercy love his ways and prize them above pleasure wealth or praise though common sense allowed a casting voice and free from bias must approve the choice convicts a man fanatic in the extreme and wild as madness in the worlds esteem but that disease when soberly defined is the false fire of an oerheated mind it views the truth with a distorted eye and either warps or lays it useless by it is narrow selfish arrogant and draws its sordid nourishment from mans applause and while at heart sin unrelinqushd lies presumes itself chief favorite of the skies it is such a light as putrefaction breeds in flyblown flesh whereon the maggot feeds shines in the dark but ushered into day the stench remains the luster dies away true bliss if man may reach it is composed of hearts in union mutually disclosed and farewell else all hope of pure delight those hearts should be reclaimed renewed upright bad men profaning friendships hallowed name form in its stead a covenant of shame a dark confedracy against the laws of virtue and religions glorious cause they build each other up with dreadful skill as bastions set point blank against gods will enlarge and fortify the dread redoubt deeply resolved to shut a savior out call legions up from hell to back the deed and cursed with conquest finally succeed but souls that carry on a blessed exchange of joys they meet with in their heavenly range and with a fearless confidence make known the sorrows sympathy esteems its own daily derive increasing light and force from such communion in their pleasant course feel less the journeys roughness and its length meet their opposers with united strength and one in heart in interest and design gird up each other to the race divine but conversation choose what theme we may and chiefly when religion leads the way should flow like waters after summer showers not as if raised by mere mechanic powers the christian in whose soul though now distressed lives the dear thought of joys he once possessed when all his glowing language issued forth with gods deep stamp upon its current worth will speak without disguise and must impart sad as it is his undissembling heart abhors constraint and dares not feign a zeal or seem to boast a fire he does not feel the song of sion is a tasteless thing unless when rising on a joyful wing the soul can mix with the celestial bands and give the strain the compass it demands strange tidings these to tell a world who treat all but their own experience as deceit will they believe though credulous enough to swallow much upon much weaker proof that there are blessed inhabitants of earth partakers of a new ethereal birth their hopes desires and purposes estranged from things terrestrial and divinely changed their very language of a kind that speaks the souls sure interest in the good she seeks who deal with scripture its importance felt as tully with philosophy once dealt and in the silent watches of the night and through the scenes of toilrenewing light the social walk or solitary ride keep still the dear companion at their side no  shame upon a selfdisgracing age gods work may serve an ape upon a stage with such a jest as filled with hellish glee certain invisibles as shrewd as he but veneration or respect finds none save from the subjects of that work alone the world grown old her deep discernment shows claps spectacles on her sagacious nose peruses closely the true christians face and finds it a mere mask of sly grimace usurps gods office lays his bosom bare and finds hypocrisy closelurking there and serving god herself through mere constraint concludes his unfeigned love of him a feint and yet god knows look human nature through and in due time the world shall know it too that since the flowers of eden selt the blast that after mans defection laid all waste sincerity toward the heartsearching god has made the newborn creature her abode nor shall be found in unregenrate souls till the last fire burn all between the poles sincerity why it is his only pride weak and imperfect in all grace beside he knows that god demands his heart entire and gives him all his just demands require without it his pretensions were as vain as having it he deems the worlds disdain that great defect would cost him not alone mans favorable judgment but his own his birthright shaken and no longer clear than while his conduct proves his heart sincere retort the charge and let the world be told she boasts a confidence she does not hold that conscious of her crimes she feels instead a cold misgiving and a killing dread that while in health the ground of her support is madly to forget that life is short that fick she trembles knowing she must die her hope presumption and her faith a lie that while she doats and dreams that she believes she mocks her maker and herself deceives her utmost reach historical assent the doctrines warpt to what they never meant that truth itself is in her head as dull and useless as a candle in a scull and all her love of god a groundless claim a trick upon the canvass painted flame tell her again the sneer upon her face and all her censures of the work of grace are insincere meant only to conceal a dread she would not yet is forced to feel that in her heart the christian she reveres and while she seems to scorn him only fears a poet does not work by square or line as smiths and joiners perfect a design at least we moderns our attention less beyond the example of our sires digress and claim a right to scamper and run wide

however as some years have passed since she and i conversed together last and i have lived recluse in rural shades which seldom a distinct report pervades great changes and new manners have occurred

the subtle and injurious may be just and he grown chaste that was the slave of lust arts once esteemed may be with shame dismissed charity may relax the misers fist the gamester may have cast his cards away forgot to curse and only kneel to pray it has indeed been told me with what weight how credibly it is hard for me to state that fables old that seemed for ever mute revived are hastening into fresh repute and gods and goddesses discarded long like useless lumber or a strollers fong are bringing into vogue their heathen train and jupiter bids fair to rule again that certain feasts are instituted now where venus hears the lovers tender vow that all olympus through the country roves to consecrate our few remaining groves and echo learns politely to repeat the praise of names for ages obsolete that having proved the weakness it should seem of revelations ineffectual beam to bring the passions under sober sway and give the moral springs their proper play they mean to try what may at

to the theme they meant as mendicants whose business is to roam make every parish but their own their home though such continual zigzags in a book such drunken reelings have an awkward look and i had rather creep to what is true than rove and stagger with no mark in view yet to consult a little seemed no crime the freakish humor of the present time but now to gather up what seems dispersed and touch the subject i designed at first may prove though much beside the rules of art best for the public and my wisest part and first let no man charge me that i mean to cloth in sables every social scene and give good company a face severe as if they met around a fathers bier for tell some men that pleasure all their bent and laughter all their work is life misspent their wisdom bursts into this sage reply then mirth is sin and we should always cry to find the medium asks some share of wit and therefore it is a mark fools never hit but though lifes valley be a vale of tears a brighter scene beyond that vale appears whose glory with a light that never fades shoots between scattered rocks and opening shades and while it shows the land the soul desires the language of the land she seeks inspires thus touched the tongue receives a sacred cure of all that was absurd profane impure held within modest bounds the tide of speech pursues the course that truth and nature teach no longer labors merely to produce the pomp of sound or tinkle without use wherever it winds the salutary stream sprightly and fresh enriches every theme while all the happy man possessed before the gift of nature or the classic store is made subservient to the grand design for which heaven formed the faculty divine so should an idiot while at large he strays find the sweet lyre on which an artist plays with rash and awkward force the chords he shakes and grins with wonder at the jar he makes but let the wise and wellinstructed hand once take the shell beneath his just command in gentle sounds it seems as it complained of the rude injuries it late sustained till tuned at length to some immortal song it sounds jehovahs name and pours his praise along retirement  studiis florens ignobilis oti

smile to what was sweet before he may possess the joys he thinks he sees lay his old age upon the lap of ease improve the remnant of his wasted span and having lived a trifler die a man thus conscience pleads her cause within the breast though long rebelled against not yet suppressed and calls a creature formed for god alone for heavens high purposes and not his own calls him away from selfish ends and aims from what debilitates and what inflames from cities humming with a restless crowd sordid as active ignorant as loud whose highest praise is that they live in vain the dupes of pleasure or the slaves of gain where works of man are clustered close around and works of god are hardly to be found to regions where in spite of sin and woe traces of eden are still seen below where

has made to trace in natures most minute design the signature and stamp of power divine contrivance intricate expressed with ease where unassisted sight no beauty sees the shapely limb and lubricated

to wonder at a thousand insect forms these hatched and those resuscitated worms new life ordained and brighter scenes to share once prone on earth now buoyant upon air whose shape would make them had they bulk and size more hideous foes than fancy can devise with helmed heads and dragon scales adorned the mighty myriads now securely scorned would mock the majesty of mans high birth despise his bulwarks and unpeople earth then with a glance of fancy to survey far as the faculty can stretch away ten thousand rivers poured at his command from urns that never fail through every land these like

thus whatever is seems formed indeed for us not as the plaything of a froward child fretful unless diverted and beguiled much less to feed and fan the fatal fires of pride ambition or impure desires but as a scale by which the soul ascends from mighty means to more important ends securely though by steps but rarely trod mounts from inferior beings up to god and sees by no fallacious light or dim earth made for man and man himself for him not that i mean to approve or would enforce a superstitious and monastic course truth is not local god alike pervades and fills the world of traffic and the shades and may be feared amid the busiest scenes or scorned where business never intervenes but it is not easy with a mind like ours conscious of weakness in its noblest powers and in a world where other ills apart the roving eye misleads the careless heart to limit thought by nature prone to stray wherever freakish fancy points the way to bid the pleadings of selflove be still resign our own and seek our makers will to spread the page of scripture and compare our conduct with the laws engraven there to measure all that passes in the breast faithfully fairly by that sacred test to dive into the secret deeps within to spare no passion and no favorite sin and search the themes important above all ourselves and our recovry from our fall but leisure silence and a mind released from anxious thoughts how wealth may be increased how to secure in some propitious hour the point of interest or the post of power a soul serene and equally retired from objects too much dreaded or desired safe from the clamours of perverse dispute at least are friendly to the great pursuit opening the map of gods extensive plan we find a little isle this life of man eternitys unknown expanse appears

above sealed with his signet whom they serve and love scorned by the rest with patient hope they wait a kind release from their imperfect state and unregretted are soon snatched away from scenes of sorrow into glorious day nor these alone prefer a life recluse who seek retirement for its proper use the love of change that lives in every breast genius and temper and desire of rest discordant motives in one center meet and each inclines it is votry to retreat some minds by nature are averse to noise and hate the tumult half the world enjoys the lure of avarice or the pompous prize that courts display before ambitious eyes the fruits that hang on pleasures flowery stem whatever enchants them are no snares to them to them the deep recess of dusky groves or forest where the deer securely roves the fall of waters and the song of birds and hills that echo to the distant herds are luxuries excelling all the glare the world can boast and her chief favorites share with eager step and carelessly arrayed for such a cause the poet seeks the shade from all he sees he catches new delight pleased fancy claps her pinions at the sight the rising or the setting orb of day the clouds that flit or slowly float away nature in all the various shapes she wears frowning in storms or breathing gentle airs the snowy robe her wintry state assumes her summer heats her fruits and her perfumes all all alike transport the glowing bard success in rhyme his glory and reward oh nature whose elysian scenes disclose his bright perfections at whose word they rose next to that power who formed thee and sustains be thou the great inspirer of my strains still as i touch the lyre do thou expand thy genuine charms and guide an artless hand that i may catch a fire but rarely known give useful light though i should miss renown and poring on thy page whose every line bears proof of an intelligence divine may feel an heart enriched by what it pays that builds its glory on its makers praise woe to the man whose wit disclaims its use glittering in vain or only to seduce who studies nature with a wanton eye admires the work but slips the lesson by his hours of leisure and recess employs in drawing pictures of forbidden joys retires to blazon his own worthless name or shoot the careless with a surer aim the lover too shuns business and alarms tender idolator of absent charms saints offer nothing in their warmest prayrs that he devotes not with a zeal like theirs it is consecration of his heart soul time and every thought that wanders is a crime in sighs he worships his supremely fair and weeps a sad libation in despair adores a creature and devout in vain wins in return an answer of disdain as woodbine weds the plants within her reach rough elm or smoothgraind ash or glossy beech in spiral rings ascends the trunk and lays her golden tassels on the leafy sprays but does a mischief while she lends a grace streightning its growth by such a strict embrace so love that clings around the noblest minds forbids the advancement of the soul he binds the suitors air indeed he soon improves and forms it to the taste of her he loves teaches his eyes a language and no less refines his speech and fashions his address but farewell promises of happier fruits manly designs and learnings grave pursuits girt with a chain he cannot wish to break his onlybliss is sorrow for her sake who will may pant for glory and excel her smile his aim all higher aims farewell thyrsis alexis or whatever name may least offend against so pure a flame though sage advice of friends the most sincere sounds harshly in so delicate an ear and lovers of all creatures tame or wild can least brook management however mild yet let a poet poetry disarms the fiercest animals with magic charms risque an intrusion on thy pensive mood and woo and win thee to thy proper good pastoral images and still retreats umbrageous walks and solitary seats sweet birds in concert with harmonious streams soft airs nocturnal vigils and daydreams are all enchantments in a case like thine conspire against thy peace with one design sooth thee to make thee but a surer prey and feed the fire that wastes thy powers away up  god has formed thee with a wiser view not to be led in chains but to subdue calls thee to cope with enemies and first points out a conflict with thyself the worst woman indeed a gift

that study gleans mix with the world but with its wiser part no longer give an image all thine heart its empire is not here is nor is it thine it is gods just claim prerogative divine virtuous and faithful heberden whose skill attempts no task it cannot well fulfill gives melancholy up to natures care and sends the patient into purer air look where he comes  in this embowerd alcove stand close concealed and see a statue move lips busy and eyes fixed foot falling slow arms hanging idly down hands clasped below interpret to the marking eye distress such as its symptoms can alone express that tongue is silent now that silent tongue could argue once could jest or joint the song could give advice could censure or commend or charm the sorrows of a drooping friend renounced alike its office and its sport its brisker and its graver strains fall short both fail beneath a fevers secret sway and like a summerbrook are past away this is a sight for pity to peruse till she resemble faintly what she views till sympathy contract a kindred pain pierced with the woes that she laments in vain this of all maladies that man infest claims most compassion and receives the least job felt it when he groaned beneath the rod and the barbed arrows of a frowning god and such emollients as his friends could spare friends such as his for modern jobs prepare blessed rather cursed with hearts that never feel kept snug in caskets of closehammerd steel with mouths made only to grin wide and eat and minds that deem derided pain a treat with limbs of british oak and nerves of wire and wit that puppetprompters might inspire their sovereign nostrum is a clumsy joke on pangs enforced with gods severest stroke but with a soul that ever felt the sting of sorrow sorrow is a sacred thing not to molest or irritate or raise a laugh at its expense is slender praise he that has not usurped the name of man does all and deems too little all he can to assuage the throbbings of the sesterd part and staunch the bleedings of a broken heart it is not as heads that never ach suppose forgry of fancy and a dream of woes man is an harp whose chords elude the sight each yielding harmony disposed aright the screws reversed a task which if he please god in a moment executes with ease ten thousand thousand strings at once go loose lost till he tune them all their power and use then neither heathy wilds nor scenes as fair as ever recompensed the peasants care nor soft declivities with tufted hills nor view of waters turning busy mills parks in which art preceptress nature weds nor gardens interspersed with flowery beds nor gales that catch the scent of blooming groves and waft it to the mourner as he roves can call up life into his faded eye that passes all he sees unheeded by no wounds like those a wounded spirit feels no cure for such till god who makes them heals and thou sad suffrer under nameless ill that yields not to the touch of human skill improve the kind occasion understand a fathers frown and kiss his chastning hand to thee the dayspring and the blaze of noon the purple evening and resplendent moon the stars that sprinkled over the vault of night seem drops descending in a shower of light shine not or undesired and hated shine seen through the medium of a cloud like thine yet seek him in his favor life is found all bliss beside a shadow or a sound then heaven eclipsed so long and this dull earth shall seem to start into a second birth nature assuming a more lovely face borrowing a beauty from the works of grace shall be despised and overlooked no more shall fill thee with delights unfelt before impart to things inanimate a voice and bid her mountains and her hills rejoice the sound shall run along the winding vales and thou enjoy an eden ever it fails ye groves the statesman at his desk exclaims sick of a thousand disappointed aims my patrimonial treasure and my pride beneath your shades your gray possessor hide receive me languishing for that repose the servant of the public never knows ye saw me once ah those regretted days when boyish innocence was all my praise hour after hour delightfully allot to studies then familiar since forgot and cultivate a taste for ancient song catching its ardour as i mused along nor seldom as propitious heaven might send what once i valued and could boast a friend were witnesses how cordially i pressed his undissembling virtue to my breast receive me now not incorrupt as then nor guiltless of corrupting other men but versed in arts that while they seem to stay a falling empire hasten its decay to the fair haven of my native home the wreck of what i was fatigued i come for once i can approve the patriots voice and make the course he recommends my choice we meet at last in one sincere desire his wish and mine both prompt me to retire it is done  he steps into the welcome chaise lolls at his ease behind four handsome bays that whirl away from business and debate the disincumberd atlas of the state ask not the boy who when the breeze of morn first shakes the glittering drops from every thorn unfolds his flock then under bank or bush sits linking cherry stones or platting rush how fair is freedom  he was always free  to carve his rustic name upon a tree to snare the mole or with illfashiond hook to draw the incautious minnow from the brook are lifes prime pleasures in his simple view his flock the chief concern he ever knew she shines but little in his heedless eyes the good we never miss we rarely prize but ask the noble drudge in state affairs escaped from office and its constant cares what charms he sees in freedoms smile expressed in freedom lost so long now repossessd the tongue whose strains were cogent as commands revered at home and felt in foreign lands shall own itself a stammrer in that cause or plead its silence as its best applause he knows indeed that whether dressed or rude wild without art or artfully subdued nature in every form inspires delight but never marked her with so just a sight her hedge row shrubs a variegated store with woodbine and wild roses mantled over green baulks and furrowed lands the stream that spreads its cooling vapor over the dewy meads downs that almost escape the enquiring eye that melt and fade into the distant sky beauties he lately slighted as he passed seem all created since he traveled last master of all the enjoyments he designed no rough annoyance rankling in his mind what early philosophic hours he keeps how regular his meals how sound he sleeps not sounder he that on the mainmast head while morning kindles with a windy red begins a long lookout for distant land nor quits till eveningwatch his giddy stand then swift descending with a seamans haste slips to his hammock and forgets the blast he chooses company but not the squires whose wit is rudeness whose good breeding tires nor yet the parsons who would gladly come obsequious when abroad though proud at home nor can he much affect the neighboring peer whose toe of emulation treads too near but wisely seeks a more convenient friend with whom dismissing forms he may unbend a man whom marks of condescending grace teach while they flatter him his proper place who comes when called and at a word withdraws speaks with reserve and listens with applause some plain mechanic who without pretense to birth or wit nor gives nor takes offense on whom he rests well pleased his weary powers and talks and laughs away his vacant hours the tide of life swift always in its course may run in cities with a brisker force but no where with a current so serene or half so clear as in the rural scene yet how fallacious is all earthly bliss what obvious truths the wisest heads may miss some pleasures live a month and some a year but short the date of all we gather here nor happiness is felt except the true that does not charm the more for being new this observation as it chanced not made or if the thought occurred not duly weighed he sighs  for after all by slow degrees the spot he loved has lost the power to please to cross his ambling poney day by day seems at the best but dreaming life away the prospect such as might enchant despair he views it not or sees no beauty there with aching heart and discontented looks returns at noon to billiards or to books but feels while grasping at his faded joys a secret thirst of his renounced employs he chides the tardiness of every post pants to be told of battles won or lost blames his own indolence observes though late it is criminal to leave a sinking state flies to the levee and received with grace kneels kisses hands and shines again in place suburban villas highwayside retreats that dread the encroachment of our growing streets tight boxes neatly sashd and in a blaze with all a july suns collected rays delight the citizen who gasping there breathes clouds of dust and calls it country air oh sweet retirement who would baulk the thought that could afford retirement or could not it is such an easy walk so smooth and strait the second milestone fronts the garden gate a step if fair and if a shower approach you find safe shelter in the next stagecoach there imprisoned in a parlour snug and small like bottled wasps upon a southern wall the man of business and his friends compressed forget their labors and yet find no rest but still it is rural  trees are to be seen from every window and the fields are green ducks paddle in the pond before the door and what could a remoter scene show more a sense of elegance we rarely find the portion of a mean or vulgar mind and ignorance of better things makes man who cannot much rejoice in what he can and he that deems his leisure well bestowed in contemplations of a turnpike road is occupied as well employs his hours as wisely and as much improves his powers as he that slumbers in pavilions graced with all the charms of an accomplished taste yet hence alas insolvencies and hence the unpitied victim of illjudgd expense from all his wearisome engagements freed shakes hands with business and retires indeed your prudent grand mammas ye modern belles content with bristol bath and

of god he swathes about the swelling of the deep that shines and rests as infants smile and sleep vast as it is it answers as it flows the breathings of the lightest air that blows curling and whitning over all the waste the rising waves obey the increasing blast abrupt and horrid as the tempest roars thunder and flash upon the steadfast shores till he that rides the whirlwind checks the rein then all the world of waters sleeps again  nereids or dryads as the fashion leads now in the floods now panting in the meads votries of pleasure still wherever she dwells near barren rocks in palaces or cells oh grant a poet leave to recommend a poet fond of nature and your friend her slighted works to your admiring view her works must needs excel who fashioned you would ye when rambling in your morning ride with some unmeaning coxcomb at your side condemn the prattler for his idle pains to waste unheard the music of his strains and deaf to all the impertinence of tongue that while it courts affronts and does you wrong mark well the finished plan without a fault the seas globose and huge the oerarching vault earths millions daily fed a world employed in gathering plenty yet to be enjoyed till gratitude grew vocal in the praise of god beneficent in all his ways graced with such wisdom how would beauty shine ye want but that to seem indeed divine anticipated rents and bills unpaid force many a shining youth into the shade not to redeem his time but his estate and play the fool but at a cheaper rate there hid in loathed obscurity removed from pleasures left but never more beloved he just endures and with a sickly spleen sighs over the beauties of the charming scene nature indeed looks prettily in rhyme streams tinkle sweetly in poetic chime the warblings of the

the laws so famed for his talent in nicely discerning   in behalf of the nose it will quickly appear and your lordship he said will undoubtedly find that the nose has had spectacles always in wear which amounts to possession time out of mind   then holding the spectacles up to the court  your lordship observes they are made with a straddle as wide as the ridge of the nose is in short designed to sit close to it just like a saddle   again would your lordship a moment suppose it is a case that has happened and may be again that the visage or countenance had not a nose pray who would or who could wear spectacles then   on the whole it appears and my argument shows with a reasoning the court will never condemn that the spectacles plainly were made for the nose and the nose was as plainly intended for them   then shifting his side as a lawyer knows how he pleaded again in behalf of the eyes but what were his arguments few people know for the court did not think they were equally wise   so his lordship decreed with a grave solemn tone decisive and clear without one if or but  that whenever the nose put his spectacles on by daylight or candlelight  eyes should be shut on the burning
