characteristical index  london printed by s richardson and dublin reprinted by and for h saunders at the corner of christchurch lane m dcc live  the history of sir charles grandison bart letter i miss lucy selby to lady g saturday nov    you enjoined me my dear lady g at parting on monday last to write to you and to be very particular in what i wrote i will because i love and fear you otherwise i would not write at all first because i had not the good fortune to please you in mine to lady l and next because i shall so soon have the honor to attend you in town well then i begin  on tuesday we women were employed in preparations for the tenants jubilee next day sir charles attended by my brother paid a morning visit to mr greville whom he found moody reserved and indisposed my brother james says that he never saw such a manly yet tender treatment from one man to another as sir charles gave him and that he absolutely subdued him and left him acknowledgeing the favor of his visit and begging a repetition of it as often as he could while he staid in these parts and that he said as well for his credit as for his comfort but when sir charles said he do you carry from us the siren i will call her names i hate her the sooner the better curse me if i shall be able to creep out of the house while she is visible on northamptonshire ground  though i was a friend to the match  do you mind that young man to my brother james o love love added he of what contradictions art thou the cause though i hate her i almost long to see her you will allow me to visit you both i hope when i have got over these plaguey megrims  the same day sir charles making a friendly visit as going by sir john holless seat to that family found miss orme there expecting her brother to call for her in his postchaise  great civilities passed between sir charles and miss orme she was doubtful whether her brother had at that time best see sir charles as he was weak in health and spirits but just as sir charles was at the gate going to his chariot attended by sir john and the young ladies poor mr orme came  the liveries would not allow mr orme to doubt who it was he turned pale sir charles addressed himself to him with his usual polite freedom knowing sir said he that mr orme was expected by one of the best of sisters i presume to salute you as the mr orme to whom i have been desirous ever since i have been in northamptonshire to pay my compliments  sir charles grandison sir   at your service mr orme taking his hand  the happiest man in the world replied mr orme with some emotion the best the loveliest woman on earth calls you hers  i am i think myself the happiest of men but it will add to my joy to have it wished me by so good a man as mr orme  ah sir  could i wish joy to any man on this occasion it would be to you because of your character and in the reflection that the most excellent of women must be happier with you than any other man could have made her but self self sir he is indeed a hero who with such a servent attachment as mine can divest himself of self i loved her sir from her early infancy and never knew another love  the man mr orme who loved miss byron gave distinction to himself permit me to present her to you and you to her as dear friends and allow me a third place in your friendship you have a sister who justly claims a second i dare engage for the dear creature from what i know of her value for mr orme that she will allow of this friendship on the foot of his own merits were my recommendation out of the question  o sir charles you are you ought to be the man and will you allow me on these terms to visit you and visit her  but alas i fear i fear i cannot soon   at your own time my dear mr orme  at mr selbys at her house in london in hampshire wherever she is and whether i am present or absent mr orme will be received as her brother and my brother as her friend and my friend  good god good god  he gushed into tears he ran into the house to hide his emotion but in vain for when he went in he wept like a child  forgive me forgive me sir john who just then came in from taking leave of his noble guest but there is no bearing this mans magnanimity  he is all i have heard of him happy happy miss byron  no man but this could deserve her but where is he rising i will ask his pardon for my abrupt departure from him  he is gone answered sir john i saw him in his chariot good mr orme he called you and sighed for you poor mr orme declared that he would wait upon sir charles and tell him how acceptable to his heart and what balm to his mind would be the tender he had the goodness to make him sister said he you were at the gate as well as the young ladies did he not hint did he not say that miss byron spoke of me with tenderness  miss kitty holles supplied to us afterward my brothers account of what passed in this accidental interview these dear girls know not how to keep from selbyhouse they are good girls how then can they help admiring sir charles grandison  i begin to fancy i am in a way to please you lady g of which at taking up my pen i had little hopes and therefore intended not to take much pains about it but the subject must warm the coldest genius is it not of your brother and my cousin  in the afternoon a letter was brought from sir rowland meredith my cousin intends to show it to you in town such a mix are in it of joy and sadness of condolement and congratulation i believe was never seen in one sheet of paper it is dated from windsor the good man was there in his way to town resolving to pay a visit to the wonderful man as he calls im of whom he had heard so great a character and who was probably to be the husband of his daugr byron and there he heard from lord ws dostics i suppose that sir charles was in northamptonshire and that the marriage was actually solemnized he therefore intended to set out directly for bath where mr fowler was or at the hotwell at bristol pursuing measures for his health with a view to console his poor boy  this is a good old man methinks i am half ready to wish that some of my cousins admirers would dry up their tears and come among us yet we are nice and dainty girls some of us let me tell you  it is foolish however to suggest leavings and such sort of stuff the lady such as but one man could deserve his merit allowed universally  sir charles acquainted his lady with all that had passed between him and mr orme she received his account with joy and thankfulness  you are entered sir said she into a numerous family i have called sir rowland meredith my father mr fowler my brother be pleased to read this letter  i remember the relation my dear returned sir charles and acknowledge it mr fowler is another mr orme sir rowland is a very worthy man  he read it  what an excellent heart has sir rowland my dearest love cultivate their friendship as i will mr ormes my pity for these worthy objects joining with yours and the frankness of our mutual behavior to them will strengthen their hearts we owe it to them my dearest life as much as it is in our power to soften their disappointment  could they have a greater  o my lady g who can think of a man after this  except one might hope from the personal knowledge of his charming behavior that the men who addressed us might be improved by such an example  the tenants jubilee as they called it was on wednesday it was a much more orderly day than we expected sir charles was all condescension and cheerful goodness my cousin all graciousness was the word for her mrs shirley was of the company how was she reverenced she ever was once when the bride was withdrawn and sir charles was engaged in talk with mr deane she whispered two or three of her tenants to tell the rest that it was great joy to her to be assured that after her departure the tenants of her dear mr shirley would be treated with as much kindness perhaps with more as he and as she after his example had ever treated them yet one caution i give said she my dear son will see with his own eyes he will dispense with his own hands he will not be imposed upon  thursday and friday the bride saw company there was as little both days of the impertinence that attends form as i believe was ever known on the like occasion but more of sincere admiration we had a vast number of people some of them persons of fashion with whom we had but slender acquaintance but who wished to see the happy pair  we shall be this day at shirleymanor in a family way in that my dear lady g after all the bustle and parade that we can make lies the true because the untumultuous joy  tomorrow we shall serve god in our usual way  adieu my dear lady g  this is the sort of stuff you must be satisfied with from a poor untalented girl as is  your everdevoted lucy selby no end of duty love compliments etc i begin again to doubt i shall not please you  so am allowably tired    letter ii lady g to miss selby monday nov    come come lucy you do pretty well dont be disheartened child yet you are not quite the clever girl i once thought you you that held such a part in the correspondence of our harriet  but you say you cannot help it poor girl i am sorry for it your talents lie in speech not in writing  your account of the interview between orme and my brother shows you cannot write at all no not you  poor lucy but write one letter more before you come to town do my dear you have charming subjects before you yet  i you see have a talent to make subjects out of nothing you poor soul cannot follow them when made to your hand i will tell you a story of my good man and his good woman a short one the poor man is very sensible of slight ailments happy as he is in a wife no wonder he is afraid of dying he was complaining to me just now to whom but to a pitying wife should a man complain when he ails anything that he had a troublesome disorder in the inside of his mouth i looked very grave shook my careful head i am afraid my lord something is breeding there that should not he started and looked concerned the man will never know me god sorbid said he  afraid of nothing less than a cancer have i not told you a thousand times my lord of your gaping as sure as you are alive your mouth is flyblown  expecting compassion he found a jest and never was man so angry i was forced to take his hand and stroke his cheeks with mine to be friends  but lucy let not any of these flippances meet my brothers eye or invade his ear i shall be undone if they do  caroline is pure well her lord is never out either of her chamber or the nursery  aunt nell makes an admirable nurse her parrot and her squirrel are now neglected for a little marmouset everybody but the real nurse likes aunt nell the good creature is so understanding so directing i protest these old maids think they know everything the nurse i see cannot endure her  i interfere not the boy is robust and they leave him the free exercise of his limbs and he has a fine pipe and makes the nursery ring whenever he pleases so will do well enough  but highho lucy all these nursery mementos how do they sadden and mortify me the word mother what a solemn sound has it to me now carolines situation before me  but come the evil day is at distance who is afraid  beauchamp sighs for emily emily for somebody else sir hargrave is still miserable poor sir harry he still lives but can life be life when there is no hope  write me one more letter before you come up if it be ever so short a one dont be proud and saucy you imagine i suppose that you cannot write as well as harriet and i granted attempt it not therefore but write as well as you can and that till harriet can find herself at leisure to resume her pen shall content  your true friend and humble servant chapter g no end of your compliments to us in town you say  no end of ours to you in the country were i to begin them therefore will not say a word about them you know my meaning by my gaping    letter iii miss selby to lady g thursday night no  0 and must i write your ladyship one more letter  and will a short one content you  well then i will try for it  on sunday last we hoped to be quiet and good but the church was as much crowded as it was the sunday before  monday and tuesday the bride and bridegroom returned the visits made them at one they met miss orme and accompanied her to their seat called the park at her request you did not seem to like my account of sir charless interview with mr orme in my last so i will not tell you what passed on accasion of this visit to that worthy man i will be as perverse as you are difficult i dont care yet as your new sister described the meeting and parting to me you would have been pleased with what i could have told you  yesterday we had a ball given by mrs shirley were i able to write to please you how i could expatiate on this occasion how did the bridegroom shine everybody was in raptures with him on his charming behavior to his bride the notice he took of her was neither too little nor too much for the most delicate observers every young lady envied her and how coldly did some of them look on their own humble servants they indeed were as regardful of him as their mistresses so bore the preference the better my uncle selby was all and more than all he used to be how happy that he is a sober man his joy raised by wine would have made him mad  this day we have been all happy together a calm serene day at shirleymanor and thus is the matter settled among us  your brother and new sister my uncle and aunt selby mr deane and your ladyships humble servant are to set out early tomorrow morning for london my brother james would sain accompany us sir charles kindly inviting him but i withstood it so did my aunt the private reason because of miss jervois  sir charles thinks to stay in town till the friday following and then proposes to carry his bride and all of us to grandisonhall  a motion was made to sir charles by my grandmamma selby whether he would not choose to be presented with his lady to the king on their nuptials sir charles answered that he was ready to comply with every proposal that should show his duty to his sovereign and the grateful sense he had of the honor done him by his harriet  we are to call on lord and lady w at windsor and take them with us  my cousin and i are to write constantly to our two grandmammas my sister nancy devotes herself to our grandmother selby miss holless will constantly visit mrs shirley sir charles is to bring down his lady twice a year or oftener if convenience permit  he hoped he said after a while to induce his harriet to take a trip with him to ireland to inspect the improvements making in his estate there he will find no difficulty i believe to prevail upon her to accompany him thither nor even were he disposed to it to the worlds end  he hopes for a visit from the italian family so deservedly dear to him by which he is to regulate many of his future motions  his newtaken house in grosvenorsquare being as you know nearly ready he proposes to compliment with it those noble guests for the time of their residence in england for he will not it seems be so soon obliged to quit his present londonhouse as he had thought he must  and thus my dear lady g have i obeyed your commands i know you will not be satisfied with me had i been able to follow a subject that was made to my hand i should have attempted the parting scene between my cousin and her grandmamma could i have borrowed your pen i would have displayed the tender yet magnanimous parent not once though tottering with age and infirmities hinting that she might never again see the darling of her heart she saddened not hope but encouraged it all she said demonstrated love of her harriet divested of self and a soul above the weaker passions and well might she since she has already one foot among the stars and can look down with pity unmixed with envy on all those who by their youth are doomed to toil through the rugged road of life in search of a happiness that is not to be met with in it and at the highest can be compounded for only by the blessing of a contented mind with the same pen before i had resigned it would i have described the lovely grandchild embraceing the knees of the indulgent parent not satisfied with one two three blessings and less generously in the purport though not in the intent judging from her own present happiness that there is still something worth wishing for to be met with in this world praying to god to preserve the overripened fruit still on the withered tree in which we all joined but o how much less generously as i hinted because it was altogether for our own sakes  but i know not whose pen i must have borrowed to have done justice to sir charles grandisons behavior on this occasion  excuse this serious conclusion my dear lady g my cousin shall not see it may she know nothing but felicity in hers is bound up that of sir charles grandison and in his that of hundreds i long though we parted so lately to throw myself at your feet and to assure you that whatever defects there are in my pen there are none in the love borne you by  your ladyships most sincere admirer and humble servant lucy selby  letter iv lady grandison to mrs shirley thursday december   lucy my ever honored grandmamma has given you the particulars of the rapturous reception i met with on saturday from my dear lady l on the visit we made her in her chamber she as well as her lord welcomed and congratulated us and herself with such a grace  they are a charming pair  we all rejoiced with her on the addition she had made to two families so worthy  mrs eleanor grandison received us also in raptures  how did the tenderly kind notice which sir charles took of the lovely little infant it is a fine child delight the happy mother and everybody  lord and lady g met us at lady ls emily and the earl of g and lady gertrude with them how affectionately did the dear girl welcome us after a few tears which she endeavored to hide and which we passed over as tears of joy but lucy has given you all particulars this letter of miss selby does not appear  and the noble manner also in which sir charles gave me possession of his house on our first arrival everybody was charmed with it it cost my aunt some tears  the christening was delayed till monday because sir charles was desirous it should be performed at church he had some few difficulties to get over before he carried his point and this was the substance of his reasonings on the subject people of fashion he said should consider themselves as examples to the lower orders of people they should show a conformity to the laws of their country both ecclesiastical and civil where they can do it with a good conscience in the present case baptism said he is one of our two sacraments and shall it not be performed when it can as the church directs the child in full health  i will give you my dear grandmamma journalwise i think an account of our proceedings still referring myself to my lucy for such particulars as now i shall not have time to give for you know my dear grandmamma that my time is not now my own as it used to be though i shall think myself very ungrateful and undutiful too if i permit my new duties so wholly to engross me as to furnish an excuse for the neglect of those which from my very birth i owe to you  i think lucy has not mentioned to you the lively conversations that passed in the evening after the christening between sir charles and lady g she choosing to single out her brother as she had threatened unknown to him to do in order to try once more her strength with him in vivacity and raillery she delighted everybody with her wit for it was not so rapid and so unguarded as sometimes it is he condescended was lucys just observation to return wit for her wit in order to follow her lead as he saw the company was delighted with their conversation and was exceedingly brilliant she complimented herself on the merit of having drawn him out though to her own disadvantage finding herself overmatched she shifted her attacks and made one upon me but with so much decorum and complaisance as showed she intended to do me honor rather than herself  tuesday evening sir charles is just returned from visiting sir harry beauchamp the poor man numbers his hours and owned that the three the best of men gave him as by his own watch though sir charles intended to be back in one were more happy ones than he had promised himself in this life o madam how easy sits my sir charless piety upon him he can pity a dying friend without saddening his own heart for he lives the life of duty as he goes along and fears not the inevitable lot  wednesday he is just returned from a visit to sir hargrave sir hargrave it seems complimented him but with tears in his eyes on his marriage great god said he how are you rewarded how am i punished is there not hope that i have all my punishment in this life i am sure it is very very heavy  he visited the same day mrs oldham and her children  he drank tea this afternoon with the danby family in full assembly at the house of the elder brother and came to my cousin reevess to supper my uncle aunt mr deane and lucy accompanied me thither to tea and supper where as by promise we were joined by lord and lady g lord l mrs eleanor grandison my emily and mr beauchamp mr reeves had also invited lady betty williams what felicitations did she pour on me she sighed poor lady for the unhappy step her daughter had taken and i sighed for the mother who though she had not given her daughter a bad example had not set her a good one  lucy will tell you what a charming evening we had  on thursday mr grandison presented his newmarried lady to sir charles and me on account of our marriage and dined with us sir charles received the lady as well as his cousin with the utmost politeness she is far from being a disgreeable woman but at first the awe she had of the people of rank in company particularly of lady g as she owned to me gave her an air of aukwardness but sir charless polite notice of her soon made her easy  mr grandison found an opportunity to praise to me her good sense and fine qualities but in such a way as if he were making apologies for having given the honor of his name to a woman under his own rank ungrateful who yet had reestablished him he concluded his panegyric with letting me know that she had already presented him with   000 pounds he looked as if he thought he deserved it all and actually called her a very discerning woman i questioned not i told him his gratitude to a lady so deserving and he as good as promised to reward her by his love whispering with an air of selfsufficiency sticking his hand in his side and surveying himself to the right and left her former husband madam was a very plain but an honest man but i do assure you she has taste  o dear o dear thought i to myself  sir charles invited them both to grandisonhall and she seemed not a little proud on his calling her as he did several times cousin  lord l and lord and lady g dined with us as did mrs eleanor grandison and emily lady g in the main behaved prettily enough to mr grandison and his bride but once a little forgetting herself and putting on a supercilious air i whispered her dear lady g consider you can give pride to others by your condescension you must not yourself condescend to be proud  be you my harriet rewhispered she always my monitress it is the sorry fellow not his wife that i look down upon she a widow cit might have done still worse  cit lady g and in a trading kingdom  ay cit child have you not heard my brother say that even in the republic of venice there are young nobility and old nobility distinctions in blood everywhere but at amsterdam  who and what at first made the distinction my dear asked i  be quiet harriet  i think i am very good   and at the height of your goodness charlotte  be quiet when i bid you aloud  sir charles a little jealous of our whispering for the sake of his cousins turning to mr grandison your cousin charlotte you know sir is always hard pressed when she calls out be quiet  i was always rejoiced replied he when my cousin was brought to that  sir charles has been twice at the drawing room since we have been in town he admires the integrity of heart of his sovereign as much as he reveres his royal dignity once i remember he wished that his majesty would take a summers progress through his british another into his irish dominions but expressly with this proviso that every gentleman and woman of condition should be welcome at his court who came not in new dresses to pay their duty to him and this lest the gentrys vying with each other in appearance should hurt their private circumstances and for the same reason that he would graciously treat but not be treated by any of the nobility at their houses  tomorrow morning sir charles his grateful harriet happy creature my uncle and aunt selby mr deane and emily are to set out by the way of windsor for grandisonhall we are to take an early dinner there with lord and lady w who on that condition have promised to attend their beloved nephew and his friends to the hall  lord g is allowed to stay a week with us and no more he is then to attend his now but halfsaucy lady at one of the earl of gs seats in hertfordshire where by promise of longstanding she is to keep her christmas at which she mutters not a little because she would sain have been with us and because she imagines it will be proper for her to confine herself at home by the time they will part with her  my aunt selby and even my uncle will write he must he says the overflowings of his joy lucy loves to describe houses furniture gardens and such like she says she will sometimes give conversations too at which i shall not be present but will leave to my pen persons characters and what passes of the more tender sort in conversations where i am by but as well lucys letters as mine are to be sent to lady g unsealed and she after showing them to her sister will hasten them to northamptonshire referring therefore to lucy for more particular accounts i subscribe myself with all duty and grateful love to my grandmamma as well as with kindest remembrances to all my dear friends  your happy thrice happy harriet grandison  letter v lady grandison to mrs shirley grandisonhall saturday    oclock dec   o my dearest dearest grandmamma here i am the declared mistress of this spacious house and the happiest of human creatures this is all at this instant i can write  lord and lady w honored us as they had promised with their company but detained us so long that we were obliged to he one night on the road but by eleven this morning we arrived here  at our alighting sir charles clasping me in his arms i congratulate you my dearest life said he on your entrance into your own house the last lady grandison and the present might challenge the whole british nation to produce their equals then turning to every one of his guests those of my family first as they were strangers to the place he said the kindest the politest things that ever proceeded from the mouth of man i wept for joy i would have spoken but could not everybody congratulated the happy harriet  dr bartlett was approaching to welcome us but drew back till our mutual congratulations were over he then appeared i present to you my dear dr bartlett said the best of men the lovely friend whom you have so long wished to see mistress of this house he then offered my hand to the doctor  god bless you madam tears in his eyes  god bless you both then kissed instead of myhand which i withdrew my offered cheek he could say no more i could not speak distinctly  my dear sir charles led me followed by all our rejoicing friends through a noble dining room to the drawing room called the ladys the whole house my dear said he and every person and thing belonging to it is yours but this apartment is more particularly so let what is amiss in it be altered as you would have it  o sir grasping his presenting hand between both mine was all i could say  this room is elegantly furnished it is hung with a light green velvet delicately ornamented the chairs of the same the frames of them gilt as is the frame of a noble cabinet in it  my mothers my dearest life whispered he it will be always fashionable and you i know will value it on her account  indeed i shall  he presented me with the keys here perhaps will you deposit your letters and correspondences some of which the continuation of those i have had the honor to see you will allow me to peruse but of choice remember madam for your whole heart must be in the grant of the favors you will confer upon me of this kind  dear sir said i leave me power of speech my will shall be yours in everything but you will find a strange strange heart laid open to you if you command from me a sight of the papers that probably will be reposited here when all my matters are brought from northamptonshire  you shall have all the letters you ever wrote to me and the venerable circle said lucy a loan not a gift if you will show them to sir charles  courage lucy not inclination will be only wanting  thank you lucy said he thank you my love to me you must make marks against the passages in the letters you shall have the goodness to communicate which you would not have me read i will give you my honor that i will not pass the bounds you prescribe  i will snatch another opportunity to proceed  my dear sir charles indulges me i have told him that if he nowandthen misses he must conclude that i am doubling my joy by communicating it as i have opportunity to my dear grandmamma  everybody admires the elegance of this drawing room the finest japan china that i ever saw except that of lady gs which she so whimsically received at the hands of her lord took particularly every female eye  sir charles led me into a closet adjoining  your oratory your library my love when you shall have furnished it as you desired you might by your chosen collection from northamptonshire  it is a sweet little apartment my dear grandmamma elegant bookcases unfurnished every other ornament complete how had he been at work to oblige me by dr bartletts good offices while my heart perhaps was torn part of the time with uncertainty  the housekeeper a middleaged woman who is noted as you have heard her master say for prudence integrity and obligingness a gentlewoman born appearing sir charles presented her to me receive my love a faithful a discreet gentlewoman who will think herself honored with your commands mrs curzon to her you will be happy in a mistress who is equally beloved and reverenced by all who have the honor of her countenance if she approve of your services and if you choose to continue with us  i took her hand i hope mrs curzon there is no doubt but you will you may depend upon everything that is in my power to make you easy and happy  she looked pleased but answered only with a respectful courtesy  sir charles led the gentleman out to show them his study we just looked into a fine suite of rooms on the same floor and joined them there  we found my uncle and mr deane admiring the disposition of everything as well as the furniture the glasscases are neat and as dr bartlett told us stored with wellchosen books in all sciences mr deane praised the globes the orrery and the instruments of all sorts for geographical astronomical and other scientifical observations it is ornamented with pictures some as dr bartlett told us of the best masters of the italian and flemish schools statues bustoes bronzes and there also placed in a distinguished manner were the two rich cabinets of medals gems and other curiosities presented to him by lady olivia he mentioned what they contained and by whom presented and said he would show us at leisure the contents they are not mine added he i only give them a place till the generous owner shall make some worthy man happy his they must be it would be a kind of robbery to take them from a family that for near a century past have been collecting them  lucy says she will be very particular in her letters this will take up time especially as lady g and lady l must see them in their way to northamptonshire though they will not detain them i shall have an opportunity to send this to london on monday this makes me intent to snatch every opportunity of writing it will otherwise be too long before you will hear from us by my hand  i do not intend to invade this slow girls province yet i will give you a slight sketch of the house and apartments as i go along  the situation is delightful the house is very spacious it is built in the form of an h both fronts pretty much alike the hall the diningparlour two drawingrooms one adjoining to the study the other to the diningparlour which with the study mentioned already and other rooms that i shall leave to lucy to describe make the groundfloor are handsome and furnished in an elegant but not sumptuous taste the hangings of some them beautiful paper only there is adjoining to the study a room called the musicparlour so called in sir thomass time and furnished with several fine musical instruments sir thomas was as great an admirer of music as his son and a performer  it is no news to you madam that sir charles shows a great regard to every thing place and disposition that was his fathers and not absolutely inconvenient and inconsistent with the alterations he has thought necessary to make and which dr bartlett praises highly and promises to particularize to me we are to be shown this musicparlour byandby  the dining room is noble and well proportioned it goes over the hall and diningparlour it is hung with crimsondamask adorned with valuable pictures the furniture is rich but less ornamented than that of the ladys drawing room  the best bed chamber adjoining is hung with fine tapestry the bed is of crimson velvet lined with white silk chairs and curtains of the same two fine pictures drawn by sir godfrey one of sir thomas the other of lady grandson whole lengths took my eye o with what reverence that of my lady  lady l lady g as girls and sir charles as a boy of about ten years of age made three other fine whole lengths i must contemplate them when i have more leisure  the suit of rooms on the first floor which we just stepped into are each denominated from the color of the hangings which are generally of damask  mrs curzon tells us that on occasion they make fifteen beds within the house in which the best lord in the land need not disdain to repose  you remember madam that sir charles in his invitation to the italian family tells them he has room to receive them the offices are said to be exceedingly convenient  the gardens and lawn seem from the windows of this spacious house to be as boundless as the mind of the owner and as free and open as his countenance  miss lucy selby thus describes the situation of the house and the park gardens orchard etc in one of her letters which does not appear  this large and convenient house is situated in a spacious park which has several fine avenues leading to it  on the north side of the park flows a winding stream that may well be called a river abounding with trout and other fish the current quickened by a noble cascade which tumbles down its foaming waters from a rock which is continued to some extent in a kind of ledge of rockwork rudely disposed  the park itself is remarkable for its prospects lawns and richappearing clumps of trees of large growth which must therefore have been planted by the ancestors of the excellent owner who contenting himself to open and enlarge many fine prospects delights to preserve as much as possible the plantations of his ancestors and particularly thinks it a kind of impiety to fell a tree that was planted by his father  on the south side of the river on a natural and easy ascent is a neat but plain villa in the rustic taste erected by sir thomas the flat roof of which presents a noble prospect this villa contains convenient lodgingrooms and one large room in which he used sometimes to entertain his friends  the gardeners house is a pretty little building the man is a sober diligent man he is in years has a housewifely good creature of a wife content is in the countenances of both how happy must they be  the gardens vineyard etc are beautifully laid out the orangery is flourishing everything indeed is that belongs to sir charles grandison alcoves little temples seats are erected at different points of view the orchard lawns and grasswalks have sheep for gardeners and the whole being bounded only by sunk fences the eye is carried to views that have no bounds  the orchard which takes up near three acres of ground is planted in a peculiar taste a neat stone bridge in the center of it is thrown over the river it is planted in a natural stope the higher fruit trees as pears in a semicircular row first apples at further distances next cherries plumbs standard apricots etc all which in the season of blossoming one row gradually lower than another must make a charming variety of blooming sweets to the eye from the top of the rustic villa which commands the whole  the outside of this orchard next the north is planted with three rows of trees at proper distances from each other one of pines one of cedars one of scotch firs in the like semicircular order which at the same tie that they afford a perpetual verdure to the eye and shady walks in the summer defend the orchard from the cold and blighting winds  this plantation was made by direction of sir thomas in his  of fancy we have heard that he had a poetil and consequently a fanciful taste thus far from miss selby lady grandison those proceeds  my uncle once took my aunt out from the company in a kind of hurry i saw his eyes glisten and was curious on her return to know

foretaste of the joys of heaven  how sweet the incense of praise from a husband that husband a good man  my surrounding friends enjoying it  how will you madam rejoice in such an instance of a love so pure and so grateful long long may it be for the sake of his harriet his and her friends for the worlds sake before his native skies reclaim him  he approached me with tender modesty as if abashed by the applause he met with but seeing me affected he was concerned i withdrew with my aunt and lucy he followed me i then threw myself at his feet embraced his knees and had speech been lent me would have offered him the fervent vows of a heart overflowing with love and gratitude  letter vi lady grandison in continuation the musicparlour i can hardly mention it without breaking into raptures is adorned with a variety of fine carvings on subjects that do honor to poetry and music be it lucys task to describe them let me mention other instances of his tender goodness to one of the happiest creatures on earth  you know madam sir charles when in northamptonshire offered me my choice of servants of both sexes and when i told him that i chose not to take with me any one of either but my sally he said that when i came to grandisonhall where they would be all together i should choose which of the menservants i would more particularly call my own he gave me just now the names and qualities of each frederic i had seen at selbyhouse an observant sensiblelooking young man but are not all his servants so i choose him he called him in my aunt selby present all my servants frederic said he are as much your ladys as mine but you will devote yourself more particularly to her commands i mean not however any distinction in your favor where you all equally merit distinction the power madam of change or dismission through the house is entirely yours  tomorrow i am to go over all the bridal ostentation again at the parish church on monday lady mansfield and her family are to be here  your guests my dear said sir charles to me before all our friends i hope for a week at least this was the first notice he gave of it to lord and lady w what joy and gratitude appeared in her countenance upon it  tuesday by general approbation sir charles submitting the choice of the day to his guests we are to have the neighboring gentry here to dinner and for the rest of the day sir charles has been long wished by them all to reside among them he breaks through the usual forms and chose this way at once to receive the visits of all his neighbors and in both our names gave the invitation he snewed us a list of the persons invited it is a very large one my dearest life said he we shall be all halffamiliarized to them they to us even tomorrow by the freedom of this invitation for the tuesday following  mrs curzon came to me for directions about the bedchambers i took that opportunity to tell her that i should add to the number of female servants only my sally of whose discretion i had no doubt you must introduce to me said i at a proper time the female servants if you mrs curzon approve of them i shall make no changes i am myself the happiest of women every one who deserves it shall find her happiness in mine  you will rejoice all their hearts madam by this early declaration of your good to them i can truly say that the best of masters has not the worst of servants but dr bartlett would make bad servants good  i shall want no other proof said i of their goodness than their love and respect to dr bartlett  in company of my aunt lady w lucy miss jervois attended by mrs curzon we went to choose our rooms and those for our expected guests of monday we soon fixed on them my aunt with her usual goodness and lady w with that condescension that is natural to her took great notice of mrs curzon who seemed delighted with us all and said that she should be the happier in the performance of her duty as she had been informed we were managing ladies it was a pleasure she said to receive commands from persons who knew when things were properly done you my dearest grandmamma from my earliest youth have told me that to be respected even by servants it is necessary to be able to direct them and not be thought ignorant in those matters that it becomes a mistress of a family to be acquainted with they shall not find me pragmatical however in the little knowledge i have in familymatters  will nothing happen my dear grandmamma  but no more of this kind  shall i by my diffidences lessen the enjoyments of which i am in full possession my joy may not be sufficient to banish fear but i hope it will be a prudent one which will serve to increase my thankfulness to heaven and my gratitude to the man so justly dear to me  but do you my grandmamma whenever you pray for the continuance of your harriets happiness pray also for that of lady clementina that only can be wanting in my present situation to complete the felicity of  your evergrateful everdutiful harriet grandison  letter vii lady grandison in continuation sunday noon what a crowded churchyard and church had i to pass through to the handsome seat which belongs to the excellent patron of it  how much exalted was i to hear his whispered praises how did my northamptonshire friends rejoice in the respectful approbation paid to the happy creature to whom they are more immediately related i am always a little mortified by praises of my figure what a transitory thing is outward form  may i make to myself a more solid and permanent foundation for that respect which is generally more pleasing to a female heart than it ought to be  sir charles was not unhappy in his invitation for next tuesday it took off i imagine some particular addresses to him yet several gentlemen at his coachside acknowledged the favor done them in it  my uncle who you know madam loves everything that promotes good neighborhood is greatly delighted with the thoughts of the day how proud is he of his harriet how much more proud of his relation to the best of men  i have looked upon what lucy has written i see there will be but little room for me to say anything she is delighted with the task it employs all her faculties displays her fine taste in architecture paintings needleworks shellworks she will give you a description of several charming performances in the two latter arts of the late lady grandison  how does the character of that admirable lady rise upon us with what emulation does it fire me on twenty accounts it was a very bold thing my grandmamma for your harriet to aspire to be lady grandison  yet how does sir charless goodness his kind acceptance of all my humble endeavors encourage me  o madam he said truth when in courtship he told me that i parted with power to have it returned me with augmentation i dont know how it is but his freedom of behavior to me is increased yet his respectfulness is not diminished  and tender as he was before to me his tenderness is still greater than it was yet so much unaffected dignity in it that my reverence for him is augmented but without any abatement of my love then his cheerfulness his more than cheerfulness his vivacity shows that he is at heart pleased with his harriet happy harriet  yet i cannot forbear nowandthen when my joy and my gratitude are at the highest a sigh to the merits of lady clementina  what i am now should she have been think i often  the general admination paid me as the wife of sir charles grandison should have been paid to her  lady l lady g should have been her sisters she should have been the mistress of this house the coguardian of emily the successor of the late excellent lady grandison  hapless clementina  what a strange thing that a love of religion in two persons so pious so good each in their way should sunder for ever sunder persons whose minds were so closely united  sir charles by lucy invites me till dinner is ready to walk with them at her request in the gallery lucy wants in describing that gallery to give you my dearest grandmamma in whom every other of my friends is included a brief history of the ancestors of sir charles whose pictures adorn it i come lord of my heart i attend you   how madam would you have been delighted could you have sat in this truly noble gallery and seen the dear man one arm round my waist holding my opposite hand in the hand of the same surrounding arm pointing sometimes with the other sometimes putting that other arm round my lucys and giving short histories of the persons whose pictures we saw  some of the pictures are really fine one of sir charless which is drawn when he was about sixteen is on horseback the horse a managed curvetting proud beast  his seat spirit courage admirably expressed he must have been as his sisters say he was the loveliest and the most undaunted yet most modestlooking of youths he passed his own picture so slightly that i had not time to take in half the beauties of it you will not doubt madam but i shall be often in this gallery were only this one picture there  what pleasure had i in hearing the history of this ancient family from this unbroken series of the pictures of it for so many generations past and will mine one day thought i be allowed a place among them near to that of the most amiable of them all both as to mind and figure how my heart exulted what were my meditations as i traced the imagined footsteps of dear lady grandison her picture and sir thomass in my eye as finely executed as those in the best bedchamber may i thought i with a happier lot be but half as deserving but madam did not lady grandison shine the more for the hardships she passed through  and is it necessary for virtue to be called forth by trials in order to be justified by its fortitude under them what trials can i be called to with sir charles grandison but may i not take my place on the footstep of her throne yet make no contemptible figure in the family of her beloved son i will humbly endeavor to deserve my good fortune and leave the rest to providence  there are in different apartments of this seat besides two in the house in the town no less than six pictures of sir thomas but then two of them were brought from his seat in essex sir thomas was fond of his person they are drawn in different attitudes he appears to be as i have always heard he was a fine figure of a man but neither lucy nor i though we made not the compliment to sir charles you may suppose who always speaks with reverence and unaffected love of his father thought him comparable in figure dignity intelligence to his son  we were called to dinner before we had gone halfway through the gallery  we had a crowded church again in the afternoon  sunday night this excellent dr bartlett and this excellent sir charles grandison i may say  sir charles having enquired of the doctor when alone with him after the rules observed by him before we came down the doctor told him that he had every morning and night the few servants attending him in his antechamber to prayers which he had selected out of the church service sir charles desired him by all means to continue so laudable a custom for he was sure master and servants would both find their account in it  sir charles sent for richard saunders and mrs curzon he applauded to them the doctors goodness and desired they would signify the one to the menservants the other to the women that he should take it well of them if they cheerfully attended the doctor promising to give them opportunity as often as was possible half an hour after ten doctor i believe is a good time in the evening  that sir is about my time and eight in the morning as an hour the least likely to interfere with their business whenever it does they are in their duty and i do not then expect them  about a quarter after ten the doctor slipped away soon after sir charles withdrew unperceived by any of us the doctor and his little church were assembled sir charles joined them and afterward returned to company with that cheerfulness that always beams in his aspect the doctor followed him with a countenance as serene i took the doctor aside though in the same apartment supposing the matter sir charles joining us  o sir said i why was i not whispered to withdraw with you think you that your harriet   the company my dearest love interrupted he was not now to be broken up when we are settled we can make a custom for ourselves that will be allowed for by everybody when it is seen we persevere and are in every other respect unform joshuas resolution doctor was an excellent one as for me and my house we will serve the lord josh xxiv     the chapel now our congregation is large will be the properest place and there perhaps the friends we may happen to have with us will sometimes join us  monday morning sir charles has just now presented to me in doctor bartletts presence mr daniel bartlett the doctors nephew and his only care in this world a young gentleman of about eighteen well educated and a fine accomptant a master of his pen and particularly of the art of shorthand writing the doctor insisted on the specification of a salary which he named himself to be  0 l a year and to be within the house that he might always be at hand he could not trust he said to his patrons assurances that his bountiful spirit would allow him to have a regard in the reward only to the merit of the service  monday noon lady mansfield miss mansfield and the three brothers are arrived what excellent women what agreeable young gentlemen what grateful hearts what joy to lady w on their arrival what pleasure to lord w who on every occasion shows his delight in his nephew  all these things with their compliments to your happy harriet let lucy tell i have not time  what my dear grandmamma shall we do with lord and lady w  such a rich service of gilt plate just arrived a present to me  it is a noble present  and so gracefully presented and i so gracefully permitted to accept of it by my best my tenderest friend  let lucy describe this too  tuesday morning a vast company we shall have gentlemen and their ladies are invited your harriet is to be dressed she is already dressed how kindly am i complimented by every one of my friends  let lucy let my aunt she promises to assist lucy relate all that shall pass describe the persons and give the characters of our visiters our managements our entertainments the ball that is to conclude the day and night i shall not be able i suppose to write a line  wednesday noon our company left us not till six this morning my uncle was transported with the day with the night  i will only say that all was happy and decency good order mirth and jollity went through the whole space sir charles was everywhere and with everybody he was almost as much every ladys as mine o how he charmed them all sir william turner said once behind his back of what transports did my late friend sir thomas who doted upon his son deprive himself by keeping him so long abroad  i could not but think of what my dear lady g once wrote that women are not so soon tired as men with these diversions with dancing particularly by three all but sir charles and my uncle seemed quite fatigued but recovered themselves my emily delighted everybody she was the whole night what i wished her to be  dear madam be not uneasy we shall be very happy in each other  o that you were with us my dearest grandmamma but you from your cheerful piety and joyful expectation of happiness supreme are already though on earth in heaven  yet it is my wish my aunts my uncles lucys twenty times a day that you were present and saw him the domestic man the cheerful friend the kind master the enlivening companion the polite neighbor the tender husband let nobody who sees sir charles grandison at home say that the private station is not that of true happiness  how charmingly respectful is he to my uncle aunt and good mr deane to lucy he is an affectionate brother emily dear girl how she enjoys his tenderness to her  my uncle is writing to you madam a letter he says it will be as long as his arm my aunt will dispatch this day a very long one theirs will supply my defects lucy is not quite ready with her first letter if there were not so much of your harriet in it i would highly praise what she has hitherto written  thursday morning i leave to my uncle the account of the gentlemens diversions in the gardens and fields they are all extremely happy but lord g already pines after his charlotte he will not be prevailed on to stay out his week i doubt sweettemperd man as i see him in a thousand little amiable instances if lady g did not love him i would not love her lord w is afraid of a gouty attack he is never quite free he and his admirable lady will leave us tomorrow  i think my dear lady g with you that discretion and gratitude are the cornerstones of the matrimonial fabric lady w had no prepossessions in any other mans favor my lord loves her what must be that womans heart that gratitude and love cannot engage but she loves my lord surely she does is not real and unaffected tenderness for the infirmities of another the very essence of love what is wanting where there is that my sir charles is delighted with lady ws goodness to his uncle he tells her often how much he reveres her for it  in our retired hours we have sometimes the excellent lady abroad for our subject i always begin it  he never declines it he speaks of her with such manly tenderness he thanks me at such times for allowing him as he calls it to love her he regrets very much the precipitating of her yet pities her parents and brothers how warmly does he speak of his jeronymo he has a sigh for olivia but of whom except lady sforza and her laurana does he not speak kindly  and them he pities never never was there a more expanded heart  ah madam a cloud has just brushed by us its skirts have affected us with sadness and carried us from our sunshine prospects home that is to say to thoughts of the general destiny  poor sir harry beauchamp is no more a letter from his beauchamp sir charles showed it to me for the honor of the writer now sir edward we admired this excellent young man together over his letter what fine things did sir charles say on this occasion both by way of selfconsolation and on the inevitable destiny but he dwelt not on the subject he has written to lady beauchamp and to the young baronet how charmingly consolatory  what admirable  but sir charles madam is a christian  this event has not at all influenced his temper he is the same cheerful man to his guests to his harriet to everybody i am afraid it will be the cause of his first absence from me how shall i part with him though it were but for two days  friday noon what a vacancy lady mansfield and her sons lord g and lord and lady w have left us miss mansfield is allowed to stay with me some time longer emily is very fond of her no wonder she is a good young woman  we are busied in returning the visits of our neighbors which sir charles promised to do as if they were individually made to us we have a very agreeable neighborhood but i want these visitings to be over sir charles and his relations and mine are the world to me these obligations of ceremony though unavoidable are drawbacks upon the true domestic felicity one happiness however results from the hurry and bustle they put us in emilys mind though she not always accompanies us seems to be engaged when we are not quite happy in our own thoughts it is a relief to carry them out of ourselves  sir charles and i have just now had a short conversation about this dear girl we both joined in praising her and then i said i thought that some time hence mr beauchamp and she would make a vary happy pair  i have said he a love for both but as the one is my own very particular friend and as the other is my ward i would rather he found for himself and she for herself another lover and that for obvious reasons  but suppose sir they should like each the other  so as they made it not a compliment to me but gave me reason to believe that they would have preferred each the other to every one else were they strangers to me i would not stand in their way but the man who hopes for my consent for emily must give me reason to think that he would have preferred her to any other woman though she had a much less fortune than she is mistress of  i am much mistaken sir if that may not be the case of your friend  tell me my nobly frank and everamiable harriet what you know of this subject has beauchamp any thoughts of emily   ah sir thought i i dare not tell you all my thoughts but what i do tell you shall be truth  i really sir dont imagine emily has a thought of your beauchamp   nor of any other person has she   lady g lady l and myself are of opinion that beauchamp loves emily  i am glad my dear if any thing were to come of it that the man loved first  i was conscious a tear unawares dropped from my eye  he saw it he solded his arm about me and kissed it from my check why my love my dearest love why this and seemed surprised  i must tell you sir that you may not be surprised i fear i fear   what fears m love  that the happiest of all women cannot say that her dear man loved her first   he folded me in his kind arms how sweetly engaging said he i will presume to hope that my harriet by the happiest of all women means herself  you say not no i will not insult your goodness so much as to ask you to say yes but this i say that the happiest of all men loved his harriet before she could love him and but for the honor he owed to another admirable woman though then he had no hopes of ever calling her his would have convinced her of it by a very early declaration let me add that the moment i saw you first distressed and terrified as you were too much to think of favor to any man i loved you and you know not the struggle it cost me my destiny with our dear clementina so uncertain to conceal my love  cost me who ever was punctiliously studious to avoid engaging a young ladys affections lest i should not be able to be just to her and always thought what is called platonic love an insidious pretension  o sir and i flung my fond arms about his neck and hiding my glowing face in his bosom called him murmuringly the most just the most generous of men  he pressed me still to his heart and when i raised my conscious face though my eye could not bear his now sir said i after this kind this encouraging acknowlegement i can consent i think i can that the lord of my heart shall see as he has more than once wished to see long before he declared himself all that was in that forward that aspiring heart   lucy had furnished me with the opportunity before i instantly arose and took out of a drawer a parcel of my letters which i had sorted ready on occasion to oblige h m which from what he had seen before down to the dreadful masquerade affair carried me to my setting out with his sisters to colnebrook  i think not to show him farther by my own consent because of the recapitulation of his family story which immediately follows particularly includeing the affecting accounts of his mothers death his fathers unkindness to the two young ladies mrs oldhams story the sisters conduct to her which might have revived disagreeable subjects  be pleased sir said i putting them into his hands to judge me favorably in these papers is my heart laid open  precious trust said he and put the papers to his lips you will not find your generous confidence misplaced  an opportunity offering to send away what i have written here my dearest grandmamma concludes  your everdutiful harriet grandison  letter viii lady grandison in continuation saturdaymorning dec    i will not trouble you my dear grandmamma with an account of the preparations we are making to benefit and regale our poorer neighbors and sir charless tenants at this hospitable season not even sir charles grandison himself can exceed you either in bounty or management on this annual solemnity sir charles has consulted with dr bartlett and everything will be left to the direction of that good man my uncle and aunt have dispatched their directions to selbyhouse that their neighbors and tenants may not suffer by their absence  the gentlemen are all rid out together the doctor with them to reconnoitre the country as my uncle calls it emily and lucy are gone with them on horseback my aunt and i declined accompanying them and took this opportunity attended by mrs curzon to go through the offices  in the housekeepers room i received the maidservants seven in number and after her called each by her name and spoke kindly to them all i told them how handsomely mrs curzon spoke of them and assured them of my favor i praised the cheerfulness with which dr bartlett had told me they attended him every day in his antechamber they should have the opportunity given them i said as often as possible i hoped that my sally behaved well among them  they praised her  sally said i has a serious turn piety is the best security in man and woman for good behavior she will seldom fail of attending the doctor with you we shall all be happy i hope i am acquainting myself with the methods of the house nobody shall be put out of their good way by me my aunt only said my niece proposes to form herself on the example of the late excellent lady grandison  they blessed me tears in their eyes  i made each of them a present for a pair of gloves  we went through all the offices the lowest not excepted the very servants live in paradise there is room for every thing to be in order every thing is in order the offices so distinct yet so conveniently communicating  charmingly contrived  the low servants men and women have laws which at their own request were drawn up by mrs curzon for the observance of the minutest of their respective duties with little mulcts that at first only there was occasion to exact it is a house of harmony to my hand dear madam what do good people leave to good people to do nothing every one knowing and doing his and her duty and having by means of their own diligence time for themselves  i was pleased with one piece of furniture in the housekeepers room which neither you madam nor my aunt have in yours my aunt says selbyhouse shall not be long after her return without it it is a servants library in three classes one of books of divinity and morality another for housewifry a third of history true adventures voyages and innocent amusement i ii iii are marked on the cases and the same on the back of each book the more readily to place and replace them as a book is taken out for use they are bound in buff for strength a little sine is laid upon whoever puts not a book back in its place as new books come out the doctor buys such as he thinks proper to range under these three classes  i asked if there were no books of gardening i was answered that the gardener had a little house in the garden in which he had his own books but her master mrs curzon said was himself a library of gardening ordering the greater articles by his own taste  seeing a pretty glasscase in the housekeepers apartment filled with physical matters i asked if she dispensed any of those to the servants or the poor here is said she a collection of all the useful drugs in medicine but does not your ladyship know the noble method that my master has fallen into since his last arrival in england what is that he gives a salary madam to a skilful apothecary and pays him for his drugs besides and these are his though i have a key to it and this gentleman dispenses physic to all his tenants who are not able to pay for advice nor are the poor who are not his tenants refused when recommended by dr bartlett  blessings on his benevolence said i o my aunt what a happy creature am i god almighty if i disgrace not my husbands beneficence will love me for his sake  dear creature said my aunt  and for your own two i hope  there lives in an house madam continued mrs curzon within five miles of this almost in the middle of the estate and pays no rent a very worthy young man brought up under an eminent surgeon of one of the london hospitals who has orders likewise for attending his tenants in the way of his business  as also every casualty that happens within distance and where another surgeon is not to be met with and he i understand is paid on a cure actually performed very handsomely but if the patient die his trouble and attendance are only considered according to the time taken up except a particular case requires consideration  and this surgeon mrs curzon this apothecary   are noted madam for being good as well as skilful men my masters test is that they are men of seriousness and good livers their consciences he says are his security  how must this excellent man be beloved how respected mrs curzon  respected and beloved madam  indeed he is  mr richard saunders has often observed to me that if my master either rides or walks in company though of great lords people distinguish him by their respectful love to the lord they will but seem to lift up their hats as i may say or if women just drop the knee and look grave as if they paid respect to their quality only but to my master they pull off their hats to the ground and bow their whole bodies they look smilingly and with pleasure and blessings as i may say in their faces the good women courtesy also to the ground turn about when he has passed them and look after him  god bless your sweet face and god bless your dear heart will they say  and the servants who hear them are so delighted  dont your ladyship see how all his servants love him as they attend him at table how they watch his eye in silent reverence  indeed madam we all adore him and have prayed morning noon and night for his coming hither and settling among us and now is the happy time forgive me madam i am no flatterer but we all say he has brought another angel to bless us  i was forced to lean upon my aunt  tears of joy trickled down my cheeks o madam what a happy lot is mine   my uncle wonders i am not proud  proud madam  proud of my inferiority  we visited mr bartlett in his new office he is a modest ingenious young man i asked him to give me at his leisure a catalogue of the servants library for my aunt  o my dear said my aunt had your grandpapa had your papa your mamma lived to this day   i will imagine said i that i see them looking down from their heaven they bid me take care to deserve the lot i have drawn and tell me that i can only be more happy when i am what and where they are  dr bartlett attended by his servant is returned without the gentlemen i was afraid he was not very well i followed him up and told him my apprehensions  he owned afterward that he was a little indisposed when he came in but said i had made him well  i told him what had passed between mrs curzon and me he confirmed all she said  he told me that sir charles was careful also in improving his estates the minutest things he said any more than the greatest escaped not his attention he has said he a bricklayer a carpenter by the year a sawyer three months constantly in every year repairs are set about the moment they become necessary by this means he is not imposed upon by incroaching or craving tenants he will do anything that tends to improve the estate so that it is the best conditioned estate in the county his tenants grow into circumstance under him though absent he gives such orders as but few persons on the spot would think of he has a discernment that goes to the bottom of everything in a few years improving only what he has in both kingdoms he will be very rich yet answer the generous demands of his own heart upon his benevolence all the people he employs he takes upon character of seriousness and sobriety as mrs curzon told you and then he makes them the more firmly his by the confidence he reposes in them he continually in his written directions to his masterworkmen cautions them to do justice to the tenants as well as to him and even to throw the turn of the scale in their favor you are says he my friends my workmen you must not make me both judge and party only remember that i bear not imposition the man who imposes on me once i will forgive but he never shall have an opportunity to deceive me a second time for i cannot act the part of a suspicious man a watchman over people of doubtful honesty  the doctor says he is a great planter both here and in ireland and now he is come to settle here he will set on foot several projects which hitherto he had only talked of or written about  sir charles i am sure said he will be the friend of every worthy man and woman he will find out the sighing heart before it is overwhelmed with calamity  he proposes as soon as he is settled to take a personal survey of his whole estate he will make himself acquainted with every tenant and even cottager and enquire into his circumstances number of children and prospects when occasions call for it he will forgive arrears of rent and if the poor men have no prospect of success he will buy his own farms of them as i may say by giving them money to quit he will transplant one to a less another to a larger farm if the tenants consent according as they have stock or probability of success in the one or the other and will set the poor tenants in a way of cultivating what they hold as well by advice as money for while he was abroad he studied husbandry and law in order as he used to say to be his fathers steward the one to qualify him to preserve the other to manage his estate he was always prepared for and aforehand with probable events  dear dear dr bartlett said i we are on a charming subject tell me more of my sir charless management and intentions tell me all you know that is proper for me to know  proper madam everything he has done does and intends to do is proper for you and for all the world to know i wish all the world were to know him as i do not for his sake but for their own  that moment without anybodys letting me know the gentlemen were returned into the doctors apartment came sir charles my back was to the door and he was in the room before i saw him i started sir sir said i as if i thought excuses necessary  he saw my confusion that and his sudden entrance abashed the doctor sir charles reconciled us both to ourselves  he put one arm round my waist with the other he lifted up my hand to his lips and in the voice of love i congratulate you both said he such company my dearest life such company my dearest friend you cannot have every hour may i as often as there is opportunity see you together i knew not that you were the doctor and i madam stand not upon ceremony pardon me doctor i insist upon leaving you as i found you   i caught his hand as he was going  dear dear sir i attend you you shall take me with you and if you please make my excuses to my aunt for leaving her so long alone before you came in  doctor excuse us both my harriet has found for the first time a will it is her own we know by its obligingness  he received my offered hand and led me into company where my aunt called me to account for leaving her and begged sir charles would chide me  she was with dr bartlett madam said he had she been with any other person man or woman and mrs selby alone i think we would have tried to chide her  what obligation what sweet politeness my dear grandmamma  such madam is the happiness of your harriet  lucy has a charming letter to send you  from that letter you will have a still higher notion of my happiness of the dear mans unaffected tenderness to me and of the approbation of a very genteel neighborhood than i myself could give you  lady g and lady l have both made up for their supposed neglects i had written to each to charge them with having not congratulated me on my arrival here two such charming letters  i have already answered them the love as well as over thank heaven they do  your harriet grandison  letter ix lady grandison in continuation monday dec    the dearest best of men has left me just now left me  did not everybody keep me in countenance i should be very angry with myself for wishing that such a man should be always confined to my company i must keep my fondness within equitable bounds but kind man he seemed and if he seemed he was as loath to part with me he is gone to london madam poor lady beauchamp has besought his presence not at sir harrys funeral he was to be interred it seems last night but at the opening of the will and his beauchamp joined in the request  he hopes to be down with us on thursday miss mansfield took the opportunity to return to her mother who sent word that she knew not how to live without her  sir charles was pleased to give to me the keys of his study and of lady olivias cabinets lucy gave you madam an account of the invaluable contents and now i will amuse myself there and sit in every chair where i have seen him sit and tread over his imagined footsteps  tuesday my books are come and all my trinkets with them we have all been busy in classing the books my closet will be now furnished as i wish it and i shall look at these my dear companions of selbyhouse and recollect the many many happy hours they gave me there  was i ever ever unhappy my dear grandmamma if i was i have forgot the time i acquiesce cheerfully with your wishes not to disfurnish your gallery by sending to me our family pictures let those of my benevolent father and my excellent mother of happy happy memory still continue there to smile upon you as you are pleased to express yourself nobody but you and my aunt selby have a right to each of those of mine which are honored with a place in your respective drawingrooms my dear sir charles thank heaven calls the original his but why would you load me with the precious gold box and its contents less precious those though of inestimable value than my dear grandpapas picture in the lid  but i can tell you madam that sir charles is an ungrateful man he will not thank you for it a remembrance madam i know what he will say does the best of women think my harriet wants anything to remind her of the obligations she is under to parents so dear  he will be very jealous of the honor of his harriet forgive madam the freedom of my expostulation as if i were not your girl as well as his  what reasons have you found out but this was always your happy your instructive way to be better pleased with your absence from us than if you were present with us as we all often wish you  here lady l lady g sisters so dear to me since these letters will pass under your eye let me account to you by the following extract from my grandmammas last letters for the meaning of what i have written to that indulgent parent in the lines immediately preceding  you often my dearest harriet wish me to be with you in the first place i am here enjoying myself in my own way my own servants about me a trouble a bar a constraint upon no one but those to whom i make it worth while to bear with me i should think i never could do enough to strangers no though i were sure they thought i did too much in the next were i to be with you at grandisonhall i could not be everywhere so that i should be deprived of half the delightful scenes and conversations that you your aunt and lucy relate and describe to me by pen and ink nor should i be able perhaps to bear those grateful ones to which i should be present my heart my dear you know is very susceptible of joy it has long been preparing itself for the sublimest grief touches it not so much the losses i sustained of your father your mother and my own dear mr shirley made all other sorrows light nothing could have been heavy but the calamity of my gentle harriet had she been afflicted with it now i take up the kind the rapturous letters from my table where i spread them when the contents are too much for me i lay them down and resume them as my subsided joy will allow then lay them down again as i am affected by some new instance of your happiness bless god bless you your dearest of men bless everybody  in every letter i find a cordial that makes my heart light and for the time insensible of infirmity  can you my harriet be happier than i  i am called upon by my aunt and lucy i will here my dear grandmamma conclude myself  your forever obliged and dutiful harriet grandison  letter x lady grandison in continuation a treasure an invaluable treasure my dear grandmamma  on the table in sir charless own closet i took up a common prayer book under which on removing it i saw a paper written in sir charless largest hand the three last lines of which apppearing to be very serious the first side not containing them i had the curiosity to unfold it it contains reflections mingled and concluded with solemn addresses to the almighty i asked leave to transcribe them on promise that a copy as his should not pass into anybodys hands but yours i obtained it  what a comfort is it on reflection that at his own motion i joined with him in the sacramental office on occasion of our happy nuptials the first opportunity that offered a kind of renewal in the most solemn manner of our marriage vows at least a confirmation of them no wonder that the good man who could draw up such reflections should make such a motion  what credit did he do may not one say so to religion on that happy day a man of sense of dignity in his person known to be no bigot no superstitious man yet not ashamed to join in the sacred office with the meanest it was a glorious confession of his christian principles whenever he attends on public worship his seriousness his modesty his humility all show that he believes himself in the presence of that god whose blessing he silently joins to invoke and when all is over his cheerfulness and vivacity demonstrate that his heart is at ease in the consciousness of a duty performed how does my mind sometimes exult in the prospects of happiness with the man of my choice extending through divine goodness beyond this   i will conclude this letter with the copy of these reflections what is sit to come after them that can be written by  your harriet grandison  the reflections what o my heart overflowing with happiness are the sentiments that ought to spring up in thee when admitted either in the solemnities of public worship or the retiredness of private devotion into the more immediate presence of thy maker who does not govern but to bless whose divine commands are sent to succor human reason in search of happiness  let thy law almighty be the rule and thy glory the constant end of all i do let me not build virtue on any notions of honor but of honor to thy name let me not sink piety in the boast of benevolence my love of god in the love of my fellow creatures can good be of human growth no it is thy gift almighty and allgood let not thy bounties remove the donor from my thought nor the love of pleasures make me forsake the fountain from which they flow when joys entice let me ask their title to my heart when evils threaten let me see thy mercy shining through the cloud and discern the great hazard of having all to my wish in an age of such license let me not take comfort from an inauspicious omen the number of those who do amiss an omen rather of public ruin than of private safety let the joys of the multitude less allure than alarm me and their danger not example determine my choice what weigh public example passion and the multitude in one seal against reason and the almighty in the other  in this day of domineering pleasure so lower my taste as to make me relish the comforts of life and in this day of dissipation o give me thought sufficient to preserve me from being so desperate as in this perpetual flux of things and as perpetual swarm of accidents to depend on tomorrow a dependence that is the ruin of today as that is of eternity let my whole existence be ever before me nor let the terrors of the grave turn back my survey when temptations arise and virtue staggers let imagination sound the final trumpet and judgment lay hold on eternal life in what is well begun grant me to persevere and to know that none are wise but they who determine to be wiser still  and since o lord the fear of thee is the beginning of wisdom and in its progress its surest shield turn the world entirely out of my heart and place that guardian angel thy blessed fear in its stead turn out a foolish world which gives its money for what is not bread which hews out broken cisterns that hold no water a world in which even they whose hands are mighty have found nothing there is nothing lord god almighty in heaven in earth but thee i will seek thy face bless thy name sing thy praises love thy law do thy will enjoy thy peace hope thy glory till my final hour thus shall i grasp all that can be grasped by man this will heighten good and soften evil in the present life and when death summons i shall sleep sweetly in the dust till his mighty conqueror bids the trumpet sound and then shall i through his merits awake to eternal glory  letter xi lady grandison in continuation dec    sir charles god be praised arrived here in safety about two hours ago he has settled every thing between lady beauchamp and the now sir edward to the satisfaction of both for they entirely referred themselves to him this was the method he took  as their interests were not naturally the same he enquired of each separately what were the wishes of each and finding the ladys not unreasonable he referred it to sir edward of his own generosity to compliment her with more than she asked  particularly she had wished to sir charles that she might not be obliged to remove under a twelvemonth from the house in berkleysquare and when sir charles had brought them together and pronounced between them making that an article sir edward on one knee thus bespoke her  all that your ladyship demands i most cheerfully comply with instead of the year you wish to remain in berkleysquare let me beg of you still to consider both houses as your own and me your inmate only as in the lifetime of my father i never will engage in marriage but with your approbation let us madam be as little as possible separated be pleased only to distinguish that i wish not this but from pure and disinterested motives i will be your servant as well as son i will take all trouble from you that you shall think trouble but never will offer so much as my humble advice to you in the conduct of your own affairs unless you ask for it  she wept we will henceforth said she have but one interest you shall be dear to me for your fathers sake let me for the same dear sake be regarded by you receive me excellent pair of friends proceeded she as a third in your friendship should any misunderstanding arise which after so happy a setting out i hope cannot be let sir charles grandison determine between us justice and he are one  sir charles invited down to us the lady and his beauchamp he hopes they will come the young baronet i dare say will emily says she wants to see how he will become his new dignity very well i dare say said i why yes such an example before him i dont doubt but he will  lucy was present near  000 l a year and a title said she  i think you and i my dear were we nearer of an age would contend for him  not i miss selby so that i have the love of my guardian and lady grandison you may be lady beauchamp for me  you will be of another mind perhaps some time hence said miss selby  when i am replied emily tell me of it  sir charles when he was in town visited his two sisters he gave me the pleasure of acquainting me that we shall be favored with the company of lord and lady l as soon as her ladyships visits and visitings are over  mind my dear lady g what follows  lady l said he is all joy that her great event is happily over she and my lord rewarded with a dear pledge of their mutual love but is not lady g a little unaccountable my dear  as how sir  she hardly seems to receive pleasure in her happy prospects she appears to me peevish even childishly so to her lord i see it the more for her endeavors to check herself before me she submits but ungraciously to the requisites of the circumstances that lays him and me and our several united families under obligation to her i was unwilling to take notice of her particular behavior for two reasons first because she wants not understanding and would see her own error before she went too far and next because she tacitly confessed herself to be wrong by being evidently desirous to hide her fault from me but is not our charlotte a little unaccountable my dear  what my dear lady g should i have answered i hope you will allow me to be just i should have been most sincerely glad to have spoken a good word for you but to attempt to excuse or palliate an evident fault looks like a claim put in for allowances for ones own  indeed sir she is a very unaccountable creature she is afraid of you and of nobody but you you should as she could not conceal from you her odd behavior to one of the best of husbands and sweetesttemperd of men who loves her more than he loves himself and who is but too solicitous to oblige so unthankful a thing have taken notice of it and chidden her severely i for my part take liberties of this kind with her in every letter i write but to no purpose i wanted you sir to find her out yourself she will get a habit of doing wrong things and make herself more unhappy than she will make anybody else since it is possible for her to tire out her lord how insupportable to her of all women would it be were the tables to be turned and were the man she treats so ungraciously to be brought to slight her the more insupportable as she has a higher opinion of her own understanding than she has of his cannot you form to yourself my dear lady g the attitude of astonishment that your brother threw himself into   but ah my dear grandmamma do you think i said this to sir charles  no indeed for the world i would not have said one syllable of it but let lady g for a moment as she reads my letter think i did she loves to surprise why should she not be surprised in turn her displeasure would affect me greatly but if by incurring it i could do her good and put her in a right train of thinking i would incur it and on my knees afterward beg her to forgive me  he did make the above observation a thousand excellent qualities has my charlotte i particularized to her brother half a dozen and those are more than fall to the share of most of our modern people of quality and he was willing to be satisfied with them  why because he loves her but as she nowandthen whispers her harriet in her letters let me whisper her that she is under great obligation to her brother and still greater to her lord for passing over so lightly her petulances  thursday afternoon who madam do you think is arrived arrived just as we sat down to dinner and will stay with us this one night but he says no more  sir rowland meredith good man and mr fowler the latter attended his uncle reluctantly it seems but thank god he is in pretty good health how kindly how affectionately did sir charles receive them both how has he already won the heart of honest sir rowland  let me madam acquaint you with something generously particular of this worthy man  he desired sir charles to let him have me by himself for one quarter of an hour so fine a young gentleman would not he hoped be jealous of such a poor old man as he  we were in the dining room and he rising to attend me i led him to my drawing room adjoining he looked round him and was struck with the elegance of the room and furniture disregarding me for a few moments  why ay said he at last this is noble this is fine stately by mercy and he bowed to me poor man the more respectfully as i thought for what he saw and will you madam bowing again and again allow me to call you daughter i cannot part with my daughter nor would i were you a queen  you do me honor sir rowland call me still your daughter  why then you must allow me  forgive me madam  and he saluted me joy joy tenfold joy attend my daughter i dont know what to make of the present fashions would sir charles have been affronted had i taken this liberty before him the duce is in the present age they reserve themselves to holes and corners i suppose but i am sure no creature breathing could mean more respect than i do i think only of myself as of your father  you are a good man sir rowland sir charles grandison was prepared to love you he was prepared to value mr fowler  prepared by your own respect for us madam  god love you say yes  yes indeed i ever shall respect you both have i not claimed a father in you have i not claimed a brother in your nephew i never forget my relations  charming charming by mercy and he stalked to the other end of the room wiping his eyes the very same good young lady that you ever were but but but putting his hand in his pocket and pulling out a little box if you are my daughter you shall wear these for your fathers sake  how now madam refuse me i command you on your obedience to accept of this  i will not be a jackstraw father   indeed indeed sir rowland you must excuse me i thought i might have trusted myself with you alone your generosity sir is painful to me  i courtesied and withdrew to the company in the dining room the good man followed me ters upon his cheeks the box in his hand my face glowed  she calls me father sir charles and refuses her obedience here i have brought a toy or two to show my fatherly love to my daughter not a soul not my nephew there knows a syllable of the matter t was that made me call her aside  sir charles rose from his seat my dearest life is not used said he to make light of a duty taking my hand you will excuse her from accepting the present sir rowland that would look as if you thought it necessary to bribe her to do her duty she will always acknowledge her father so will i mine but you do us honor enough in the relation  what sir charles not of a present from her father to his daughter on her nuptials and as a small token of his joy on the occasion when i know not the man living out of my own family  there he stopped  my dearest love there is no resisting this plea your duty yourgratitude is engaged  look you there now look you there now god love you both everlastingly amen  and there is the blessing of a father  i took the box courtsying low but looked silly i believe  forgive me sir charles said the knight but i must  he took my hand and kissed it  and looked as if he wished to salute me  fathers my dear must be reverenced said sir charles by their children  i bent my knee and in compliance with a motion of sir charles leaned forward my cheek he saluted me and again he blessed us both  my dear nephew said he hastening to mr fowler if you envy such a man as this his good fortune by mercy i will renounce you  i may envy you sir charles said mr fowler addressing himself to him in an agreeable manner i dont know how it is possible to avoid it but at the same time i revere you for your character and accomplishments you are the only man in the world whom i could cordially congratulate as i do you on your happiness  true nephew true i any more than you should never have enjoyed myself had any of the featherheaded creatures i saw formerly endeavoring to make an interest in my daughters favor succeeded with her but you madam have chosen a man that everybody must prefer to himself  the knight after tea moved to have the box opened when sir charles saw the jewels he was a little uneasy because of the value of them a costly diamond necklace and earrings a ring of price a repeating watch finely chased the chain of which is richly ornamented one of the appendages is a picture of sir rowland in enamel adorned with brilliants an admirable likeness this i told him was more valuable to me than all the rest i spoke truth for so rich a present has made me uneasy he saw i was he knew he said that i could not want any of these things but he could not think of any other way to show his love to his daughter it was nothing to what he had intended to do in his will had i not intimated to him that what he left me should be given among his relations i am rich madam i can tell you and what on your nuptials could i do less for my daughter  sir charles said this must not end so sir rowland but i see you are an invincible man mr fowler i wish you as happily married as you deserve to be your lady will be entitled to a return of equal value  sir rowland begged that he might try on the ring himself he was allowed to do so and was pleased it was not much too big he said i should not pull it off this night i kept it on to humor the worthy man  supper over and a cheerful glass going round with my uncle mr deane and the knight sir rowland made it his odd request that i would permit sir charles to put on the necklace for me by all means i said but the knight being very earnest and my uncle seconding him for there was particularity enough in the motion to engage the dear odd man and sir charles not discouraging it my aunt and lucy smiling all the time i thought i had better comply lest the knight should take it into his head to request the putting it on himself yet i was the more reluctant on poor mr fowlers account for his smiles were but essays to smile sir charles in his own graceful manner put it on bowing low to me in the gallantest manner when he had done i courtesied to him to sir rowland and looked silly i am sure  friday noon sir rowland and mr fowler have lest us they would not stay to dinner they have business to dispatch in town that will take them up some days but they were so well pleased with their reception that they promise to see us before they set out for caermarthen  at parting sir rowland drew me aside your cousin lucy as you call her is a fine young lady they tell me that she has a great fortune but i matter not that of a straw  would to god my boy knew how to submit to his destiny like a man  hem you understand me madam  mercy i want to be akin to you  you take me madam  we are akin sir rowland meredith is my father  god bless you madam i love you dearly for that and so we are but you understand me a word to the wise she is not engaged is she  i love your uncle of all men  except the king of all men your lord and master  god bless him with what good humor he eyes us  sir charles one word with you if you please  i thought the knight had his fingers ready to take hold of sir charless button for his hand was extended but suddenly as from recollection withdrawn he led sir charles to me  and put the same question to him as he had done to me  let me ask you my dear sir rowland was this in your thought before you came hither  no by mercy  it just now struck me my nephew knew not a syllable of the matter but why you know sir charles should a man pine and die because he cannot have the she that he loves  suppose you know six men love one woman as has been the case here for aught i know what a duce are five of them to hang drown or pistol themselves or are they to outstay their time as i have done till they are fit for nobody  women must be treated with delicacy sir rowland miss selby is a young lady of great merit when questions are properly asked you hardly need to doubt of a proper answer  but sir charles is miss selby bona fide engaged or is she not that is the question i ask if she be i shall not say a word of the matter  my dear said sir charles to me  i dont know that she is answered i but lucy will never think of a man be his qualifications ever so great if he cannot give her proofs of loving her above all women  i understand you madam  well well and i should be nice too i can tell you for my boy but i will sound him i must have him married before i die if possible but no more of that for the present and now god almighty bless preserve and keep you both  i will pray for the continuance of your happiness  he kissed my hand wrung sir charless wiped his eyes made his bow and stepped into the chariot to his nephew who had taken leave of us all before  lucy with an air so like some of dear lady gs put up her saucy lip when i told her of this and bid me not write it to you but i thought were nothing to come of it it would divert my grandmamma as i am sure it will lady g  god preserve the most indulgent and pious of parents and my two sisters and their lords including the honored lord and lady you lady g are with prays  her everdutiful and their everaffectionate harriet grandison  letter xii lady grandison in continuation tuesday jan   i have been obliged by the just demands made upon us by the equallysolemn and joyful season to be silent for many days you madam and you ladies l and g have i doubt not been engaged in consequence of the same demand  so will excuse me especially as lucy and my aunt have both written and that very minutely in the interim  mr deane to our great joy has signified to us his intention to live near us and to present his house at peterborough to one of his two nephews  sir charles has besought him to consider grandisonhall as his own house he promises that he will i hope by my care of him to be an humble means of prolonging his life at least of making his latter days cheerful  what a happy season has this been to scores of people in our neighborhood but most to ourselves as the giver is more blessed than the receiver such admirable management such good order  but i told you that all was left to dr bartletts direction what a blessing is he to us and all around him  sir charles has a letter from mr lowther who is on his return from bologna by the date it should have arrived a fortnight ago so that he may be every day expected  mr lowther lets him know that the family at bologna are all in spirits on the prospect they have of carrying their point with lady clementina who however for the present declines the visits of the count of belvedere and they humor her in that particular  mr lowther is afraid he says that all is not quite right as to her mind poor lady he judges so from the very great earnestness she continues to express to make a visit to england  she received he says with great intrepidity the news of sir charless marriage she besought a blessing upon him and his bride but since has been thoughtful reserved and sometimes is found in tears when challenged she ascribed once her grief to her apprehensions that her malady may possibly return  the physicians have absolutely given their opinion that she should marry  the general is expected from naples to urge the solemnity and vows that he will not return till she is actually countess of belvedere  she begs that she may be allowed again to pass the apennines and visit mrs beaumont at florence in order to settle her mind  she dreads to see the general  how i am grieved for her  sir charles must be afflicted too why why will they not leave to time the pacifier of every woe the issue of the event upon which they have set their hearts  mr lowther writes that signor jeronymo is in a fine way  mr lowther in his letter acquits sir charles of all obligation to himself he returns him bills for the sum he had advanced and declares that he never will enter into his presence if he refuses to accept of his acquittance the family he tells him have nobly rewarded him  dr bartlett applauds mr lowthers spirit on this occasion as sir charles he says is not an ostentatious man but judges of every thing according to the rules of right and prudence he has no doubt though he might not expect this handsome treatment but he will acquiesce with it this however lessens not the comparative merit of mr lowther there are men i believe who having succeeded so well would have accepted of a reward from both parties yet on recollection sir charles stipulated with mr lowther that he should receive no fee but from himself and his present to the worthy man was the ampler on that account  i have two charming letters from the countess of d by her permission i have shown to sir charles the correspondence between that good lady and me he greatly admires her she desires that he will be acquainted with her son and declares she will always look upon me as her daughter and call me so sir charles bids me tell her that he cannot consent to her calling me so unless she will look upon him as her son and unless my lord will allow him to call him brother he bid me express his wishes of a friendship with both answerable to that desirable relation  my uncle says he knows not such a place as selbyhouse shirleymanor indeed he loves for the sake of the dear mistress of it but as long as he has with him his dame his harriet mr deane and sir charles he is happy yet my aunt nowandthen gets upon a rising ground in the park and asks pointing does not northamptonshire lie off there  emily is very good in the main dear girl i do pity her her young heart so early to be tried and tormented by the stings of hopeless love  her eyes just now were fixed for several minutes so much love in them on the face of her guardian that his modest eye sell under them  i will give you on this occasion the particulars of a conversation that passed between us which at the conclusion let in a little dawn of hope that the dear girl may be happy in time  i had more than once been apprehensive that her eyes would betray her to her guardian who at present imputes all her reverence for him to gratitude and as soon as he was withdrawn with a true sisterly tenderness come hither my love said i i was busy with my needle  she came  my dearest emily if you were to look with so much earnestness in the face of any other man as you sometimes do and just now did in that of your guardian and the man a single man he would have hope of a wife  highho sighed she did my guardian mind me  i hope he did not so much madam as you do  so much as i do my love  yes madam when my guardian is present you do look very hard at me but i hope i am not a confident girl  you are serious my emily  and so is my dear lady grandison  i was a little surprised the child abashed me her love thought i will make her hardy without intending to be so  she was too innocent even for consciousness of having disconcerted me she looked upon my work what would i give madam to be so fine a workwoman as you  but why that sigh madam  the poor lady clementina said i i was really thinking of her  do you sigh for everybody madam that loves my guardian  there are different sorts of love emily  why so i think nobody loves my guardian better than i myself do but it is not the love that lady clementina bears him i love his goodness  and does not clemementina  yes yes but still the love is different  explain my dear your kind of love  impossible  why now sighs my emily you asked me why i sighed i have answered it was from pity  why madam i can pity lady clementina and i do but i sigh not for her because she might have had my guardian and would not  i sigh for her the more for that very reason emily her motive so great  pho pho her motive when he would have allowed her to be of her own religion  then you sigh not now for clementina emily  i believe not  for whom then  i dont know you must not ask a habit and nothing else  again sighs my emily  you must not mind me madam a habit i tell you but believe me lady grandison hiding her blushing face in my bosom her arms about my neck i believe if the truth were known   she stopped but continued there her glowing cheek   what my dear if the truth were known  i dare not tell you you will be angry at me  indeed my love i will not  o yes but you will  i thought we had been sisters my dear i thought we were to have no secrets tell me what if the truth were known  why madam for a trial of your forgivingness tell me are you not apt to be a little jealous  jealous my emily you surprise me why of whom of what jealous jealousy is doubt of whom should i doubt  people have not always cause i suppose madam  explain yourself my dear  are you not angry with me madam  i am not but why do you think me jealous  you need not indeed my guardian adores you you deserve to be adored  but you should allow a poor girl to look upon her guardian nowandthen with eyes of gratitude your charming eye is so ready to take mine to task  i am if i know myself a poor innocent girl i do love my guardian that is certain so i ever did you know madam and let me say before he knew there was such a lady in the world as yourself madam  i threw aside my work and clasping my arms about her and love him still my emily you cannot love him so well as he deserves you are indeed a dear innocent but not a poor girl you are rich in the return of his love i will ever ever be a promoter of an affection so innocent so pure on both sides but jealousy my dear do you charge me with jealousy impossible i should deserve it my only concern is lest as the heart is guessed at by the eyes the hearts of young creatures especially whose good minds are incapable of art or design you should give room for the censorious who know not as i do that your love is reverence next to filial to attribute it to a beginning of the other sort of love which yet in you were it kindled would be as bright and as pure a flame as ever warmed a virgin heart  o madam how you express yourself what words you have they go to my heart  i dont know how it is but every day i reverence more and more my guardian reverence yes that is the proper word i thank you for it filial reverence just the thing and let me say that i never reverenced him so much as now that i see what a polite what a kind what an affectionate husband he makes my dear lady grandison yet let me tell you truth madam i should i am afraid be such a littleminded poor creature that if i were married and had not a husband that was very like him i should envy you i should be at least unhappy  if you could be envious my dear you would be unhappy but you must never encourage the addresses of a man who you think loves you not better than any other woman who is not a good man upon principle who is not a man of sense and that has seen something of the world  and where madam can such a man be found  leave it to your guardian my dear he if anybody will find you a man that you may be happy with if your eye be not aforehand with your judgment  that madam i hope it will not be first because the reverence i have for my guardian and his great qualities will make all other men look little in my eye and next as i have such a confidence in his judgment that if he points his finger and says that is the man emily i will endeavor to like him but i believe i never now shall like any man on earth  it is early days my love but is there not some one man that were you of age to marry you would think better of than of any other  i dont know what to say to that it is early days as you say i am but a girl but girls have thoughts i will tell you madam that the man who has passed some years in the company of sir charles grandison who is beloved by him on proof on experience as i may say of his good heart  she stopped  beauchamp my dear  why yes him i mean he is the most to be liked of any man but my guardian but he now is a great man and i suppose may have seen the woman he could love  i fansy not my dear  why do you fansy not madam  because if i must speak as freely to you as i would have you do always to me i think he shows great and uncommon respect to you though you are so young a creature  that is for my guardians sake but be that as it will let me be secure of my guardians love and yours and i shall have nothing to wish for  her guardian my guardian my friend my lover my husband every sweet word is one coming in put an end to the subject i leave this conversation to your own reflections my dear grandmamma lady l lady g but i have hopes from it  letter xiii lady grandison in continuation saturday sunday jan  0    another long silence lucy will supply all my defects she will tell you how much i have been engaged she has sent you a charming letter filled with observations on the good order established here before our arrival by dr bartlett and mrs curzon with accounts of some particular charities both public and private that deserve to be imitated by all who have ability and of our visit made last wednesday at mansfieldhouse  the lady of it would not part with us till thursday the days being short and the weather unfavourable mr dobson and his lady were guests there he is a credit to his cloth his wife to him they are greatly beloved by all who know them lady mansfield and miss mansfield are all that is polite and good the three brothers were there the eldest who was once a melancholy man is now one of the chearfullest with what pleasure did i meditate as i looked upon them the restoration of such a worthy and ancient family to affluence they were born to it yet when they were deprived of it how glorious was the resignation of mother and daughters and now how easy sits the prosperity upon them never saw i eyes more expressive of gratitude to a benefactor than those both of ladies and gentlemen as they were often cast upon my dear sir charles  i heartily wish mr orme may find his expectations answered in the second voyage nancy tells me he is preparing for to lisbon she will make known my best wishes for the restoration of his health how good is his sister to accompany him  i always loved her  i received yesterday yours madam acquainting me with mr grevilles visit and proposal and asking my opinion of the latter and whether i would choose to mention it to lucy and my aunt what can i say you once told me madam that you believed lucy would not have refused mr greville had he first applied to her lucys grandmother you say is not averse to the match and you think my uncle would not refuse his consent because of the contiguity of their respective estates and in hopes that he might resume with success on such an event his favorite project of exchange of lands yet i am sure this consideration would have no weight with him if he thought lucy could not be happy with mr greville  i have mentioned it to my aunt she says mr greville is not a bashful man he knows how to apply to lucy himself and she has no notion in such a case of that pride which withholds him till he thinks himself sure of the familyinterest  he will if possible he says be related to me let that be mentioned to lucy as one of his principal motives and his business with her is done for ever  lady g would laugh at the notion of a difficulty from a first love first love she calls first nonsense too frequently it is so lucy is a noble girl she has overcome a first attachment the more laudably as it cost her some struggles to do it mr greville i doubt has had several first loves this transition therefore is nothing to him so neither of them will be first love to the other it may therefore be a match of discretion yet his character the reformation he boasts of  i hope he is reformed but i have no notion of a good young woman as lucy is trusting her person i may say her principles to the arbitrary will of an impetuous man who has been an a vowed libertine and pretend not to have reformed from proper convictions a scoffer too how came he by his new lights  you madam have told us young folks the difficulty of overcoming evil habits i own that lucy always spoke of him with more faviour than anybody else she was inclined to think him a goodnatured man and was pleased with what she called humor in him humor i never could call it so humor i used to tell her is a gentle a decent though a lively thing mr greville is boisterous impetuous rude i had almost said his courtship to me was either rant or affront the one to show his plaindealing the other his love he knows not what respectful love is in short his mirth his goodnature as it is called has fierceness in it it always gave me apprehension  as to worldly matters there can be no exception to him but i cannot be of the opinion of lucys grandmother that he is a generous man he has only qualities that look like generosity his start to me when he resigned his pretensions to me as they have been called for i know not any he had was only a start he could not hold it but be all these things as they may how can i who love lucy as myself propose to the dear girl a man whom i could not think of for myself lucy has a fine fortune and surely there are men enough in the world who have never made pretensions to lucys cousin who would think themselves honored by her acceptance otherwise i should after sir rowlands hint and earnest wishes in his nephews favor much sooner recommend mr fowler to her than mr greville  my aunt had said that for her part she should choose to leave the above affair to its own workings yet could not forbear to acquaint lucy with it the dear girl came to me to demand a sight of your letter and of what i had written upon it i could not though i had some little reluctance to show her the latter deny her i will give you madam the substance of a short dialogue that passed between us on the occasion and leave it to you to draw such conclusions from it as you shall judge proper with regard to my lucys inclinations  she did not know what i meant she said by writeing to you that she had always spoken of mr greville with more favor than anybody else  it is ungenerous lucy if you are angry at what you would oblige me to show you against my will  i am not angry but  she stopped and would not explain her half sullen but o lucy thought i you are a woman my dear  as to what you write said she of his desire of being related to you who would not  if that be not his principal motive  very well lucy thought i  i know said she that my grandmamma selby has often wished mr greville would make his addresses to her granddaughter  so so so lucy thought i  his libertinism indeed is an objection  but i have not heard lately of any enormities   go on lucy thought i hitherto appears not any reason for mr greville to despair  he may have seen his folly  no doubt but he has thought i he saw it all the time he was committing it but perhaps he is the more determined bad man for that is not purity of heart thought i as well as of manners an eligible thing  if a woman is not to marry till she meet with a strictly virtuous man   you have too often pleaded that argument lucy to me  i am sorry  i stopped willing to hear her quite out for she held before her what i had written  how came he you ask said she by his new lights i have nothing to do with how he came by them i should rather indeed he had them from proper convictions  but if he has them that is enough  is it my dear let him have been what he will  i am for judging charitably   charming thought i  judging charitably so i have lost a virtue and you lucy have found it  mr greville is nothing to me nor ever will be  not quite so sure of that thought i to myself  you say harriet you have no notion of a good young woman trusting her principles to the arbitrary will of a man who has been a free liver  must the man be arbitrary  were a husband a free liver must a wifes own principles be endangered  these questions from my lucy thought i  a scoffer you say harriet  the mans a fool for that  but what a poor soul must she be that could not silence a scoffer  silence a scoffer ah lucy said i and would you marry a man with a hope to be able to silence him mr greville is a conceited man my lucy has six times his sense but he will not be convinced of that you will have the less influence upon him if he is jealous of the superiority of your understanding mr greville is obstinate as well as conceited few men i believe will own conviction from a wifes arguments  to be sure the man is not a sir charles grandison who is  let him as my aunt selby says apply to me i shall give him his answer  you would wish he should lucy  i dont say so  i fancy lucy you would not be very cruel if he did  you fancy i would not  but i can as you always did treat the man who professes to love me with civility yet not throw myself into his arms at the first word   first word lucy no the second or third or fourth is time enough so the man is not mean time rendered quite hopeless  very well lady grandison but let me go on with what you have written  goodnatured man  i do think he is not an illnatured man  so much the better for himself and his future wife lucy  that will not be i lady grandison  perhaps not lucy   humor i do think he is a humorous goodnatured man a little too vehement perhaps in his mirth a little too frolic but who is faultless  proceed my lucy   generous not a generous man  qualities that look like generous ones  you are a nice distinguisher harriet you always were  but here you tell your grandmamma that you had rather i should have mr fowler than mr greville   well my dear and what say you to that  why i say i think you are not so nice for me in this case as you are in others  how so  how so why is there not a difference between the actual proposals made by mr greville to mrs shirley and sir rowlands undertaking to try to prevail upon mr fowler to make his addresses to me  granted my dear  i have not a word more to say in behalf of mr fowler mr greville lucy   is a man i never will have   no rash resolutions my dear and yet i believe a woman has seen the same man in a very different light when he has offered himself to her acceptance from what she did before  i believe so  but i had a mind to sound you harriet and to come at your opinion   you were entitled to it lucy without attempting to sound me for it  true but we women sometimes choose to come at a point by the roundabouts rather than by the forerights  that is lucy either when we think the foreright way as you call it would not answer our wishes or when we are not willing to open our own hearts  your servant my dear but the cap fits not whenever i speak to you my heart is upon my lips  let me try then in this one doubtful instance that i ever had from you of its being so do you think of encouraging mr grevilles proposal  it is not a proposal till it comes in a direct way to myself  very well my dear  i say no more till it does  sir charles has just now heard that mr lowther is arrived in london he longs so i am sure do i to know how affairs are situated in italy o for good news from thence then will my happiness in this life be perfected  letter xiv lady grandison in continuation grandisonhall thursday jan    mr lowther arrived here last night sir charles gave him a most welcome reception he presented him to all our guests with expressions of the warmest friendship and then retired with him to his study he soon led him back to company and seating him drew a chair between my aunt and me  you must have curiosity my dearest love said he behold the sisterexcellence of lady clementina mr lowther not a person of her family is more concerned for the happiness of that lady than this dearest and most generous of women every one of my friends present looking round him is an admirer of her  we cannot my dear applying to me know for certainty the destiny of that excellent lady from mr lowther he passed a week at lions a fortnight at paris on his return to england but my jeronymo is in a fine way thank god and resolves to visit us in the spring  i hope sir said my aunt to mr lowther you left lady clementina well and happy in her mind  she was at florence answered he when i left italy she has been pretty much indisposed there the general the bishop and father marescotti had been with her she was expected at bologna very soon by this time i have no doubt she is countess of belvedere  by her own consent i hope then mr lowther said i eagerly  he shook his head  as to that said he she has the most indulgent of parents   they cannot be so mr lowther if they would compel her to marry any man to whom she has an indifference  they will not compel her madam   persuasion sir in the circumstances this excellent lady is in is compulsion  i think it may be justly called so said sir charles mr lowther they should not have been so precipitating  so you have always told them sir charles signor jeronymo is entirely of your opinion yet is earnest in the count of belvederes favor the count adores her  adores her sir said i adores himself for so it should be said pardon me sir of a man who prefers not the happiness of the object beloved to his own i felt my face glow  generous warmth said sir charles  laying his hand on mine  for my part replied mr lowther i am only afraid of the return of her malady if it do not return and she can be prevailed on her piety will reconcile her to a duty   a duty mr lowther interrupted i  so imposed  a duty   i knew not what i said i thought at that instant i did not like mr lowther  my uncle aunt and the rest of us thought sir charles and mr lowther would be glad to be left alone and retired early  my aunt my lucy and i had a good deal of discourse upon this interesting subject emily present  we all foresaw that the situation of this admirable lady would overcloud a little we hoped but a little the happiest days that ever mortals knew the sincere value said my aunt that you have for so deserving a woman and your native generosity will be your security for happiness my dear and will six on a durable base your mutual love but this ladys trials will however be trials to you god give her peace of mind it is all we can hope for in her favor to you the continuance of your present happiness greater cannot fall to the lot of mortal  she left me i retired to my pen  thus far have i written it is late sir charles is coming up  and i am here at my pen i will compliment him with a place in my closet while i retire  goodnight my dearest grandmamma pray for your harriet and pray for clementina  friday morning sir charles would have withdrawn to his study when he found me at my pen i besought him to sit down in my closet  remove your papers then my dear  no need sir these putting what i had been just writing and those i had written the day before on one side of my desk i would not sir except you have a curiosity wish you to see at present these sir you may if you please amuse yourself with  i will take down one of your books my love i will not look into any of your written papers  dear generous sir look into them all  look into both parcels something about lucy something of what mr lowther has talked of in that parcel  read any of the written papers before you  a generous mind my love will not take all that is offered by a generous mind hasten my harriet it is late my mind is a little disturbed yours i am afraid is generously uneasy in your faithful bosom will i repose all my cares  i pressed his hand between both mine and would have pressed it with my lips but kissing my hands first one then the other  condescending goodness said he god continue to me my harriets love and make clementina not unhappy and what can befall me that will not add thankfulness to thankfulness  with what soothing tenderness did he afterward open his generous heart to his harriet he was indeed disturbed for mr lowther had told him that the general i dont love him was quite cruel  at one time he threatened the excellent creature he called her ungenerous ungrateful undutiful  she fell down at his seet in a fainting fit he left her in anger  staid not to recover or sooth her  yet returned in about two hours his conscience stinging him and on his knees besought her pardon  received it  the dear saint forgave the soldierly man  yet he persisted and turned his threatenings into worse if possible than threatenings into persuasion  if i have an enemy said the dear creature to her brothers who has conceived a mortal antipathy to me let him insinuate himself into the favor of those most dear to me and prevail upon them to attack me with all the powers of persuading love in order to induce me to do the thing whatever it be most contrary to my heart and then will the instigator wreak upon me his whole vengeance and make me think death itself an eligible refuge  sir charles sighed at repeating this i wept how happy thought i more than once are you best of men in your own reflections that a woman so excellent who cannot be happy with any other man herself refused you and persisted in her refusal though you sought all ways and used all arguments to bring her to a change of determination what otherwise would have been your regret and how unhappy should i have been in the consciousness of being in her place and of having dispossessed her of a heart to which she had so much better pretensions now has he no room for remorse but for friendly pity only and for wishes to relieve her afflicted heart of what a blessing is that man possessed who when calamity assails him can acquit himself his intentions at least and say this i have not brought upon myself it is an inevitable evil a dispensation of providence i will call it and submit to it as such  methinks madam i could spare this excellent woman some of my happiness have i not more than mortal ever knew before  sir charles mentioned to me that lady olivia in her last letter to him intimated her desire to come over once more to england but he hoped what he had written to dissuade her from it would have weight with her i told him i wished that lady the wife of some worthy man whose gratitude and affection she by her great fortune might engage but sir said i i cannot cannot wish be the count of belvedere ever so good a man that lady clementina were married  what would my harriet wish for lady clementina circumstanced as she is  i dont know but the woman who has loved sir charles grandison with a heart so pure can never be happy with any other man  you are ever obliging my love you judge of clementina as she deserves to be judged of as to the purity of her heart but  he stopped  but what my dear sir  alas she says that you have strengthened the hands of her friends am i forgiven before i go any further  not my harriet if you think it necessary to ask such a question blame me always when you think me wrong i shall doubt your love if you give me reason to question your freedom  dear sir  but answer me would you have clementina circumstanced as she is marry  what answer can i return to my harriets question when sometimes i am ready to favor the parents pleas at others the daughters i would not have her either compelled or overearnestly persuaded the family plead that their happiness her health and peace depend on her marriage they cannot bear to think of rewarding laurana for her cruelty with an estate that never was designed for her and to the cutting it off as it may happen from their giacomo and his descendants for ever in case clementina assumes the veil the health of the father and mother are declining they wish but to live to see the alliance with the count of belvedere take place the noble lady gave reasons that could be answered she had by her own magnanimity got over a greater difficulty if i may presume to say so than they had required her to struggle with how could i avoid advising her to yield to the supplications of parents of brothers of an uncle who however mistaken in the means by which they seek to obtain their wishes love not their own souls better than they love their clementina  it was besides a measure by which only at the time i could demonstrate and the general i know considered it as a test that i really gave up all hopes of her myself  and when i had owned that there was a woman with whom i had no doubt of being happy could i engage her to accept of me they all besought me for their sakes for clementinas to court that acceptance having hopes that though she could not set me an example she would follow mine  this my dearest life was the occasion as i told your friends of accelerating my declaration to you i could not else either for the sake of your delicacy or my own so soon have made proposals not even to mrs shirley for situated as i was i could not think of applying to you till i had strengthened myself as i hoped to do by her interest your generous acceptance signified to me by that good lady has for ever obliged me i regarded it my harriet circumstanced as i had been and shall ever regard it as a condescension which as i told that lady at the time laid me under an obligation that i never by my utmost gratitude shall be able to repay  o sir well have you shown that you meant what you said how poor a return hiding my face in his generous bosom is my love for so much goodness and kind consideration  he clasped me to the faithfullest of human hearts  but dear sir i find i find on the whole that you think lady clementina has not so much reason on her side as her parents have on theirs  my tenderness for her my dear because of her unhappy malady and my apprehension of a return of it together with my admiration of her noble qualities prejudice me strongly in her favor if she could be convinced by their motives i should be ready to own my convictions in favor of these but if she cannot neither can i so partial am i in the cause of a lady i so sincerely admire and who has been so much afflicted but what in the situation they and she were in remain for me to do but to advise the family to proceed with tenderness and patience that their clementina might have time to weigh to consider their reasons their indulgence you my dear shall see in the copies of the letters i have written since i have been in england my remonstrances to them on their precipitating her but they were in a train they presumed on the characteristic duty of their clementina they flattered themselves that sometimes she seemed to relent they conceived hopes from the expressions of compassion for the count of belvedere which sometimes she let fall the general who though a generous man can do nothing moderately would not be satisfied with cold measures as he called them and not doubting his sisters acquiescence with her duty if once she could be prevailed upon to think her compliance such they were resolved to pursue the train they were in but in order to avoid their importunities how has the dear clementina shifted the scene from bologna to florence from florence to bologna and once for that purpose wanted to go to urbino once to naples and even as you have seen to come to england  but now by this time most probably they have succeeded god give happiness to the dear clementina  most cordially did i join in the prayer  the next letters from italy must acquaint us with the unwishedfor success of the family and the poor ladys thraldom can my dear grandmamma the count of belvedere really be a good a generous man to solicit the favor of a hand that he knows will not be accompanied by a heart can the man be said to know what true love is who prefers not the happiness of the beloved object to his own who can in short think he can be happy though the person he professes to love shall be unhappy  thank god this dreadful lot has not been drawn by  your harriet grandison i am glad my dear lady g that you are returned to grosvenorsquare be easy be patient my charlotte we shall have i hope many happy days together at grandisonhall at grosvenorsquare at every place where we shall be you are a dear fretful creature  but not half so petulant i hope in behavior as on paper to me let us think of nothing grievous my charlotte but of the unhappy situation of poor lady clementina and let us join to pray for her happiness    letter xv lady grandison in continuation saturday morning feb   emily and i have had another conversation she had been more grave and solemn than usual from the time of the last of which i gave you an account  her anne had taken notice to sally of a change in the temper of her young mistress she knew not how to please her she said from the bestnatured young lady in the world she was grown one of the most peevish and she had taken the liberty to tell her that she must quit her service if she found her so hard to be pleased  do then was her answer i will not be threatened by you anne you seem to have found out your consequence with me go anne as soon as you will i will not be threatened anne i have enough to vex me without being disturbed by you  the honest maid who dearly loves her and has been with her ever since she was seven years old and was much approved for her fidelity and good behavior by her father burst out into tears and would in a mild and humble manner have expostulated with her let me beseech you madam said she to permit me a word or two by way of dutiful expostulation but she hurried from her  i will not hear you anne you have begun at the wrong end you should have expostulated and not threatened first and then going up to her closet she locked herself in  i pitied the dear girl too well i thought i could account for this change of temper in her so exceeding good her guardian to her her gratitude augmented her love dont i know how that might easily be yet thought i it would half break her heart if he were to assume reserve  i would not for her sake have him imagine there was a necessity for a change of his behavior to her and indeed if he were to be more reserved what would that do so good a man so uniform his goodness the poor emily must acquit him and condemn herself yet have no cure for her malady  sally offered anne to acquaint me with what had passed but the good young woman begged she would not her young lady was so tenacious she said young lady like of her authority that she would never forgive her if she were known to make an appeal to me or to my aunt and to complain without a probability of redress the prudent creature observed except to her as one ladys woman to another would expose her beloved young mistress when perhaps the present grievance might be cured by time assiduity and patience  this was necessary to premise  sir charles my uncle and mr deane having rode out pretty early this morning to breakfast at sir william turners and my aunt and lucy retiring after breakfast to write and i to my closet for the same purpose emily came and tapped at my door i instantly opened it  i intrude madam  no my dear  i had observed at supper last night and at breakfast this morning that she had been in tears though nobody else did for the above hints privately given me by sally made me more observant of her motions  i took her hand and would have placed her by me  no madam said she let me stand i am not worthy of sitting down in your presence  her eyes were brimful of tears but as she twinkled in hopes to disperse them i would not take such full notice of them as might make them run over if they could be dispersed yet mine i believe glistened sympathetically  in my presence my emily my friend why why this  i stood up your elder sister my love sits not while her younger stands  she threw her arms about me and her tears ran over this goodness this goodness kills me  i am i am a most unhappy creature  unhappy from the grant of my own wishes  o that you would treat me severely i cannot cannot support myself under the hourly instances which i receive of your goodness  whence my dearest emily these acknowlegements i do love my emily and should be either ungrateful or insensible to the merits of my beloved sister did i not do all in my power to make her happy what can i do for her that is not her due  she struggled herself out of my embracing arms withdrawing hers  let me let me go madam  she hurried into the adjoining apartment i followed her and taking her hand leave me not in this perplexity my emily i cannot part with you if you love your harriet as she loves her emily you will put me in the way of alleviating this anguish of the most innocent and most amiable of minds open your heart to me my dear  o lady grandison the deserving wife of the best of men you ought to hate me  my dearest emily said i  indeed you ought  let us sit down on this sofa if you will not return to my closet  i sat down she sat by me leaning her glowing face on my shoulder i put one arm round her neck with the other hand i grasped one of hers now my dear i conjure you by the friendship that is between us the more than sisterly friendship open your whole heart to me and renounce me if it be in my power to heal the wounds of your mind and i do not pour into them the balm of friendly love  what can i say  yesterday my dearest lady grandison i received an answer to a case i put to dr bartlett of a young creature who  i cannot tell you   she wept raised her head dried her eyes again leaned her face on my shoulder again i put my arm round her neck  your case my love  ah madam my case  did you say my case  i asked my dear not as for your case any other than as for the case you put to the doctor  he has not told you madam  indeed he has not said a word of your consulting him  i had rather tell you myself i am afraid he guesses who the young woman is o the poor cunning  i am a weak silly creature  he certainly guesses   may i my love see the case  may i see the answer to it  i have burnt them both  in a fit of anger at myself that i should expose myself for he certainly guesses who the young woman is i threw them in the fire  but you can tell me the case you can give me the substance of the answer  how can i you of all women you madam whom i best love of all women but who ought to hate to despise me  trust me love with your secret it shall never without your leave pass this faithful bosom if it be a secret that already i do not guess at  she started  guess at madam  dont start at what i say my love  o you cannot cannot guess at it if you did   what if i did  then would you banish from your presence for ever the justly hated emily then would you make my guardian renounce me  shall i my dear tell you what i guess  whisper me then throwing about me the hand i held not but whisper me that i may not hear  you love your guardian my emily  he loves you  o madam  he will always love you so will i  banish the criminal from your presence for ever rising yet again laying her face on my shoulder  and clasping her arms about me hide me hide me from myself  no need my dear everybody loves your guardian you cannot love him but with innocence your love is founded in gratitude so was mine dont i know how to allow for my emily  you will banish fear from my heart madam by this your goodness to me i find i may own all my weakness my folly to you and the rather as i shall entitle myself by it to your advice i wanted to do it but was afraid you would hate me in the same circumstances i doubt i should not be so generous as you are o that i had not put my case to the doctor  the doctor my dear is all goodness he will keep your secret   and not tell my guardian madam any thing about it it would be worse than death to me if my guardian should mistrust me he would hate the poor emily if you did not  he never shall know it my dear you have already engaged the doctor to secrecy i doubt not  i have  he will inviolably keep your secret no fear especially as your charming ingenuousness to me will be a means of putting you and me my love on finding expedients that shall equally secure your honor and your guardians regard for you  that madam is the very thing  open then to me your innocent heart my dear regard me as your friend your sister and as if i were not the happy wife of your beloved guardian   and so i will  i did not madam mistrust myself till the solemnity had passed that made you and my guardian one then i began to be uneasy with myself and the more as i was for hiding myself from myself as i may say for i was afraid of looking into my heart why so thought i am i not an innocent girl what do i wish for what can i hope for do i not love lady grandison i do yet nowandthen  dont hate me madam i will reveal to you all my heart and all my weakness  proceed my emily this is indeed a token of your love of your confidence in me what a compliment does my dearest younger sister make to her elder  yet nowandthen something like envy i thought arose in my heart and can your countenance forbear to change when i tell you of envy  if it did it would be from compassionate love to my emily you dont know my dear how my heart dilates on this your most agreeable confidence in me  god bless that dear heart  there never was such a heart as yours well but i will go on if you please  do my dear  here thought i once that i was resolved to call myself to account did i ask the favor of being allowed to live with my guardian and his lady when they were married and what did i mean by it nothing but innocence believe me well and my request is granted this was all that i thought was wanting to make me happy but said i to myself am i happy no do i love my guardian less no do i love lady grandison more for granting me this favor i admire her more i think and i have a grateful sense of her goodness to me but i dont know how it is  i think though i dearly love her yet i would be sometimes glad i did not quite so well ungrateful emily and severely i took myself to task surely pity madam is near akin to love for while your suspenses lasted i thought i loved you better than i loved my own heart but when you were happy and there was no room for pity wicked wretch that i was i wanted methought sometimes to lower you  dont you hate me now  no no my emily my pity as you say increases my love of you proceed child your mind is the unsullied book of nature turn to another leaf depend upon my kindest allowances i knew before you knew it yourself that you loved your guardian  before i knew it myself why that might be so i went on reasoning with myself  what emily can thou love thy guardian more and lady grandison with all her goodness to me not more  and can thou mingle envy with admiration of her  ah silly and worse that silly girl where may this end  lord bless me if i suffer myself to go on thus shall i not be the most ungrateful of creatures shall i not instead of my guardians love incur his hatred will not all the world despise me  and where may this stop  yet i went on excusing myself for i knew i had no vile meaning i knew i only wanted my guardian to love me and to be allowed to love him but what thought i at last can i allow myself inloving a married man the husband of my friend and sometimes i trembled at the thought for i looked back and said to myself would thou emily a year ago have allowed in thyself but the same lengths that thou have now run  no answered i my own question is not this a fair warning of what may be a year hence  so i put a case to dr bartlett as of three persons of my annes acquaintance two young women one young man living in one house the young man contracted to one of the young women the other knowing it and though a person incapable of a criminal thought yet finding an increasing regard for the young man though she dearly loved her friend began to be afraid her heart was not quite as it should be what i asked as for my annes friend would he advise in the case  and what my dear was the doctors advice  i was a silly creature to put it to him as i said he certainly must guess if you madam could without such a case put he certainly must we young girls think if we put our hands before our eyes nobody can see us in short the doctor pronounced the increasing regard to be a beginning love the consequence would be that the young woman would in time endeavor to supplant her friend though at present she might probably shudder at the thought he bid me tell anne to warn her acquaintance against the growing flame he said she might entangle her own heart and without gaining her end render unhappy a couple who according to my representation from my anne deserved to be happy and he advised by all means that she should leave the contracted couple to themselves and for her own honors her own hearts sake remove to as great distance from them as possible  believe me madam i was shocked i was frighted at myself i threw the papers in the fire and have been ever since i read them more unhappy than usual my dear lady grandison then thought i i will if you give me encouragement open my heart to you you will hear of my folly my weakness one day or other  and now dear good madam forgive me keep my secret and advise me what to do  what my dearest creature can i advise you i love you i ever will love you i will be as careful of your honor as of my own i will endeavor to cultivate your guardians affection to you  he never madam i hope guessed at the poor emilys folly  he never mentioned you to me but with love and tenderness  thank god  but say advise me madam my heart shall be in your hand guide it as you please  what my dear did you think of doing yourself  i must not think of living with you now madam  why not you shall find me ever your true friend  but i am sure dr bartletts advice to annes acquaintance is right i tell you madam that i must every day and every hour of the day that i see his tender behavior to you that i behold him employed in acts of beneficence that i see every one adoring him admire him more i see that i am less my own mistress than i thought it was possible i could be and if such a girl as i have so little command of myself and his merit every hour spreading itself out before me with increasing luster my weak eyes will not be able to bear his glory  o madam i ought to fly i am resolved whatever it cost me to fly  how i admired how i pitied how i loved the dear creature i clasped both my arms about her and pressing her to my bosom  what can i say my emily what can i say tell me what would you wish me to say  you are wise madam you have a tender and generous heart o that i were half as good  advise me something  i see the folly of my wishing to live with you and my guardian  and is it necessary my dear to a conquest of yourself that we should not live together  absolutely so i am convinced of it  suppose my dear you go to the london house and put yourself under mrs grandisons protection  what madam my guardians house still  i hope a few weeks absence by help of a discretion of which you have in the present conversation given shining proofs will answer all we wish since you never my dear could have thought but of admiring and that at distance the great qualities of your guardian  i have it is true but just found myself out i never could have hope of being looked upon in any other light than as his daughter and i hope i have made the discovery in time but i must not be with him in his own house i must not be in the way of his constant conversation  admirable discretion amiable innocence  well then suppose you request lady l lady g   ah no no that would not do neither my guardianwould be the continual subject of our conversation and often very often his brotherly goodness would lead him to them them to him  charming fortitude heroic emily how i admire you i see you have thought attentively of this matter what are your thoughts  cannot you guess  i know what i wish  but you must speak first  dont you remember what the blessed mrs shirley i must call her blessed said to me on your weddingday in the vestry  i do my dearest emily and are you inclined   shall i be received madam as a second harriet in your family it would be my ambition to tread in your steps at selbyhouse and shirleymanor to hear from you to write to you to form myself by the model by which you were formed to be called by mrs shirley by mrs selby their emily  how you would rejoice them all my emily and if we must part me to have my emily be to my dearest friends what their harriet so happily was  but madam will you undertake to procure my guardians consent  i will endeavor it  endeavor it then it is done he will deny you nothing will good mrs shirley consent  i have no doubt but she will if your guardian do  will mrs selby will mr selby be my uncle and aunt  we will consult them they are happily with us you know  but madam there is one objection a very great one  what is that my love  your cousin james selby i should respect him as your cousin and as the brother of the two miss selbys but that is all  i never my dear approved of any motion of that kind not one of my friends think of it they wish it not he has met with discouragement from every one of my family and his own he submits to the discouragement  then madam if you please to break the matter to mr and mrs selby and to mrs shirley without letting them know the poor girl flies to them as for refuge against herself and satisfy lady l lady g and mrs eleanor grandison that i mean nothing of slight to them then will i attend mr and mrs selby in their return home and i shall be in a while a very happy girl i doubt not but still remember madam i must love my guardian but it shall be with a love that shall not exclude lady grandison from a large share of it the largest if i can and now clasping her arms about my neck let me beg your pardon for all the strange things i have said my heart will be the easier for having found a confident such a confident however as no girl ever found before  but in this instance of goodness you more than equal lady clementina herself and a thousand thousand thanks for your patience with me on such a subject  yet say say my dear lady grandison you dont hate the poor girl who has the vanity to emulate you and lady clementina  i wept over her from joy pity tenderness  will you not my dear grandmamma love my emily more than ever will you call her your emily and think of her as your harriet  lady l lady g will you excuse the preference she has given to quiet northamptonshire against noisy london and its gay scenes at so young a time of life  excuse it i am sure you will think that the reason she has given for the preference lifts her up above woman  monday feb   i have already obtained my uncles and aunts and lucys high approbation of emilys proposal they at her request asked sir charless consent as a favor he desired to see her upon it she came in bashful her steps unassured looking down he took her hand my good emily said he i am told that you have a desire to restore to mrs shirley mrs selby and mr selby the granddaughter and niece i have robbed them of they rejoice in your proposal you will be exceedingly happy in their protection my harriet will be loath to part with you but for their sakes as well as yours she will cheerfully acquiesce and though we wanted it not we shall have an additional pleasure in visiting northamptonshire  it is your deliberate choice my dear  it is sir and i hope i may be allowed to accompany mrs selby down  settle the matter ladies among yourselves i have but one thing to add on the subject you have a mother my dear we must not absolutely resolve till we have her consent she is good now you must make a compliment to my sisters and their lords also and to my aunt grandison they love my ward and she must preserve every worthy persons love  the dear girl courtesied wept  you are all  all

mean time if there be anything further in my power to oblige you  o sir you must not she ran to me and in my bosom weeping spoke out her sentence be too good to me  i kissed the dear girls forehead  heroic emily whispered i to confirm her in her heroism  and thus already my dearest grandmamma is this material article settled my aunt answers for your approbation and lucy for the pleasure that this acquisition as i may call it will give to nancy to miss holless and all our other kindred and acquaintance but how when the time comes shall i part with her  what i wonder will sir edward beauchamp say to this  he must get his dear friends leave to visit with us shirleymanor and selbyhouse which i hope we shall do twice a year at least  my uncle and aunt lucy and mr deane are exceedingly rejoiced on this occasion how fond are they of emily she of them this gives them a relation to each other that i hope will produce a friendship which will last for ever  my aunt and lucy have been asking my opinion whether sir charles did not discover something of the good girls growing affection for him so undisguisedly sincere as she always was and for some time not suspecting herself he so penetrating a man of this said lucy i am sure he would have seen it with half an eye had any other man been as much the object of her regard  if any thing would induce me said i to think he did it would be his ready acquiescence with her proposal and from his being so little inquisitive after her motives for leaving us the case continued i is of so nice a nature that he never will say even to me what his thoughts are upon it if such thoughts he has and as to myself it would be dealing with emily less delicately than i was dealt with by the two noble sisters should i presume to sound him on so nice a subject  and indeed there never could be a man in the world that had a greater regard than he has to those real delicacies of our sex which border not upon what is called prudery  mr lowther is gone to london he has given into sir charless wishes to settle in this neighborhood he said he liked the country he had no particular attachment to any place and made a fine compliment to sir charles on the occasion i need not say it was a just one  my uncle my aunt write lucy has another long letter almost ready i have only further to say therefore at this time that i am and ever will be  your most dutiful harriet grandison sir charles intends to write to you madam on emilys proposal  my uncle and aunt begin to be weary of us as sir charles and i tell them but they call us both unreasonable god give us good news from italy    letter xvi lady grandison to ladies l and g grandisonhall tues feb    i write to my dearest sisters now  nor will i ask you to send my letters to my grandmamma for the present  lucy shall be lest to entertain my northamptonshire friends  the enclosed translation of a letter written by signor jeronymo will give you the surprising news  surprising indeed  poor poor lady  i must tell you in my next how we were all affected on the receiving it no more at present can i add but that i am my dear ladies  your ever affectionate sister harriet grandison  letter xvii signor jeronymo della porretta to sir charles grandison my grandison you will be surprised  astonished  the dear clementina how has she tarnished all her glory a young creature of her nice honor  good god  and must i her brother your jeronymo expose his sister  we gave into almost every wish of her heart the dear scripturist had requested a months time to travel from place to place on the other side of the apennines partly in imitation of the daughter of the famous israelitish general jephthah see judges xi  and partly on pretense of establishing her health implying that she considered the meditated marriage as a sacrifice and we had hopes at the end of it that she would be brought to give her hand not unchearfully to the count of belvedere for whom she owned pity and gratitude  we had consented to several trifling delays of her return to us before yet besought her to excuse us from allowing her to visit rome and naples and she acquiesced with the reasons we gave her she desired leave to take into her service as a page an english youth the nephew of a gentleman of the english factory at leghorn who was well recommended by his uncle on the enquiry mrs beaumont at our desire made into his character we supposing her motive to be merely an innocent and grateful regard to the country of a man whom we could allow her to respect consented she accordingly took him and he attended her in her excursions to pistoia prato pratolina pisa sienna etc to some of which places she was accompanied by mrs beaumont and the ladies her friends but being desirous to see the seacoast from piombino to lucca according to a plan she showed and talking of stretching to genoa when at lucca which was to conclude her excursions and complete her month she was left by those ladies to be attended by her own servants these all but her page and laura she contrived the highsould clementina stooped to art to send different ways ordering them to meet her at lucca but instead of going thither took a short way to leghorn and there embarked on board an english ship ready cleared out and bound for the port of london and it had sailed three days before it was known what was become of her but then the contents of the following letter directed to mrs beaumont astonished that lady and her friends as you will believe it did us when it was transmitted to us in a letter written by mrs beaumont acquainting us with the particulars of her excursions and flight and the certainty upon proper enquiries at leghorn that she was gone to england  forgive me my dearest ladies my dearest mrs beaumont particularly forgive me i am embarked in an enterprise that will be enough my punishment pity me therefore as well as pardon me the impending evil is always the most terrible my heart is extremely averse to a married life a fortnight of the month is expired at the end of which i am expected to give my vows to a man not unworthy of them could i think it in my power to make him happy and could i be so myself in the prospects before me but how can that be persuasion cruel persuasion a kneeling father a fighing mother generous but entreating brothers how how can i resist you if i go to dear once most dear bologna all you my friends at bologna at urbino everywhere forgive me what have i not suffered before i came to the resolution that must be pursued though repentance when i have attained the proposed asylum follow my good lord of b forgive me also change your attachment you deserve a better wife than conscience than honor than justice words that mean the same thing tell me can be made you by the unhappy clementina she dare not add della porretta  ah my mother   this letter was left with a person at leghorn with orders not to send it till the vessel had sailed three days we are all distracted but most my mother  for the sake of her peace of mind we are come to a resolution to anticipate our summers visit to you and unpropitious as the season is for such a journey we shall set out next week accordingly god give my mother strength to bear the fatigue courage she has on this occasion who never before could be brought to go by sea anywhere no not to naples to visit her giacomo and his lady though in a more propitious season  it was a longlaid scheme we imagine for she had dismissed her faithful camilla on her urging her to a change of condition i am afraid the good woman was too sedulous in obeying the orders given her by my brother to make use of every opportunity to inspire her with tender sentiments in favor of the count of belvedere laura has for some time been her only favorite servant  this youth by name antony dagley no doubt has managed this affair for her  mrs beaumont now recollects several circumstances which could she have suspected clementina to be capable of such an enterprise might have given her suspicion  the vessel she is in is called the scanderoon alexander henderson master  how can the dear creature on her arrival in england look you your lady your sisters in the face what may she suffer in such a voyage at such a season to what insults may she be exposed so little as she knows of the english tongue laura not a syllable of it depending on the fidelity of a strangerboy so few changes of apparel as she had the opportunity to take with her  whether provided with any considerable sums of money we know not england in her opinion a nation of heretics  good heaven could clementina della porretta be guilty of such a rashness  but what an averseness must she have to marriage we have certainly been too precipitating you cautioned us yet i dare say could not have believed that our clementina could have taken such a step but alas we conclude that it is owing more to the effects of her late unhappy malady than to any other cause when once the mind is disordered there is danger it seems of its showing itself on extraordinary occasions even after the cure is supposed to be perfected capable of extravagance again i say we have been too hasty  our brother giacomo  but he is the most disinterested of men he would not otherwise be so urgent as he is for her marriage  dear dear creature how my heart bleeds for the distresses she may be thrown into  but they cannot be equal to those which her mother feels for her clementina knows how much the lives of her father and mother are bound up in hers but i repeat she must be under the influences of her former malady or never never could she have done an act that she must know would wound our very souls  from the lights i have held out we hope you will be able to find her before she can have suffered more than the inconveniences of the voyage before she can have wanted money or other conveniences if you do your sisters will give the rash one countenance and protection till we can arrive  our company will be my father mother the bishop your jeronymo father marescotti and our two cousins sebastiano and juliano mrs beaumont has the goodness purely from motives of charity to accompany my mother poor camilla almost as inconsolable as my mother attends her lady  we must give you the trouble of hiring for us as large a house as you can procure the circumstances we are in allow us not to think of anything more than common convenience and to be incognito  our two cousins abovenamed may be in lodgings if room be wanted  we shall have no more than necessary attendants  a lesser house or handsome lodgings will content the count of belvedere  these cares for us my dear grandison we must throw upon you yet if my lowther be in england he will be so kind as to ease you of part of them you will have concern enough in sharing ours for the occasion which carries us to you so much sooner than we intended and in an inconvenient season circumstances that will sufficiently demonstrate the distress we are in  the vessel we have hired is called the leghorn frigate the masters name is arthur gunning if we are favored in our voyage the master hopes to be in your river thames in about three weeks from our embarking  god give us my grandison a meeting not unhappy may we find the dear fugitive safe in your protection or under the wings of one of your noble sisters  i hope this unhappy affair will produce no uneasiness between your lady and you if it should what an additional evil would the dear rash one have to answer for  the general is too much incensed against the unhappy girl to think of accompanying us could he obtain permission of his sovereign  the least reparation the dear creature can make us the bishop says is cheerfully to give her vows to the good count of belvedere who looks forward to the issue of this affair as the crisis of his fate  i hardly know what i have written nor how to leave off it is to you our dear friend our consoler our brother and let me add our refuge next to that almighty who we hope will guide us in safety to you and give an issue not greatly derogatory to the glory of our sister and family join my grandison your prayers with ours to this purpose noblest of friends adieu  jeronymo della porretta  letter xviii lady grandison to ladies l and g wedn febr    let me now give you the promised particulars  as we and our beloved guests were at dinner on monday all harmony all love the dear emily laying out the happy days she hoped to see in northhamptonshire sir charles using generous arguments to prevail on my uncle and aunt to stay a little longer with him the letter the affecting letter was given into sir charless hands from my jeronymo said he looking at the superscription asking excuse he broke it open and casting his eye upon the first lines he started and bowing to his guests and to me he arose from table and withdrew to his study  we had not half dined i urged our friends but could not set them the example and we arose by consent and went into the adjoining drawing room  sir charles soon joined us there his face was in a glow he seemed to have struggled for a composure for our sakes which however he had not obtained  i looked upon him with eyes i suppose that had speech in them by his taking my hand and saying be not surprised my love you will soon have guests  from italy from italy sir  yes my life  who who sir  dr bartlett was with us he besought him to give a translation of that letter the doctor retired to do it and sir charles said it is not impossible but clementina may be soon in england perhaps before the rest of her family be not surprised for we all looked upon one another dr bartlett will give you the contents of the letter oblige me my dearest love with your hand  he led me into his study and there in the most tender and affectionate manner acquainted me with the contents of the letter  my dearest harriet said he his arms encircling my waist will not cannot doubt the continuance of my tenderest love i am equally surprised and disturbed at the step taken god preserve the dear clementina join your prayers with mine for her safety you can pity the unhappy lady she is i am afraid desolate and unprotected you can pity her equally unhappy friends they are following her they are all good they mean well yet overpersuasion as you lately observed in such a case a hers is a degree of persecution in the unhappy circumstances she had been in she should have had time given her time subdues all things  let me beseech you sir said i to give the unhappy lady your instant protection consider me as a strengthener not a weakener of your hands in her service i have no concern but for her safety and honor and for your concern on the affecting occasion dear sir let me by participation lessen it  soul of my soul said he clasping me more ardently to his bosom i had no doubt of your generous goodness it would be doing injustice to the unhappy absent and to the knowledge i have of my own heart as well as to you the absolute mistress of it did i think it necessary to make professions of my unalterable my inviolable love to you i will acquaint you with every step i take in this arduous affair you must advise me as i go along minds so delicate as your and clementinas must be allied i shall be sure of my measures when i have the approbation of my harriet all our friends they have discretion shall be made acquainted with my proceedings i will not leave a doubt upon the mind of any one of them that my harriet is not as far as it is in my power to make her the happiest of women  what sir is the date of the letter  he looked it has no date my dear jeronymos grief  the lady sir said i may be arrived leave me here at grandisonhall with my friends i will endeavor to engage their stay a little longer than they had designed and do you hasten up to town if you can do service to the unhappy lady destitute as you apprehend she is at present of protection and exposed to difficulties and dangers your letters shall be if possible more acceptable to me than even the presence of the man who is as dear to me as my own soul  i was raised it was making me great my dear ladies to have it in my power as i may say to convince sir charles grandison that my compassion my love my a lmiration of the noblest of women was a sincere admiration and love  how happy a man am i said he you have anticipated me by your goodness i will hasten up to town you will engage your friends the man whose love is fixed on the mind all loveliness as is the admirable person that thus i again press to my fond bosom must be as happy as a mortal man can be  he led me back to the expecting company who all stood up as by an involuntary motion at our entrance each person looking eager to know our sentiments the doctor had not finished the translation but sir charles sent up for the letter and begged of the doctor who brought it down himself to read it in english to us all he did so  what my dear ladies was there of peculiarity in my generosity as your brother was pleased to call it  my uncle my aunt my lucy mr deane all before sir charles could well speak besought him not to suffer their being here to be one moments hindrance to his setting out for london  he generously applauded me to them for what had passed between us in his study and told them he would set out early in the morning if they would promise to keep me company here  they said they would stay as long as their convenience would permit and the longer that he might be the easier on such a generous call to town  one thing dear sir said i let me beg let not the sweet fugitive be compelled if you can help it to marry let not advantage be taken as they seem by a hint in this letter inclined to take it of this seeming rash step to make her compliance the condition of their forgiveness and reconciliation  he called me his generous his noble harriet repeated that he would be governed by my advice and that then he should be sure of his footing  your brother set out early this morning for london join your prayers my dear ladies with his and mine and with those of all our friends here for a happy issue to the present afflictions of the dear clementina how i long yet halffear to see her shall i do you think be able to see her without being apprehensive that she will look upon me as the invader of her right she was undoubtedly his first love  your brother communicated to me his intention of completing the furnishing of the newtaken house in grosvenorsquare which was before in great forwardness and to have it well aired for the reception of his noble friends he will acquaint his sisters with his further intentions as occasions arise god succeed to him his own wishes  he may be trusted with them  adieu my dearest sisters how proud am i that i can indeed call you so by the name of  harriet grandison  letter xix sir charles grandison to lady grandison st jamess square thursday feb    my dearest life on my arrival here last night i found a long letter dated sunday last from the unhappy lady whom we both so much admire and pity the contents too well confirm her wandering state of mind and account for the steps she has taken i will send you the letter itself as soon as i have seen her and can prevail upon her to put herself into my protection till the hope of a happier state of mind shall dawn upon us the contents of it will afflict you  she has been ten days in england i wrote to her last night to beg her to admit me to her presence  she expresses in her letter a generous joy in our happiness and in the excellent character which she has heard of the beloved of my heart of every heart in the midst of her affecting wanderings she preserves the greatness of mind that ever distinguished her she wishes to see you but unknown to us both  it would not be difficult perhaps to find out the place of her abode but she depends on my honor that i will not attempt it clementina loves to be punctiliously observed in the way she is in she must be soothed and as little opposed as possible she thinks too highly of my character and apprehends that the step she has taken has lowered her own she has great sensibility and only sometimes wanders into minutenesses that her circumstances which i find are not happy oblige her to attend to i have great hopes that i shall be able to sooth conciliate and restore her her mind seems not to he deeply wounded god enable me to quiet the heart of the noblest of your sisters forgive me for my two beloved sisters they will if you do  i hope our dear friends will make themselves and you happy at grandisonhall this cloud passed away if god preserve us to each other and our friends to us all our future days must be serene at least as far as it is in my power they shall be so to my harriet professions would disgrace my love and your merits all that your own heart can wish me to be that if i know it will i be for am i not the happy husband of the best and most generous of women and as such  wholly yours charles grandison  letter xx lady clementina to sir charles grandison mentioned in the preceding  tuesday febr    o s by this time it is very probable you have heard of the rashest step that the writer of these presents checkered and unhappy as the last years of her life have been over took she knows it to be rash she condemns herself for taking it she doubts not but she shall be condemned by everybody for it nor is she sure that she shall have the better opinion of your justice if you are not one of the severest of her censurers for you are a good man your goodness i hear fills every mouth in this your own country and it is not one of your least praises that you did your duty in the strictest manner to a father who was wanting in his to his whole family it is it seems your principle that where a duty is reciprocal the failure in it of the one acquits not the other for a failure in his how then can i appear before you i am covered with blushes at the thoughts of it  i who am a runaway from the kindest the most indulgent of parents  god forgive me  yet can i say i repent  i think i can  but at best it is a conditional repentance only that i boast  i am here in your england i cannot cannot tell you where in a low condition my fortune scanty my lodgings not very convenient two servants only my attendants laura you remember her one weeping every hour after her friends and our italy my other you know not  my page he was called in the days of my state as i may comparatively call them but now my every thing poor youth but he is honest he is faithful god reward him  i cannot  yet in all this my depression of circumstances if i may so express myself and sometimes too often indeed of spirits i think i am happy in the thought that i am a single woman  well sir  and what can i say further a thousand things i have to say too many to know which to say first i had better say no more i am not however sure i shall send you this or any other letter  i have been ten days in this great and as it seems to me ugly city a vastly populous one people very busy i thought your london people were all rich  but what is this to write to you about  i have been out but once and that for a morning in one of your parks i cannot say i like england nor its people much but i have seen nothing of the one or the other  i live a very melancholy life but that befits me best  they tell me that your churches are poor plain things you bestow more upon yourselves than you do upon your god but perhaps you trust more to the heart than to the eye in the plainness of your places of devotion but again what is all this stuff to you  yet i am apt to ramble tootoo much  the truth is i am not very well so excuse me  but do you know how it comes about that having the best of fathers the best of mothers the most affectionate of brothers i should yet think them persecutors how it comes about that i who love them who honor them as much as daughter ever honored parents or sister ever loved brothers should run away from them all into a strange land a land of heretics yet once be thought a pious kind of creature do you know how this comes about  once there was a man  but him i renounced  but i had a good reason for it and do you think i repent it by my truth chevalier i do not i never did yet i think of nobody half so often nor with half the pleasure for though a heretic he is a good man  but hush dare i in this country say he is a heretic perhaps we catholics are looked upon as heretics here idolaters i know we are said to be  i grant that i had like to have been an idolater once  but let that pass i believe we catholics think worse of you protestants and you protestants think worse of us catholics than either deserve it may be so but to me you seem to be a strange people for all that  of one thing my good chevalier methinks i should be glad  here i am told you are married that i knew before i left italy else let me tell you i never would have come hither yet i should have got away rather than be married myself i believe but then perhaps it would have been to a catholic country  what was i going to say  one thing i should be glad of it is to see your lady but not if she were to see me i came with very few clothes and they were not the best i had at florence my best of all are at bologna my father and mother loved to see me dressed i dressed many a time to please them more than to please myself for i am not a proud creature do you think i am you knew me once better than i knew myself but you know little of me now i am a runaway and i know you will not forgive me i cannot help it however i should be glad to see your lady she dresses richly i suppose well she may  i am told she is one of the loveliest women in england and as to her goodness  there is nobody so good thank god you know chevalier i always prayed that the best of women might be called by your name  but olivia it seems praises her and olivia saw her when she was a rambler to england as god help me i am now  but olivias motive and mine were very different olivia went to england in hopes of a husband  poor woman i pity her  but chevalier cannot i see your lady and she not see me i need not be in disguise to see her if you were with her handing her suppose to church i would not scruple to crowd myself into some unobserved corner of your church on such an occasion you would be too proud of her to mind me and you would not know me if you saw me for i would stoop in my shoulders and look down and the clothes i should have on would be only an english linen gown and petticoat unadorned by ribbands or gewgaw  not half so well dressed as your ladys woman  but yet i should thank god that you had not disgraced the regard i had once for you i had a great deal of pride you know in that hope thank you sir that you have married so lovely and so deserving a woman she is of a good family i hope  it wa a great disappointment to me when i came first to london to find that you were not there i thought some how or other to catch a sight of you and your lady were it but as you stepped into your coach and i to have been in a chair near or even on foot for when i heard what a character you bore for every kind of goodness i a poor fagitive was afraid to see you so many good lessons as you taught me and all to come to this unhappy clementina  where will your ladyship but i have forbidden that style choose to take up your residence said anthony when we first landed my servants name is anthony but you shall not know his other name we landed among a parcel of guns at the tower they called it in a boat  laura answered for me for he spoke in italian somewhere near the chevalier grandisons will not you madam i will not tell you what was my answer for perhaps i am near the thames  i dont want you to find me out i beseech you chevalier dont give yourself pain for me i am a fugitive dont disgrace yourself in acknowleging any acquaintance with a creature who is poor and low and who deserves to be poor and low for is she not a runaway from the best of parents but it is to avoid not to get a husband you will be pleased to remember that sir  but poor laura  i am sorry for laura more sorry than for myself  my brother giacomo would kill the poor creature i believe if ever she were to come in his way but she is in no fault it was with great reluctance she obeyed her mistress she was several times as impertinent as camilla poor camilla i used ever hardly she is a good creature i used her hardly against my own nature to make her the easier to part with me i love her i hope she is well it is not worth her while to pine after me i was an ungrateful creature to her  my anthony is a good young man as i told you i think to save half his wages and give the other half to raise lauras to keep her a little in heart the poor young man hoped preferment in my service and i can do nothing for him it will behove me to be a good manager but i will sell the few jewels i have left rather than part with him till he can get a better service what little things do i trouble you with little things to you but not quite so little to me now as i have managed it but so as i can do justice to this poor youth and poor laura i matter not myself what i have done is my choice they had no option i overpersuaded laura as my friends would have done me i feel that sting it was not doing as i would

thought it would trouble you god forbid that your pupil clementina should give you discomposure now especially in the early part of your nuptials yet if i could so manage as that you would permit your secretary i would not ask the favor of your own pen to send a few lines to some particular place where my servant could fetch them unknown to you or any body only to let me know if you have heard from

fourth brother her equally admiring and faithful friend yet not honor him with the knowledge of her arival  forgive me if i call you cruel  it is in your power madam to make one of the happiest men in the world a very unhappy one and you will effectually do it if you keep from him the opportunity of throwing himself at your feet and welcoming you to a country always dear to him but which will be made still dearer by your arrival in it  i have a letter from your and my jeronymo i have a great deal to say to you of its contents of your father mother brothers  but it must be said not written for gods sake madam permit me to attend you in company of one of my sisters or otherwise as you shall think best you have in me a faithful an indulgent friend i am no severe man need i tell you that i am not if you do not choose that anybody else shall know the place of your abode i will faithfully keep your secret you shall be as much the mistress of your own will of your own actions as if i knew not

received our jeronymos letter but yesterday tender and affectionate are the contents  i have ridden post to get hither this night in hopes of being favored with intelligence of you in the morning i should have made enquiries at the proper places but little did i think my sister could have been so many days in town let not an hour pass after this comes to your hand before you relieve the anxious heart of  dearest lady clementina your most affectionate brother and faithful humble servant charles grandison  letter xxiii lady clementina to sir charles grandison friday morning feb    o s i received yours but this moment what can i say to the contents i wish to see you but dare not your happiness you say depends upon an interview with me why do you tell me it does i wish you happy yet if you wished me so you would have told me how my dear friends in italy do this omission was designed it was not generous in the chevalier grandison it was made to extort from me a favor which you thought i should otherwise be unwilling to grant  but can you forgive the rash clementina god is merciful as well as just you imitate him but how can clementina humbled as she is be sunk so low as to appear a delinquent before the man she respects for a character which great as she thought it before has risen upon her since her arrival in england  but sir can you will you engage that my friends will allow me to continue single can you answer in particular for the discontinuance of the count of belvederes addresses can you procure forgiveness not only for me but my poor laura will you take into your service or recommend him effectually to that of some one of your friends in some manner that is not altogether servile the honest youth who has behaved unexceptionably in mine for he wishes not to return to italy  answer me these few easy and plain questions and you shall hear further from  clementina  letter xxiv sir charles grandison to lady clementina under cover directed as before  friday morn febr    to the questions of dear lady clementina i answer thus  i will endeavor to prevail upon your parents and other friends to leave you absolutely free to choose your own state without using either compulsion or overearnest persuasion  who madam can forbid the count of belvedere to hope leave him hope if he has not the overearnest entreaties of your own relations to give weight to his addresses it will be in your power to give him either encouragement or despair  i will engage for the joyful reconciliation to her of all the dear clementinas friends i am sure i can  laura shall be forgiven and provided for by an annuity equal to her wages if the continuance of her service be not accepted  i will myself entertain your young man and place and reward him according to his merits  and now madam admit to the honor of your presence  your brother your friend your evergrateful and affectionate humble servant charles grandison  letter xxv lady clementina to sir charles grandison sat morn febr    i depend upon your honor sir for the performance of the prescribed conditions yet on meditating my appearance before you i am more and more ashamed to see you it was a great disappointment to me at my first arrival that you were at your countryseat at that time my heart was full i had much to say and i could have seen you then with more fortitude than now falls to my share however i will see you tomorrow sir about five in the evening you will find at one of the doors on the higher ground on the left hand going up st jamess street from the palace as it is called the expecting laura who will conduct you to  clementina  letter xxvi sir charles grandison to lady grandison monday febr    you requested me my dearest harriet to write minutely to you now i have been admitted to the presence of clementina and have hopes that she will soon recover her peace of mind i can the more cheerfully obey you  i was exactly at the hour at the appointed place laura guessed at my chair and my servants as they crossed the way and stood out on the pavement that i might see her when she found she had caught my eye she ran into the house wringing her clasped hands  god be praised god be praised were her words as i followed her in in her own language laura can speak no other show me show me to your lady good laura said i with emotion  she ran up one pair of stairs before me she entered the dining room as it is called i stopped at the stairs head till i had clementinas commands laura soon came out she held open the door for me courtefying in silence  the drawn windowcurtains darkened the room but the dignity of clementinas air and motion left me not in doubt she stood up supporting herself on the back of an elbow chair  on one knee taking her trembling hand welcome thrice welcome to england dearest lady clementina i pressed her hand with my lips and rising seated her for she trembled she sobbed she endeavored to speak but could not for some moments  i called to laura fearing she was fainting  o that wellknown voice said she and do you can you bid me welcome  me a fugitive an ingrate undutiful  o chevalier lower not your unfullied character by approving so unnatural a step as that which i have taken  i do bid you welcome madam your brother your friend from his soul welcomes you to england  let me know chevalier before another word passes whether i have a father whether i have a mother  blessed be god madam you have both  she lifted up her clasped hand thank god god i thank thee distraction would have been my portion if i had not i was afraid to ask after them i should have thought myself the most detestable of parricides if either of them had been no more  they are in the utmost distress for your safety they will think themselves happy when they know you are well and in the protection of your brother grandison  will they sir o what a paradox they so indulgent yet so cruel  i so dutiful yet a fugitive but tell me sir determined as i was against entering into a state i too much honor to enter into it with a reluctant heart could i take any other step than that i have taken to free myself from the cruelty of persuasion o that i might have been permitted to take the veil  but answer my question chevalier  surely madam they would not have compelled you they always declared to me they would not  not compelled me sir did not my father kneel to me my mothers eyes spoke more than her lips could have uttered the bishop had influenced good father marescotti against the interests of religion i had almost said to oppose the wish of my heart jeronymo your jeronymo gave into their measures what refuge had i  our glacomo was inexorable i was to be met on my return from florence to bologna by the count of belvedere and all those of his house the general was to be in his company i had secret intelligence of all this and i was to be received as an actual bride at bologna or made to promise i would be so within a few days after my arrival my sisterinlaw my only advocate among my italian friends pitied me it is true but for that reason she was not to be allowed to come to bologna i was at other times denied to go to urbino to rome to naples  could i do otherwise than i have done if i would avoid prosaning a sacrament  my dearest sister clementina sometimes accuses herself of rashness for taking a step so extraordinary at this moment does she not receive her brother in darkness whence this sweet consciousness but what is done is done your conscience is a law to you who shall condemn  let us look forward madam i approve not of the vehemence of your friends persuasions yet what parents ever meant a child more indulgence what brothers a sister more disinterested affection  i own sir that my heart at times misgives me but answer me this are you of opinion that i ought at the instance of my parents and brothers however affectionate however indulgent in all other instances to marry against inclination against justice against conscience  against any one of these you ought not  well sir then i will endeavor to make myself easy as to this article but will you undertake sir a woman wants a protector to maintain this argument for me  i will madam and shall hope for the more success if you will promise to lay aside all thoughts of the veil  ah chevalier  will my dearest sister answer me one question is it not your hope that by resisting their wishes you may tire out opposition and at last bring your friends to consent to a measure to which they have always been extremely averse  ah chevalier  but if i could get them to consent   dear madam is not their reasoning the same  if they could get you to consent  ah chevalier  may not this be a contention for months for years and   i know sir your inference you think that in a contention between parents and child the child should yield is not that your inference  not against reason against justice against conscience but there may be cases in which neither ought to be their own judge  well sir you that have yielded to a plea of conscience god has blessed you and may god continue to bless you for it  admirable clementina   are fit to be a judge between us  you shall be mine if ever the debate be brought on  no consideration in that case shall bias me  but may i not hope that the dear lady i stand before will permit me to behold a person whose mind i ever revered  laura said she let the tea be got ready i have been taught to drink tea sir since my arrival the gentlewoman of the house is very obliging permit me sir to withdraw for a few moments  she sighed as she went out leaning upon laura  laura returned soon after with lights she set them on the table and giving way to a violent emotion o my lord grandison said the poor girl falling down and embracing my knees for the blessed virgins sake prevail on my lady to return to dear dear bologna  have patience laura all will be well  i the unhappy laura shall be the sacrifice the general will kill me  o that i had never accompanied my lady in this expedition  have patience laura if you have behaved well to your lady i will take you into my protection had you a good voyage was the master of the vessel were his officers obliging  they were sir or neither my lady or i should have been now living o sir we were in a dying way all the voyage except the three last days of it the master was the civillest of men  i asked after her fellow servants naming him from jeronymos letters gone out was the answer to buy some necessaries o sir we live a sad life strangers to the language to the customs of the country all our dependence is upon this young man  i asked her after the behavior and character of the people of the house a widow and her three daughters that if i heard but an indifferent account of them i might enforce by it my intended plea to get her to lady ls laura spoke well of them the captain of the vessel who brought them over is related to them and recommended them when he knew what part of the town her lady chose  what risques did the poor lady run such different people as she had to deal with in the contrivance and prosecution of her wild scheme yet all to prove honest how happy poor lady how ready was she to fly from what she apprehended to be the nearest evil but she could not be in a capacity to weigh the dangers to which she exposed herself  often and often said laura have i on my knees besought my lady to write to you but she was not always well enough to resolve what to do and when she was sedate she would plead that she was afraid to see you you would be very angry with her you would condemn her as a rash creature and she could not bear your displeasure she was conscious that the act she had done bore a rash and even a romantic appearance had you been in town antony should have made enquiries at distance and she might have yielded to see you but for several days her thoughts were not enough composed to write to you at last being impatient to hear of the health of her father and mother she did write  why stays she so long from me laura attend your lady and tell her that i beg the honor of her presence  laura went to her her lady presented herself with an air of bashful dignity i met her at her entrance  my sister my friend my dearest lady clementina kissing her hand welcome welcome i repeat to england behold your fourth brother your protector honor me with your confidence acknowledge my protection your honor your happiness is dear to me as my life  i led her trembling sighing but at the moment speechless to a seat and sat down by her holding both her hands in mine she struggled for speech compose yourself madam assure yourself of my tenderest regard of my truest brotherly affection  generous grandison can you forgive me can you from your heart bid me welcome i will endeavor to compose myself you told me i was conscious conscious indeed i am the step i have taken has a disgraceful appearance but yet will i not condemn nor consent that you should my motive  i condemn not your motive madam all will all must be happy rely on my brotherly advice and protection my sisters and their lords every one i love admires you you are come to families of lovers who will think themselves honored by your confidence  you pour balm into the wounds of my mind what is woman when difficulties surround her when it was too late and the ship that i embarked in was under sail then began my terror that took away from me all power of countermanding the orders i had given till the winds that favored my voyage opposed my return then was i afraid to trust myself with my own reflections lest if i gave way to them my former malady should find me out but let me not make you unhappy yet permit me to observe that when you mentioned the kind reception i might expect to meet with among your friends you forbore to mention the principal person  what will she think of the poor clementina but be assured and assure her that i would not have set my foot on the english shore had you not been married o chevalier if i make you and her unhappy no creature on earth can hate me so much as i shall hate myself  generous noble clementina  your happiness is indeed essential to that of us both my harriet is another clementina you are another harriet sisterexcellencies i have called you to her to all her relations in the letter you favored me with you wished to know her you must know her and i am sure you will love her your wishes that she would accept of my vows were motives with her to make me happy she knows our whole history she is prepared to receive you as the dearest of her sisters  generous lady grandison i have heard her character i congratulate you sir you have reason to think that i should have been grieved had you not met with a woman who deserved you to know you are happy in a wife and think yourself so that no blame lies upon me for declining your addresses will contribute more than i can express to my peace of mind when i have more courage and my heart is eased of some part of its anguish you shall present me to her tell her mean time that i will love her and that i shall hold myself everlastingly bound to her in gratitude for making happy the man whom once but for a superior motive i had the vanity to think i could have made so  she turned away her glowing face tears on her cheek my admiration of her greatness of mind so similar to that of my own harriet would not allow me to pour out my heart in words i arose and taking both her hands bowed upon them tears more plentifully flowed from her averted eyes and we were both for one moment speechless  it would be injurious to a mind equally great and noble as that which informs the person of this your sisterexcellence to offer to apologize for faithfully relating to you those tender emotions of hearts one of them not less pure than my harriets the other all your own  i broke silence and urged her to accept of apartments at lady ls let me acquaint the gentlewoman of the house i beseech you madam that tomorrow morning the sister i have named and i will attend you to her house we will thank her for you as you have almost forgotten your english for the civilities which she and her daughters have shown you and i will make it my business to find out the honest captain who laura tells me has been very civil to you also and thank him too in the names of all our common friends for his care of you  i will think myself honored now you have encouraged me to look up by a visit from either or both your sisters but let me advise with you sir is the kind offer you make me a proper offer for me to accept of i shall be ready to take your advice  little regard as i may seem by the step i have taken to have had for my own honor i would avoid if possible suffering a first error to draw me into a second do you sir as my brother and friend take care of that honor in every step you shall advise me to take  your honor madam shall be my first care i sincerely think this is the rightest measure you can now pursue  now pursue  sighing  this argument admitted of a short debate she was scrupulous from motives too narrow for a clementina to mention i made her blush for mentioning them and in short had the happiness to convince her that the protection of the sister of her fourth brother was the most proper she could choose  i went down and talked to the gentlewomen below they were pleased with what i said to them they prayed for the lady and her family and for a happy reconciliation between them for antony had given them briefly her story  i requested them to make my compliments to her relation captain henderson and desire him to give me an opportunity to thank him in person for his civility to a lady beloved by all who have the honor of knowing her  i went up again to the lady and sat with her most of the evening laura only attending us  i talked to clementina of mrs beaumont and the ladies at florence and intimated that her mother had prevailed on that lady to come to england in hopes as she is an english woman that her company would be highly acceptable to her she blessed her mother what an instance of forgiving goodness was this she said with tears of gratitude and blessed mrs beaumont for her goodness to her and the ladies at florence for parting with one so dear to them  i was happy throughout this latter conversation in her serenity not one instance of wandering did i observe  i chose not however so early to acquaint her with the intention of the dearest and nearest of her friends to come over with mrs beaumont though i expressed my earnest hope that if we could make england agreeable to her i should have the honor of the promised visit from some of the principals of her family before she left it  this my dearest life is a minute account of our interview one of the greatest pleasures i can know is to obey the gentle the generous commands of my harriet  this morning i attended lady l to breakfast with the excellent lady as proposed my sister and her lord are charmed with their guest their guest she is and lady clementina is as much pleased with them she is every hour more and more sensible of the danger she has run and censures herself very freely for the rash step as she calls it herself  she longs yet is ashamed to see you my dearest life and listens with delight to the praises my lord and lady l so justly give to my harriet  monday afternoon i have introduced lord and lady g to lady clementina at her own request being assured she said that the place of her refuge would be kept secret by all my friends both sister occasionally joining in praising my angel how happy said she are those marriages which give as much joy to the relations on both sides as to the parties themselves  adieu my dearest love with the tenderest affection i am and ever will be  your most faithful and obliged chapter grandison  letter xxvii sir charles grandison in continuation thursday feb    we are as happy here as we can expect to be lady clementina in her state of suspense and apprehension i without my harriet  you hinted to me once my love something of our beauchamps regard for emily he just now after more hesitations than i expected from my friend opened his heart to me and asked me to countenance his addresses to her i chid him for his hesitation  and then said is my beauchamp in this proposition so right as he generally is  emily though tall and womanly is very young i am not a friend to very early marriages you know as well as any man my dear friend the reasons that may be urged against such methinks i would give emily an opportunity as well for her husbands sake whoever shall be the man as for her own to look round her and make her own choice the merit of sir edward beauchamp his personal accomplishments and character to say nothing of his now ample fortune must make his addresses to any woman acceptable you would not i presume think of marrying her if you might till she is eighteen or twenty and would my beauchamp fetter himself by engagements to a girl and leave her who at present can hardly give him the preference he deserves no chance of choosing for herself when at womans estate  he waved the discourse and left me without resuming it i am grieved on recollection for i am afraid he is not satisfied with me for what i said  my dearest life you must advise me i will not take any important step whether relative to myself or friends but by your advice and if you please dr barletts whenever heretofore i have had time to take that good mans i have been sure of the ground i stood upon his has been of infinite service to me as you have heard me often acknowledge yours and his will establish my judgment in every case but in this of emilys yours my dear for obvious reasons i must prefer even to his in the mean time i will seek beauchamp he shall not be angry with his grandison  but good young man can it be that he is really in love with such a girl as to years  this i dare say beauchamps principal regard cannot be to her fortune his estate is unincumbered i should think myself as well as emily happy and that i had performed all my duty by her were i to marry her to such a man but methinks i want him to be sooner married than i should wish my emily to be a wife i think you told me that emily at present has not thoughts of him  but you my dear must advise me  thursday afternoon sir edward has just left me he asked my excuse for having mentioned the above subject to me it is at present in your power sir charles said he to silence me upon it for ever it might not have been so some time hence i thought therefore on examining the state of my heart it was but honorable to open it to you forbid me this moment to think of her and i will endeavor to obey her guardian  my dear friend you know emilys age  would you willingly  i stopped that he might speak  stay for her i would sir charles till you and she  he passed  then resuming my love for her is not an interested love i would if i might have your permission to make my addresses to her and that should be  honest assiduities before declaration be wholly  by your advice for the good of both i would make your conduct to lady clementina when you last went over my pattern i would be bound she should be free i never would be so mean as to endeavor to engage her by promises to me my pride will set her free whenever i perceive she balances in favor of another man  but what my excellent friend shall we do can you condescend to court two women emily so young for her distant consent  what means sir charles grandison  i will read to you without reserve what i had just written to my harriet on this topic reciting to her what passed in the conversation between you and me a little while ago  i read to him accordingly what i wrote to you my dearest love he heard me with great attention not interrupting me once nor did i interrupt myself no not by apologies for the freedom of my thoughts on the subject and when i had done he wrung my hand and thanked me for my unreservedness in terms worthy of our mutual friendship  you see my dear sir edward said i how i am circumstanced what i have promised to my wife is a law to me prudence and afterevents not controuling she loves emily she has a high regard for you women know women go hand in hand with her i will save you the trouble of referring to me in the progress of your application to my wife and emily my harriet will acquaint me with what is necessary for me as emilys guardian to know i build on your hint of assiduities in preference to an early declaration you my beauchamp need not be afraid of giving time to a young creature to look round her let me add that emily shall give signs of preferring you to all men as i expect from you demonstrations of your preferring her to all women or i shall make a difficulty for both your sakes of giving a guardians consent and remember also that emily has a mother who though she has not greatly merited consideration is her mother we must do our duty you know my beauchamp in the common relations of life whether others do theirs or not but the address of a man of your credit and consequence cannot give you any difficulty there when that of miss jervoiss tender years is got over  he was pleased with what i said i asked him if he approved of her motion to go down with mrs selby and lucy highly he said and as it came from herself he thought it an instance of prudence in her that few young creatures would have been able to show  instance of prudence my love how so when wise as our northamptonshire relations are emily would have wanted to benefit that her choice can give her were she to remain with us in the instructions and example of my harriet  but my dear life does emily hold her mind to attend mrs selby and lucy into northamptonshire let it be with her whole heart  my cousin grandison believes himself to be very happy his wife he says thinks herself the happiest of women i am glad of it she has a greater opinion of his understanding than she has of her own this seems to be necessary to the happiness of common minds in wedlock he is gay fluttering debonnaire and she thinks those qualities appendages of family he has presented her with a genealogical table of his ancestors drawn up and blazoned by heraldry art it is framed glazed and hung up in her drawing room she shows it to every one perhaps she thinks it necessary to apologize by that means to all her visiters for bestowing her person and fortune on a ruined man but what in a nation the glory and strength of which are trade and commerce is gentility what even nobility where descendants depart from the virtue of the first enobling ancestor  lord and lady g have invited lady clementina to dinner tomorrow she has had the goodness to accept of the invitation lord and lady l and my aunt grandison will attend her  what my dear makes charlotte so impatient so petulant i had almost said under a circumstance which if attended with a happy issue will lay all us her friends under obligation to her i asked once my harriet if lord g were as happy in a wife as charlotte is in a husband you returned me not a direct answer i was afraid of repeating my question because i knew you would have cheerfully answered it could you have done it to my wishes i see in my lords behavior to her respect and affection even to fondness but not the polite familiarity that becomes a wedded love let her present circumstance be happily over and she will find her brothers eye a more observant one than hitherto she has found it but be not my dear oversolicitous for the friend you so greatly value true brotherly love shall ever hold the principal seat in my heart when i sit in judgment upon a sisters conduct  my fond heart throbs in expectation of soon presenting a sister to each of the two noblest women on earth allow for the perplexity of clementinas mind and for the impolitic urgency of her friends and you will not when you see her scruple to hold out to a sisterexcellence not happily situated the hand that blessed  your everfaithful chapter grandison  letter xxviii sir charles grandison in continuation sat feb    the arrival of the leghornfrigate is every day expected the merchants have intelligence that it put in at antibes if the journey by land from thence to paris and so to calais could be made favorable to my dear friend jeronymo i have no doubt but our expected guests landed there at this season of the year so unpropitious to tender passengers  the house in grosvenorsquare is now thanks to good lord g quite ready for their reception there will be room i believe as they propose to be here incognito and with only necessary attendants for the marquis and his lady for mrs beaumont who will be both their comforter and interpreter for the two brothers and father marescotti saunders has already procured handsome lodgings for the count of belvedere i wish with you my love that the count were not to accompany them the poor lady must not know it if it can be avoided the two young lords whom i invited when i was in italy must be more immediately our own guests if my dearest life has no objection  assure yourself my generous harriet that the lady shall not be either compelled or too urgently persuaded if i have weight with the family when they arrive they shall not know where she is nor see her but by her own consent and as i see their disposition to receive her as i wish excellent creature what a noble solicitude is yours for her tranquillity of mind  i have not yet been able to break to her the daily expectation i have of seeing in england her parents and brothers yet am uneasy that she knows it not i want courage my harriet to acquaint her with it i have more than once essayed to do it dear creature she looks with so much innocence and so much reliance upon me and is at times so apprehensive  i know not how to break it to her  she depends upon my mediation she urges me to begin a treaty of reconciliation with them i defer writing i tell her till i have seen mrs beaumont little does she think they are upon their journey and that i know not where to direct to them she longs for mrs beaumonts arrival and hopes she says she will bring with her the poor camilla that she may have an opportunity to obtain her excuse for the harsh treatment she gave her and yet camilla said she was a teazing woman  were you ever sensible my harriet of the tender pain that an open heart yours is an open and an enlarged one feels longing yet for its friends sake afraid to reveal unwelcome tidings which however it imports the concerned to know how loath to disturb the tranquillity which is built upon ignorance of the event yet that every tranquillity contemplated upon adding to the pain of the compassionating friend who reflects that when the unhappy news shall be revealed time and christian philosophy only will ever restore it to the heart of the sufferer  lord and lady l are endeavoring to divert their too thoughtful guest by carrying her to see what they think will either entertain or amuse her tomorrow lady l contributing to the dear ladys proper appearance there they purpose to attend her to the drawing room but hitherto she seems not to have a very high opinion of the country if her heart could be easy every thing would have a different appearance to her  i have this moment the favor of yours of yesterday if our kind friends will stay no longer with you at the hall do you my dearest love as you propose accompany them up they are extremely obliging in proposing to give me here two or three days of their company before they return to northhamptonshire  my consent my harriet  why if you have a choice of your own do you ask it i must approve of whatever you wish to do could i have been certain i would have met my love but you will have many dear friends with you  tell my emily that i have had a visit from her mother and mr ohara and was so much pleased with them that i propose on monday to return their visit at their own lodgings  now i know i am to be soon blessed with the presence of my harriet i have given way to all my wishes one of them is never to be separated from the joy of my heart such i trust will she ever be to  her grateful everfaithful grandison  letter xxix lady grandison to mrs shirley london friday march   again my everhonoured grandmamma does your harriet resume the pen lucy and my aunt between them have given you an account of everything that passed since my last  we arrived last night with what tenderness did the best of men and of husbands receive his harriet and her friends  this afternoon at tea i am to be presented to lady clementina at lord ls dont you believe my heart throbs with expectation indeed it does sir charles says her emotions are as great on the occasion  what honor does my dear sir charles do to his harriet he consults her as if he doubted his own judgment and wanted to have it confirmed by hers what happiness is hers who marries a good man such a one will do obliging things for principles sake he will pity involuntary failings he will do justice to good intentions and give importance to all his fellowcreatures because he knows they and he are equally creatures of the almighty what woman who thinks but will prefer a good man to all others however distinguished by rank fortune or person but my sir charles is a good man and distinguished by all those advantages what a creature should i be blessed with a husband of a heart so faithful and so wellprincipled if i were not able to let my love and compassion flow to a clementina though once and indeed for that very reason the only beloved of his heart  why are not real calls made upon me to convince such a man that i have a mind emulative of his own at least of clementinas the woman who from motives of religion having the heart of a sir charles grandison in her hand loving him above all earthly creatures and all her friends consenting could refuse him her vows must be in that act the greatest the most magnanimous of women but could the noble lady have thus acted my dear grandmamma had not she been stimulated by that glorious enthusiasm of which her disturbed imagination had shown some previous tokens and which rightly directed has heretofore given the palm of martyrdom to saints  we have just now been welcomed to town by sir edward beauchamp sir charles on presenting him to me thus expressed himself you remember my dearest life what i wrote to you of the last part of the conversation between sir edward and me in relation to my emily your prudence my harriet and love of the good girl your discretion and generosity sir edward will join you together as counselors and advisers of your grandison my wife and my friend cannot err in this instance because you will both consider what belongs to the characters of a guardian and a ward so beloved by you both and if you doubt have dr bartlett at hand  my uncle and aunt lucy are determined to set out next wednesday for northamptonshire sir edward desired to know of sir charles if he had any objection to his attending them down none at all surely was sir charless answer  mr deane accompanies them in order to adjust some matters at peterborough preparative to the favor he does us of settling with us or near us for the remainder of his days may that remainder be long and happy  sir charles asked emily just now if she held her mind as to going down indeed she did she said her heart was in it and she would go that instant to acquaint her mother with her intention and to buy some things preparatory to her journey she should take it for a great favor she told lucy if she would go with her on both occasions  lucy has made to herself a great interest in emilys heart they are both sure they shall be happy in each other my aunt loves her so does my uncle who does not i am sure you will my dear grandmamma and pity her too dear pretty soul she costs me now and then a tear but had i not been in her way it would have been worse she could have no hope i am sure she knows she could not but what a sad gradation is there in that love which though begun in hopelesness of succeeding rises by selfflattery to a possibility then to probability to hope and sinking again to hopelesness ends in despair  but how coolly i write on for one who is byandby to see a clementina  i am waiting sir charless kind leisure to carry me to lady ls he has mr lowther with him just now who however finding us engaged will not stay  sir charles approved my dress as he passed by me to go to mr lowther in the study he snatched my hand and pressed it with his lips my everlovely my everconsiderate harriet you want no ornaments but i was sure you would not give yourself any but those that flowed from a compassionate and generous heart when you were to visit a lady who at present is not in happy circumstances yet is entitled by merit as well as rank to be in the happiest  my aunt and

really in her person a lovely woman of middle stature extremely genteel an air of dignity even of grandeur appears in her aspect and in all she says and does her complexion is fine without art indeed she is a lovely woman she has the finest black eye hair eyebrows of the same color i ever saw yet has sometimes a wildish cast with her eye sometimes a languor that when one knows her story reminds one that her head has been disturbed why taking advantage of her sex is such a person to be controuled and treated as if she were not to have a will when she has an understanding perhaps superior to that of either of her wilful brothers  when we alighted at lady ls i begged sir charles to conduct me into any apartment but that where she was i sat down on the first seat lady l hastened to me  my dearest sister you seem disordered  fie  lady grandison and want spirits  sir charles not observing my emotion had left me and went to attend lady clementina she it seems was in some disorder my

harriet you now see you now know by person the admirable clementina whose magnanimity you so much admired whose character you have so often said is the first among women  we both wept but her tears seemed tears of kindness and esteem i put the hand which was not in hers on her arm i wanted courage my reverence for her would not allow me to be so free or it had again embraced the too conscious lady believe me madam excuse my broken italian i have ever revered you i have said often very often that your happiness happy as i am is necessary to complete mine as well as sir charles grandisons  this goodness to me a fugitive an alien to your country not a lover of your religion o lady grandison you must be as much all i have heard of you in your mind as i see you are in your person receive my thank for making happy the man i wished to be the happiest of men for well does he deserve to be made so we were brother and sister madam before he knew you let me be his sister still and let me be yours  kindred minds sir charles grandison calls ours madam he does me honor may i on further knowledge appear to as much advantage in your eye as you from what i know of you do in mine and i shall be a very happy creature  then you will be happy i was prepared to love you i love you already methinks with a passion that wants not further knowledge of your goodness to augment it but can you madam look upon me with a true sisterly eye can you pity me for the step i have taken so seemingly deregatory to my glory can you believe me unhappy but not wicked for taking it o madam my reason has been disturbed  do you know that  you must attribute to that some of my perversenesses  heaven dearest lady clementina only knows how many tears your calamity has cost me in the most arduous cases i have preferred your happiness to my own you shall know all of me and of my heart not a secret of it though yet uncommunicated to this dearest of men will i conceal from you i hope we shall be true sisters

let me not sir let me not i entreat you all three be compelled to give my vows to any man in marriage all of you promise me and i shall with more delight look before me than for a long long time past i thought would fall to my lot  you madam must concede a little perhaps your parents must a little relax their reason if you will not be too unconceding shall not if i am referred to be mine unless it is reason in every other impartial judgment would to heaven they were at hand to be consulted  what a wish then you would give me up you are a good man will a good man resist the authority of parents in favor of a runaway child dear dear madam clasping her arms about me prevail upon your chevalier grandison to protect me to plead for me he can deny you nothing he will then protect me though my father my mother my brothers should all join to demand me of him  my dear lady clementina said i you may depend on your own interest with sir charles grandison he has your happiness at heart and will have as much as i wish him to have mine  generous noble good lady grandison how i admire you may the almighty shower upon you his choicest blessings if you allow me an interest in his services i

said i taking sir charless hand lady clementina must not be persuaded perfuasion is compulsion why comes over the count of belvedere if she knows it i will not answer for her right mind  my uncle and aunt lucy emily were very curious after particulars when we came home as we did to supper  sir charles left it to lady l to manage with lady g who he knew expected a day of our beloved guests and he himself apologized to them for the freedom he had taken of so disposing of them they had the goodness to thank him for his freedom with them but yet they long to see the admirable lady who could renounce the man of her choice from religious motives yet love him still fly to him for protection yet be able to congratulate him on his marriage and love his wife she is great indeed said my aunt  lucy praised my generosity  but what is that which is called generosity in me who am in full possession of all my wishes to that of clementina  join my dear grandmamma in prayers for her happiness the

for breakfast  lady l had given her such an account of my friends that she was desirous to see them and as she was pleased to say to bespeak their favor to the poor fugitive after the first salutations she addressed my aunt selby in french being told that she spoke not italian you are happy madam said she in a niece who may challenge the world to show her equal and still more happy in her being blessed with such a husband merit is not always so well rewarded  my aunt was struck with the manner as well as with the words  she made a very pretty compliment to my uncle who having forgot his french could only bow and seem pleased when lucy was presented to her as my uncles niece and my favorite correspondent you must not mademoiselle said she be angry with me if i envy you  to emily happy happy young lady said she i have heard of you in italy mrs beaumont spoke honorably of you to me more than once we both called you happy in such a guardian  she made polite compliments to mr deane and bespoke all their favor to her how does everybody admire her  i hope my dear grandmamma you dont think i forget my cousin reevess though i mentioned them not before i have already called in upon them twice and they have with the kind freedom of relations dropped in upon us several times they are invited guests at lord gs i will not say lady gs though everybody else does  this is what i stole time to write while sir charles is engaged in discourse with the lady and our guests are preparing to be gone to lord gs lady g requesting my aunts company early she is the veriest coward these brave spirits she has said are but flash indeed the very delicate as well as very serious and even solemn circumstances which attend her case must make the liveliest woman when the time approaches think  the enclosed note of hers to my aunt brought late last night is however in her usual style  you and lucy must be here early tomorrow morning  what wretched simpletons are we women daughters of gewgaw solly ostentation trifle  first we show our sorry fellow when not disapproved to our friends and relations and take all their judgments upon him if he has their opinion in his favor everybody be he what he will will praise him and give him riches sense ancestry and i cannot tell what of qualities that perhaps we shall never find out then we show our presents our jewels our laces and a smile spreads the mouth and a sparkle gladdens the eye of every maiden that hangs admiring over them ah filly maidens if you could look three yards from your noses you would pity instead of envying the milkwhite heifer dressed in ribbands and just ready to be led to sacrifice  well then what comes next why the poor soul in a few months by the time perhaps her gratulatory visits are half paid her begins to find apprehension take place of security then are she and all her virgins employed in the wretchedest trifles  if i thought you had forgot them i would give you a list of them  and the poor fools wrapping up their jewels in cotton with sighs that perhaps they have worn them for the last time and doubtful whom they may next adorn cover the deckedout milkwhite bed with their babythings see here and see here and what is the use of this and of that asks the curious and perhaps too fearless maiden why this is for   and that is for   answer the matrons who have passed the rubicon  and to this is your charlotte reduced  aunt selby lucy come early that i may show you my babythings  o dear o dear o dear  and that you may be able to testify that i had no design to overlay the little marmouset adieu till ten tomorrow morning  c g  the moment our guests were gone sir charles came to me and leading me into my drawing room where the lady was comfort my love said he your sister  i hastened to her poor lady she was in tears and even sobbing and clasping my arms about her be comforted be consoled my dearest lady clementina  o madam my father my mother my jeronymo are every day expected who beside i know not how shall i look my father my mother in the face  sir charles withdrew he was troubled for her he sent in lady l  your dear friend madam said i and my dear friend will protect you your father and mother would not have had the thoughts of taking so long and troublesome a voyage had they not resolved to do every thing in their power to restore you to peace and to them  so the chevalier tells me  at this time of the year madam such a voyage your mamma so tender in her health such a dislike to the sea her whole motive is tenderness and love she prefers your health your tranquillity to her own  and is not this consideration enough to distress a grateful spirit  unworthy clementina to every relation in every action of late unworthy what trouble have thou given thy parents i cannot cannot bear to see them  o my lady grandison i was ever a perverse creature whatever i set my heart upon i was uneasy till i had compassed it my pride and my perverseness have cost me dear but of late i have been more perverse than ever my heart ran upon coming to england i could think of nothing till i came i have tried that experiment i am sick of it i do not like england now i see i cannot be unmolested here but my favorite for years was another project that filled my mind and helped me to make the sacrifice i did  and here i am come to almost the only country in europe which could render my darling wish impracticable why went i not to france i had with me sufficient to have obtained my admission into any order of nuns and had i been once professed  i will get away still i think befriend me my sister i cannot cannot see my mother  sir charles came in just then i heard what you last said madam said he compose yourself i beseech you i dreaded to acquaint you with the expected arrival of your parents but are they not the most indulgent of parents you have nothing you shall have nothing to fear and you will have everything to hope from their presence  will you engage for their allowing of a divine dedication sir will you plead that cause for me  i cannot say what will what can be done till i see them but confide in my zeal to serve you madam lord ls house i repeat shall be your asylum till you shall consent to see them i cannot be guilty of a prevarication i will own to them that i know where you are but till you give leave you shall be as much concealed from their knowledge as if you were still at your first lodgings and i myself ignorant of your abode  a man of honor said she her hands lifted up is more valuable to a woman in trouble than all the riches of the east but tell me now tell me upon your neverforfeited honor whom besides my father mother and your jeronymo do you expect  my lord the bishop madam   oh oh said she clapping her hands together with an inimitable grace and eagerness  i am afraid  but whom else  father marescotti   the good man will he think it worth his while  but for my father and mothers sake he will  whom else  mrs beaumont madam never intended to set her oot on english ground again but she has broken through her resolution to oblige your mother  good mrs beaumont  but i am half afraid of her well sir  camilla your poor camilla madam  poor camilla i used her hardly but teazing never yet did good with me remember sir they are not to know were i am your house madam to lady l is to be my asylum  then seeing me affected gentlest of human hearts said she what right have i thus to pain you well sir drying her eyes with looks too earnest for her health of mind tell me is anybody else expected  your cousins sebastiano and juliano madam but not the general  thank heaven for that  i love my brother giacomo but he is so determined a man  his own lady only can soften his heart  sir charles by his admirable address made her tolerably easy by dinnertime on the subject of her friends expected arrival and she once owned that she should be transported with joy to see her father mother and jeronymo could she assure herself that she could see them with forgiveness in their countenances  sir charles would only be attended at table by saunders whom she had seen in italy she was much pleased to have it so but desired laura might be permitted to attend at the back of her own chair  i addressed myself to laura three of four times as she stood the lady was pleased and laura seemed proud of my notice  nowandthen an involuntary tear filled the ladys eye as she fat it was easy to enter into her thoughts p oor lady on her situation she was grieved she said at the trouble she gave me and frequently sought to suppress a sigh once after a resverie of few minutes and am i here said she in england at the house of the chevalier grandison can it be a  after dinner lady l and she and i retiring to my drawing room what a generous lady said she are you i was afraid to see you before i saw you but the moment i beheld you i embraced a sister you will allow of my esteem of your grandison  of your love dear lady clementina and thank you for it a good man has an interest in every good persons affections  such generosity snatching my hand with both hers would confirm a doubtful goodness but indeed my esteem for him always soared above person you know i am a zealous catholic you know our doctrine of merits i would have laid down my life to save his soul but surely god will be merciful to such a man and no less so to such a woman as putting her arms about me i have now the honor to embrace  mercy madam said i is the darling attribute of the almighty he is the god of all men  true  but  and was going to say something surther but stopped on sir charless entrance  sir charles after sitting with us a little while asked leave of absence for an hour to look on his friends at lord gs we had a charming conversation in the mean time our subjects were various the customs of italian ladies and their surprising illiterateness in general were parts of it a woman there it seems who knew more than her own tongue was a miracle till within these few years that the french customs seem prevailing there why madam the ladies of italy with geniuss as fine as that classic climate ever produced are immersed in the pleasures of sense singing dancing and conversationgallantry take up their whole time one would imagine that their husbands and fathers thought them only children of this world and not heirs of a better hope by the little care taken in improving their understanding and were it not for the religion of the country which we call superstition half the italian world of women would be looked upon merely as temporary idols for men to worship for temporary gratifications only yet in their conversationassemblies men see what they are capable of but their country it seems is in the same uncultivated state as the minds of their women the garden of the world as italy is called is overrun with weeds and for want of cultivation the very richness of its soil becomes its disease but these reflections i draw rather by deduction from what lady clementia said than from any direct confession of hers she is fond of her country in its present state but sensible english travelers speak of it as i have written  sir charles returned within his time he is kind to be everywhere for he is the life of every company and of every individual  we passed a sweet evening together and till near eleven oclock were lady clementina happy how happy should we all be  sir charles waited on the ladies home lord l was by that time returned from lord gs but was the first of the friendly company that withdrew lady g it seems was all alive in every part of the ontertainment my uncle selby and she spared not each other her lord i sansy fared the better or the presence of the earl and lady gertrude and for her having my uncle to shoot at  god preserve my grandmamma and all my dear friends in her neighborhood prays  her ever dutiful harriet grandison  letter

dear creature what was her grief her noble struggle with herself to conceal her anguish from her guardian  she will now be yours and my aunt selbys and when once settled will must be happy for she is good and you all love her and will love her the more for this great instance of her nobleness of mind  about half an hour before we parted she begged to speak a few words to me in my closet i led her thither when we entered it she shut the door and dropped down on her knees i would have raised her but she would not be raised i clasped my arms about her neck i have revealed all my folly to you said she forgive the weakness of a poor girl a thousand thousand thanks to you madam for your indulgent goodness to me i longed to live with you and my guardian i placed my whole happiness in the grant you gave me an opportunity to try the experiment what i little expected happened i was more unhappy than before i revere your grandmamma she is a blessed lady how good was she on your wedding day to wish me poor me to supply to her the loss of her harriet her goodness her condescension that of all your family overcame me it would not perhaps had i not tried the other experiment all that i have now to beg of you is to pardon me for the trouble i must have given to your noble heart it is a noble heart or it could not have borne with me as it has done but promise to write a letter to me once a fortnight  and permit me to write to you once a week and i shall think myself a happy creature not a thought of my heart but i will reveal to you  i do promise my love my emily the correspondence

improve as i have more years and more sense but my present concern is more for lady clementina than for myself poor lady pray write something of her friends behavior to her and hers to them to me particularly besides what you write to your grandmamma i shall take it for such a favor and it will make me look so important you dont know how proud it will make me and it will induce your lucy and everybody to show me everything you write to them and i shall have it in my power to read out of your letters to me something in return which will look like an acquittal of obligation  all that she wished me to do and still more as occasions offered i promised  she arose from her knees called me by many tender names kissed one cheek then the other then one hand then the other i folded her to my fond heart my sister my friend my emily i called her we wetted each others bosom with our tears and both went down with red eyes  extremely tender but delicate was the leave she took of her guardian the brother the affectionate friend and father i may say appeared in his unreserved tenderness to her she hurried into my uncles coach which stood ready when she parted with him that her emotion might not be too visible i hastening in after her lest she should be too much affected while my aunt lucy and my uncle were taking their leaves in the hall  my dearest emily i admire you said i do you do you  best of wives of women of friends of sisters do you say so  i behaved not amiss then  amiss no my dear charmingly my love you are great as ever woman was  how you comfort me  adieu adieu my best love said i  my best lady grandison said she both in a breath as from one heart embracing and quitting each other with regret her arms folded about herself when i left her as if i were still within

yourself emily shall not need to be your concern she will be our harriet  indeed she shall said lucy dear girl she shall be mine and thank god i now have two harriets instead of one  my uncle wept

much disturbance and at this season of the year so much fatigue god grant that she may be safe in your protection and in her right mind had she been so at the time she had never meditated such a wild such a disgraceful flight the heart of the count of belvedere is torn in pieces by his impatience he will soon follow the man and horse whom we dispatch with this signor sebastiano will accompany him

seeing his kind and skilful lowther god grant us a happy meeting and that no interruption may have been given to your nuptial happiness by the extravagance of a young creature which can only be accounted for in her by the unhappy disorder of her mind adieu adieu my grandison  jeronymo della porretta  letter xxxiv lady grandison to mrs shirley tuesday morning eleven march    about two hours

illustrious guests  as soon as i can get quieter spirits i will attend lady clementina in order to reassure her if i find sue has presence of mind enough to hear the news sir charles has already

what a hurry of spirits i write you will not wonder i have not my grandmammas steadiness of mind never never shall i be like my grandmamma  tuesday two oclock in lady ls closet i have as gently as i could broken the news of their safe arrival at dover to lady clementina she began the subject and said she had been praying for the safety of her friends what will become of me said she should mishap befall any one of them should the fatigue be too much for either my father or mother their healths so precarious or for my jeronymo so lately ill  after proper prefacings i hoped i said her cares on that subject would soon be over sir charles had some intimation of the likelihood of their arrival at a particular port and was actually set out with coaches in hopes of accommodating them when they did arrive and to bring them to the house which had been as she knew before got ready for their reception  she looked by turns on me and on lady l in speechless terror at last then i am sure said she you know they are come tell me tell me are they indeed arrived and are they all well  i owned they were and at dover and waited there to refresh themselves and to be informed of her health and safety before they would proceed further  she wept even to sobbing inveighed against herself her tears were tears of duty and tenderness she comforted herself that sir charles would be able to soften their resentments against her and she was sure he would make the best conditions for her that could be obtained  lord l is all goodness all compassion to her he greatly admires her but we observe that there are some little traces of wildness nowandthen in her talk which carries her into high language and exclamation may her mind be quieted may her intellects be preserved entire in the affecting scenes before her  i am sent for home in haste  tuesday night methinks i am half afraid of telling even you my grandmamma at this distance to whom i was sent for it was to the count of belvedere signor sebastiano was with him lord g happened to call in at st jamess square when they arrived and sending for me entertained them till i came  i asked lord g half out of breath with fear at my first alighting if he had said anything of the lady not a syllable said he i avoided answering questions the gentlemen were full of impatience to know something about her and this made me send for you for though cautioned i was afraid of blundering  honest modest worthy lord g  i prevailed on them to stay supper with me lord g was so obliging as to send home to excuse himself to his lady at my request  they are both fine young gentlemen extremely polite we have been told that the count is a handsome man indeed he is any lady with such a character as he has if she were not prepossessed might like him he is certainly a gentledispositioned and goodnatured man he looks the man of quality he seems not to be above five or sixandtwenty has a foreign aspect and a complexion a sallowish brown yet has a healthy look his eyes however as i knew his case appeared to me to have a cast like those of a man whose mind is disturbed  i behaved to them with the greatest frankness i could show i told them that sir charles set out in the morning on the receipt of a letter from dover for that port and with what equipages they gave but a poor account of the health of the marchioness but if she could but hear good tidings he said and stopped   sir charles i answered would do his utmost to set their hearts at ease  may i not ask a question madam said the count i find your ladyship knows everything of us and our affairs we heard in italy that you were all goodness and find you to be an angel i make no compliment said he laying his spread hand on his heart  lord g with kind officiousness said that was the universal voice  i answered in french the language in which he spoke to me  that i had the pleasure of informing him that letters had passed between lady clementina and sir charles the account she gives of herself said i makes us not quite unhappy  makes us said the count to signor sebastiano in italian his hands lifted up heavenly goodness  i imagined that he thought i understood not that tongue and that i might not mislead them into undue compliments i said in my brokenaccented italian we all here signors are as much interested in the health and happiness of lady clementina as any of her friends in italy can be  they applauded all of us who were as they said so generously interested in the happiness of one of the most excellent of women  i told the count that sir charles had as desired provided lodgings for him i hoped he would find them convenient though sir charles thought them not befitting his quality he said before he set out this morning hearing that their lordships were then probably on their journey from dover to london ordered his gentleman to attend him to them you signor said i are if you please with signor juliano to be sir charless own guests we have another house which will be honored with the residence of the marquis and marchioness their sons the good father marescotti and their other friends  good father marescotti repeated the count  excellent lady grandison  but you say well father marescotti is indeed a good man  i have by heart my lord said i the characters of all my dear sir charless good friends  again the two lords looked upon each other as admiring me  pity my dear grandmamma that different nations of the world though of different persuasions did not more than they do consider themselves as the creatures of one god the sovereign of a thousand worlds  the count expressed great impatience to know some particulars of lady clementina i took this opportunity to say that as i had been informed of the transcendent piety of the lady and of her great earnestness from her earliest youth to take the veil i presumed it would forward the good understanding hoped for if it were not at present known that his lordship was arrived and the rather as several tender scenes might be expected to pass between her and her other friends which perhaps her present easily to be supposed weak spirits and turn of mind might with difficulty enable her to support  the count sighed but bowing said he came with a very small retinue because he would be as private as possible he had been for many months determined to visit england the family della porretta signor jeronymo in particular had promised to visit sir charles in it likewise they should indeed have chosen a better season for it had not their care and concern for one of the most excellent of women induced them to anticipate their intentions he was entirely of my opinion he added that his arrival in england should not at present be known by lady clementina  he then in a very gallant but modest manner owned to my lord g and me his passion for her and said that on the issue of this adventure of the dear lady hung his destiny  i told him i had been the more free in giving my humble advice as to the keeping secret his lordships arrival as but for that reason i could assure him sir charles would not have permitted his lordship or any of his train to go into his lodgings and i mentioned the high regard which i knew sir charles had for the count of belvedere  i ordered supper to be got early as i supposed the two lords would be glad to retire soon after the fatigue of their journey for they had set out early in the morning i sent a note begging the favor of my cousin reevess company to supper apologizing by the occasion for the short notice they were so kind as to come they admire the two young noblemen for signo r sebastiano as well as the count is a sensible modest young man mr reeves and they entered into free conversation in french which we all understood on their country voyage and journey by land both gentlemen spoke of sir charles and his behavior in italy in raptures  my cousin reeves attended by saunders was so good as to conduct the count to his lodgings in his coach sir charles having all our equipages with him  you will soon have another letter my dearest grandmamma from  your everdutiful harriet grandison  letter xxxv lady grandison in continuation wedn morn march    mr and mrs reeves were so kind as to breakfast and intend to dine with me  they brought with them as agreed upon overnight the count of belvedere who has assumed the name of signor marfigli after breakfast mr reeves dropping my cousin at lady gs carried the two noblemen through several of the greet streets and squares of this vast town to westminster hall the houses of parliament etc  i went in my chair mean time to pay my sincerest compliments to lady clementina i assured her that she was and should be the subject of our choicest cares  poor lady she is full of apprehensions i owned to her the arrival of signor sebastiano and his prayers for her safety and health and told her what i had answered to his enquiries after her  she was for removing to some distance from town where she thought she could be more private lord and lady l both assured her it was impossible she could be anywhere so private as in this great town nor so happily situated should she think fit on a reconciliation to own where she had been as in the protection and at the house of sir charles grandisons brother and sister  god be praised for the happy meeting you all have had lucy is very good to be so particular about my emily this letter of miss lucy selby appears not  dear girl she is an example to all young ladies let clementina be made easy and who will be so happy as your harriet  thursday march    sir charles has been so good as to let me know that he and mr lowther arrived yesterday morning at dover he found the marchioness signor jeronymo and the good camilla as he calls her very much indisposed from the fatigues they had undergone both in mind and body the whole noble family received him with inexpressible joy jeronymo told him that his arrival and mr lowthers with him had given them all spirits and health must follow to those who were indisposed  sir charles supposes that they will be obliged to continue at dover all this day tomorrow if the marchioness is able to bear the journey they propose to set out and proceed as far on their way to london as her health will permit and to get to town as early on saturday as possible  the dear man thought his harriet would be uneasy if he had not written to her as he shall be two days longer out than he had hoped to be sure she should if he had not thought so justly of her as she knows no other method of valuing herself than by his value of her she must have been extremely sunk in her own opinion  he bids me assure lady clementina that she will find every one of her friends determined to do all in their power to make her happy resentment he says has no place in their bosoms they breathe nothing but reconciliation and love  i will not my dear grandmamma dispatch this letter to you till i can inform you that this worthy family are settled with us and at grosvenorsquare  sat evening march    i have just received the following billet from sir charles  grosvenorsquare sat   oclock my dearest love will rejoice to know by this that our friends are all arrived here in safety the marchioness bore the journey better than we expected my jeronymo is in fine spirits i thought it would give my harriet as well as them less fatigue if i put them into immediate possession of this house than if i brought them to pay their compliments to her as they were very desirous to do at st jamess square mrs beaumont has allotted to them their respective apartment there is room enough and they are pleased to say handsome room signor juliano will attend my love with me what an admirable forecast in my dearest life a repast so elegant prepared as your murray informs me by your personal direction to attend their hour she tells me you have borrowed a female servant of each of our sisters and one of mrs reeves to join with two of your own in the service of this house in everything on every occasion you delight by your goodness and greatness of mind  your everdevoted chapter grandison   i shall stay supper with them but shall break away as soon as i can to attend the joy of my heart  am i not a happy creature my dear grandmamma by what little offices if done with tolerable grace may one make a great and noble spirit think itself under obligation to one  but had i known they would not have called first in st jamess square i would not have contented myself as i did with a visit to the other house in the middle of the day to see everything was in order against they came they should have found me there to receive and welcome them  signor sebastiano is flown to them i should have told you that the count at my request dined and supped with me and signor sebastiano they choosing to comply with our english customs every day of this week from that of his arrival they are really good young men they improve upon me every hour how do they admire lady clementina the count yesterday complimented me that for piety reading understanding sweetness of manners frankness of heart she could only be equally in england italy knew not he said nor had known of modern times her mother excepted such another woman if i knew lady clementina he added i would not wonder at his perseverance he having besides the honor of all her familys good opinion  how i long to see every individual of this noble family  i know how sincerely i love them all by this one instance  i have not now for near a week that my dearest friend has been absent from me in their service wished once for his company though had he not written to me on thursday i should have been anxious for his health and theirs  may they be indulgently and not ungraciously forgiving  then will i dearly love them  poor lady clementina how full of apprehensions has she been all this week she has not stirred out of her chamber since wednesday morning nor designs it for a week or two to come  sunday my dearest friend my lover my husband every tender word in one left his noble guests for their sakes early last night and he was pleased to tell me for his own sake longing to see to thank to applaud his harriet he brought with him the two young noblemen who are our own immediate guests  he gave me last night and this morning an account of what passed between the family and himself from his arrival at dover to their coming to town last night  they confessed the highest obligations to him for attending them in person and for bringing mr lowther with him but when on their eager questions to him after their clementina he told them that he had heard from her and that she had owned herself to be in honorable and tender hands the marquis lifted up his eyes in thankful rapture the marchioness with clasped hands seemed to praise god but her lips only moved all the rest expressed their joy in words dictated by truly affectionate hearts  sir charles found them all most cordially disposed to forgive the dear fugitive as the bishop called her but depend upon it added the prelate nothing will secure her head but our yielding to her in her long wishedfor hope of the convent or on prevailing on her to marry and if you grandison join with us i question not but the latter may be effected  sir charles blamed them for having precipitated her as they had done  that said the bishop was partly the fault of our well meaning giacomo and partly her own for more than once she gave us hope that she would comply with our wishes  i besought sir charles that he would not be prevailed upon to take part with them if she continued averse to a change of condition  i waved the subject my dearest life replied he at the time i have continued to do so ever since i want only to see them settled and lady clementina composed and then i shall know what can be done till then arguments on either side will rather strengthen than remove difficulties  the bishop with great concern told sir charles that when the first news of clementinas flight was brought to bologna her poor mother was for two days as unhappy in her mind as ever her daughter had been and when it was found likely that clementina was gone to england she insisted so vehemently on following her that they had no other way to pacify her but by promising that they would out of hand pay to sir charles the visit they intended and some of them had engaged to make him nor would she when she grew better on their promise acquit them of it this determined them to this winter excursion sorely against the will of some of them and it was in compassion to this unhappy state of the poor mothers mind that mrs beaumont consented to accompany her  sir charles is gone to attend lady clementina he then proposes to welcome the count of belvedere into england and afterward to wait on the noble family and know when i shall be permitted to pay my devoirs to them  sunday two oclock sir charles has found it very difficult to quiet the apprehensions of lady clementina he is grieved for her god grant he prays that she keep in her right mind lady l thinks the poor lady is already disturbed  sir charles was joyfully received by signor marsigli he owned to that lord that he knew where to send letters to lady clementina he is to introduce me byandby to his guests at grosvenorsquare  sunday night sir charles presented me to this expecting family i admire them all  the marquis and marchioness are a fine couple there is dignity in their aspects and behavior a fixed kind of melancholy sits upon the features of each the bishop has the man of quality in his appearance but he has something more solemn in his countenance than even father marescotti who at a glance is not unlike our dr bartlett the more like as goodness and humility both shine in his countenance  but signor jeronymo is an amiable young man i could almost at first sight and his winning grace confirmed me have called him brother with signal kindness did my sir charles present me to this his dear friend and with equal kindness did signor jeronymo receive me and congratulate sir charles they all joined in the congratulation  the amiable mrs beaumont  she embraced me she felicitated me with such a grace as made her manner surpass even her words  the good camilla was presented to me she has the look of a gentlewoman how many scenes did the sight of this good woman revive in my memory some of them painful ones  signior marsigli as he is called and the two young lords dined with them this being a first visit on my part we made it a short one we went from them to lady gs and drank tea with her and her lord sir charles could not bear he said to go immediately from the sighing parents to the sorrowing daughter they not knowing nor being at present to know she was so near them  lady g was so petulant so whimsical when her brothers back was turned that i could not forbear blaming her but i let her go her own way she stopped my mouth  so you think you shall behave more patiently more thankfully in the same circumstance  look to it harriet  here my dearest grandmamma i will conclude this letter pray for the poor clementina for a happy reconciliation and that the result may be tranquillity of mind restored to this whole noble family so necessary to that of your dear sir charles and  his and your harriet grandison  letter xxxvi lady grandison in continuation thursday march    nothing decisive yet my dear grandmamma  there have been some generous contentions between the family and sir charles he has besought them to make their hearts easy and he will comply with all their reasonable desires  they think not of dining with or visiting us till they can hear some tidings of their beloved daughter  lord g lord l and lady l as also mrs eleanor grandison have been presented to them  sir charles has begun to enter into a treaty as i may call it with the lady on one part her family on the second and the count of belvedere on the third lady clementina it seems insists upon being allowed to take the veil and that in a manner that sometimes carries wildness with it the bishop sir charles thinks seems less fervent in his opposition to it than formerly father marescotti in his heart he believes favors her wishes but the marquis and marchioness and signor jeronymo plead their own inclinations their son the generals unabated fervor in behalf of the marriage were it but to secure the performance of the grandfathers will and to be an effectual disappointment of the interested hopes of lady sforza and her daughter laurana the count of belvederes passion for the lady notwithstanding her unhappy malady past and apprehended makes a great merit for him with the family and the two young lords think so highly of him for his perseverance that they are attached to his interest and declare that the conte della porretta their father is as strongly on the same side as the general himself  in the mean time the fond mother is so impatient to see her daughter that they are afraid of the consequences as to health both of mind and body if a speedy determination be not come to on the other hand the young lady grieves to find herself as she says in such a situation as to be obliged to insist on conditions with her parents before she can throw herself at their feet which she longs to do though she dreads to see them sometimes and they are when she is calmest she blames herself for the step she has taken at others she endeavors to find excuses for it  sunday morning mar    sir charles has drawn up a paper at the request of all parties he last night gave a copy of it to the lady another to the count a third to the bishop for them all to consider of the contents and he will attend them tomorrow for their answer he has been pleased to give me also a copy of it which is as follows  i that lady clementina in obedience to the will of her two deceased grandfathers in duty to her parents and uncle and in compliance with the earnest supplications of the most affectionate of brothers shall engage her honor to give up all thoughts of withdrawing from the world not only for the present but for all future time so long as she shall remain in her maiden state  ii she shall be at liberty to choose her way of life and shall be allowed at her own pleasure to visit her brother and his lady at naples her uncle at urbino mrs beaumont at florence and be put into the immediate perception of the profits of the estate bequeathed to her if she chooses it that she may be enabled to do that extensive good with the produce that she could not do were she to renounce the world in which case that estate would devolve to one who it is but too probable would make a very different use of it  iii she shall have the liberty of nominating her own attendants and in case of death or removal by promotion of father marescotti whose merits must at last render him conspicuous to choose her own confessor but that her father and mother shall have their negative preserved to them in either case while she continues in their palace nor will the dear lady think this a hardship for she wishes not to be independent on parents of whose indulgent goodness to her she is most dutifully sensible and it is reasonable that they should be judges of the conduct of every one who is to be a domestic in their family  iv as lady clementina from some late unhappy circumstances thinks she cannot marry any man and as a late extraordinary step taken by her has shown that there is at present too much reason to attend to the weight of her plea it is hoped that the count of belvedere for his own sake for the sake of the composure of mind of the lady so dear to all who have the honor of knowing her will resolve to discontinue his addresses to her and engage never to think of resuming them unless some hopes should arise in course of time of his succeeding in her favor by her own consent  v her everhonoured parents for themselves and for their absent brother the count of porretta her right reverend brother for himself and as far as he may for his elder brother signor jeronymo for himself will be so good as to promise that they will never with earnestness endeavor to persuade much less to compel lady clementina to marry any man whatever nor encourage her camilla or any other friend or confident to endeavor to prevail upon her to change her condition her parents however reserving to themselves the right of proposing as they shall think fit but not of urging because the young lady who is by nature sweettempered gentle obliging dutiful thinks herself however determined by inclination less able to withstand the persuasions of indulgent friends than she should be to resist the most despotic commands  vi these terms conceded to on all sides it is humbly proposed that the young lady shall throw herself as she is impatient to do at the feet of her indulgent parents and that all acts of disobligation shall be buried in everlasting oblivion  the proposer of the above six articles takes the liberty to add on the presumption that they may be carried into effect that his noble guests will allow him to rejoice with them on their mutual happiness restored for months to come in his native country  he hopes that they will accept of his endeavors to make england as agreeable to them as they heretofore made italy to him  he begs that they will consider their family and his as one family ever to be united by the indissoluble ties of true friendly love  he hopes for their company at his country seat  he will seek for opportunities to oblige and accommodate them in every article whether devotional or domestic  and when they will be no longer prevailed upon to stay in england he will no accidents no events preventing of which themselves shall be judges attend them to italy and if his beloved wife and sisters and their lords shall have made to themselves as he hopes they will an interest in their affections he questions not to prevail on them to be of the party  chapter grandison  monday morn ten oclock sir charles is gone to attend the count at his lodgings in pursuance of his request signified by a note last night  two oclock the following billet is just now brought me  my dearest love will have the goodness to excuse my dining with her this day signor marsigli and her everdevoted are hastening to grosvenorsquare where we shall dine this worthy nobleman deserves pity adieu my dearest life  chapter grandison   i am all impatience for the issue of these conferences but i will not dine by myself when i can sit down at table with lady l and lady clementina at lord ls  and with my lord himself so much my brother and friend here therefore will i close this letter forgive my everhonoured grandmamma the abruptness of  your everdutiful harriet grandison  letter xxxvii lady grandison in continuation monday march    lady l when i was set down at her house told me that lady clementina had been in great agitations on the contents of the proposals left with her she kept her chamber all day yesterday and this morning lady l had then but just left her i sent up my compliments to her she desired me to walk up she met me on the stairhead in tears and led me into her dressing room  have you seen the chevaliers proposals madam  i owned i had   give up for ever said she my scheme my darling scheme for the sake of which i  there she stopped  it was easy to guess what the poor lady was going to say the subject was too delicate for me to help her out  dearest lady clementina said i be pleased to consider the good it will be in your power to do to hundreds according to the second article if you can comply how much has our dear friend consulted your beneficent spirit all my fear is that your parents will not subscribe to their part of it if they will what a favorite scheme of their own will they give up  she paused  then breaking silence  and is it your opinion lady grandison your opinion joined to the chevaliers  let me consider   she took two or three turns about the room then thinking of sir charless intimation of a tour to italy  with what soothing what consoling hope said she does the nexttodivine man almost conciliate my mind to his measures  and could you would you madam think of going with us to italy o how flattering are these hints  i should rejoice in such a tour replied i love me but in your italy if i should be allowed to go as i do you in our england and i shall be happy in so fine a country as i am told it is but dearest lady what shall we do to obtain your friends compliance with these articles shall i cast myself on my knees before your father and mother to beg theirs you in my hand i in yours  ever good ever noble lady grandison  but how first shall i pacify my own heart on yielding to my part of them  let it not stick there madam will not lady clementina meet them one fourth of the way it is not more  well i will consider of it i shall hear what they will do your advice my dear lady grandison shall have all the weight with me that a sisters ought  i attended the summon to dinner she excused herself i took leave of her for the day declaring my intention of going home as soon as i had dined  monday night sir charles returned with a benevolent joy brightening his countenance he hopes to bring this affair to an issue not unhappy  he was first with the count of belvedere who received him with great emotion i apprehended said he that i was to be the sacrifice o grandison did you but know the hopes the assurances given me by the general by everybody  sir charles expatiated on every argument that could compose his mind  will she promise will she engage that if ever she marry it will be the man before you chevalier why did you not make that a stipulation in my favor  i think such a stipulation would be of disadvantage to your lordship you would be kept by it in suspense whatever had offered whether in italy or spain in both which countries you have considerable connexions if lady clementina can be brought to give up the veil it may not be impracticable to induce her in time but time must be given her to favor with her hand a man of your lordships merit and consequence if otherwise your lordship unfettered either by hope or obligation will be free to make another choice  another choice sir  this to a man who has so long adored her and through the various turns of her unhappy malady still preserved for her a love that never any other woman shared in  but if you please we will hear what her father her mother and other friends say to the articles you have drawn up  they went to them after dinner the important subject had a full and solemn consideration  signor jeronymo and mrs beaumont only at first espoused the proposed plan in all its articles but everybody came into it at last god be praised now surely the dear lady must be happy but the poor count of belvedere he has not in giving up his inclination such a noble triumph of selfconquering duty as she had to support her in the same arduous trial but then he cherishes a hope that there remains a possibility the lady still unmarried  noblest of women is harriet a bar  no she is what you generously wished her to be  tuesday mar    sir charles excused himself to lady clementina by a few lines last night for not waiting on her yesterday and just as he was setting out to attend her this morning the following note was brought him from signor jeronymo the contents designed to strengthen his endeavors to prevail on the lady to accept his plan  my dearest grandison tuesday morn you will make us all happy if you can prevail upon our beloved clementina to accept and subscribe to your generous plan as we all most cheerfully are ready to do restore yourself my dearest sister this day or tomorrow at furthest to the arms of the most indulgent of parents and to those of the most affectionate of brothers two of us who will answer for our third how impatiently shall we number the hours till the happy one arrives that we all shall receive from the hand of the dearest of friends and best of men a sister so much beloved  ever ever my dear grandison  your grateful jeronymo   o my dearest lady clementina noblest of women let your sister harriet prevail upon you not to refuse the offered olive branch  tuesday two oclock sir charles has just now acquainted me that he has prevailed with lady clementina tomorrow afternoon she will throw herself at the feet of her father and mother rejoice with me my dear grandmamma all my friends rejoice with me congratulate me  is it not i myself that am going to be restored to the most indulgent parents brothers friends  let me gratefully add from the information of his aunt grandison whom he brought home with him that he was so good as to resist entreaty to dine at lord ls and why because as he was pleased to give the reason and was generously commended for it by lady clementina that i was alone lord l proposed to send to request my company he was sure his sister grandison would oblige them and i my lord said sir charles am sure she would too but the time is so short that it is not giving one of the most obliging women in the world an option  tenderest of husbands kindest and most considerate of men  he will not subject a woman to the danger of being a refusing vashti nor yet will give her reason to tremble with a toomeanly mortified esther  tuesday evening as sir charles and i were sitting at supper sweetly alone the whole world as it seemed to each other for mrs grandison chooses to be at present at lord ls and was gone thither the following billet was brought me written in italian which thus i english  tomorrow my dearest lady grandison as the chevalier has no doubt told you the poor fugitive is to be introduced to her parents pray for her but if i am to have the honor of being looked upon as indeed your sister you must do more than pray for me was you in earnest yesterday when you offered your comforting hand to sustain me if i consented to cast myself at the feet of my father and mother lady l is so good as to consent in person to acknowledge the protection she has given me will you my sister be my sister on this awful occasion  will you lend me your supporting hand  if you as well as lady l credit the runaway penitent with your appearance in her favor then will she with more courage than can otherwise fall to her share look up to those parents and to those brothers whose indulgent bosoms she has filled with so much anguish till tomorrow is over she dare not sign the respectable addition to the name of  tuesday evening clementina   will i repeated i as soon as i had read it was i in earnest yesterday  indeed i was indeed i will read it my dearest sir and give me leave to answer its contents as my amiable sister wishes  he had looked benignly at his servants and at the door and they withdrew as soon as the billet was brought on my saying from my lady  scenes that may be expected to be tender said he will not i hope affect too much the spirits of my angel  but it is a request as kindly made by clementina as generously complied with by you i will tell you my dear how if the lady please we will order it after dinner you shall call upon your worthily adopted sister and take her and lady l to grosvenorsquare i will be there to receive her and present her to her friends though i doubt not but she will

  now for particulars of what passed yesterday sir charles is gone to grosvenorsquare to enquire after the health and composure of his noble guests there  when i called upon lady clementina yesterday five oclock i found her greatly distressed with her own apprehensions i must said she to me be a guiltier creature than i had allowed myself to think i was why else am i so ashamed so afraid to see parents whom i ever honored brothers and friends whom i ever loved  o lady grandison what a dispiriting thing is the consciousness of having done amiss and to a proud heart too  then looking upon the written plan let me see said she what i am to sign these were the remarks she made upon them as she read    hard hard article the first but your grandison madam my fourth brother my friend my protector tells me that i shall discharge all the obligations he ever laid upon me if i will sign it  i submit    how flattering to my pride to my hopes of doing good to the indigent and unhappy    nominating my attendants  my confessor  kind considerate grandison if i give up the first wish of my heart i shall not insist upon these stipulations in my favor my parents shall have in these cases affirmative and negative too indeed i desire not in any article to be independent of them    a grateful article i acknowledge chevalier your protection with gratitude in this stipulation    if my friends promise they will perform ours is a family of untainted honor i hope my brother giacomo will be answered for by his brothers in these articles but he will hate me i fear  generous grandison

the coach drove to grosvenorsquare when it stopped she threw her arms about lady l and hiding her face in her bosom called upon the blessed virgin to support her  how how said she can i look my father my mother in the face  sir charles on the coach stopping appeared he saw her emotion it is kind my harriet it is kind lady l to accompany lady clementina  your goodness will be rewarded in being

expedient i repeated therefore what sir charles last said she was visibly encouraged by it she gave him her trembling hand and he led her into the prepared drawing room lady l and i followed and took our seats on each hand of her sir charles his over against her our offered salts and soothing with difficulty kept her from fainting  when she was a little revived  hush said she with her finger held up and wildness in her looks casting her eyes to the doors and windows in turn they will hear us  further recovering herself  o chevalier said she what shall i say how shall i look what shall i do

my mamma  my clementina  was all that either could say they sunk down on the floor the mothers arms about the daughters neck the daughters about the mothers waist  sir charles lifted them up and seated them close to each other  pardon pardon pardon said the dear lady hands and eyes lifted up sliding out of her mothers arms on her knees  but at that moment could say no more  the marquis not being able longer to contain himself rushed in  my daughter my child my clementina once more do i see my child  sir charles had halflifted her up when her father entered she sunk down again prostrate on the floor her arms extended o my father forgive  forgive me o my father  he raised her up by sir charless assistance and seating her between himself and his lady both again wrapped their arms about her she repeated prayers for forgiveness in broken accents blessings in accents as broken flowed from their hearts to their lips  after the first emotions when they could speak and she nowandthen could look up which she did by snatches as it were her eyes presently falling under theirs behold madam behold my lord said she the hospitable lady to whom  looking at lady l behold looking at me a more than woman an angel  more she would have said but seemed at a loss for words  we have before seen and admired said the marquis in lady grandison the noblest of all women  he arose to approach us sir charles led us both to them  lady clementina snatched first my hand and eagerly pressed it with her lips then lady ls her heart was full she seemed to want to speak but could not and lady l and i with overflowing eyes congratulated the father mother daughter and were blessed in speech by the two former by hands and eyes lifted up by lady clementina  sir charles then withdrawing returned with the bishop and signor jeronymo it is hard to say whether these two lords showed more joy than clementina did shame and confusion she offered at begging pardon but the bishop said not one word of past afflictions nobody is in fault we are all happy once more and happy on the conditions prescribed to both by this friend of mankind in general and of our family in particular  my ever noble my venerable brother said jeronymo who had clasped his sister to his fond heart his eyes running over how i love you for this uncalled for assurance to the dear clementina every article of my grandisons plan shall be carried into execution we will rejoice with the chevalier in his england  and he and all who are dear to him shall accompany us to italy we will be all one family  sir charles then introduced to the lady his greatly and justly esteemed mrs beaumont clementina threw herself into her arms forgive me my dear mrs beaumont if you forgive me virtue will pardon the poor creature who never never would have so much disgraced your lessons and her mammas example as she has done had not a heavy cloud darkened her unhappy mind say you forgive me as the best and most indulgent of parents and the kindest of brothers have done  it was not your fault my dear lady clementina but your misfortune you never was so much to be blamed as pitied all here are of one sentiment we came over to heal your wounded mind be it healed and every one will be happy yes more happy perhaps for now we all understand one another than if you had not left us to mourn your absence  blessed be my comforter my friend my beloved mrs beaumont you always knew how to blunt the keen edge of calamity what a superior woman are you  father marescotti was introduced by the marquis himself with a respect worthy of his piety and goodness i submit father said lady clementina before he could speak to any penance you shall inflict  his voice would not befriend him his action however showed him to be all joy and congratulation  i have been wicked very wicked continued she  but mrs beaumont says and she says justly that i merited pity rather than blame yet if you think not so you who are the keeper of my conscience spare me not  who who said the good man recovering speech shall condemn when father mother and brothers so zealous for the honor of their family acquit god forgive you my dearest lady and god forgive us all  my dearest chevalier grandison said jeronymo what gratitude what obligations do we owe to you and your admirable lady and sisters again i acknowledge the obligation for a whole family from this hour a happy one i hope  it had been agreed between the family and sir charles that not a word should be mentioned to lady clementina of the count of belvedere they requested sir charles to take upon himself the breaking to her that he was in england in his own manner as opportunity should offer  every one having been greatly affected sir charles proposed to take leave and that lady clementina should return to lady ls for that night as preparation might not have been made for her stay in grosvenorsquare but all the family with one voice declared they could not part with the restored daughter and sister of their hopes and she herself cheerfully consented to stay gratefully however with a bent knee thanking lady l for her sisterly treatment  who in the general joy said sir charles has remembered the good camilla let camilla congratulate her lady and all of us on this happy occasion  everyone called out for camilla in ran the worthy creature on her knees she embraced her young ladys and wept for joy ah my camilla my friend camilla said clementina clasping her arms about her neck i have been cruel to you but it was not i  alas alas i was not always myself  i will endeavor to repair your wrongs  thank god that i once more clasp my dear young lady to my heart  i have no wrongs to complain of  yes yes you have kind camilla i wanted to elude your watchful duty and was too cunning to be just to my camilla  sir charles forgot not to commend laura to forgiveness and favor laura said lady clementina is blameless she obeyed me with reluctance if i am myself forgiven forgive laura  my dearest love said the marchioness we have agreed that you shall choose your own servants the chevalier we have no doubt had laura in his thoughts when he made that stipulation the english youth too you my clementina must have it in your power to do with these as you please  may i be permitted my lords said sir charles to make one request for myself to lady clementina a request which shall be consistent with the articles you will all sign  i will agree to a request of yours chevalier said the lady be it almost what it will  i will not madam make it today nor tomorrow after the hurry of spirits we have all sustained let tomorrow be a day of composure permit me to expect you all at dinner with me on friday the articles then may be signed and then but not before i will mention my request and hope it will be granted  sir charless invitation was politely accepted and tomorrow   lady clementina and mrs beaumont below  agreeable surprise  sir charles had been out and was just come in when the two ladies alighted i was overjoyed to see them and to see lady clementina serene and seemingly not unhappy we are come said mrs beaumont to make our earliest acknowlegements for the happiness restored to a whole family lady clementina could not be easy till she had paid her personal thanks to lady grandison for the support her presence gave her yesterday  gratitude said the lady fills my her but how chevalier shall i express it i beseech you let me know your request tell me dear lady grandison wherein i can oblige my fourth brother  my dearest lady clementina said sir charles fortify your heart against a gentle i hope it will then be but a gentle surprise you have not yet signed your relations have not i presume the articles to which you have mutually agreed  sir chevalier sir  let me not alarm you madam  he put one of her hands in mine and took the other in a very tender manner in his  you intend to sign them  they do i am sure tomorrow when we are all together they will be signed on both sides  i hope so  they will not chevalier be receded from  they will not madam and hence you will be assured that the count of belvedere will never be proposed to you with any degree of urgency  i hope not i hope not said she with quickness  should you madam on your return to italy be unwilling to see the count as a friend of your family as a respecter of your great qualities as a countryman  i shall always regard the count of belvedere as a man of honor as a friend of my brother giacomo of all our family  but i cannot place him in any other light what means the chevalier grandison keep not my mind in suspense  i will not your father your mother your brothers came over in hopes that you might be prevailed upon in the counts favor they have given up that hope   they have sir  and will absolutely leave you to your own will to your own wishes on the condition to which you have agreed to sign  but shall i ask you  were the count to be in france would you allow him to come over and take leave of your family and you before he sets out for the court of madrid  what sir as a man who had hopes from me of more than my good wishes  no madam only as a friend to the whole family  not requesting any other favor now he sees you so determined than your good wishes your prayers for him as you will ever have his for you  i can consent in that view but were any other favor to be hoped from me were my generosity to be expected to be prevailed upon  o chevalier lady grandison mrs beaumont let me not be attempted in this way the articles would be broken this would be persuasion and that compulsion  nothing madam of this kind is intended the articles will be inviolably observed on the part of your relations but here mrs beaumont who never intended to set her foot on the english shore to oblige and comfort your mother is come to england and in the general grief that was occasioned by your absenting yourself if the man who was always deservedly esteemed by your family had accompanied had attended your father your brothers   sir charles stopped and looked at the apprehensive lady with such a sweet benignity and on her eye meeting his with such tender and downcast modesty all the graces of gentle persuasion are his   o chevalier your request your request tell me in what i can oblige the most obliging of friends of men  i will tell you madam  bowing on the hand he held  consent if it be not with too much pain to yourself to see the count of belvedere  see him sir how when where as what  as a friend to your family  a wellwisher to your glory your happiness and as a man ready and desirous to promote the latter at the expense of his own he wishes but while he stays here   stays here sir  to be allowed to visit your family and to see you once twice thrice as you please  but entirely under the conditions of the articles to be signed tomorrow  and is then the count in england  he is madam he attended his and your friends over he has not once desired to appear in your presence he keeps himself close in private lodgings hence judge of his resolution not to disturb or offend you he will depart the kingdom without an interview if you will have it so but i could not bear that so good a man should be obliged to depart disgracefully as i may say and as if he were undeserving of pity though he could not obtain favor  o chevalier  secured madam by the articles though his emotion may be apprehended to be great yours cannot  there is not the same reason for the one as for the other i make it my request that the count of belvedere may be allowed as one of the chosen friends of your house but as no more more the articles forbid a place at my table tomorrow  tomorrow sir and i at it   he bowed affirmatively  o how the penetrating man looked into the heart of the lady at her eyes  as sure us you are alive madam he thought of guessing by her then emotion whether any hopes could distantly lie for the count by the consequence his presence or absence would give him with her  she paused  at last  and is this chevalier the request you had to make me  it is madam and if my harriet had not had the honor of this visit i should have made the same request for his admission in the evening tomorrow  as now i do to dinner  well sir i can suspect no doubledealing from sir charles grandison  i ask for no favor for the count more than i have mentioned madam i am bound by the articles i have drawn as if i were a party to them  well sir i consent to see the count he will be prudent i hope i shall be so in italy more than once after you had left it i saw him and i always wished him happy  now my dearest sister said sir charles my evertoberespected friend i am easy in my mind i could not bear in my thoughts that anything i knew which it concerned you to know should be concealed from you  tears stood in her eyes o madam said she to me god and you only can reward this excellent man for his goodness to me and all the world that know him  you see your influence chevalier in every way do i wish to show my gratitude but never never ask me to give my hand in marriage  ah my dear lady thought i a tear stealing involuntarily down my cheek the less the less i doubt must you be asked for having before you a man who having no equal you cannot think of any other  the two ladies hurried away to lady ls how sincerely has the friendly heart of dear lady l been affected in all these tender scenes  letter xxxix lady grandison in continuation thursday evening march    lady g has sent for me in all haste she is taken ill god give her a happy hour  o my grandmamma there are solemn there are awful circumstances in the happiest marriages she begs to see her brother as well as me i wait for him the count of belvedere is with him  they have parted  i am gone  thursday night just returned all happily over a fine girl  yet though a fine one how are the earl and lady gertrude disappointed  poor mortals how hard to be pleased  the brave are always humane sir charless tender and polite behavior on this occasion  how does every occurrence endear him to everybody  how dearly does lord g love his charlotte till all was over he was in agonies for her safety his prayers then his thankfulness now how ought they to endear them to his charlotte and so they must when she is told of his anxiety and of his honest joy or i will not own her for my sister but in her heart i am sure she loves him her past idle behavior to him was but play she will be matronized now the mother must make her a wife she will doubly disgrace herself if she loves her child and can make a jest of her husband  i have just now asked sir charles whether if he could prevail on lady clementina while they were all with us to give her hand to the count of belvedere he would by no means said he and that for both their sakes lady clementina has on many occasions shown that she may be prevailed upon by generous and patient treatment let the count have patience if she recover her mind a train of cheerful ideas may take place of those melancholy ones which make her desirous of quitting society she will find herself by the articles agreed to in a situation to do more good than it is possible she could do were her inclination to take the veil to be gratified the good she will do will open and enlarge a mind which is naturally noble and she will be grateful for the indulgence given her which will be the means of so happy a change but if the poor ladys mind be not curable which god forbid who will pity the count for not being able to obtain her hand  i think my dear i have made him though not happy easy and i hope he will be able to see her without violent emotions  friday morn signors sebastiano and juliano are come back rejoicing that they have been introduced to and kindly received by lady clementina  sir edward beauchamp has just left me how happy does the account he gives of my emilys cheerfulness make me i knew you would all love her  sincerely do i rejoice in the news which my nancy confirms that lucy has absolutely rejected the addresses of mr greville she startled me once i can tell her a naughty girl what could she mean by it  will not she give me the particulars under her own hand i shall be afraid of her till she does so much was i impressed by her warmth in the argument she once held with me in his favor as i thought yet i cordially wish mr greville well but my lucy better pray madam let me privately know if the proposals from the young irish peer lord reresby mentioned vol vi p      whom nancy praises so much for his sobriety modesty learning and other good qualities were made before or after the rejecting of mr greville i halfmistrust the girls who have been disappointed of a first love yet lucys victory over herself was a noble one she is in the way i hope to be rewarded for it god grant it  think you my dear grandmamma i can be solicitous as i am from the bottom of my heart for the happiness of a newadopted sister and not be inexpressibly anxious for that of my lucy the faithful the affectionate friend of my earlier years  our guests are entering  may the same gracious providence which has more than answered every wish of your harriets heart in her own situation shower down its blessings on lucy on you and all the revered the beloved circle prays my dear grandmamma  your and their ever dutiful and affectionate harriet grandison  letter xl lady grandison to mrs shirley sat march    now my dear grandmamma let me give you some account of what passed yesterday  the articles signed and witnessed were put into lady clementinas hand and a pen given her that she might write her name in the presence of all her surrounding friends here  never woman appeared with more dignity in her air and manner she was charmingly dressed and became her dress a truly lovely woman but every one by looks seemed concerned at her solemnity she signed her name but tore off deliberately their names and kissing the torn bit put it in her bosom then throwing herself on her knees to her father and mother who stood together and presenting the paper to the former never let it be said that your child your clementina has presumed to article in form with the dearest of parents my name stands it will be a witness against me if i break the articles which i have signed but in your forgiveness my lord in yours madam and in a thousand acts of indulgence i have too much experienced your past to doubt your future goodness to me your intention my ever honored parents is your act i pray to god to enable your clementina to be all you wish her to be in the single life only indulge me your word is all the assurance i wish for i will have no other  they embraced her they tenderly raised her between them and again embraced her  i would not methinks sir said she turning to sir charles for the first time see the count of belvedere before all this company though i revere every one in it is the count in the house  he is in my study madam  will my mamma said she turning to her honor me with her presence  she gave her hand to sir charles and took mine  jeronymo followed her and sir charles led her into the next room too great solemnity in all this whispered the marquis to father marescotti she courtefied invitingly to mrs beaumont she also followed her  sir charles seating her and the marchioness by the young ladys silent permission went into his study and having prepared the count to expect a solemn and uncommon reception introduced him he approached her profoundly bowing a sweet blush overspread her cheeks you my lord of belvedere said she are one of those my friends to whom i am in some measure accountable for the rash step which brought me into this kingdom because it has induced you to accompany my brothers whom you have always honored with your friendship  forgive me for any inconveniences you have suffered on this occasion  what honor does lady clementina do me to rank me in the number of the friends to whom she thinks herself accountable  believe me madam   my lord interrupted she i shall always regard you as the friend of my family and as my friend i shall wish your happiness i do wish your happiness as my own and i cannot give you a better proof that i do than by withholding from you the hand which you have sought to obtain with an unshaken and my friends think an obliging perseverance quite through an unhappy malady which ought to have deterred you for many sakes and most for your own  my dear mamma throwing herself at her feet forgive me for my perseverance it is not altogether owing i hope it is not at all owing to perverseness and to a wilful resistance of the wills and wishes of all my friends that i have withstood you two reasons influenced me when i declined another hand religion and country a double reason was one the unhappy malady which had seized me was another two reasons rising with dignity and turning from her weeping mother also influence me with regard to the count of belvedere though neither of them are the important articles of religion and country i own to you before these my dearest friends and let it be told to every one concerned to know it that justice to the count of belvedere is one  what a wretch should i be if i gave my hand to a man who had not the preference in my heart which is a husbands due  and should i who had an unhappy reason to refuse one worthy man for his own sake perhaps for the sakes of the unborn i will speak out on this important occasion not be determined to do as much justice to another  in one word i refused to punish the chevalier grandison madam to me you know my story what has the count of belvedere done that i should make no scruple to punish him my good lord be satisfied with my wishes for your happiness i find myself at times very very wrong i have given proofs but too convincing to all my friends that i am not right  while i so think conscience honor justice as i told you once before my good chevalier compel me to embrace the single life  i have in duty to my nearest friends given up the way i should have chosen to lead it in  let me try to recover myself in their way my dearest dearest mamma again dropping on her knees to her i will endeavor to make all my friends happy in the way they have agreed to make me so pray for me all my friends  looking round her tears in big drops trickling down her cheeks then rising pray for me my lord of belvedere i will for you and that you may do justice to the merit of some worthier woman who can do justice to yours  she hurried from us in a way which showed she was too much elevated for her corporal powers sir charles besought mrs beaumont to follow her mrs beaumont took my hand  we found the lady in the study she was on her knees and in tears she arose at our entrance each of us hastening to give her a hand o my dear lady grandison said she forgive me  my dear mrs beaumont am i am i wrong tell me have i behaved amiss  we both applauded her well we might if her greatness be owing to a raised imagination who shall call it a malady who but for the dear ladys own sake would regret the nexttodivine impulse by which on several occasions she has shown herself actuated  she suffered herself to be led to her mother who embracing her clementina again kneeling to her my dearest child my blessed daughter we all of us while such are your apprehensions must acquiesce with your reasons be happy my love in your own magnanimity i glory in my child  and i in my sister said the noble jeronymo  saint angel kneeling to her on one knee notwithstanding his lameness i next to adore my sister  she called him her brother her true brother then taking my hand and will you lady grandison said she be my sister shall sir charles grandison be my brother will you return with us into italy shall we cultivate on both sides a familyfriendship to the end of our lives  i threw my arms about her neck tears mingling on the cheeks of both it will be my ambition my great ambition to deserve the distinction you give me  my sister my friend the sister of my best friend love him as he honors you and me for his sake as i will you for your own as well as his to the end of my life  sir charles clasped his arms about us both his eyes spoke his admiration of her and his delight in each angels he called us then seating us he took the counts hand and leading him to her let me madam present to you the count of belvedere as a man equally to be pitied and esteemed he yields to your magnanimity with a greatness of mind like your own receive then acknowledge the friend in him he will endeavor to forego a dearer hope  then will i receive him as my friend i thank you my lord for the honor you have so long done me may you be happy with a woman who can deserve you  see that happy pair before you may you be as happy as sir charles grandison  what greater felicity can i wish you  he took her hand on one knee he lifted it to his lips i will tear from you madam a tormentor i must ask nothing of you but for myself i can only promise in the words of the chevalier grandison to endeavor to forego a dearer the dearest hope  the count arose bowing to her with profound respect his eyes full as his heart seemed to be signor jeronymo motioned to return to the company lady clementina wished to retire with me till what had passed was related to the rest i led her to my closet there did we renew our vows of everlasting friendship  sir charles thinking the relation would be painful to the count withdrew with him into his study mrs beaumont and signor jeronymo told those who were not present at the affecting scenes what had passed  when we were summoned to dinner every one received lady clementina as an angel they applauded her for her noble behavior to the count and blessed themselves for having taken the resolution of coming to england and most of all they blessed my dear sir charles to whom they ascribed all their opening happy prospects and promised themselves that his family and theirs would be as much one as if the alliance once so near taking place had actually done so  sir charles at and after dinner urged the carrying into execution the latter part of his beneficent plan he offered to attend them to the drawingroom to the play to the oratorios and took that opportunity to give the praises which everybody allows to be due to mr handel and to every place of public entertainment which was worthy the notice of foreigners and left it to their choice whether they would go first to grandisonhall or satisfy their curiosity in and about town  the marquis said that as sir charles and i were brought out of the country by the arrival of their clementina and our expectation of them he doubted not but it would be most agreeable to us to return to our own seat adding politely that the highest entertainment they could have would be the company and conversation of us and our friends and that rather at our own seats than anywhere else the public diversions he was pleased to say might take their attention afterward now they were here they would not be in haste to return provided sir charles and his friends would answer the hope he had given of accompanying them back to italy  there is no repeating the polite and agreeable things that were said on all sides  well then my dear grandmamma to cut short thus it was at last agreed upon  the count of belvedere who all the afternoon and evening received the highest marks of civility and politeness from the admirable clementina which by the way i am afraid will not promote his cure proposes with signors sebastiano and juliano to pass a month or six weeks in seeing everything which they shall think worthy of their notice in and about this great city and then after one farewelvisit to us they intend to set out together for the court of madrid where the count intends to stay some months  we shall all set out on monday next for grandisonhall  lord and lady l will follow us in a week or fortnight  how will the poor dear charlotte mutter whispered lady l to me but she and her lord will join us as soon as possible  mrs eleanor grandison loves not the hall because of the hardships she received from the late owner of it sir thomas and thinks herself bound by a rash vow which she made the last time she was there never again to enter its gates and she will be delighted lady l says in attending in the absence of the fathers and mothers the dear little infants of her two nieces  lady clementina whispered me more than once how happy she should think herself in these excursions and hoped all their healths would be established by them she said the sweetest the most affectionate things to me once she said bidding me call her nothing but my clementina that she should be happy if she were sure i loved her as much as she loved me i assured her and that from my very heart that i dearly loved her  surely it was a happy incident my dear grandmamma that lady clementina took a step which though at first it had a rash appearance has been productive of so much joy to all round to the poor count of belvedere excepted and in particular to  your everdutiful evergrateful harriet grandison  letter xli lady grandison to lady g grandisonhall monday april   how happy my dear lady g are we all of us here in one another how happy is your harriet  and yet when you can come and partake of my felicity it will be still enlarged  i have just now received a letter from lucy the consents as you will see for i shall enclose it are a conversation that passed a few days ago at shirleymanor upon a subject of which you are a better judge than your harriet in short it is a call upon you as i interpret it to support your own doctrine by which in former letters you have made some of the honestest girls in england halfashamed to own a first passion you know how much i am at present engaged i would not have the dear girls neglected answer the letter therefore for me and for yourself yet remember that i do not engage to abide implicitly by your determination ever ever my charlotte  your most affectionate harriet grandison  letter xlii miss lucy selby to lady grandison inclosed in the preceding  thursday april   every hour in the day some circumstance or other makes me wish my dear lady grandison in northamptonshire emily charms us all  but still every object reminds us of our harriet not that harriet alone would content us now nor could sir charles and lady grandison be at this time spared by their noble guest after all therefore everything is best as it is but indeed we all wished for you yesterday evening most particularly at shirleymanor the conversation was an interesting one to all us girls and emily nancy and our cousin holless have brought me to give you an account of it and to appeal to you upon it and through you to lady g and yet we are all of us more than half afraid of a lady who has already treated but lightly a subject that young women think of high importance  the conversation began with my cousin kittys greatly pitying lady clementina describing in her pathetic way the struggles she had had between her first duties and her inclination the noble preference she had given to the former and the persecution as she called it of all her friends to induce her to marry when she chose to live single all her life every one of us young folks joined with my cousin kitty  but your grandmamma shirley could not she said perfectly agree with us in the hardship of lady clementinas situation who having from noble motives spontaneously rejected the man of her choice was from reasons of family convenience and even of personal happiness urged to marry a nobleman who by all accounts is highly deserving and agreeable and everyway suitable to her a man in short to whom she pretended not an aversion nor hoped nor wished to be the wife of any other man proposing to herself only the single life and having given up all thoughts of taking the veil  personal happiness cried out miss kitty holles can the woman be happy in a second choice whose first was sir charles grandison  and whom for noble motives she refused said my aunt selby remember that kitty and whom she wished to be and who actually is the husband of another woman  the girls looked at one another but mrs shirley speaking they were all silent  the happiness of human life my dears replied your grandmamma is at best but comparative the utmost we should hope for here is such a situation as with a selfapproving mind will carry us best through this present scene of trial such a situation as all circumstances considered is upon the whole most eligible for us though some of its circumstances may be disagreeable  young people set out with false notions of happiness gay fairyland imaginations and when these schemes prove unattainable sit down in disappointment and dejection tell me now kitty holles and speak freely my love she would not address herself to some of us for a reason i your lucy for one need not give we are all friends the gravest of us have been young tell us kitty your ideas of happiness for a young woman just setting out in life  poor emily answered only with a sudden blush and a halfstifled sigh but all the rest as with one voice cried out harriet our harriet is the happy woman  to be married to the man of her choice the man chosen by her friends and applauded by all the world  and so said mrs selby as there is but one sir charles grandison in the world were his scheme of protestant nunneries put in execution all the rest of womankind who had seen him with distinction might retire into cloisters  were men to form themselves by his example said emily no unfavourable hint for sir edward  there she stopped  besides said i my own case in view when our eye has led our choice imagination can easily add all good qualities to the plausible appearance but to give our hand where we cannot give a preference is surely madam acting against conscience in the most important article of life  a preference we ought to give my lucy but need this be the preference of giddy inclination no version presupposed will not reason and duty give this preference in a securer and nobler way to the man who upon the whole is most suitable to us it is well known that i was always for discouraging our harriets declarations that she never would be the wife of any other man than him she is now so happy as to call hers if as we all at one time apprehended our hopes had been absolutely impracticable the noble countess of d who gave such convincing reasons on her side of the question see vol v letter xviii would have had my good wishes for the earl of d so before him had not ill health been an objection would mr orme you all know that i wished but to live to see my harriet the wife of some worthy man a single woman is too generally an undefended unsupported creature her early connexions year by year drop off no new ones arise and she remains solitary and unheeded in a busy bustling world perhaps soured to it by her unconnected state is not some gratitude due to a worthy man who early offers himself for her guide and protector through life gratitude was the motive even of harriets inclination at first  nancy smiled why smiles my nancy asked your smiling grandmamma i am sure you think child there is weight in what i said  indeed madam there is  great weight  but just as you gave us an idea of the dreary unconnected life of a single woman in years i thought of poor mrs penelope arby you all know her i saw her in imagination surrounded with parrots and lapdogs  so springlike at past fifty with her pale pink lutestring and back head  yet so peevish at girls   and she resumed mrs shirley refused some good offers in her youth out of dread of the tyranny of a husband and the troublesomeness of a parcel of brats  yet now she is absolutely governed by a favorite maid and as full of the bonmots of her parrots as i used to be of yours my loves when you were prattlers  yet let us not said mrs selby with the insolence of matrons or bridesexpectant be too severe upon old maids lady g surely is faulty in this particular many worthy and many happy persons in that class have i known many amiable and useful in society even to their latest age  you madam to mrs shirley had a friend  mrs eggleton  i had my dear mrs selby  never has any length of time any variety of scene at all effaced the dear idea though she died many years ago she never married but that was not her own fault she was addressed when near twenty by a young gentleman of unexceptionable character she received his addresses on condition that both their friends approved of them she was a visiter in town the relations of both lived in the country the young couple loved each other but neither of their families when consulted approving the match to the great regret of both it was broken off the gentleman married and was not unhappy in three or four years another worthy man made his addresses to mrs eggleton all her friends approved she found him deserving of her affection and agreed to reward his merit he was to make one voyage to the indies on prospects too great to be neglected and on his return they were to be married his voyage was prosperous to the extent of all his wishes he landed in his native country flew to his beloved mistress she received his visit with grateful joy it was his last visit he was taken ill of a violent fever died in a few days delirious but blessing her  she and i have talked over the subject we are upon a hundred times in those days i was young and had my romantic notions  indeed madam said patty holles indeed madam said emily  dear dear madam said kitty holles if it be not too bold a request let us hear what they were  the reading in fashion when i was young was romances you my children have in that respect fallen into happier days the present age is greatly obliged to the authors of the spectators but till i became acquainted with my dear mrs eggleton which was about my sixteenth year i was overrun with the absurdities of that unnatural kind of writing  and how long madam did they hold  not till i was quite twenty that good lady cured me of so false a taste but till she did i had very high ideas of first impressions of eternal constancy of love raised to a pitch of idolatry in these dispositions not more than nineteen was my dear mr shirley proposed to me as a person whose character was faultless his offers advantageous i had seen him in company two or three times and looked upon him merely as a good sort of man a sensible man  but what was a good sort of man to an oroondates he had paid no addresses to me he applied to my friends on a foot of propriety and prudence they laid no constraint upon me i consulted my own heart  but my dear girls what a temptation have you thrown in the way of narrative old age  all of us most eagerly besought her to go on  the excellent mrs eggleton knew my heart better than i did myself even now said she you dislike not this worthy man you can make no reasonable objection to his offer you are one of many sisters we were then a numerous family  alas how many dear friends have i out lived a match so advantageous for you will be of real benefit to your whole family esteem heightened by gratitude and enforced by duty continued she will soon ripen into love the only sort of love that suits this imperfect state a tender a faithful affection there is a superior ardor due only to supreme perfection and only to be exercised by us mortal creatures in humble devotion my dear henrietta concluded she condescend to be happy in such a way as suits this mortal state  i replied to her with distress of mind proceeded mrs shirley that i could not depend upon my own sentiments i had seen little of the world suppose after i have vowed love to a man quite indifferent to me i should meet with the very one the kindred soul who must irresistably claim my whole heart i will not suspect myself of any possibility of misconduct where the duty and the crime would be so glaring but must i not in such a case be for ever miserable  the mild mrs eggleton did not chide she only argued with me often afterward did i with delight repeat this conversation to the best of men my dear mr shirley when a length of happy years had verified all she said  dear madam cried kitty tell us how she argued or we shall all remain on your side of the question  o my children said the venerable parent in what talkativeness do you engage me  i fear henrietta said mrs eggleton that though you are a good christian your opinions in this point are a little heathenish you look upon love as a blind irresistible deity whose darts fly at random and admit neither defense nor cure consider the matter my dear in a more reasonable light the passions are intended for our servants not our masters and we have within us a power of controuling them which it is the duty and the business of our lives to exert you will allow this readily in the case of any passion that poets and romance writers have not set off with their false colorings to instance in anger will my henrietta own that she thinks it probable anger should ever transport her beyond the bounds of duty  i pleaded that i was not naturally of an angry temper and was asked with a smile whether i meant by that distinction to own myself of a loving one  i could not be angry with my good mrs eggleton yet i remember i was vexed to the heart  but why then rejoined she should you think yourself more likely to fall in love after you are married than before  at least said i a little peevishly let me stay till i am in love as you are pleased to call it before i marry  i would not by any means replied she have you marry a man for whom you have not a preferable inclination but why may you not find on admitting mr shirleys addresses young agreeable worthy and every way suitable to you as he is that he is that man whom your inclination can approve  i never saw him yet said i with the least emotion i have no aversion to him i might esteem him but what is that to the love one is so solemnly to vow a husband and should i after that vow behold an object whom i could indeed have loved   a duke de nemours said she taking up the princess of cleves that unluckily lay on my table  ah my henrietta have i found you out  that princess my dear was a silly woman her story is written with dangerous elegance but the whole foundation of her distresses was an idle one to fansy herself in love with a mere stranger because he appeared agreeable at a ball when she lived happily with a worthy husband was mistaking mere liking for love and combating all her life after with a chimera of her own creating i do not tell you it is impossible for you to meet hereafter with persons in some external accomplishments superior to the deserving man whose wish is to make you happy but will you suffer your eye to lead you into misery then when an additional tie of duty forbids its wandering if so i must suppose it would equally mislead you now tell me henrietta what think you of those girls who blast all the hopes of their fond parents by eloping with a welldrest captain a spruce dancingmaster or a handsome player  she struck me dumb with shame  you see then my dear the filial duty the duty of a reasonable and modest woman were she even without parents or friends forbids fancy to be her guide as much as the sacred engagement of marriage forbids it to be her tormenter  but have there not been instances said i do not you and i know one we did in this neighborhood where a truly good woman was made miserable for years by having her heart and hand differently engaged  mrs eggleton reminded me that there were in that case such extremely particular circumstances as made it absurd to form from thence a general judgment in almost every thing said she we act but upon probabilities and one exception out of a thousand ought never to determine us even this exception in the case you hint at is owing in some measure to a pitiable misguided imagination let us take our rules my dear from plain common sense and not from poetical refinements  say my children said the condescending parent did my friend argue well  i think madam answered kitty she argued poor love out of doors she did not seem to allow the possibility of any persons being in love at all  i told her so replied my grandmamma  so far from it said she with a sigh and a look expressive of the softest tenderness that my own affections as you know were deeply engaged the amiable youth to whom i was to be united by marriage died his memory will ever be dear to my heart love authorized by reasonable prospects love guided and heightened by duty is everything excellent that poets have said of it yet even this love must submit to the awful dispensations of providence whether of death or other disappointment and such trials ought to be met with cheerful resignation and not to be the means of embittering our lives or of rendering them useless and every thing we ought to do be assured my dear we shall be enabled to do if we set about it rightly and with equal humility and trust as for that kind of love which in its very beginning is contrary to duty to suppose that unconquerable is making ourselves wretched indeed and for firstsight impressions and beginning inclinations though always dangerous and often guilty to indulge they are absolutely trifles to overcome and suppress to a person of prudence and virtue  how we dwelt upon every sweet document that fell from the lips of the dear mrs shirley  but now harriet for the appeals after all were you or were you not a romantic girl when you declared that you never would be the wife of any man living if you were not sir charles gaandisons even at the time when neither you nor we thought there could be any hopes of such a happy event   but had we not however better appeal to lady g than to you you were always so wise  yet you could not be contented with the worthy orme you knew instinctively as i may say that your kindred mind dwelt in st jamess square and lady g forty years hence will be looking back i suppose with wonder on the time when she gave her then fair hand of swanskin changed to buff her own slighty idea with reluctance to her deserving lord so perhaps we had best make no appeals at all if we did neither you nor she are at leisure now to answer them yet we have one appeal more to make but it must be to our harriet not to lady g  was not even our venerable parent a little too severe upon old maids that wicked nancy fell a laughing  does she know what may be her own case here is a great parcel of girls of us  have not i her elder been crossed in love already but if no proper match ever offers must we take an improper one to avoid the ridicule of a mere name an unsupported state is better than an oppressed a miserable one however and how many rashlychosen husbands and repentant wives could i set against nancys mrs arby  but the post is just going out so that far from entering on so copious a subject i have barely time to add that i am with the truest affection my dearest creature  your faithful lucy  letter xliii lady g to lady grandison thursday april    i am very well  what is the matter with the woman  i will write  fifteen days control and candle  why surely   they are impertinent my dear and would take my pen and ink from me   you do well harriet to throw upon me your selfcondemning task  how conscious you are when you tell me before you know my opinion of the contents of lucys letter that you will not subscribe implicitly to my determination  but i will not spare you in my condemnation of them read your own i have written my answer and shall enclose it and no more at present trouble myself about them  but here i charlotte g who married with indifference the poor lord g who made the honest man whenever i pleased foam fume fret and execrate the hour that he first beheld my face now stand forth an example of true conjugal felicity and an encouragement for girls who venture into the married state without that prodigious quantity of violent passion which some harebrained creatures think as essential of love  you my dear left us tolerably happy but now we are almost intolerably so i had begun to recover my spirits depressed as they had been for near a month before on finding myself like any common woman confined to my chamber while every other mouth sang o be joyful and one was preparing another was set out and half a score more were actually got to dear grandisonhall i bit my lip and raved at the wretch to whom i attributed my durance when yesterday after a series indeed of the most obliging and most grateful behavior that a man ever expressed for a present made him which he holds invaluable he entered my chamber and surprised me as i did him for i intended that he should know nothing of the matter nor that i would ever be so condescending surprised me as how ah harriet in an act that confessed the mother the whole mother  little harriet at my breast or at my neck i believe i should say  should i not  the nurse the nurserymaids knowing that i would not for the world have been so caught by my nimble lord for he is in twenty places in a minute were more affrighted than dianas nymphs when the goddess was surprised by acteon and each instead of surrounding me in order to hide my blushes was for running a different way not so much as attempting to relieve me from the brat  i was ready to let the little leech drop from my arms  o wretch screamed i  begone  begone whence the boldness of this intrusion  never was man in a greater rapture for lady gertrude had taught him to wish that a mother would be a mother he threw himself at my feet clasping me and the little varlet together in his arms brute said i will you smother my harriet  i was halfashamed of my tenderness  dearest dearest dearest lady g  shaking his head between every dear and est every muscle of his face working how you transport me  never never never saw i so delightful a sight let me let me let me every emphatic word repeated three times at least behold again the dear sight let me see you clasp the precious gift our harriets harriet too to that lovely bosom  the wretch trembling however pulled aside my handkerchief i tried to scold but was forced to press the little thing to me to supply the place of the handkerchief  do you think i could not have killed him  to be sure i was not half angry enough i knew not what i did you may well think  for i bowed my face on the smiling infant who crowed to the pressure of my lips  begone lord g said i  see see how shall i hold the little marmouset if you devour first one of my hands then the other  he arose took the little thing from me kissed its forehead its cheeks its lips its little pudsey hands first one then the other gave it again to my arms took it again and again resigned it to me  take away the pug said i to the attendants  take it away while any of it is left  they rescued the still smiling babe and run away with it  my lord then again threw himself at my feet  pardon pardon me dearest creature said he that i took amiss any thing you ever said or did  you that could make me such rich amends  o let not those charming charming spirits ever subside which for a fortnight together till yesterday i missed i loved you too well proceeded he to take any usage that was not quite what i wished it lightly but for some time past i have seen that it was all owing to a vivacity that now in every instants of it delights my soul you never never had malice or ill nature in what i called your petulance you bore with mine you smiled at me henceforth every thing you say every thing you do will i take for a favor o my charlotte never never more shall it be in your power to make me so far forget myself as to be angry  my dear lord g  i had like to have said  i believe i did say  then will you ruin absolutely ruin me what shall i do  for my roguery   never never part with what you call so   impossible my lord to retain it if it lose its wonted power over you i shall have a new lesson to learn o my lord why began you not this course before harriet and caroline set out for grandisonhall i might by a closer observation of their behavior have made myself mistress of lessons that would have far more delightfully supplied the old ones than can be done without their examples but my lord the time will soon come when we shall be allowed to fly to that benefit at grandisonhall our little harriet shall go with us the infant is the cement between us and we will for the future be every day more worthy of that and of each other  my lord hurried from me in speechless rapture his handkerchief at his eye  nurse said i bring me again our precious charge i will be all the mother i clasped it to my bosom what shall i do my little harriet thy father sweet one has run away with my roguery   what a scene is here  i will not read it over if it requires a blush do you my dear blush for me i am hardened  and shall not perhaps were i to reperuse it my maternity so kindly acknowleged so generously accepted by my lord g be able to blush for myself  but that i may seem only to have changed the object not wholly to have parted with my levity read the enclosed here in answer to the appeal of the young people directed thus  lady g to miss lucy selby and the rest of the girls at selbyhouse greeting you appeal to harriet and revoke your appeal you appeal to me and withdraw it in the same letter  a parcel of chits you know not what you would have what you would be and hardly what you are you can have the sauciness in more places than one to reflect upon me your judge but are you not convinced by the solid arguments of mrs shirley and her mrs eggleton if you are not what strange creatures are girls from sixteen to twentytwo dont boys read romances as well as girls yet in these latter days do the glaring absurdities influence them so much in lovematters or last so long foolish things would you give a preference against yourselves to the other sex  harriet i think was a romantic girl when she made her declarations of one man only or no one for a husband i did let her know my mind at the time by hints but had my brother actually married clementina not only i but her grandmother shirley and aunt selby and uncle too odd soul as he is in some things would have spoken out in favor of the young earl of d and had it not been with success after a proper time had passed i for my part would have set her down as a very silly girl inferior in this respect to you lucy and to twenty more i could name for how few of us are there who have their first loves and indeed how few first loves are fit to be encouraged you know my thoughts lucy of a beginning love in a young bosom vol vi p          a very very silly and childish affair believe me  let me enumerate a few chances that may render a first love impracticable  a young woman may fix her affections on a man who may prove persidious  on a man who may be engaged to another woman as had like to have been my brothers case  on a man who may be superior to her in degree or fortune or who may be greatly inferior to her in both  if love be not a voluntary passion why not upon an hostler a groom a coachman a footman  a grenadier a trooper a footsoldier  she may be in mrs eggletons case her lover may be taken from her by death in either or any of these cases what is to be done must a woman sit down cry herself blind and become useless to the principal end of her being as to this life and to all family connexions when probably she has not lived one third of her time  silly creatures  to maintain these nonsenses at their own expense in favor of a passion that is generally confined to the days of girlhood and which they themselves would laugh at in a woman after she was arrived at honest thirty or at years of discretion  thus narrowing their own use and consequence  i for my part am and ever will be a friend of my sex  but hark ye girls  let me ask you  do you find many of these constant nymphs when they have had their foolish way given them and they have buried the honest man of whom they were once so dotingly fond refuse to marry again  do they wish like the wives of some pagan wretches to be thrown into the funeral pile with the dead bodies of their lords  no they have had their whimsey out their fit of constancy is over and quiet good souls as they are by that time become they go on without rantipoling in the ordinary course of reasonable creatures  not but harriet was in earnest i am sure she was she believed she certainly believed herself and were it given to us women always to be in one mind she would have made all her friends the good mrs shirley at the head of us despair of succeeding with her in our endeavors to induce her to change it but harriet with all her wisdom could not know what time would have done for her time is the pacifier of every woe the qualifier of every disappointment  pity for the man the earl of d suppose  he would have thought it worth his while to feign dying for her the entreaty of her friendsyou see what arguments her excellent grandmamma could have produced  pho pho never fear but harriet would have married before my brother and clementina had seen the face of their second boy  no girls shall he have for fear they should be romancers  and do you think that clementina and the count of belvedere a year or two hence  i have no fear of the matter if they do not teaze torment oppose her if they do  why then i will not be answerable for their success for with excellences that none but she and harriet among women ever boasted there is a glorious perverseness which they miscall constancy and perseverance in the mind of that noble lady and indeed in the minds of most of us that will probably as it has already done carry her through all opposition  in short no more teazing tormenting from friends no more heroics from girls  is not opposition is not resistance the very soul and essence of all sorts of heroism  my life therefore for clementinas admirable creature as she undoubtedly is  leave her searoom leave her landroom and let her have time to consider and she will be a bride  did i ever mention to you a trick that an honest guardian put upon his ward many a one have you heard of from dishonest ones this briefly was it  the girl was of the heroic stamp as good a girl as an heroic girl could well be a match was proposed for her much more considerable than she could have expected as to fortune and as to the mans person and qualities of mind absolutely unexceptionable  young handsome gallant and most ardently in love with her but unpolitic he had let her know as much before he had made himself sure of the shadow of a return or acceptance her guardian from pure love of his ward and a sense of the advantageousness of the offer heartily espoused the interests of the young gentleman this was another unhappiness to him she gave him an absolute denial nor vouchsafed she to assign a reason for it having indeed no other man either in her head or heart  her guardian was a man who knew the world and a little of her sex he saw that miss was in the very meridian of her heroics and that the grievance most probably was that there was no likelihood of difficulty or opposition he took another course he acquainted the young lady that he had altered his mind that he had objections to the address of sir arthur poinings the young gentlemans name and declared that he never would give his consent he desired that she would by no means see him or receive letters from him and he talked of carrying her down to his countryseat in a full townseason the girl had a taste for pleasure  what girl has not not doubting he said that the young baronet would persecute her with his addresses while she remained in london he then actually forbid sir arthur his house and more than once read miss a lecture on the authority of a guardian and the duty of a ward words that naturally incite young girls to rebellion  sir arthur sound means to write to the minx as if unknown to her guardian darts flames and distresses were suggested in his letter the girl began to relent the guardian to suspect he renewed his prohibition cunning creature the affair now wore a face of difficulty she answered the young gentlemans letters it became a regular loveaffair of the heroic kind and at last  what at last  why the young lady attended only by her faithful delia who had been assistant to the lovers in their correspondence ran away from an inexorable guardian to sir arthur married him and in a few days writing an humble letter for her clothes acknowleged rashness which she laid at the door of love and soforth the guardian desired a meeting with the loveyers now no more loveyers but man and wife they met with trembling on her side with pretended apprehension on sir arthurs for having disobliged so good a guardian the guardian was in high good humor he forgave them both at the first word and surrendered up his trust with pleasure the girl was surprised at his unexpected goodness and had she not been actually nailed down by the solemnity would very probably have again resumed her heroics  well but i am charmed with mrs shirleys eggleton as well as with her account of herself in her heroic days little did i think that she ever was girl enough to be infected but as she says romances were the fashionable reading of her youthful years   tell aunt selby that i am not an enemy to old maids but only to those ill qualities which i should equally dislike in old or in young anybodies i love lady gertrude and even aunt eleanor for those qualities that are loveable in them but you see that your nancy the mild goodnatured nancy could not forbear laughing at the idea of the youngold penelope arby yet knows she not says the malicious lucy what may be her own case but i have appealed for you and to whom to lady gertrude i was writing to her on a particular occasion when your packet was brought me and in order to enliven my subject transcribed three lines of lucys query upon defending the single state she was but at enfield and returned me the following by the same messenger the other part of my letter requiring an immediate answer  your question my dearest niece is whimsically asked you tell me that a whole roomfull of young country ladies wait only the success of an appeal you have referred to me to know whether they shall out of hand dispose of themselves to recruiting officers mountebanks and foxhunters or venture to live on with the melancholy title of old maids in an unsupported undesended state  one or two queries to be put proceeds the sage are whether the worthy matches you have mentioned or any unsuitable matches whatsoever would be a support and defense whether the woman who makes a rash and improper choice does not throw herself out of that protection and defense which every one may depend upon in the state of life marked out to them by providence and whether the single state is not thus marked out to the woman who never has it fitly in her choice to change it  i my dear who am an old maid must not write partially on that side of the question in general i will fairly own that i think a woman is most likely to find her proper happiness in the married state may you my dear niece experience it every day more and more  but there are surely many exceptions women of large and independent fortunes who have the hearts and understanding to use them as they ought are often more beneficial to the world than they would have been had they bestowed them on such men as look for fortune only women who have by their numerous relations many connexions in the world need not seek out of their own alliances for protection and defense ill health peculiarity of temper or sentiments unhappiness of situation of person afford often such reasons as make it a virtue to refuse what it would otherwise be right to accept  but why do i write seriously to such a lively creature only my dear   but girls i will give you no more of lady gertrude i have not done with you myself yet  much to the same purpose i remember as mrs shirleys were the expostulations of lady d in one of her letters to harriet who only answered her i also remember like a girl what could she say  you my harriet wrote that lady are pious dutiful benevolent  cannot you if you are unable to entertain for the man who now with so much ardour addresses you were you married to him the passion called love regard him as gratitude would oblige you to prefer any other man who is assiduous to do you service or pleasure cannot you show him as much good will as you could any other man whom it was in your power to make happy would you esteem him less than a person absolutely a stranger to you the exertion of your native benevolence of your natural obligingness of your common gratitude of your pity is all that is asked of you you have no expectation of the only man who is dearer to you than he this exertion will make my lord happy and if you retain that delight which you have hitherto taken in promoting the happiness of others who are not undeserving yourself not unhappy  you have now before you girls the opinion of mrs shirley and the countess of d on the ease you put they both sit enthroned on the serene hill of wisdom which hardly one in fifty of their sex attains from thence they look down with pity and with beckoning singer to the crowds below them who with aching eyes and despairing hearts emulate their starry heights but in too faintly attempting to gain the ascent tumble down some shameful head over heels immersed in the miry puddles of sense and others taking a supposed more easy though visibly run roundabout way are misled by mazy paths into dreary deserts till they lose even the distant sight of the sacred hill  there chits i end romantically figuratively at least in compliment to your fanciful tastes and thus much as to you girls young ladyexpectants whimsicals and so forth from  your charlotte g friday saturday april       my women are so impertinent and my marmouset is so voracious that i have been forced to take two days for what once i could have performed in little more than two hours    letter xliv lady grandison to mrs shirley grandisonhall monday april    and must i my dear grandmamma be more particular in relation to ourselves our guests our amusements diversions conversations  why then does not lucy write as usual every tender every engaging every lively occurrence that happens at selbyhouse and shirelymanor is she so much taken up with her agreeable peer that she must leave the obliging task wholly to nancy and emily i dont care they shall be my best girls and i will put down my lucy as a woman of mere quality before she has the title yet let me tell her that could honest mr fowler have courted for himself have suffered his heart to rise to his lips i should have wished by her means to have been related to him and sir rowland but that matter it seems is as good as over and i will proceed to do my duty whether she does hers or not  i have told you madam how much our guests are pleased with us and the place how much we are charmed with them i need not tell you every praise you have heard of them is confirmed and heightened on a more intimate knowledge of them  lord and lady l are with us lord and lady g will come as soon as they can lady l has her sweet infant with her and i hope lady g will not come without my godchild  sir edward beauchamp is at present our guest the good doctor you know is at home here and how beloved how revered by every one  sir charles the soul of us all  o madam never surely was one spot blessed with so many persons of one mind as are now rejoicing together at grandisonhall  and pray my dear grandmamma let me ask would it not be affectation rather than modesty were i to leave myself unnamed in this noble circle i will not every body for sir charless sake looks on me with the kindest partiality and my heart tells me that being his as much as my own it deserves that partiality  except at certain devotional hours of retirement we know not but that we are all of one faith nothing of religious subjects is ever mentioned among us but in those points in which all good christians are agreed you madam who have a true catholic charity for the worthy of all persuasions would be delighted to see the affectionate behavior of the two fathers i will call them to each other when they are not in the general company they are always together walking riding out or in the apartment of each other reading conversing the dear clementina cannot but see that charitable and great minds however differing in some even essential articles of religion might mingle hearts and love each other and from sir charless catholicism that she might have been happy with him and kept her own faith  but no it would in her notion now i recollect have been a dangerous trial she could not trust her own heart  great and noble lady how much is she to be revered  the gentlemen ride out almost every day  our conversations it would be endless to give you an account of the conversations that yet i flatter myself would delight you all the least interesting ones of those we hold would have made a great figure in my former letters such the company you may suppose we know not what trifling subjects are  every one avoids mentioning the name of the poor count of belvedere in the presence of lady clementina yet we all pity him we have reason to do so from the account signor jeronymo receives of his distress of mind while he endeavors to overcome his hopeless passion  allow me madam to conclude this letter here we are to have a little concert this evening and our company is beginning to assemble in the musicroom  i must go and attend the marchioness and lady clementina who herself will be a performer she is an admirable one i can only stay to add that i am  your everdutiful harriet grandison  letter xlv lady grandison to mrs shirley grandisonhall saturday april    my dearest grandmamma will not complain that my three last letters these three letters do not appear were not filled with particulars of our engagements and conversations here what a scene of happiness what have i to pray for but the continuance of it except that the admirable lady clementina were somehow settled to her own liking and that her indulgent relations could be satisfied with it something seems to be wanting for her and therefore for them yet can a lover of her of her fame of her family say what that something should be i for my part ought to be the last who should decide for her i who never i think say lady g what she pleases of my romancings could have been happy with any man in the world but sir charles grandison after i had known him and once was led to hope for so great a blessing and who have not that notion that she has or seems to have of the dreariness and disadvantages of a single state on the contrary who think the married life attended with so many cares and troubles that it is rather as it is a duty to enter into it when it can be done with prudence a kind of faulty indulgence and selfishness in order to avoid these cares and troubles to live single but to leave this subject to the decision of lady g and lady gertrude the latter of whom has given some unanswerable hints on her side of the question i will proceed with my narrative  and here let me observe that had not lady clementina made her rejection of the best of men her sole and deliberate act it is my humble opinion that her loss of him would have been insupportable to her that consideration and her noble motive for it enable her to behave gloriously under the selfdeprivation as i may call it yet i can see at times by her studiously avoiding his company and frequently excusing herself from making one in little parties of sir charless proposing and by her choosing at all times my company that the noble lady thinks selfdenial necessary to her peace  she was once for putting jeronymo on proposing to leave england sooner than they had intended and take my promise to follow them i was present she had tears in her eyes when she proposed it we had been talking of sir charles in raptures on some of his noble charities which had but lately come to our knowledge and it was pretty evident to me that she at the time was of opinion that distance from him would be a means to quiet her heart  the dear emily finds it so thank god  lady clementina has been however tolerably cheerful since amusing herself with drawing up plans for her future life very pretty ones some of them but a little too ideal if i may so express myself and she changes them too often to show that steadiness which i want to see in her mind poor lady how i pity her as i contemplate her in her contrivances and proposals i am often forced to turn away my face that she may not see the starting tear  tuesday may   the count of belvedere being returned to london from a country excursion and not very well the marquess was desirous of making a visit to him and at the same time to pass a few days in london to see the curiosities of the place and to be present at some of the public entertainments the gentlemen at the first motion made a party to attend him and sir charles you may suppose would not in complaisance be excused dr bartlett and father marescotti who are inseparable had formed a scheme of their own and the ladies declared that not one of them would leave me  the gentlemen accordingly set out yesterday morning in the afternoon arrived here one of the most obliging of wives tenderest of mothers and amiable of nurseswho do you think madam  no other than lady g and her lord ungovernable charlotte her month but just up we have all blamed her we blamed her lord too for suffering her to come  but what could i do said he innocently  but they are both so much improved as husband and wife  upon my word i am charmed with her in every one of the above characters my lord appears even in her company now that his wife has given him his due consequence a manly sensible man if he ever had any levities of behavior they are all vanished and gone she is all vivacity as heretofore but no flippancy her liveliness in the main is that of a sensible not a very saucy wife entirely satisfied with herself her situation and prospects upon my word i am brought over to her opinion that if the second man be worthy a woman may be happy who has not been indulged in her first fancy and i am the rather induced to hope so for my emilys sake  tuesday evening mrs beaumont has received a letter from the ladies her friends at florence expressing their fear that the love of her country now she is in it has taken place in her heart and weakened her affection for them they beg of her to convince them of the contrary by hastening to them  this letter it seems mentions some severe reflections cast upon lady clementina by the unhappy olivia camilla who is very fond of me has hinted this to me and at the same time acquainted me with her young ladys earnestness to see it mrs beaumont having expressed to her her indignation against olivia on the occasion unworthy olivia what reflections can you cast on the admirable clementina  yet i wish mrs beaumont would let me see them  but dear mrs beaumont impart not to clementina any thing that may affect her delicate and too scrupulous mind  this overlively lady g has been acquainting lady clementina with emilys story yet intending to set forth nothing by it she says but the fortitude of so young a creature  she owns that lady clementina often reddened as she proceeded in it yet that she went on  how could she  i chid her for poor emilys sake for her own sake for lady clementinas for sir edward beauchamps sake  how could she be so indelicate is there a necessity dear lady g thought i as she repeated what passed on the occasion now you are so right in the great articles of your duty that you must be wrong in something  lady clementina highly applauded emily however a charming young creature she called her absence added she is certainly a right measure were the man a common man it would not signify presence in that case might help her as he probably would every day expose his faults to her observation but absence from such a man as sir charles grandison is certainly right lady g says it was easy to see that lady clementina made some selfapplications upon it  wednesday morning may   lady g has been communicating to me a conference which she says she could not but overhear between lady clementina and mrs beaumont held in the closet of the latter which joins to a closet in lady gs dressing room separated only by a thin partition the rooms were once one  a little of your usual curiosity i doubt my dear lady g thought i you were not confined to that closet you might have retired when their conversation begun but no curiosity is a nail that will fasten to the ground the foot of an inquisitive person however painful what she hears may sometimes make her situation  mrs beamont had acquainted lady clementina with the contents of the letter she had received from her friends at florence the poor lady was in tears upon it she called olivia cruel unjust wicked the very surmize said she is of such a nature that i cannot bear to look either lady grandison or any of her friends in the face for heavens sake let it not be hinted to any one in the family nor even to my own relations that olivia herself could be capable of making such a reflection upon me  my dearest lady clementina said mrs beaumont i wish   what wishes my dear mrs beaumont   that you would change your system  articles mrs beaumont articles  if they are broken with me i resume my solicitude to be allowed to take the veil that allowance and that only can set all right my heart is distressed by what you have let me see olivia has dared to throw out against me  allow me one observation only my dear clementina what olivia has hinted the world will hint it behooves you to consider that the husband of lady grandison ought not to be so much the object of any womans attention as to be an obstacle to the address of another man really worthy  cruel cruel olivia there is no bearing the thought of her vile suggestion none but olivia  say not the world olivia only mrs beaumont was capable of such a suggestion   for my own part interrupted mrs beaumont i am confident that it is a base suggestion and that if sir charles grandison had not been married you never would have been his you could not have receded from your former objections you see what a determined protestant he is a protestant upon principle you are equally steady in your faith yet as matters stand so amiable as he is and the more his private life and manners are seen the more to be admired must not your best friends lay it at the door of a first love that you cannot give way to the address of a man against whom no one other objection can lie  articles mrs beaumont articles   one word more only my dear lady clementina as the subject was begun by yourself  may it not be expected now that no opposition is given you you will begin to feel that your happiness and peace and strength of mind will flow from turning your thoughts on principles of duty so the world will call them to other objects and that the dwelling on those it will suppose you to dwell upon till your situation is visibly altered will serve only to disturb your mind and fill your friends on every instance that may affect it with apprehensions for you  you have said a great deal mrs beaumont but is not the veil the only possible expedient to make us all easy  articles articles my dear clementina i have been drawn in by yourself insensibly to speak my mind on this subject but i have no view no design your parents your brothers you see inviolably adhere to the articles but consider my dear were you even allowed to assume the veil that all such recollections of your former inclination as would be faulty in a married state would have been equally contrary to your religious vows would then the assuming of the veil make you happy  dont you hint olivialike mrs beaumont at culpable inclinations do you impute to me culpable inclinations  i do not neither do i think you are absolutely as yet an angel would you my dear refuse your vows to the count of belvedere or any other man for a certain reason yet think yourself free enough to give them to your god  will this argument hold mrs beaumont in the present case  you will call upon articles my dear if i proceed your silence however is encouraging what were just now your observations upon the story of miss emily jervois is there not a resemblance between her case and yours  surely madam i am not such a girl  o mrs beaumont how am i sunk in your opinion  you are not my dear clementina you cannot in anybodys miss jervois is under obligations to her guardian that you are not  is that mrs beaumont all the difference  that makes none i am under greater what are pecuniary obligations to the preservation of a brothers life to a hundred other instances of goodness  that girl my pattern poor poor clementina how art thou fallen let me fly this country  now i see in the strongest light what a rashness i was guilty of when i fled to it how must the chevalier grandison himself despise me  but i tell you mrs beaumont that i am incapable of a wish of a thought contrary to those that determined me when i declined the hand of the best of men o that i were in my own italy  what must young creatures suffer from the love of an improper object in the opinion of their friends if after the sacrifices i have made i must lie under disgraceful imputations from my gratitude and esteem for the most worthy of human minds  o how i disdain myself  it is a generous disdain my dear lady clementina i end as i began  i wish you would think of changing your system but i leave the whole upon your own consideration your parents are passive god direct you i wish you happy at present you will not yourself say you are so yet nobody controuls you nor wishes to control you everybody loves you your happiness is the subject of all our prayers  lady g believes the conversation ended here  lady l in mrs beaumonts presence has been just making me a compliment on my generous love as she calls it of lady clementina and my security in sir charless affection dear madam said i where is the merit a man of such established principles and a woman of such delicate honor they both of them move my pity and engage my love with regard to lady clementina this is my consolation that i stood not in her way that your brother never made his addresses to me till she on the noblest motives left him free to choose the next eligible as i have reason to think he allowed me to be and let me tell you my dear mrs beaumont that in his address to me he did her justice and dealt so nobly with me that had i not before preferred him to all other men i should have done it then  thursday may   i have received a letter from sir charles lady clementina and i were together when it was brought she seeing whom it came from and that i mediated the seal with impatience begged me to read it then or she would withdraw i opened it there were in it i told her the politest remembrances of her and the other ladies and read what he wrote of that nature she looked with so desiring an eye at it that i said were you to read it madam you would find him the kindest of men sir charles and i have not a secret between us but there are in it a passage or two relating to a certain gentleman that were you to read it might affect you by the way she reads english extremely well and is that lady grandison your only objection i should be glad to see were it not improper how the politest of men writes to the best of wives  i gave her the letter  she had greatness of mind to be delighted with his affectionate style  tender delicacy said she as she read  happy happy lady grandison tears in her eyes and clasping her arms about me let me thus congratulate you i acted right in declining his address i must have thought well of the religion of the man who could speak who could write who could act who could live as he does  i bowed my face on her shoulder to have expressed but half the admiration i had in my heart of her nobleness of mind would have been to hint to her the delicate situation she had been in and to wonder how she could overcome herself  what follows said she sitting down i presume i may read for my eye has caught the name of a man my heart can pity  she read to herself the passage which is to the following effect the person of the poor count of belvedere sir charles writes in the counts words is loitering in town endeavoring to divert itself there while his soul is at grandisonhall he cannot think of quitting england till he has taken leave of lady clementina yet dreading the pangs he shall feel on that occasion he cannot bring himself to undergo them  the marquess the bishop signor jeronymo all joined sir charles writes to console him yet wished him to pursue his better fortune at madrid and the count thinks of prevailing on himself to accompany them down in order to take this dreaded farewell sir charles expresses his pity for him but applauds the whole family for their inviolable adherence to their agreement  when she read to that place tears stole down her cheeks  agreement said she  ah lady grandison it is true they speak not but i can read their wishes in their eyes  she read on sir charless praises of the count for his beneficent spirit the count said she is certainly a good man  but is not his a strange perseverance then giving me the letter how few of us know said she what is best for ourselves there is a lady in spain of great honor and merit who would make him a much happier man than she can do on whom he has cast a partial eye and besides there is the poor laurana   she stopped i suffered the subject to end there  sir charles supposes it will be the latter end of next week before they return if the marquis holds his purpose of being present at a ball to which he is invited by the venetian ambassador  near a fortnights absence on the whole  o dear o dear  the following by lady g  and o dear o dear say i this is saturday and not a word more written so taken up with her walks and walkingmate  selfishs creature both it was with difficulty i procured a fight of this letter no wonder you see how freely she has treated me in it i told her it never would be finished if i did not finish it for her her excuse is sir charless absence and that you madam charged her not to write by every post lest an accidental omission should make you uneasy  ungrateful for indulgence given she must therefore let several posts pass  but get thee gone paper now and carry with thee all manner of compliments from charlotte g as well as from here sign it my sweet sister  harriet grandison  letter xlvi lady g to miss selby grandisonhall sat may   your complaining letter this letter does not appear reached me here lucy but this day i arrived here on monday afternoon ungracious harriet she chid me for coming but i went to church first what would they have  my lord and i are one now if therefore i say i arrived it is the same as saying he did my little harriet with us you may be sure  but what does the girl complain for maiden creatures should send us married women two letters for one establish for me this expectation you will soon yourself be the better for the doctrine  you tell me that hardly any of your girls are satisfied with my imperial decision on the appeal laid before me though supported by the opinions of mrs shirley lady d and every wise woman i dont care whether you are or not sorry chits you decide among yourselves and then ask for the opinions of others what for in hopes they will confirm your own if not to be saucy and reject them  you want me to tell you a hundred thousand things of what is doing what is done what is said here not i harriet is writing a long long letter to her grandmamma she tells me and journalwise meaning the preceding letter   let that when you have it content you she says i must not see it but i will something saucy about me in it i suppose  my brother and his principal menguests are in town they went on monday morning so i have not seen them  will not come back till friday next week harriet is impatient for his return o girls girls that a church ceremony can so soon make such a difference in the same person  but he is so generously tender of her that the wonder in her case is the less  lady clementina is a noble creature we are obliged to call both her and harriet to order or they would never be asunder the garden and park are the places in which they most delight to walk make harriet give you the particulars of their conversations  then i shall have them i have demanded them but she only acquaints me in general that she is delighted with lady clementinas part in them the other expresses no less admiration of harriets but besides that they rob us of their company too often which is ruder in the mistress of the house than in the guest harriet does not enough consider her own circumstances their walks are too long she comes in and throws herself sometimes into a chair  so tired  yet chidden for her long walks such engaging conversations she cries out  heroines both i suppose and they are mirrors to each other each admiring herself in the other no wonder they are engaged insensibly by a vanity which carries with it to each so generous an appearance for all the while harriet thinks she is only admiring clementina clementina that she is applauding harriet  well lucy  but i find you will not be lucy long  your day it seems will soon be fixed the day happy may it be which will set a coronet on your head a foolish kind of bawble after all but it looks not amiss on the outside of ones coach  if the inside contain not  did i say a monkey lucy but that will not be your case my lord knows your lord and esteems him lord gs esteem china and shells out of the question is not contemptible i can tell you his love for his flippant charlotte made him play monkeytricks which lessened him in my eyes but now i see he is capable of forgetting his butterflies and esteeming me i remember my promise and honor him obedience will come  when it can  well but lucy dr bartlett knew your lord reresby abroad and speaks well of him he has wished for this match ever since it was first mentioned nay before it was mentioned  ever since he was a brideman on my brothers happy day and you are a good girl that you have not paraded as harriet did and clementina does  have i any more to say i think not i will endeavor to get a sight of what harriet has written let her deny me if she dare if that suggests to me a subject which she has not touched upon well and good if not take it for a conclusion chits that i wish you all well and to our venerable mrs shirley and respectable aunt selby and her honest man health happiness and soforth  chapter g  letter xlvii lady g to miss selby wednesday may   i am afraid your brother james will terrify you all surprising  i am very angry with him for however slight he might make of what i have to tell you i know that none of you besides will i therefore dispatch this by a man and horse on purpose to set your hearts at ease  the wretch left her in a fainting fit had the dear creature ever any of these fits before but why do i ask this is easily accounted for she was oversatigued with a walk against warning against threatenings she and lady clementina had taken a longer walk than ever they did before quite to the end of the park to view some alterations which sir charles was making there they had forgotten that they had the same length to walk back again halfway on their return tired and each accusing herself and apologizing to the other they were surprised by a sudden shower of rain a violent one a thundershower no shelter they were forced to run for it toward a distant tree which when they approached they found wet through as they both were so they made the best of their way to the house were seen at a little distance making the appearance of frighted hares the servants ran to them with clokes which thrown over their wet clothes helped to load them as harriet entered the halldoor which leads into the garden she was surprised with the sight of sir charles entering at the other she expected him not till friday or saturday her complexion changed she sighed sobbed her cheeks her lips turned pale down she was sinking my brother was terrified but he caught her in his arms and saved her fall  lady l and i were together indulging ourselves with our little nurseries who were crowing at each other i singing to both by the way they are surprising infants when word was brought that my brother was come and lady grandison was dying how were we both terrified we in our fright each popt her pug into the arms of the other by way of ridding our hands of our own and the women being not at hand threw the smiling brats into one cradle and down hurried we to our harriet  in the midst of all this bustle this wise brother of yours lucy slipped away without taking leave of us what though his hour was fixed and his postchaise waiting could he not have staid one halfhour o these inconsiderate harebraind  dont be angry lucy he has vexed us for you i should otherwise have left to herself the account of her indisposition and recovery she has got cold so has her sisterexcellence as my brother justly calls her is it to be wondered at  she was feverish all day yesterday but made slight of it and would have come down to dinner but we would not permit her to leave her chamber  how was lady clementina affected she laid all at her own door and last night harriet being still more feverish we all talked ourselves into a thousand panies lady clementina was not to be pacified  today she is in a manner quite well and we are all joy upon it but she shall never again do the honors of the park to lady clementina trust me for that grandmamma shirley and expect a letter from the dear creature herself by the post adieu adieu lucy every body in a violent hurry subscribes  your charlotte g p s my hurry is owing only to the demands of my marmouset upon me to nothing else upon my honor for we are all safe serene and soforth    letter xlviii lady grandison to mrs shirley grandisonhall friday may    i am sorry my dearest grandmamma you have all been so much alarmed by an indisposition which is already gone off my cousin james foolish youth i wish he had not called upon us on his return from portsmouth or that he had staid at grandisonhall till now lady g has given you in her lively way an account of the girlish inconsideration which might have been attended with a fever had not mr lowther been at hand who thought it advisable that i should lose blood but it was the joy on seeing sir charles after an absence of eight days and several days sooner than i had expected that pleasure which overcame me  never never was there so tender so affectionate so indulgent a husband  lady g has told you that i fainted away  when recovered i found myself in his arms all our friends and guests assembled round me every one expressing such a tender concern  harriet be grateful but can thou be enough so how art thou beloved of hearts the most worthy  and what new proofs have thou received of that love of all other the dearest every hour do i experience some new instance of his tender goodness he stirred not from my chamber for half an hour together for two whole days and nights all the rest he took was in a chair by my bedside and very little was his rest yet blessed be god his health suffered not every cordial every medicine did he administer to me with his own hands he regarded not anybody but his harriet the world he told me was nothing to him without his harriet so amiably has he appeared in this new light not in my fond eyes only but in those of all here who are continually congratulating me upon it and every one telling me little circumstances of his kind attention and anxious fondness as some happened to observe one some another that though i wanted not proofs before of his affection for me i cannot account my indisposition an unhappiness especially as it has gone off without the consequences of which you were so very apprehensive  dear sir i obey you but indeed sir writing to my grandmamma does me good but i obey only let thus far as i have written be dispatched to my northamptonshire friends  from their everdutiful harriet grandison  letter xlix lady grandison in continuation sat night i have a constant attendant in lady clementina she was not to be consoled when i was at worst wringing her hands o that she had never come to england was her frequent exclamation and they apprehended that her mind would be again disturbed she has not yet recovered her former sedateness she gets by herself when she is not with me she is often in tears and wishes herself in italy sir charles is concerned for her she has something upon her mind he says and asked me if she had not disclosed it to me he wondered she had not expressing himself with pleasure on the confidence each has in the other  sunday may    signor jeronymo has been pitying to me the count of belvedere the poor man could not prevail upon himself to accompany sir charles and his noble guests down he owned to jeronymo that he had twice set out for grandisonhall but both times being unable to pursue his intention turned back  jeronymo told me that the count had made his will and left all that he could leave and his whole personal estate to their family in case he should die unmarried he would not leave it to lady clementina left if his bequests were to come to her knowledge she should think he was so mean as to expect that favor from his riches of which he had no hope from her esteem  the generous belvedere declares said jeronymo that should her malady be renewed by means of our interesting ourselves in his favor he should be the most miserable of men my dear jeronymo said he at parting in town tell that angel of a woman that i never will solicit her favor while i shall have reason to apprehend she has an aversion to me may clementina be happy and belvedere must have some consolation from knowing her to be so however wretched he may be on the whole but assure yourself jeronymo that i will never be the husband of any other woman while she is unmarried  i joined with signor jeronymo in pitying the count yet i must own that my compassion is still more deeply engaged for clementina but i was affected not a little however when jeronymo read a passage from a letter of the count which at my request he lest with me and which i english as follows  after his supplicatious put up to heaven for her happiness whatever became of him  but can she be happy says he in her present situation may there not be always a struggle between her exalted notion of duty and her passion though the noblest that ever warmed a human breast which may renew the disorders of her mind  were she mine  let me indulge for one moment the rapturous supposition i could hope to conduct to guide to compose that noble mind we would admire with an equal affection that best of men whose goodness is not more the object of her love than of my veneration jealous as i am of my honor i would satisfy the charmer of my soul that i approved of her sisterly love of a man so excellent she would not then be left to the silent distress of her own heart  what say my grandmamma my aunt my lucy shall i wish the noble clementina may be prevailed upon in favor of this really worthy man should i do you think be prevailed upon in her situation  a better question still  ought i  monday may    my cousin james has seen me and i have chid him too for having been so hasty to carry bad news to northamptonshire without staying a day or two when he might have carried better it is true they will not permit me to quit my chamber yet but that is rather for precautionary than necessary reasons and they have given over chiding me for writing  their indulgence to me of my pen will convince you that i am quite well  lady clementina most sincerely rejoices in my recovery yet she is every day more and more thoughtful and solemn she is grieved she tells her mother who is troubled at her solemnity for her brother jeronymo who indeed is not well mr lowther tells us that he must not expect to be exampt from temporary pains and disorder but i am sure the worthy man would be easier in his own mind were his sister to give her hand to the count of belvedere  i talked to sir charles on this subject an hour ago lady clementina my dear sir said i is not happy i question whether she ever will unless she is allowed her own way the veil  and that returned he has been so long a familyobjection that the compliance with her wishes would break the heart of her mother at least and greatly afilict all the rest it must not for their sakes be thought of  what then sir can be done  we must have patience my dearest life her malady has unsettled her noble mind she must try her own schemes and if she find not happiness in any of them she will think of new ones till at last she fixes nor i hope is the time far off  do you think so sir  dont you see my love that the poor lady is more and more uneasy with herself something is working in her mind i have desired her mother to leave that disturbed mind to its own generous workings her vehemence raised by the opposition she met with which she considered as a persecution has for some time subsided and she will probably fall upon reflections which she had not time to attend to before  jeronymo thinks proceeded he that i might successfully plead in the counts favor  but did i not draw the articles did i not propose the terms lady clementina shall not be prevaricated with she shuns me of late  in apprehension perhaps that i will try my influence over her she never seems so easy as when she is with my dearest love you must preserve that consequence with her which delicate minds will ever be of to one another some little appearances of her malady will perhaps nowandthen show themselves and unsettle her but i have no doubt if it please god to preserve her reason that her present uneasinesses will be productive of some great change in her schemes which may end in a tranquillity of mind that will make all us who love her happy meantime my dear let this be our rule if you please let her lead let us only follow  persuasion against avowed inclination you and i my harriet have always condemned as a degree of compulsion had the admirable lady been entreated to take the noble measure she fell upon when she rejected me however great the motives she would not have been so happy as she was when she found herself absolute mistress of the question and could astonish and surprise us all by her magnanimity  who could resist this reasoning how well does he seem to know this excellent woman when he considers her unhappy unfixedness occasioned by a malady which will nowandthen till she can be settled in some quiet and agreeable way show itself in her conduct when she has any great part before her to act  tuesday afternoon may    lady clementina soon after dinner sent up to me her camilia for i was not at table to desire a quarter of an hours discourse with me in my chamber i gave direction that nobody should come to me till i rang she entered saw me seated took her seat by me and immediately with a noble frankness in her manner thus began  i could not my dear lady grandison ask the favor of your ear on the subject i wanted to open my heart upon to you till i saw you were perfectly recovered god be praised that you are what anxieties did your late indisposition give me i accused myself as the cause of it  i had engaged you thoughtlesly in too long a walk you know how lady g how lady l were terrified i overheard them once that evening talking over their fears to one another lady g looked with visible unkindness upon me my aid ineffectual my person in the way i hurried to my chamber good god said i every object looking strange about me where am i what am i can i be the same clementina della porretta that i was a few months ago can i have brought misery to the family which was my only resuge to the man who  she paused then lifting up her eyes blessed virgin said she and is clementina in the house of the man whom she has been known to regard above all men and whom she still does regard but not as olivia supposes and then on my knees i offered up fervent prayers for your health and happiness and that it would please god to return me with reputation to my native country my eyes are now opened to the impropriety i have been guilty of in taking refuge in england and in remaining in it and in your house and with a man whom i am known to value the world had begun to talk cruel olivia she will lead and point the talk as she would have it believed i am under obligation to your goodness and to that of all your friends that they and you think kindly of me situated as i once was i am obliged mortifying consideration to a spirit like mine to sir charles grandisons generosity and compassion that he does not despise me a girl forgive me for mentioning it it is to you only has been by my dear mrs beaumont proposed indirectly at least for a pattern to me how am i sunk my pride cannot bear it had i been allowed to take the veil all these improprieties in my conduct had been prevented all these mortifications would have been spared the unhappy clementina  tell me advise me may i not renew my entreaties to be allowed to take the veil give me as to your sister no sister ever loved her sister better than i love you your advice counsel me what to do what course to steer to recover myself in my own eyes at present i hate i despise myself  with how little reason my dearest sister my excellent friend all my family revere you sir charles his sisters and i love you lady g particularly admires you she could not possibly look unkindly upon you what has olivia dared to report but did she ever forbear her rash censures  what can i advise you i see your delicate distress but suppose you open your mind to the marchioness to mrs beaumont suppose she is the most prudent of women  i know their minds already their judgments are not with me mrs beaumont indeed without intending it has terrified me my mamma thinks herself bound by the articles and will not speak  suppose my dearest lady you advise with sir charles you know he is the most delicateminded of men  i shall ever honor him but your indisposition has made me look upon him with more reverence than familiarity i have avoided him an exquisite pain has seized my heart on being brought to meditate the impropriety of my situation a pain i cannot describe here it used to be putting her hand to her forehead but here now it is removing it to her heart and at times i cannot bear it  let me beg of lady clementina to lay that noble heart open to sir charles you know his disinterested affection for you you know his regard for your glory you know that your own mother your own mrs beaumont are not more delicate than he is you may unbosom yourself to him but such is his fear of offending you that you must begin a small opening will do his nice regard for your honor for the honor of our sex will on a slight encouragement spare you all that would be irksome to you he has no prejudices in favor or disfavour of any body he loves it is true he reveres your whole family but you more than all the rest shall i say that he made his court to me in your name and by your interest yet acknowledged himself refused by an angel  excellent man  i will consult him and in your presence  as to my presence madam   it must be so interrupted she i shall want your support do you be my advocate with him and if he will be an advocate for me i may yet be happy at present i see but one way to extricate myself with honor i dare not propose it he may the world and olivia will not let me be in that world a single woman and happy  why should i not be allowed to quit it by a divine dedication  i embraced her soothed her but thought of sir charless advice not to lead but follow as she led not one word as i told her would i say to him of what had passed between us that she might have his own unprejudiced advice  i rang by her permission sally came up i made my request by her to her master he found us together sir charles said i before he could speak lady clementina has something on her mind i have besought her to consult you  i must consult you both said she tomorrow morning sir as early as will suit lady grandison we will meet for that purpose  may the issue of tomorrows conference be tranquillity of mind to this excellent lady  letter l lady grandison in continuation wednesday may    the conference was held in italian it was but just turned of seven in the morning when we met in my drawing room  i had told lady clementina that she must lead the subject but sir charles seeing her in some confusion relieved her  you do me madam said he great honor and it is worthy of our brotherly and sisterly friendship in proposing to ask my opinion on any subject in which you are interested our dear harriets recovery god be praised for it has left no wish in my heart so ardent as for your happiness permit me to say my dear lady clementina it is necessary for that of us both  indeed madam it is said i taking her hand tenderness love respect i am sure were in my countenance if it spoke my heart she condescendingly bowed upon mine tears were in her eyes you pain me chevalier you pain me madam by your goodness  how many of my friends have i made unhappy  for some days past said sir charles i have observed that you have seemed more uneasy than usual would to heaven it were in my power to remove the cause  perhaps it may ah chevalier i thought when i came into the compromise that i might have made myself happier in it than i now find i can be  dear lady clementina said sir charles and stopped  be not displeased with me chevalier i must hold myself bound by it if it be insisted on but though my condescending friends urge me not by entreaties by persuasions see you not that their wishing eyes and sighing hearts break every hour the articles agreed to  dear lady clementina  i knew you would be angry with me  i am not it would be equally unfriendly and insolent if i were but my dear clementina what an affecting picture have you drawn of the resignation of parents to the will of their child in an article which their hearts were fixed upon  add not weight sir to my uneasy reflections i can hardly bear to see in them the generous suppression of their own wishes  she then addressed herself to me  bear with me dear lady grandison if i cast an eye back to former situations you know my whole story  for a few moments bear with me  i never god is my witness envied you on the contrary i rejoiced to find those merits which i had not power to reward so amply rewarded by you and that the chevalier was so great a gainer by my declining his vows  she stopped  proceed dearest lady clementina said i  are we not sisters and do i not know that yours is the noblest of female minds  i rejoice sir from my heart that i was enabled to act as i did   again she stopped sir charles bowed in silence  but still i hoped that one day my parents would have been overcome in favor of the divine dedication that was always my wish till you sir induced me to come into a compromise and then i was resolved to make myself if possible happy in the single life allowed me but what can i do my former wishes recur i cannot help it and it seems evident to me that there is but one measure and that is the convent which can make me happy  dear lady clementino said sir charles will you be pleased to allow me   olivia sir interrupted she you dont perhaps know that reflects upon me it was indeed a rash step which i took when i fled to england how has it countenanced the excursion she made hither though god knows our motives were widely different hers was to obtain what mine was intended to avoid but your sudden indisposition madam pointed the sting and carried it into my heart that flashed full upon me the impropriety of my situation can there be say chevalier can there be any expedient which will free me from reflection from slander except that of the veil  you lead the question madam replied sir charles i but follow you surely there can  you are not angry with me chevalier you do not upbraid me with breach of articles  i do not madam while we only reason not resolve assure yourself that your tranquillity of mind is one of the principal objects of my daily vows say lady clementina all that is in your heart to say your friend your brother hears his sister with all the tenderness of fraternal love  how soothing how kind  you say there is another expedient what excepting marriage is it  were it that and that could be an acceptable expedient  we are only reasoning madam not resolving   do you chevalier with a look of impatience propose that to me  i do not madam  i said we were reasoning only  but surely you may be very happy in the single life you may have thought of plans which on consideration may not please you but it is yet early lady clementina has too much greatness of mind to permit anything that may be said by malevolent people to effect her she knows her heart and has reason to be satisfied with it were your former wishes to take place will not ill will and slander follow you into the most sacred retirements there are several tender points to be considered in your past situation these are considered by your parents they have no view but to your happiness you and they indeed have different notions of the means they think marriage with a worthy man of your own faith would tend to establish it you think assuming the veil the only expedient this subject has been much canvassed they are determined not to urge you yet their judgments are not changed shall they not be allowed to wish especially when they urge not speak not their wishes your father was earnest with the count of belvedere in my hearing when last in town to give up all expectations from you god preserve their lives till they see you happy you must be convinced that they are not so intent upon the means as to obtain the end  my father my mother are all goodness  god preserve their precious lives  tears trickled down her cheeks  i am sure my dear lady clementina you cannot be happy in any state of life if your choice pursued would make your parent unhappy  could lady clementina were she even professed divest herself of all filial of all family regards would not that very contemplative life of which she is at present so fond make her when it was too late to retrieve the step and with the more regret perhaps because it was too late carry her thoughts her affections with greater force back to parents if living so deservedly dear to brothers so disinterestedly kind to her and who have all shared so largely in her distresses  she sighed she wept o chevalier was all she said  you cannot madam live only to yourself for yourself and you may live to your god in the world perhaps more efficaciously than in the convent with regard to your souls health as you have such large ability to do good for wants not the world as i have heretofore pleaded such an example as you can give it  the heart madam not the profession is the truly acceptable your maternal grandfather though a sound catholic would have it that there were many sighing hearts in convents and on this supposition confirmed to him by a singular instance which affected him he inserted in his will the clauses which he thought would oblige you to marry your other grandfather joined in the enforcement of them  and what sir was the penalty only the forfeiture of an estate which i wish not for which none of us want we are all rich it is a purchased not a paternal estate  and purchased with what view madam and for whom  i would have my family superior to such motives  must they not my dear clementina be judges for themselves  i do not believe proceeded she that there are many sighing hearts in convents but if there were and my friends would be satisfied for that i own is an essential point with me i should not i am sure add to the number of such as to what you say of the world wanting such an example as i could set it i have not vanity enough to be convinced by that argument whether my souls peace could be best promoted in the world or in the convent must be left to me to judge who know that in the turmoils and disturbances i have met with both of mind and body the retired the sequestered life is most likely to recompose my shattered spirits  those turmoils those disturbances madam thank god are over  i pity i can forgive i do forgive the poor laurana ah sir you know not perhaps that love a passion which is often the cause of guilty meanness as sometimes indeed of laudable greatness was the secret cause of lauranas cruelty to me she hated me not till that passion invaded her bosom shall i remember the evil of her behavior and not the good  admirable clementina said sir charles admirable lady said his harriet both in a breath  she was the companion of my childhood proceeded the exalted lady we had our education together i was the sufferer thank god not the aggressor she has made me great by putting it in my power to forgive her let all my revenge be in her compunction from my forgiveness and from my wishes to promote her welfare  and a revenge indeed would that be said sir charles were she who had acted by an excellent creature as she has done by you capable of generous compunction but noblest of women can it be expected if you can forgive her that your family should join by giving up their reversionary expectance to reward her for her cruelty to their child who was entrusted to her kindest care and protection can you madam treat lightly those instances of your parents and brothers love which have made them resent her barbarity to you  my dear lady clementina you must not aim at being above nature remember that your grandfather never designed this estate for laurana it was only to be provisionally hers in order to secure it the more effectually to you and on failure of descendants from you to your elder brother who however wishes not for it his heart is in your marriage he only wishes that it may not be the cruel lauranas if you can defeat the design of your grandfathers with regard to your own interest ought you to do injustice to your brothers claim  o chevalier  ought you think of disposing of your brothers right has not he much better reason to be considered by you for his affection than laurana has for her cruelty  abhorred be that sort of love my dear lady clementina which is pleaded in excuse of barbarity or of any extravagant undutiful or unnatural action  she sighed tears again stole down her cheeks after a short silence  o spare me chevalier  despise me not lady grandison  my enfeebled reason may lead me into error but when i know it is error i will not continue in it i see that with regard to my brothers interest in this estate i reasoned wrong i was guilty my dear lady grandison i doubt in your eye of a false piece of heroism i was for doing less than justice to a brother that i might do more than justice to an unnatural relation  all that laurana can hope from you my dear lady clementina said sir charles is that you will entitle her to the receipt of the considerable legacy your grandfather bequeathed to her   and how is that to be done interrupted she but by my marriage  ah chevalier  such indeed is the state of the case such was it designed to be i madam but state it i advise nothing  still sir the motive which may allowably have weight with my friends ought not to have principal weight with me consider sir is it not setting an earthly estate against my immortal soul  far otherwise madam can you so far doubt of the divine grace can you so disparage your own virtues as to suppose they want the security of a convent do justice my dear lady clementina to yourself you have virtues which cannot be exerted in a convent and you have means to display them for the good of hundreds i argue not as a protestant when i address myself to you the most zealous catholic if unprejudiced circumstanced as you are must allow of what i say  ah chevalier how you anticipate me i was going to charge you with arguing like a protestant  did not your grandfathers madam in effect argue as i argue when they made their wills did not your father mother uncle brothers thus argue when they wished you to relinquish all thoughts of the veil and are not the one were not the others all zealous catholics does not your brother the bishop does not your truly pious confessor acquiesce in their reasonings and concur with at least not oppose the familyreasons  she looked down sweetly conscious sir charles proceeded  has not your mother madam who gave you and your three brothers to the world a merit both with god and man one of you dedicated as he is to god you see madam i address myself to you in the catholic style which the cloistered life could not have given her are not the conjugal and maternal duties performed as she has performed them of higher account than any of those can be which may be exerted in the sequestered life clementina would not wish to be a better woman in the convent than her mother has always been out of it  she hesitated sighed looked down at last what can i say said she i have signed to the waving of my wishes after the veil and must i see abide by my signing it is however generous in you sir not to plead against me that my act and to hear me with patience want to be absolved from it but i am not happy  she stopped and turned away her face to conceal her emotion  sir charles was affected as well as i  she recovered her speech i am at times said she too sensible of running into flight and absurdity my late unhappy malady has weakened my reasoning powers you both can i see you both do pity me let me say chevalier that when i came into your proposed compromise which after so grievous a fault committed as the flying from my native country and indulgent parents i could the less refuse i promised myself happiness in a situation in which i now see it is not to be found your friendship your united friendship for me happy pair i thought as i knew i deserved it by my disinterested affection for you both would contribute to it i was therefore desirous to cultivate it my wounded reason allowed me not to consider that there were improprieties in my scheme of which the world would judge otherwise than i did and when i heard of vile and undeserved reflections cast upon me but most when that sudden indisposition seized you my dear lady grandison and seemed to my frighted imagination to threaten a life so precious   she paused then proceeded  i have told you madam my reflections  before you chevalier i have said enough  and now advise me what to do  to say truth i almost as much long to quit england as i did to fly to it i am unhappy o my fluctuating heart when when shall i be settled  what madam can i say answered sir charles what can i advise you say you are not happy you think your parents are not so we all believe you can make them so but god forbid it should be to your own unhappiness who have already been so great a sufferer though hardly a greater than every one of your friends has been from your sufferings i plead not madam the cause of any one man i have told you that your father himself advises a certain nobleman to give over all hopes of you and that person himself says that he will endeavor to do so first because he promised you that he would and next because he is now too well assured that you have an aversion to him  an aversion chevalier god forbid that i should have an aversion to any hum n creature i thought my behavior to that gentleman had been such  she stopped  it was great it was worthy of clementina but this is his apprehension and if it be just god forbid that lady clementina should think of him  my dear lady grandison do you advise me upon all that has passed in this conference you assured me at the beginning of it that my peace of mind was necessary to your happiness  from my affection for you my dear lady clementina and from my affection only it is necessary you cannot have a distress which will not if i know it be a distress to me you know best what you can do god give you happiness and make yours the foundation of that of your indulgent parents they are of opinion that a settled life with some worthy man of your own country and faith will greatly contribute to it your mamma is firmly of opinion it will so is mrs beaumont you see that you cannot in justice to your brother and to his children yet unborn as well as in duty to your deceased grandfathers assume the veil you see that the unnatural laurana whom you still are so great as to love cannot enjoy a considerable legacy bequeathed her but on your marriage  if you have a dislike to the nobleman who has so large a share in the affections of all your family by no means think of him rejoice madam in a single life if you think you can be happy in it till some man offer whom you can favor with your esteem let me be honored mean time with the continuance of your love as i shall be found to deserve it we are already sisters in presence we will be one in absence we will not be divided for we will mingle souls and sentiments on paper   i was proceeding but she wrapped her arms about my neck she bathed my cheek with her tears  o how generously did she extol me how delighted how affected was the dearest of men how delicate was his behavior to both the tender friend in her the beleved wife were with the nicest propriety distinguished by him  the dear lady was too much disordered by her own grateful rapture to recover a train of reasoning she told me however that she would ponder weigh consider every thing that had passed  god give her happiness prays with her whole heart  your harriet grandison  letter li lady grandison to mrs shirley thursday may    lady clementina is thoughtful solemn and shuns company not one word will anybody say to her of the count of belvedere but as he is expected here everyday to take his leave sir charles thinks she ought not to be surprised by his coming at unawares she neither dined nor supped in company yesterday nor breakfasted with us this morning she loves as you have heard to walk in the garden she diverts herself often with feeding the deer which gather about her as soon as she enters the park sir charles just now passed her in the garden he asked after her health  my mind is not well chevalier  god almighty heal it said he taking her hand and bowing upon it  thank you sir continue your prayers for me that last conversation chevalier  but adieu  she took a path that led to the park he looked after her she turned once to see if he did he bowed and motioned with his hand as for leave to follow her she understood his motion and by hers forbid him  poor lady  thursday evening six oclock mr lowther returned from london about an hour ago he has always been of opinion with the physicians of italy that a disorder of mind not hereditary but circumstanced as lady clementinas was will be in no danger of returning or of becoming hereditary unless on some new distress like the former he expressed his wonder more than once at her relations acquiescence with her plea as she made that the principal against marriage though he allowed it to be a noble and generous one in her and now in order to justify his opinion he has taken of his own accord the opinions of the most noted london physicians who entirely agree with him  saturday may    lady clementina has been generously lamenting to me the unhappiness of the cruel laurana what i hinted to sir charles said she of her love for the count of belvedere is but too true i have been urged to have compassion as it is called on him he should have showed some for her she was proposed to him he rejected the proposal with haughtiness but i believe knew not how much she loved him i have faint remembrances of her ravings as i may call them for him to her mother and woman sometimes vowing revenge for slighted love  poor laurana was another olivia in the violence of her passion in the few lucid intervals i had when i was under her management i always expected that these ravings would end in harder usage of me yet even then when i had calmness enough to pity myself i pitied her o that the count would make her happy and could think himself happy in her   she asked me if sir charles were not indeed inclined to favor the count  he wishes you madam to marry answered i because he thinks and physicians of italy and england and mr lowther concur with your parents wishes if there were a man in the world whom you could consent to make happy the consequence would not only make your whole family so but yourself but the choice of the man he thinks should be entirely left to you he thinks that the count so often refused ought not to be insisted on and that time should be given you  let me ask you lady grandison as one sister to another could you in my situation have resolved to give your hand  she stopped blushed looked down i snatched her hand and lifted it to my lips  speak your whole heart my clementina to your harriet  but yet i will spare you when i understand your meaning noblest of women i am not clementina i could not situated as you once were all my friends consenting and the man  such as you knew him to be have refused him my hands as well as heart but what may not be expected from a lady who from a regard to her superior duties could make the most laudable passion of inferior force  you have already overcome the greatest difficulty and when you can persuade yourself that it is your duty to enter into new measures i am sure whatever they may be   dear lady grandison say no more  my duty  how delicate are your intimations  what a subject have we slid into  believe me i am incapable   of any thought of any imagination interrupted i that an angel might not own it would be an injury to your harriets emulative love of you were you but to suppose any assurances of your greatness of mind necessary  but i am at times pained generous lady grandison for what your friends may think may wish  o that i were in my own country again  they wish for nothing but your happiness lay down your own plan dear lady chalk out your future steps look about you one two three years in the single life assure your indulgent parents   hush hush hush hush my dear lady grandison gently putting her hand on my mouth i will i must leave you  o my fluctuating heart  but whatever i shall be enabled to do whosesoever displeasure i may incur do you continue to love me still call me sister and through you let me call sir charles grandison my brother and then shall i have a felicity that will counter balance many infelicities  she hurried from me not staying to hear the affectionate assurances of my admiring love that were bursting my lips from a heart fervently desiring to comply with every wish of hers  sunday may  0 the marquis is slightly indisposed the marchioness is not well lady clementina applying to mrs beaumont for consolation on the occasion owned that were their indispositions to gather strength she should be too ready for her peace of mind to charge them to her own account mrs beaumont generously consoled her without urging one syllable in favor of the man who has so large an interest in the hearts of all her family her own excepted she herself mentioned with approbation to mrs beaumont some particulars of the counts munificence and greatness of mind that had come to her knowledge but wished he could think of her cousin laurana her camilla came in she asked with anxious duty after her mothers health and withdrew in tears to attend her  monday may    well but now i charlotte g who have taken up harriets pen say these tears will soon be dried up the marquis and his lady are both better the count is arrived signors juliano and sebastiano with him did you not see the count when he was in town lucy a pretty man upon my life were he not quite so solemn but that very solemnity will make for him with the fair romancer is he not come as lee says in his theodosius   to take eternal leave not to vouchsafe to see him would be scorn which the fair soul of gentle clementina could never harbor accordingly on his arrival not unsent to but almost unnexpected down she came to tea and with such a grace  indeed my dear and venerable mrs shirley she will be a good girl all will come right she was a little solemn indeed in her serenity but she plainly put herself forward to speak she seemed to pity the counts confusion who poor soul knew not how to speak to her and relieved it by enquiring after his health as he had not been well she addressed herself to him once or twice on indifferent subjects and pleased everybody by her behavior to him nay they talked together a good while at the window he and she and mrs beaumont very freely about england and italy comparing in a few instances these gardens with those of the marquis at bologna no very interesting conversation indeed but the good count thought himself in paradise yet he fears he shall tomorrow be allowed to take a long long leave of her he goes to france and italy not to spain i like him for that it would only be distressing himself further he says were he to amuse a worthy family who have invited him thither with a view that can never be answered while clementina remains unmarried  my brother continues to insist upon it that not one word shall be said in the counts favor searoom and landroom mrs shirely as i said once before  where did he learn so thoroughly to understand the perverseness of a female heart  by lady grandison you see my grandmamma what lady g has written her sweetly playful pen may divert you her heart feels not as mine does the perplexities of the de r clementina but i yield with grateful pleasure to a pen so much more lively than that of  your harriet grandison  letter lii lady g to miss selby tuesday may    and so lucy your day is fixed may next thursday be a happy one and reward the heroic girl who so nobly conquered a first love on the discovered unworthiness of the man and you own that your heart is far from being indifferent to lord reresby  good girl  confirmation of all my doctrines we women prate and prate of what we can and what we cannot what we ought and what we oughtnot to do but none of us staytillweareasked mortals know what we shall or can do till we are tried by the power of determining being put into our hands was it possible for me to have loved that sorry wretch anderson so well as i really love my honest lord g it was not but though i name that creature myself never do you presume to do it i blush even to this hour at looking back to certain giddinesses that debased my character  but let me quit a subject so disagreeable  lady clementina has had a bad night it seems  came not down to breakfast the poor enamore to was in despair i tried to hearten him up a little but my brother will not let any body flatter him with a hope that too probably may end in disappointment  yonder i am writing at my window you must know is the fair inflexible musing in the garden i have a good mind to call to her for i see by her motions and downcast looks that resverie is no favorable sign for the count  no need of my calling to her my prother has this minute joined her as soon as he came in sight she went to him  now dear brother put in a word for the poor man  well but lucy this lord of yours must come among us he snall not carry you to ireland this year let all who would be good husbands and good wives come to grandisonhall and learn and pray let them come while i am here yet i have something to say against our harriet too  she is so taken up with her heroic friendship that clementina is now almost the only subject of her pen what godlike instances of my brothers goodness does she leave untold though she admires him for them as much as ever every rising every setting fun are witnesses of his divine philanthropy i suppose she looks upon his praises now to be her own well she may never were hearts so united so formed for one another but harriet used to praise herself formerly did she not uncle selby  believe me i will praise my honest man whenever he gives me cause for instance yesterday i was well enough pleased with what he said to my brother  you sir charles ought not to give yourself up to a private life your country has a claim upon such a character as yours  without doubt said i  shall we mylord make my brother an ambassador or a justice of peace lord g rubbed his forehead but seeing me smile his countenance brightened up dont you know charlotte said my brother that nothing but the engagements our noble guests have given me would have prevented me from acting in the useful character you have last named  o that you had brother what admirable causes would then have been brought before us en dernier ressort how delightfully would your time have been taken up with the appeals of scolding wives forsaken damsels and witches presumptive  l die g most be herself whatever be the subject replied sir charles you and i love her my lord for her charming vivacity but think you my sister that a day spent in doing good be the objects of it ever so low is not more pleasing to reflect upon than a day of the most elegant indulgence would persons of sense and distinction myself out of the question more frequently than they do undertake the task it would be lighter to every one and would keep the great power vested in this class of magistrates and which is every year increasing out of mean and mercenary hands and surely men of consideration in the world owe it to their tenants and neighbors and to those of their fellow creatures to whose industry they are obliged for their affluence to employ in their service those advantages of rank and education which make it perhaps easy for them to clear up and adjust in half an hour matters that would be of endless perplexity and entanglement to the parties concerned  mind this uncle selby for i think you are too fond of your own ways and your own hors to do your duty as an active justice though of the quorum  but i should have told you lucy how this conversation began i got the occasion for it out of dr bartlett af erwards you must know that i visit him now and then as harriet used to do to learn some of my brothers good deeds that otherwise would not come to our knowledge by which i understand that notwithstanding he gives his guests so much of his company and appears so easy and free among us yet that every beneficent scheme is going on not one improvement stands still he knows not what it is to be one moment idle  dr bartlett tells me that some gentlemen of prime consideration in the county have been offering my brother their interest against the next election he modestly acknowleged the grateful sense he had of the honor done him but declined it for the present as having been too little a while returned into his own country after so long an absence to be as yet fit for a trust so important we young men said he are apt to be warm when we have not studied a point thoroughly we act upon hasty conclusions and sometimes support sometimes oppose on insufficient grounds i would not be under engagements to any party neither can i think of contributing to destroy the morals and health of all the country people round me to make myself what is called an interest forgive me gentlemen i mean not to slight your favors but on such an occasion i ought to be explicit  but after the gentlemen were gone there is a county dr bartlett said he of which i should be ambitious to be one of the representatives had i a natural interest in it because of the reverence i bear to the good man to whom in that case i should have the honor to call myself a colleague when i can think myself more worthy than at present i am of standing in such a civil relation to him i shall consider him as another gamaliel at whose feet so long absent as i have been from my native country i shall be proud to be initiated into the service of the public  it is not difficult to guess who my brother  but my marmouset is squalling for me and i must fly to silence it  now lucy that i have pacified my brat do i wish you with me at my window my brother and his harriet only at this instant walking almost under it engaged in earnest conversation seemingly how pleasing a one admiration and tenderness mingled in his looks in her while he speaks the most delighted attention when she answers love affiance modest deference benevolence compassion an expression that no pen can describe  knowing them both so well and acquainted with their usual behavior to each other i can make it all out she is pleading i am sure for clementina charming pleader  yet my dear mrs shirley i fear her reasonings are romantic ones our harriet you know was always a little tinctured with heroism and she goes back in her mind to the time that she thought she could never be the wife of any other man than my brother though then hopeless that he could be hers and supposes clementina in the same situation  when i looked first i dare say he was giving her an account of the conversation that passed an hour ago between him and clementina he had his arm round her waist sometimes pressing her to him as they walked sometimes standing still and on her replies raising her hand to his lips with such tender possion  but here she comes  harriet if i am a witch let lucy know it here  read this last paragraph  have i guessed right at your subject of discourse  you will tell me you say in a letter by itself  do so  letter liii lady grandison to miss selby in continuation of lady gs subject  you need not be told my dear lucy that our charming lady g is mistress of penetration your happy harriet had been engaged in the most pleasing conversation the best of husbands conceals not from her one emotion of his excellent heart he is greatly distressed for clementina it would be unworthy of his character if he were not yet he seems to think she may be happy with the count of belvedere that is the point we have been debating as sir charles would have been the man of her choice but for an invincible obstacle is it not owing partly to his delicate modesty that he thinks she may be so what think you lucy  lady g says i make clementinas case my own be it so because so it ought to be could i have been happy with lord d  call it romantic if you please lady g i think it impossible that i could even though i could not form to myself that sir charles grandison himself would make the tender the indulgent husband he makes to the happiest of women  sir charles gave me the particulars of the conversation that passed between him and lady clementina in the garden he observed that she is not a stranger to the counts resolution never to marry while she remains unmarried and that it is the intention of that nobleman to return to italy and not go to spain at all perhaps she had her information either from camilla or laura who both heard him declare as much if she has condescended to hear them talk on a subject which every body else has studiously avoided she may also have heard from them many other particulars greatly to the counts honor for they are his admirers and wellwishers  sir charles believes she will take a gracious leave of the count before he sets out  the solemn the parting interview was to have been in my drawing room this afternoon but lady clementina has given the count an unexpected and joyful reprieve  she dined in company we were all charmed with her free and easy deportment as well to the count as to everybody else his was not so easy he intending to bespeak the favor of half an hours audience of her in order to take leave of her when she arose from table was in visible agitations how the poor man trembled with what awe with what reverence as he sat did he glance toward her how did everybody pity him and by their eyes beseech her pity for him yet in the same moment our eyes fell under hers as she looked upon each person we all seeming unwilling to have her think we entreated for him by them i thought i read in her lovely countenance more than once compassion for him yet the breath hardfetched as often showed a sigh suppressed that indicated i imagined a wish also suppressed after a life more eligible to her than the nuptial  at last when we women arose from table he as a man who must address her in haste or be unable at all to do it slept toward her retreated when near her as irresolute and again advancing profoundly bowing madam madam said he hesitatingly  putting out his hand as if he would have taken hers but withdrawing it hastily before he touched it  i hope  i beg  allow me  i beseech you  one parting moment  she pited his confusion my lord said she we see  tomorrow in the afternoon allow me madam  me  she courtesied to him and withdrew with some little precipitation but with a dignity that never forsakes her  every man it seems congratulated the count every woman when withdrawn with her clementina the marchioness folded her to her maternal bosom  my daughter my beloved daughter my clementina was all she said tears trickling down her cheeks  o my mamma kneeling affected by her mothers tears  o my mamma  was all the daughter could say and rising took mrs beaumonts hand and retired with her to her own apartment  we see her now in the garden with that excellent woman arm in arm in earnest talk as we sit by the window  wednesday night and now my grandmamma a word or two of

whole heart was captivated by his perfections by his greatness of mind that was all may not a creature though ever so young admire a good mans goodness may she not have a deep sense of gratitude for kindness conferred that gratitude may indeed as she grows up engage her too deeply and i found myself in danger but made my escape in time thank god  and thank you who assisted me  what an excellent lady are you that one can speak to you of these tender matters but you are the queen of our sex and sit inthroned holding out your scepter in pity to one poor girl and raising another and another for

almostunerring counselors my grandmamma and aunt selby dont be ashamed to open your heart to them are you not under their wings i will so manage that they shall lead the way to your freedom with them your difficulties by this means will be lessened sir charles will pay the greatest attention to their advice but yet i must insist that the reference to them shall not deprive of my emilys confidence  her everaffectionate sister and faithful friend and servant harriet grandison  letter lvi lady grandison to mrs shirley thursday may    i begin this letter as i ended my last to lucy  may this day be a happy one to her and then it will be so to us all  my dear aunt selby will be so good as to favor me with a line to acquaint me with the actual celebration that i may ground upon in my earliest felicitations  i will proceed with an account of what so much engages the attention of every one here  i told you in one of my former that lady g had shown to mrs beaumont lucys account of the conversation held at shirleymanor on the subject of a first love with lady gs sprightly decision upon it and upon the appeal made to me  i must now tell you that mrs beaumont prevailed upon lady clementina to desire me to read it to her she made her request and i obeyed mrs beaumont was present not a word by way of application did either she or i suggest when i had done reading lady clementinas complexion often changed as i read she was not at all diverted with those lively parts of lady gs decision that i ventured to read though she is an admirer of her sprightly vein she looked down most of the time in solemn silence and at last when i had ended she sighing started as if from a resverie arose courtesied and withdrew not having once opened her lips on the subject  the bishop signor jeronymo and the two young lords just now joined to request sir charles to become avowedly an advocate for the count to lady clementina they urged that she was ballancing in his favor and that sir charless weight would turn the scale but sir charles not only desired to be excused but begged that she might not be solicited by anybody on that subject  may she not asked he by reasoning with herself and considering what she can do with justice to the count and herself her future peace of mind is concerned that her determination now shall be all her own leave her no room for afterregret for having been persuaded against her mind if persuasion only is wanting will she not wrap herself up in reserve to keep herself in countenance for not having been persuaded before  pursuant to this advice the marchioness in a conversation with her beloved daughter that might have led to the subject on which their hearts are fixed declined it saying whatever my child shall determine upon with regard to any plan for her future life let her whole heart be in it her choice shall be ours  thursday afternoon lady clementina excused herself from breakfasting with us but obliged us with her company at dinner at and after dinner sir charles directed himself to all the company in turn in his usual agreeable manner how does his benign countenance always shine when he finds himself surrounded at table by his friends the larger the circle the more diffused is his cheerfulness with what delight does his jeronymo meditate his every graceful motion he dwells upon what he says and by his eyes cast with less complaceney on an interrupter seems to wish every one silent when sir charless lips begin to open  after he had gone round his ample table saying something obliging to all in a manner calling forth every one to say something in his or her own way he addressed himself more particularly to the count and led him into subjects both learned and familiar in which he knew he could shine and in which he d d it was doubly kind in sir charles to do so for the poor mans reverence for the mistress of his fate had taken all courage from his love and he wanted to be drawn out never can bashful merit appear to so much advantage as in sir charless address to it  how much soul did lady clementina show in her eyes she was very attentive to every one that spoke she asked the count questions more than once on some of the subjects he was led to talk of my eyes as i could feel glistened when she did to see how those of her father and mother rejoiced as i may say on the notice she took of him lady clementina could not but observe how delightfully her complaisance to the count was received by all her family  is it possible thought i more than once were i in the situation of this admirable lady to avoid obliging such indulgent parents with the grant of all their wishes that depended on myself having given up voluntarily the man i preferred to all others  signor sebastiano dropped a hint once of his own and the counts and signor julianos intention of setting out mentioning a care for their baggage which by this time he supposed had reached dover but clementina turning an attentive ear to what he said sir charles was afraid she would take this hint as a design to hasten her resolution and said we will not sadden our hearts with the thoughts of parting with any of our friends  thursday evening eight oclock a letter is this moment brought from town by an especial messenger to signor jeronymo the whole family lady clementina excepted are got together upon the contents  ten oclock the marchioness just now taking my hand tears starting in her eyes ah madam said she the poor wretch laurana  just then the bishop and father marescotti entering she put the letter into my hand i shall enclose a translation of it  to signor jeronymo della porretta may   n s the dear perverse clementina may be now indulged if she has not from principles of gratitude already yielded to give her hand to our belvedere i hope she has one of our motives for urging her is at an end laurana is no more her mother kept from her as long as she could the news of the counts accompanying you all to england but when she was told that he was actually in that kingdom and that my sister was heard of she doubted not but the consequence would be the defeating of all her hopes with regard to him a deep melancholy first seized her that was succeeded by raving fits and it is suspected that the poor creature eluding the care of her attendants came to a miserable end lady sforza is inconsolable a malignant fever is given out  so let it pass  she whom the wretched creature most cruelly used will shed a tear for the companion of her childhood but who else besides her own mother will  yet if the manner of her quitting life were as shocking as it is whispered to me it was  but i will not enquire further about it for fear i should be induced to show compassion for a wretch who  not any to show to a near relation entrusted to her care and who had a right to her kindest treatment  what a glorious creature as you paint him as fame as father marescotti and you a l report him is your grandison your sisterinlaw must i believe be complied with ever since you all left italy she has been earnest to attend you in england she even threatens to steal from her husband if he consent not and now clementina has shown her the way procure a passage thither to try my love in following her as that naughty girl has all yours in a season  but what is the inclemency of season what are winds mountains seas to a woman who has set her heart on an adventure this i must allow in her favor if she should fly from me it will be to the father mother brothers from whom her sister fled  naughty naughty clementina can i forgive her yet if her parents do what have i to say  i do assure you jeronymo that i unfeignedly join with you in your joy that so deserving a man is not a loser by a disappointment that we all know sat heavily upon him at the time i even long to see upon one spot two women who are capable of showing as they have shown a magnanimity so very rare in the sex one of whom let me glory is my sister but clementina ever was one of the most generous however in some points unpersuadable of human creatures  let belvedere know how much i love him whatever be his fate with one of the perversest yet noblestminded of women i will ever look upon him as my brother  reverence duty love and the sincerest compliments distribute as due my dear jeronymo from  your giacomo   letter lvii lady grandison to mrs shirley friday may    unhappy laurana sir charles expressed great concern for the manner of her death how can you brother said lady g when we three only were together be concerned for so execrable a wretch  shall a human creature perish replied he and its fellow creature not be moved shall an immortal being fix its eternal state by an act dreadful and irreversible by a crime that admits not of repentance and shall we not be concerned this indeed was owing to distraction but how ill was such a soul as lauranas prepared to rush into eternity  unhappy laurana  it is not thought fit for obvious reasons to acquaint clementina with the contents of the generals letter  at last my dear grandmamma the great point seems to be decided lady clementina had for some time been employing herself in drawing up in two opposite columns the arguments for and against her entering into the marriagestate she showed them to me and afterward to mrs beaumont but would not allow either of us to take a copy she has stated them very fairly i could not but observe to her on which side the strength lay  this morning she gave us her company at breakfasttime for a few minutes only she was in visible emotions and seemed desirous of getting the better of them but was unable and therefore retired she shut herself up and about noon sent sealed up a letter which i will english as well as i can thus directed  to her everhonoured everindulgent father and mother clementina della porretta how did my whole soul aspire after the veil  insuperable obstacles having arisen against the union of your child with one exalted man how averse was i to enter into covenant with any other  it was your pleasure my lord it was yours madam that i should not be indulged in the aspiration you had the goodness to oblige me in my averseness  the chevalier grandison has since convinced me by generous and condescending reasonings that i could not in duty to the will of my two grandfathers and in justice to my elder brother and his descendants renew my wishes after the cloister i submit  but now what is to be done what can i do to make you my dearest parents and my brothers happy olivia triumphs over me my situation is disagreeable i who ought to be a comfort to my friends have been i still am a trouble to them all  the chevalier grandison and his excellent lady have signified to me more than once that they expect from me the completion of their earthly happiness and what is this life but a short a transitory passage to a better  have i not declined accepting the vows of the first of men the only man i ever saw with a wish to be united to him decline them on motives that all my friends think do me honor  have i ever dear as the struggle cost me repented the glorious self denial and what precedents of selfdenial wholly yours by laws divine and human as i am have you my ever indulgent parents set me  is there a man i would prefer to him whom my friends are solicitous to commend to my favor  cannot i in performing my duty to my parents perform all those duties of life which performed may entitle me to a blessed hope  shall i contend in and through life to carry a point that at the awful close of it will appear to me as nothing   let me make a proposal  on a supposition that you sir that you madam whose patient goodness to me has been unexampled and every one of my friends favor the count of belvedere as much as ever  i have always acknowledged his merits   permit me a years consideration from the present time to examine the state of my head and heart and at the end of that year allow me to determine and i will endeavor my dear parents to make your wishes and my duty honor conscience divested of caprice fancy petulance my sole guides in the result as well as in the discussion the chevalier grandison his lady father marescutti and mrs beaumont shall be judges between my relations and me if there be occasion  but as it would be unreasonable to expect that the count of belvedere should attend an issue so uncertain for i would rather die than give my vows to a man to whom i could not do justice both with regard to head and heart so i make it my earnest request to him that he will look upon himself to be absolutely free to make his own choice and to pursue his own measures as opportunities offer rejoiced at my heart should i be to have reason to congratulate him on his nuptials with a woman of the soundness of whose mind he could have no doubt and whose heart never knew another attachment  i would humbly propose as a measure highly expedient that the everobliging chevalier grandison and his truly admirable lady will permit us as soon as possible to depart from england o my friends accuse me not of levity in your hearts i obeyed in the rash voyage hither an impulse that appeared to me irresistable and let us leave it to his neverforfeited honor to bring over to us as soon as can be convenient his lady his sisters and their lords as they have made us hope and that a family friendship may be cultivated among us as if a legal relation had taken place  but allow me to declare that if my cousin laurana shall be found to have entertained the least reason to hope that she might one day be countess of belvedere that that expectation alone whatever turn my health may take shall be considered as finally determining the counts expectations on me for i never will be looked upon as the rival of my cousin  and now blessed virgin mother of the god of my hope do thou enable me to be an humble instrument of restoring to the hearts of my honored and indulgent parents and to those of my affectionate brothers and other friends the tranquillity of which i have so unhappily and so long deprived them prays and will every hour pray my ever honored and ever indulgent father and mother  friday may    your dutifully devoted clementina   the marquis was alone with his lady in her dressing room when camilla carried them this letter they opened it with impatience they could not contain their joy when they perused it they both declared that it was all that should all that ought to be exacted from het the bishop signor jeronymo and her two cousins on the contents being communicated to them were in cestasies of joy  all that the count of belvedere had wished for was that lady clementina would give him hope that if she ever married he might be the happy man and for the sake of this distant hope he was resolved to forego all other engagements sir charles was desired to acquaint him with the happy tidings he did with his usual prudence but his joy is extreme  the marquis and marchioness were impatient to embrace and thank their beloved daughter the moment she saw them she threw herself at their feet as they sat together on one settee and were rising to embrace her  o my father o my mother have i not been perverse in your eyes  it was not i  you can pity me  it was not always in my power to think as i now do my mind was disturbed i sought for tranquillity and could no where find it my brother guiacomo was too precipitating yet in his earnestness to have me marry showed his disinterestedness he gave me not time as you both through the advice of the common friend of us all have done the nearest evil was the heaviest to me i sought to avoid that and might have fallen into greater god reward you my father my mother and all my dear friends for the indulgence you have shown me  to follow me too into foreign climates at an unpropitious season of the year  and for what  not to chide not to punish me but to restore me to the arms of your parental love  and did you not vouchsafe to enter into conditions with your child  how greatly disordered in my mind must i be if i ever forget such instances of your graciousness  the tender parents pressed her to their bosoms how did her two brothers and mrs beaumont applaud her   o how good said she are you all to me what a malady a malady of the darkest hue was mine that it could fill me with such apprehensions as were able to draw a cloud between your goodness and my gratitude and make even your indulgence wear the face of hardship to me  the bishop thought it not advisable that the count who hardly knew how to trust himself with his own joy should be presently introduced to her the rejoicing lover therefore walked into the garden giving way to his agreeable contemplations  clementina her mind filled with selfcomplacency on the joyful reception her proposal had met with went into the garden intending to take one of her usual walks laura attending her the count saw her enter and fearing to disoblige her if he broke in upon her in her retirements profoundly bowed and took a different path but she crossing another alley was near him before he was aware he started but recovering threw himself at her feet  life of my hope adorable lady clementina said he  but could not at the moment speak another word  she relieved him from his confusion  rise my lord said she i crossed to meet you on purpose to exchange a few words with you as you happened to be in the garden  i cannot connot rise till thus prostrate at your feet i have thanked you madam with my whole soul   no thanks are due my lord interrupting him god knows what may happen in the next twelve months rise my lord he arose as a friend of our house i will respect you so i have heretofore told you but for your own sake for honors for justice sake i think it necessary to tell you you must not make an absolute dependence on me from what i have written to my parents though i repent not of what i have written  i will not madam for one year for many years i will await your pleasure if at the end of any limited period after that you have named i cannot be so happy as to engage your favor i will resign to my destiny  only mean time permit me to hope  i mentioned my lord that it was for your own sake that i wished you not to depend upon a contingency be you free to pursue your own measures who can say what one two or three years may produce maladies that have once seized the head generally as i have heard say keep their hold or often returned have i not very lately been guilty of a great rashness believe me sir if at the end of the allowed year i shall have reason to suspect myself i will suffer by myself i ever thought you a worthy man god forbid that i should make a worthy man unhappy that would be to double my own misery  generous lady exalted goodness  permit me i once more beseech you but to hope i will resign to your pleasure whatever it shall finally be and bless you for your determination though it should doom me to despair  remember my lord you are warned you depend upon the regard all our house have for you i owe it duty next to implicit for its unexampled indulgence to me your reliance on its favor is not a wak one but o count remember i caution you that your dependence on me is not a strong me be prudent let me not be vexed my heart sickens at the thought of importunity opposition has its root in importunity if you are as happy as i wish you will be very happy but at present i have no notion that i can ever contribute to make you so  he bent one knee and was going to reply  adieu adieu said she  not another word my lord if you are wise are not events in the hand of providence  she hurried from him he was motionless for a few moments his heart however overflowed with hope love and reverence  on his reporting to the marchioness mrs beaumont the two brothers and me what passed between the noble lady and him as above we all congratulated him  the warning lady clementina has given you my lord said mrs beaumont is of a piece with her usual greatness of mind since the event referred to is not cannot be in her own power  there is not said signor jeronymo there can be but one woman greater than my sister  it is she who can adopt as her dearest friend a young creature of her own sex in calamity circumstances so delicate and for her sake occasionally forget that she is the wife of the best and most beloved of men  clementina said the bishop the count being withdrawn will now complete her triumph she has upon religious motives refused the man of her inclination the man deservedly beloved and admired by all her friends and by the whole world and now will she from motives of duty accept of another worthy man and thereby lay her parents themselves as well as the most disinterested of brothers under obligation to her  what a pleasure madam to the marchioness will it be to you to my honored lord to my uncle and even to our giacomo and still more to his excellent wife to reflect on the patience you have had with her since her last rash step and the indulgence shown her clementina now will be all our own  every one praised sir charles and attributed to him the happy prospects before them  letter lviii lady grandison to mrs shirley monday may    the marchioness having been desired to break to lady clementina the news of lauranas death as of a favor she did it with all imaginable tenderness this morning but the generous lady was affected with it  o my poor cousin said she  once she loved me i ever loved her  had she time given her  on what a sandy foundation do we build our schemes of worldly glory  poor laurana  god i hope has taken her to the arms of his mercy  the pious lady and her confessor have shut themselves up in the oratory appropriated for the devotions of this noble family to pray as i presume for the soul of laurana  every thing is settled according to a plan laid down by lady clementina at the request of all her family the count and signor sebastiano are to set out for dover on thursday next in less than a month from their departure the rest of our noble guests are to embark for france in their way home  all but jeronymo sir charles has prevailed that he shall be left behind to try what our english baths may contribute to the perfect reestablishment of his health  this tender point having been referred to his admirable sister she generously consented to his stay with us she has still more generously because unasked released sir charles from his promise of attending them back to italy in consideration of his harriet since at this time he would not know how to leave her nor she to spare him but the next summer if it be permitted me to look so forward or the succeeding autumn to that we hope to be all happy at bologna lady l lady g and their lords have promised to accompany us so has dr bartlett and we all hope that sir edward beauchamp will not refuse to revisit italy with his friends  friday june   six happy days from the date of the letter which lady clementina wrote to her father and mother has the count passed with us the happiest he often declared of his life for in every one of them he was admitted with a freedom that rejoiced his heart to converse with the mistress of his destiny she called upon him more than once in that space of time to behave to her as a brother to his sister for this she thinks the uncertainty of what her situation may be a twelvemonth hence requires for both their sakes  sweetly composed sweetly easy was her whole behavior to him and to everybody else during these six days the sisterly character was well supported by her to him but in the count the most ardent the most respectful and even venerating lover took place of the brotherly one signor jeronymo loves his sister as he loves himself but the eyes of the count compared with those of jeronymo demonstrated that there are two sorts of love yet both ardent and soul in both  the parting scene between clementina and the count was on his side a very fervent on hers a kind one on his knees he pressed with his lips her not withdrawn hand he would have spoken but only could by his eyes which run over  be happy my lord of belvedere said she you have my wishes for your health and safety  adieu  she was for retiring but the count and signor sebastiano of the latter of whom she had taken leave just before following her a few paces she turned and with a noble composure adieu once more my two friends said she take care my lord of signor sebastiano cousin take care of the count of belvedere courtesying to both the count bowed to the ground speechless as she passed me lady grandison said she listing my hand to her lips sister of my heart the day is fine shall i after you have blessed with your good wishes our parting friends invite you into the garden i took a cordial leave of the two noble youths and followed her thither  we had a sweet conversation there and it was made still more delightful to us both by sir charless joining us in about half an hour for the two lords would not permit him to attend them one step beyound the court yard though he had his horses in readiness to accompany them some miles on their way  when we saw sir charles enter the garden we stood still arm in arm expecting and inviting his approach sweet sisters lovely friends said he when come up to us taking a hand of each and joining them bowing on both let me mark this blessed spot with my eye looking round him then on me  a tear on my harriets cheek  he dried it off with my own handkerchief  friendship dearest creatures will make at pleasure a safe bridge over the narrow seas it will cut an easy passage through rocks and mountains and make england and italy one country kindred souls are always near  in that hope my good chevalier in that hope my dear lady grandison will clementina be happy though the day of separation must not be far distant and will you here renew your promise that when it shall be convenient to you my dear lady grandison you will not fail to grace our italy with your presence  we do  we do   promise me again said the noble lady i too have marked the spot with my eye standing still and as sir charles had done looking round her the orangery on the right hand that distant clump of oaklings on the left the villa the rivulet before us the cascade in view that obelisk behind us  be this the spot to be recollected as witness to the promise when we are far far distant from each other  we both repeatexd the promise and sir charles said and he is drawing a plan accordingly that a little temple should be erected on that very spot to be consecrated to our triple friendship and since she had so happily marked it to be called after her name  on monday next we are to set out for london one fortnight passed we shall accompany our noble friends to dover  and there  o my grandmamma how shall we do to part  it is agreed that mr lowther and mr deane though the latter i bless god is in good health will next season accompany signor jeronymo to bath sir charles proposes to be his visitor there and when i will give permission is the compliment made me sir charles proposes to show him ireland and his improvements on his estate in that kingdom will not lucy be rejoiced at that  i am happy that her lord and she take so kindly the felicitations i made them both they are always my dear grandmamma my uncle and aunt and all my friends in northamptonshire sure of the heart of  their and your harriet grandison  letter lix lady grandison to mrs shirley sat june    i gave you my dear grandmamma in my two last letters these do not appear  an account of our delightful engagements among ourselves principally and nowandthen at public places what a rich portion of time has passed and we have still the promise of a week to come and how let me take a survey of our present happy situation  every thing that can be adjusted is the count of belvedere as by letters to signor jeronymo is on his way to italy and not unhappy lady clementina is mistress of every question and the more studious for that reason of obliging all her friends how joyfully do we all in prospect see a durable tranquillity taking possession of her noble heart the marquis and marchioness have not one care written on their heretofore visibly anxious brows clementina sees as every one does their amended health in their fine countenances wonders at the power she had over them and regrets that she made not what she calls a more grateful and dutiful use of it  father marescotti the bishop signor juliano compliment the english air as if that had contributed to the alteration and promise wonders from that and its salubrious baths for jeronymo  the highest merit is given to the conduct of sir charles and to the advice he gave not to precipitate the noble clementina  lord and lady l lord and lady g when we are by ourselves felicitate me more than any body else on these joyful changes for they rightly say that i could not but look upon the happiness of lady clementina as essential to my own  but your congratulations my dearest grandmamma i most particularly expect that in this whole critical event which brought to england a lady so deserving of every ones love not one shadow of doubt has arisen of the tender inviolable affection of the best of men to his grateful harriet  so peculiarly circumstanced as he was how unaffectedly noble has been his behavior to his wife and to his friend in the presence of both how often though causelessly because of the nobleness of the ladys heart have i silently wished him to abate of his outward tenderness to me before her though such as became the purest mind  nothing but the conscious integrity of his own heart above disguises or concealments as his ever was could thus gloriously have carried him through situations so delicate  he had from the first avowed his friendly his compassionating love as well as admiration of this noble lady that generous avowal prepared his harriet to expect that he should behave with tenderness to her even had not her transcendent worthiness done honor to every one who paid her honor to her he applauded he exalted his harriet she was prepared to expect that he would recognize in the face of the sun obligations that he had entered into at the altar and both knew that he was a good man and that a good man cannot allow himself either to palliate or temporize with a duty whether it regarded friendship or a still closer and more sacred union how many difficulties will the character and intervention of a man of undoubted virtue obviate what cannot he effect what force has his example sir charles grandisons love is a love to be gloried in magnanimity and tenderness are united in his noble heart littleness of any kind has no place in it all that know him are studious to commend themselves to his favorable opinion solicitous about what he will think of them and suppressing common foibles before him find their hearts expand nor know how to be mean  o my god do thou make me thankful for such a friend protector director husband increase with my gratitude to thee my merits to him and my power of obliging him for his sake spare to him  this my grandmamma he bids be my prayer  i know it is yours in the awful hour approaching his harriet whose life and welfare he assures her are the dearest part of his own  letter lx lady grandison to mrs shirley st jamesssquare monday june    now at last my dearest grandmamma is the day arrived that we are setting out for dover we shall lodge at canterbury this night and reach dover tomorrow how sad our hearts  canterbury monday night here we are how we look upon one another the parting of dear friends how grievous  how does sir charles endeavor  but lady clementina is to outward appearance an heroine what a grandeur of soul she would not be thought to be concerned at leaving sir charles grandison but i see she is inwardly a sufferer jeronymo is silent i hope he repents not his stay to oblige his dear friend and us all the marquis and marchioness are continually comforting themselves and declare it to be needful with the hope of seeing us in a few months thank god they have a finer season to go back than they had to come hither and they have found the jewel they had lost  i should have told you that lord and lady l and lord and lady g took leave of us at rochester thinking so large a train would be inconvenient to those to whom they wished to do honor how tender was the parting particularly between lady clementina and lady l  ten oclock monday night i am in my chamber here know not what to do

excellent mrs beaumont she now is also affected  she never loved at so short an acquaintance she says any mortal as she loves me she blesses my dear sir charles for his tender yet manly love to me  we have engaged to correspond with each other and in italian chiefly as with lady clementina in order to perfect myself in that language and to make myself as the marchioness fondly says an italian woman and her other daughter  dover wednesday morning cruel tenderness they would not let me see them embark sir charles laid his commands upon me i will call them so because i obeyed reluctantly not to quit my chamber overnight we parted what a solemn parting sir charles and mrs beaumont only  but are they gone they are indeed they are  sir charles to whom seas and mountains are nothing when either the service or pleasure of his friends call upon him is embarked with them he will see them landed and accommodated at calais and then will return to dover to his expecting harriet his jeronymo his beauchamp and good dr bartlett are left to protect and comfort her what a tender farewell between the doctor and father marescotti last night they also are to be constant correspondents the welfare of each family is to be one of their subjects  lady clementina was not afraid of passing a boistrous sea and the bay of biscay in a wintry season when she pursued the flight that then was first in her view her noble mother while she was in search of her daughter had no fears but now the pangs of uncertainty and ardor of impatience being over they both very thankfully embraced sir charless offer his resolution i should say for he would not have been refused to accompany them over the marquis complimented him that every one would think themselves safe in the company of so good a man  how will they be able to part with him he with them  but in a twelvemonth we shall all god willing meet again and if the almighty hear our prayers have cause to rejoice in lady clementinas confirmed state of mind  friday morning the best of men of friends of husbands is returned from calais cheerful gay lively lovely fraught with a thousand blessings for his harriet we shall set out and hope to reach canterbury this night on our return to town  sir charles assures me that he left the dear sister of my heart not unhappy she was all herself at parting his own words magnanimous yet condescendingly affectionate his words also as one who was not afraid or ashamed of her sisterly love for him he took leave of her with a tenderness worthy of his friendship for her a tenderness that the brave and the good ever show to those who are deserving of their love  he particularly recommended it to her father mother the bishop and father marescotti the two latter to enforce it upon the general that they would not urge the noble lady not even upon the expectation she had given them but leave her wholly to her own will and her own way they all promised they would and the poor laurana being now no more undertook for the general  he tells me that he had engaged the court of belvedere on his departure from england to promise to make his court to her only by silent assiduities and by those actions of beneficence and generosity which were so natural to him and so worthy of his splendid fortune  st jamesssquare sunday morning last night blessed be god we came hither in health and spirits we are preparing for

absence of his father and mother bid him rub himself up and look cheerful or i shall take him into our nursery to complete the chorus when our brats are in a squalling fit adieu till tomorrow my dear and everdear harriet    lady g is a charming nurse she must be extraordinary in whatever she does signor jeronymo admires her of all women but she sometimes makes him look about him he rejoices that he is with us and is in charming spirits he is extremely fond of children particulary so of lady gs  it is indeed one of the finest infants i ever saw and he calls it after her his marmouset hugging it twenty times a day to his goodnatured bosom it would delight you to hear her sing to it and to see her toss it about such a settingout in matrimony who would have expected charlotte to make such a wife mother nurse  her brother is charmed with her he draws her into the pleasantry that she loves lays himself open to it and lord g fares the better for their vivacity sir charles generally contrives to do him honor by appealing to him when charlotte is as he complains overlively with himself but that is in truth when he himself takes her down and compliments her as if she were an overmatch for him she often at these times shakes her head at me as if she were sensible of his superiority in her own way  but how i trifle  i am ready quite ready my dear sir charles lead your evergrateful harriet to the house of the allgood allmerciful allmighty there shall i as i always do edify by your cheerful piety  sunday afternoon a new engagement and of a melancholy kind calls sir charles away from me again in how many ways may a good man be serviceable to his fellow creatures  about two hours ago a near relation of sir hargrave pollexfel came hither in sir hargraves chariatandsix the horses smoking to beg he would set out with him if possible to the unhappy mans house on the forest where he has been for a fortnight past resigned to his last hope and usually the physicians last prescription the air the gentlemans name is pollexfen he will if the poor man die childless enjoy the greatest part of his large estate mr pollexfen is a worthy man i belive notwithstanding sir hargraves former disregard to him and jealousies see sir hargraves letter to dr bartlett vol vi p   0  for after he had delivered his message from his cousin which was to beseech the comfott of sir charlees presence and to declare that he could not die in peace unless he saw him he seconded sir hargraves request with tears in his eyes and an earnestness that had both honesty and compassion in it sir charles wanted not this to induce him to go for he looks upon visiting the sick in such urgent cases as an indispensable duty and waiting but till horses had baited he set out with mr pollexfen with the utmost cheerfulness only saying to me  it is a wonder if the poor man be sensible that he thought not of dr bartlett rather than of me  mr merceda mr bagenhall and now sir hargrave pollexfen in the prime of their youth  so lately revelling in full health even to wantonness  companions in iniquity  in so few months  thou almighty comfort the poor man in his last agonies and receive him from my very soul i forgive him those injuries which i  but well i may  since great as they were they ptoved the means of my being brought acquainted with the lord of my wishes the best of men  having filled my paper with the journal of near a week i will conclude here my dear grandmamma with every tender wish and servent prayer for the health and happiness of all my dear friends in northamptonshire who so kindly partake in that of  their and your harriet grandison  letter lxi lady grandison to mrs shirley wednesday july   ah my grandmamma  the poor sir hargrave   sir charles returned but this morning he found him sensible he rejoiced to see him he instantly begged his prayers he wrung his hands wept lamented his past free life fain said he would i have been trusted with a few years trial of my penitence i have wearied heaven with my prayers to this purpose i deserved not perhaps that they should be heard my conscience cruelly told me that i had neglected a multitude of opportunities slighted a multitude of warnings  o sir charles grandison it is a hard hard thing to die in the prime of youth too  such noble possessions   and then he warned his surrounding friends and made comparisons between sir charless happiness and his own misery sir charles at his request sat up with him all night he endeavored to administer comfort to him and called out for mercy for him when the poor man could only by expressive looks join in the solemn invocation sir hargrave had begged he would close his eyes he did he staid to the last painful moment judge what such a heart as sir charless must have felt on the awful occasion  poor sir hargrave pollexfen may he have met with mercy from the allmerciful  he gave his will into sir charless hands soon after he came down he has made him his sole executor have you not been told that sir charles had heretofore reconciled him to his relations and heirs at law he had the pleasure of finding the reconciliation sincere the poor man spoke kindly to them all they were tenderly careful of him he acknowleged their care  i cannot write for tears  the poor man in the last solemn act of his life has been intendedly kind but really cruel to me  i should have been a sincere mourner for him a life so misspent without this act of regard for me  he has left me as a small atonement he calls it for the terrors he once gave me a very large legacy in money sir charles has not yet told me what and his jewels and plate  and he has left sir charles a noble one besides he died immensely rich sir charles is grieved at both legacies and the more as he cannot give them back to the heirs for they declare that he bound them under a solemn oath and by a curse if they broke it not to except back either from sir charles or me the large bequests he told them he had made us and they assured sir charles that they would be religiously bound by it  many unhappy objects will be the better for these bequests sir charles tells me that he will not interfere no not so much as by his advice in the disposal of mine you madam and my aunt selby must direct me when it comes into my hands sir charles intends that the poor mans memory shall receive true honor from the disposition of his legacy to him he is pleased with his harriet for the concern she expressed for this unhappy man the most indulgent of husbands finds out some reason to praise her for every thing she says and does but could he be otherwise than the best of husbands who was the most dutiful of sons who is the most affectionate of brothers the most faithful of friends who is good upon principle in every relation of life  what my dear grandmamma is the boasted character of most of those who are called heroes to the unostentatious merit of a truly good man in what a variety of amiable lights does such a one appear in how many ways is he a blessing and a joy to his fellow creatures  and this blessing this joy your harriet can call more peculiarly her own  my single heart methinks is not big enough to contain the gratitude which such a lot demands let the overflowings of your pious joy my dearest grandmamma join with my thankfulness

thinks human nature has often of late been shown in a light too degrading and he hopes from this series of letters it will be seen that characters may be good without being unnatural sir charles grandison himself is sensible of imperfections and as the reader will remember accuses himself more than once of tendencies to pride and passion which it required his utmost caution and vigilance to reinin and many there are who look upon his offered compromise with the porretta family in allowing the daughters of the proposed marriage to be brought up by the mother reserving to himself the education of the sons only as a blot in the character indeed sir charles himself declares to the general that he would not have come into such a compromise in a beginning address not even with a princess  notwithstanding this it has been observed by some that in general he approaches too near the faultless character which critics censure as above nature yet it ought to be observed too that he performs no one action which it is not in the power of any man in his situation to perform and that he checks and restrains himself in no one instance in which it is not the duty of a prudent and good man to restrain himself  it has been objected by some persons that a man less able by strength or skill to repel an affront than sir charles appears to have been could not with such honor have extricated himself out of difficulties on refusing a challenge and this is true meaning by honor the favorable opinion of the european world from the time of its being overrun by gothic barbarism down to the present but as that notion of hon ur is evidently an absurd and mischievous one and yet multitudes are at a loss to get over it the rejection and conutation of it by a person whom it was visible the consideration of his own safety did not influence must surely be of no small weight and when it is once allowed that there are cases and circumstances in which these polite invitations to murder may consistently with honor be disregarded a little attention will easily find others vulgar notions will insensibly wear out and more ground be gained by degrees than could have been attempted with hope of success at once till at length all may come to stand on the firm footing of reason and religion  in the mean time they who are less qualified to carry off right behavior with honor in the eye of common judges will however be esteemed for it by every serious and prudent person and perhaps inwardly by many who are mean enough to join outwardly in blaming them  indeed when a person has deserved harsh treatment his acquiescence under it may generally be imputed to fear alone and so render him an object at once of hatred and ridicule hardly possible to be borne but he who supports a conduct equally offensive by ever so much brutal courage though a less contemptible is a vastly more detestable creature whilst an upright and harmless man suppose him ever so timorous merits rather a kind sort of pity than violent scorn  but whoever declines forbidden instances of selfvindication not from fear but from principle which is always to be presumed if his regard to principle be steady and uniform in other things such a one however inferior to sir charles grandison in advantages of nature and art yet if he shows real greatness of mind in such things as all men may needs not doubt but he shall be respected by most and may be sufficiently easy though he is despised by some he will still have the satisfaction of reflecting that the laws of all nations are on his side it is so highly worth observing that even the military law of our own country is strongly against duelling that the editor cannot help subjoining an extract out of the articles of war and recommending it to the consideration of all military persons  article xx   nor shall any officer or soldier presume to send a challenge to any other officer or soldier to fight a duel upon pain of being cashired if he be an officer or suffering the severest corporal punishment if a noncommissioned officer or private soldier and if any officer or noncommission officer commanding a guard shall willingly and knowingly suffer any person whatever to go forth to fight a duel they shall be punished as above and all seconds also and carriers of challenges shall be taken as principals and punished accordingly  nor shall any officer or soldier upbraid another for refusing a challenge since according to these our orders they but do the duty of soldiers who ought to subject th mselves to discipline and we do acquit and discharge all men who have quarrels offered or challenges sent to them of all disgrace or opinion of disadvantage in their obedience hereunto and whosoever shall upbraid them and offend in this case shall be punished as a challenger   and only the usurped authority of a silly modern custom against him that on many occasions worthy men in all ages have patiently suffered false disgrace for adhering to their duty that the true bravery is to adhere to all duties under all disadvantages and that refusing a duel is a duty to ourselves our fellow creatures and our maker and whoever acts on these principles the more reproach he undergoes for it father than be driven like a coward by the scoffs of his fellow subjects to rebel against the sovereign of the universe will have the more delightful consciousness of a strong inward principle of piety and virtue and the more distinguished reward from the final judge of all who alone disposes of that honor which shall never fade  it has been said in b half of many modern fictitious pieces in which authors have given success and happiness as it is called to their heroes of vicious if not of profligate characters that they have exhibited human nature as it is its corruption may indeed be exhibited in the faulty character but need pictures of this be held out in books is not vice crowned with success triumphant and rewarded and perhaps set off with wit and spirit a dangerous representation and is it not made even more dangerous by the hasty reformation introduced in contradiction to all probability for the sake of patching up what is called a happy ending  the god of nature intended not human nature for a vile and contemptible thing and many are the instances in every age of those whom he enables amidst all the frailties of mortality to do it honor still the best performances of human creatures will be imperfect but such as they are it is surely both delightful and instructive to dwell sometimes on this bright side of things to show by a series of facts in common life what a degree of excellence may be attained and preserved amidst all the infection of fashionable vice and folly  sir charles grandison is therefore in the general tenor of his principles and conduct though exerted in peculiarities of circumstances that cannot always be accommodated to particular imitation proposed for an example and in offering him as such were his character still more perfect than it is presumed to be the editor is supported by an eminent divine of our own contry  there is no manner of inconvenience in having a pattern propounded to us of so great perfection as is above our reach to attain to and there may be great advantages in it the way to excel in any kind is optima quaeque exempla ad imitandum proponere to propose the brightest and most perfect examples to our imitation no man can write after too perfect and good a copy and though he can never reach the perfection of it yet he is like to learn more than by one less perfect he that aims at the heavens which yet he is sure to come short of is like to shoot higher than he that aims at a mark within his reach  besides that the excellency of the pattern as it leaves room for continual improvement so it kindles ambition and makes men strain and contend to the utmost to do better and though he can never hope to equal the example before him yet he will endeavor to come as near it as he can so that a perfect pattern is no hindrance but an advantage rather to our improvement in any kind tillotson vol ii sermon lvii p

him by which hers to regulate many of his future motions then follows the omission  i cannot say i wish for this visit i love i admire i pity them and would had i wings take a flight into italy with all my heart to see them incognita clementina must be a charming creature  but for harriets sake i have been used to think of her with terror  for your brothers sake also lady g i rejoice and so you know do dr bartlett and mrs shirley that she can now be only a visiter how could sir charles so thorough an englishman have been happy with an italian wife his heart indeed is generously open and benevolent to people of all countries he is as i have often heard you say in the noblest sense a citizen of the world but see we not that his long residence abroad has only the more endeared to him the religion the government the manners of england you know that on a double principle of religion and policy he encourages the tradespeople the manufactures the servants of his own country do i not remember a charmingly lively debate between you and him on the subject of those elegancses in dress and appearance which you said and i thought you naughty for saying it were only to be acquired by employing the better taste of foreigners  he concluded it seriously i recollect nearly his words the error lady g is growing too general is authorized by too many persons of figure not to make one afraid of fatal consequences from what in its beginning seemed a trifle shall any one pretend to true patriotism and not attempt to stem this torrent of fashion which impoverishes our own honest countrymen whilst it carries wealth and power to those whose national religion and interest are directly opposite to ours  good heaven thought i at the time how was this nobleminded man entangled by delicacies of situation by friendship by compassion that he should ever have been like to be engaged in a family of roman catholics and lived half of his days out of his beloved country and the other half to have set as to the worlds eye such an example in it  i know lady g he would have made it his study to prevent any mischief to his neighbors from the active zeal of his ladys confessor had a certain compromise taken effect i remember the hint he gave to father marescotti but would even that good man have thought himself bound to observe faith with heretics in such a case  whither am i rambled i was going to tell you that if this italian family comes over his new taken house etc  books printed and sold by henry saunders at the corner of christchurchlane in high street boadicia a
