hollands benefit  spoken by mr king a ropemaker a poet  write a play o hang the blockhead wicked wits will say  before you turn him off  a word i pray genius is not to place or state fixed down but flies at random all about the town now at whitehall now at st jamess smiles then whisks to wapping or to broad st giles o let not prejudice rank weed take root which may of genius choke the fairest fruit if none but gentlemen highborn must write i fear we soon should wish you all good night shakespeare and johnson our dramatick lords did they amuse themselves with twisting cords were they fine gentlemen  o no  old ben was famous for his trowel as his pen with mortar and the muse he passed his days and built good walls before he built good plays shakespeare a genius born his taste was such too exquisite he loved fat buck too much and he whose matchless muse can soften rocks fled to parnassus to avoid the stocks now to the ropemaker i come again  who having spun much hemp now spins his brain this hempen produce any test will stand this of his brain may prove a rope of sand but should this spinning of his head deceive him this hempen manufacture may relieve him had i but time to give my fancy scope i would show how tragedy was like a rope how several parts well twisted make a whole to curb the passions and to melt the soul the cause of justice each alike befriends both salutary means for moral ends thus the most crabbed critic plainly sees that making ropes is writing tragedies and should he fail to please poor scribbling else  o  then he makes a rope to hang himself  lvii

vol ii p  0  is an epilogue written by that gentleman for mrs pritchard before he knew that mr garrick had already supplied one mrs pritchard survived only until august following when she died at bath she had been    years on the stage her very extraordinary powers and her infinite variety gave her the justest claim to be remembered as one of the most distinguished actresses that perhaps any country ever produced and her uncommon talents for the theater were not more the admiration of the public than the amiableness of her private life was that of her acquaintance mrs pritchards farewell epilogue spoken on monday the   th april      at drury lane theater the curtain dropped  my mimic life is past that scene of the last scene of lady macbeth sleep and terror was my last could i in such a scene my exit make when every real feeling is awake which beating here superior to all art bursts in full tides from a most grateful heart i now appear myself distressed dismayed more than in all the characters i have played in acted passion tears must seem to flow  but i have that within that passes show before i go and this loved spot forsake what gratitude can give my wishes take upon your hearts may no affliction prey which cannot by the stage be chased away and may the stage to please each virtuous mind grow every day more moral more refined refined from grossness not by foreign skill weed out the poison but be english still to all my brethren whom i leave behind still may your bounty as to me be kind to me for many years your favors flowed humbly received  on small desert bestowed

english husbands have your wives no souls then for our persons  still more shameful work a hundred women wed a single turk again ye english husbands what say you a hundred wives you would not wish for two romans and greeks for me  o that dear sparta their women had a noble magna charta there a young hero had he won fair fame might from her husband ask a lovely dame the happy husband of the honor vain gave her with joy took her with joy again the chosen dame no struggles had within for to refuse had been a public sin and to their honor all historians say no spartan lady ever sinned that way ye fair who have not yet thrown out your bait to tangle captives in the marriage state take heed i warn you where your snares you set o let not infidels come near your net let hand in hand with prudence go your wishes men are in general the strangest fishes do not for misery your beauty barter and o take heed  you do not catch a tartar  lxvi prologue to the school for rakes a comedy by mrs griffiths

its wings and hum another day unknown to natures laws we have here one evil for flies turned spiders play the very devil  fearing some danger i will lay before ye a short true recent tragicomic story  as late i saunterd in the park for air  as free from thought as any coxcomb there  two sparks came up one whispered in my ear  he was a critic then asked me with a sneer   thus stradling staring with a swaggering swing  you have writ a farce  yes sir  a foolish thing  damned foolish  better mind your acting king  it is ten to one  i speak it for your sake  that this same farce will prove your wits last stake wits last stake a farce by mr king was acted at drury lane april        i scribble for amusement boast no powers  right for your own amusement  not for ours  thus he went on and with his pleasant talking  i lost the appetite i got with walking  he laughed  i bowed  but ere i could retreat  his lisping friend did thus the dose repeat  pray sir  this school for rakes  the womans play   when do you give it us  next saturday  i hope you will both be kind to her at least  a scribbling woman is a dreadful beast  then they are so ugly all these female wits   i will damn her play  to

his plan there is an odd mortal match him if you can hah sir said i  your reasoning is not deep for when at tragedies spectators weep like harmless infants mourn themselves asleep they often like children cry themselves asleep and if no jogging epilogue you write pit box and gallery may sleep all night  better he swore  a nap should overtake ye  than folly should to follys pranks awake ye  rakes are more harmless nodding upon benches  than ogling to ensnare poor simple wenches  and simple girls had better close their eyes  than send them gadding after butterflies  nay should a statesman make a box his nest  who that his country loves would break his rest  let come what may i will not make em laugh  take for an epilogue  this epitaph it is thus these pedant greekread poets vapor is it

mankind  there is trade law and statequacks nay would we but search we should find  heaven bless us  some quacks in the church the stiff band and stiff bob of the methodist race give the balsam of life and the tincture of grace and their poor wretched patients think much good is done em though blisters and caustics are ever upon them as for law and the state if quackrys a curse which will make the good bad and the bad will make worse we should point out the quack from the regular brother they are wiser than i who can tell one from the other can the stage with its bills puffs and patients stand trial shall we find out no quacks in the theater royal some dramatical drugs that are puffed on the town cause many wry faces and scarce will go down nay an audience sometimes will in quackry delight and sweat down an author sometimes in one night to return to our quack  should he helped by the weather raise laughter and kind perspiration together should his nostrums of hips and of vapors

cvi epilogue to alfred a tragedy by mr home acted at covent garden january       spoken by mrs barry our bards of late so tragic in their calling have scarce preserved one heroine from falling whether the dame be widow maid or wife she seldom from their hands escapes with life if this green cloth could speak would it not tell upon its well worn nap how often i fell to death in various forms delivered up steel kills me one night and the next the cup the tragic process is as short as certain with she makes the motion of stabbing this  or and here of drinking poison this i drop  then drops the curtain no saint can lead a better life than i for half is spent in learning how to aie the learned dispute how tragedies should end o happily say some  some death defend mild critics with good fortune to the good while others hotbrained roar for blood blood blood  the fair though nervous tragic to the soul delights in daggers and the poisoned bowl  i would not give a blackpin for a play  unless in tenderness i melt away  from pangs and death no lovers would i save  they should be wretched and despair and rave  and never together lie  but in the grave the brave rough soldier a soft heart discovers he swears and weeps at once when dead the lovers as down his cheeks runs trickling natures tide  damn it  i wish those young ones had not died though from his eyes the drop of pity falls he fights like caesar when his country calls in spite of critic laws our bard takes part and joins in concert with the soldiers heart o let your feelings with this party side for once forgive me

modern youths much danger lies there are a hundred blanks for one poor prize was i not bold ye fair to undertake to tame that wildest animal  a rake to lead a tiger in a silken string hush the loud storm and clip the whirlwinds wing my pride was piqued all dangers i would through to have her way what would not woman do the papers swarm each day with patent puffers for smoaky chimneys  powders

blood boils over yours bubbles too then all is lost and there is the devil to do piff puff blown up at once the lovers part he snaps his chain  and madam  breaks her heart  hymen puts out his torch and cupid blunts his dart thus ends the farce or tragedy of love but ladies if your sparks are given to rove from my experience take one general rule  cool as he warms and love will never cool if

i can remember the day when a graysinn journalist or a herald has mauled a manager weekly as ably as the monitor or the north briton has lately attacked the minister some of your politicians allow mr pit to be a great man but think he has been too fond of continental connections in like manner i not only allow garrick to be the greatest actor the world ever saw but also am of opinion that he is an excellent manager and yet i must as a true patriot blame him for his encouragement of pantomime two pantomimes in one winter and the town had only sense enough to damn one o tempora o mores but i

displayed his talents in the summer shade by chance a nightingale was there well pleased the farce to see and hear his joy began his notes to raise he warbled forth the monkeys praise pug too much flattered thought it wrong not to return his thanks in song and such a fit of squalling took him beasts birds and nightingale forsook him an owl who in a hole was dreaming was raised at once with all

dispute consider my friend an attorneys my foe the worst of his tribe and the best is so so o let not his quiddits and quirks of the law o let not not this harpy your poor client claw in law as in life i know well it is a rule that a knave should be ever too hard for a fool to this rule one exception your poor client implores that the fool may for once beat the knave out of doors the petition of the fools to jupiter a fable addressed to the late earl of chesterfield from grecian aesop to our gay each fabulist is pleased to say that jove gives ear to all petitions from animals of all conditions like earthly kings he hears their wants and like them too not always grants some years ago  the fools assembled who long at stanhopes wit had trembled and with repeated strokes grown sore most zealously did jove implore that he should shield them from that wit which pointed well was sure to hit twas hard they said to be thus baited they were not by themselves created and if they were to folly prone the fault they hoped was not their own jove smiled and said  not quite so fast you were indeed made up in haste with little care i formed your brain but never made you pert and vain stanhope himself would be your friend did you not strive my work to mend and wildly straying from my rules make yourselves fops whom i made fools but tell me how for i am willing to grant your wish on this side killing and shield you for the time to come   strike chesterfield deaf blind and dumb  first in his tongue such terrors lie  if that is stopped he cannot reply  to stop his tongue and not his ears  will only multiply our fears  he will answer both in prose and verse  and they will prove a lasting curse  then stop o sire of gods and men  that still more dreadful tongue his pen  spare not good jove his lordships sight  we never shall rest if he can write hold hold  cries jove a moment stay you know not fools for what you pray your malice shooting in the dark has driven the arrow over the mark deaf dumb and blind ye silly folk is all this rancour for a joke shall i be pander to your hate and mortals teach to rail at fate to mend a little your condition i will grant one third of your petition he shall be deaf and you be free from his keen brilliant  which like hightemperd polished steel will quicker wound than you can feel with fear with weakness we comply but still what malice  deny how would apollo hermes swear should i give ear to all your prayer and blast the man who from his birth has been their favorite care on earth what tie his tongue and cloud his sight that he no more can talk than write i cannot indulge your fe pride and punish all the world bde answer by lord chesterfield garrick i have read your fools petition and thank you for the composition though few will credit all you say yet it is a friendly part you play a part which you perform with ease whatever you act is sure to please but give me leave on this occasion to make one little observation though no good reason is assigned at least not any i can find why i should be deaf dumb or blind yet since it was resolved above by this same foolobeying jove i must not speak or hear or see surely to soften the decree he might have left the choice to me were that the case i would dispense with sight and wit and eloquence still to retain my favorite sense for grant my friend we would admit what some may doubt that i have wit what are the mighty powers of speech what useful purpose do they reach when vain and impotent you see even down from socrates to me all the bonsmots that ever were said to mend the heart or clear the head fools will be fools say what we will and rascals will be rascals still but rather i your case would be in say you than lose the power of seeing the face of nature you will say is ever cheerful ever gay and beauty parent of delight must always charm the ravished sight this choice perhaps i might commend but here you have forgot my friend that natures face and beautys heaven lose all their charms at seventyseven the brightest scenes repeated over as well you know will please no more the prospects darkened over with age the drama can no more engage we wish with you to quit the stage in short it is a point i am clear in the best of senses is our hearing happy who keeps it still and he who wants must mourn the loss like me for though i little should regret the tables roar where fools are met the flattering tribe who sing or say the lies or tattle of the day still have i cause for discontent still lose what most i must lament the converse of a chosen few the luxury of  hearing you on doctor goldsmiths characteristical cookery a jeu d esprit are these the choice dishes the doctor has sent us is this the great poet whose works so content us this goldsmiths fine feast who has written fine books heaven sends us good meat but the devil sends cooks jupiter and mercury a fable here hermes says jove who with nectar was mellow go fetch me some clay  i will make an odd fellow right and wrong shall be jumbled  much gold and some dross without cause be he pleased without cause be he cross be sure as i work to throw in contradictions a great love of truth yet a mind turned to fictions now mix these ingredients which warmed in the baking turn to learning and gaming religion and raking with the love of a wench let his writings be chaste tip his tongue with strange matter his pen with fine taste that the rake and the poet over all may prevail set fire to the head and set fire to the tail for the joy of each sex on the world i will bestow it this scholar rake christian dupe gamester and poet through a mixture so odd he shall merit great fame and among brother mortals  be goldsmith his name when on earth this strange meteor no more shall appear you hermes shall fetch him  to make us sport here to the printer of the public advertiser sir notwithstanding the great sale and reputation of lord chesterfields letters it is but lately that i had time or indeed inclination to peruse them when i was told that his lordship as a part of polite education forbids his son to lough for i am vulgar enough to seek all opportunities to show that distinction between us and brutes i was not so eager as the rest of the world to be taught politeness at the expense of my pleasure however his letters came in my way and by reading them i have learnt what i hope soon to forget viz that laughter is a sure sign of illbreeding and that women have no genius very luckily a full answer to his lordships last assertion was recommended to me i mean a poem called sir eldred of the bower said to be written by a miss hannah more  the real pleasure i received in reading that and the bleeding rock a legendary tale by the same author was to me so point blank against his lordships doctrine that i could not help showing my gratitude to the lady and my disapprobation of the lord in the following lines  upon reading sir eldred of the bower by a lady after lord chesterfields letters i far from the reach of mortal grief well stanhope art thou fled nor could thou lord now gain belief though rising from the dead ii thy wit a female champion braves and blasts thy critic power she comes  and in her hand she weaves sir eldred of the bower iii the victors palm aloft she bears and sullen foes submit the laurel wreath from man she tears and
