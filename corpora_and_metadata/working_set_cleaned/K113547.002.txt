eight syllable lines very improper for the solemnity of the subject otherwise the poem is natural and the reflections just  by the blue tapers trembling light no more i waste the wakeful night intent with endless view to pore the schoolmen and the sages over their books from wisdom widely stray or point at best the longest way i will seek a readier path and go where wisdoms surely taught below how deep yon azure dies the sky where orbs of gold unnumberd lie while through their ranks in silver pride the nether crescent seems to glide the slumbering breeze forgets to breathe the lake is smooth and clear beneath where once again the spangled show descends to meet our eyes below the grounds which on the right aspire in dimness from the view retire the left presents a place of graves whose wall the silent water laves that steeple guides thy doubtful sight among the livid gleams of night there pass with melancholy state by all the solemn heaps of fate and think as softlysad you tread above the venerable dead time was like thee they life possessed and time shall be that thou shall rest those graves with bending osier bound that nameless heave the crumbled ground quick to the glancing thought disclose where toil and poverty repose the flat smooth stones that bear a name the chissels slender help to fame which ere our set of friends decay their frequent steps may wear away a middle race of mortals own men half ambitious all unknown the marble tombs that rise on high whose dead in vaulted arches lie whose pillars swell with sculptured stones arms angels epitaphs and bones these all the poor remains of state adorn the rich or praise the great who while on earth in fame they live are senseless of the fame they give ha while i gaze pale cynthia fades the bursting earth unveils the shades all slow and wan and wrapped with shrouds they rise in visionary crowds and all with sober accent cry think mortal what it is to die now from yon black and funeral yew that bathes the charnelhouse with dew methinks i hear a voice begin ye ravens cease your croaking din ye tolling clocks no time resound over the long lake and midnight ground it sends a peal of hollow groans thus speaking from among the bones when men my scythe and darts supply how great a king of fears am i they view me like the last of things they make and then they dread my stings fools if you less provoked your fears no more my spectreform appears deaths but a path that must be trod if man would ever pass to god a port of calms a state of ease from the rough rage of swelling seas why then thy flowing sable stoles deep pending cypress mourning poles loose scarfs to fall athwart thy weeds long palls drawn herses covered steeds and plumes of black that as they tread nod over the scutcheons of the dead nor can the parted body know nor wants the soul these forms of woe as men who long in prison dwell with lamps that glimmer round the cell wheneer their suffering years are run spring forth to greet the glittering sun such joy though far transcending sense have pious souls at parting hence on earth and in the body placed a few and evil years they waste but when their chains are cast aside see the glad scene unfolding wide clap the glad wing and tower away and mingle with the blaze of day a fairy tale by dr parnell never was the old manner of speaking more happily applied or a tale better told than this  in britains isle and arthurs days when midnight fairies dauncd the maze lived edwin of the green edwin i wis a gentle youth endowed with courage sense and truth though badly shaped he been his mountain back mote well be said to measure height against his head and lift itself above yet spite of all that nature did to make his uncouth form forbid this creature dared to love he felt the charms of ediths eyes nor wanted hope to gain the prize could ladies look within but one sir topaz dressed with art and if a shape could win a heart he had a shape to win edwin if right i read my song with slighted passion paced along all in the moony light twas near an old enchanted court where sportive fairies made resort to revel out the night his heart was drear his hope was crossed twas late twas far the path was lost that reached the neighbortown with weary steps he quits the shades resolved the darkling dome he treads and drops his limbs adown but scant he lays him on the floor when hollow winds remove the door a trembling rocks the ground and well i ween to count aright at once an hundred tapers light on all the walls around now sounding tongues assail his ear now sounding feet approachen near and now the sounds increase and from the corner where he lay he sees a train profusely gay come prankling over the place but trust me gentles never yet was dight a masquing half so neat or half so rich before the country lent the sweet perfumes the sea the pearl the sky the plumes the town its silken store now whilst he gazed a gallant dressed in flaunting robes above the rest with awful accent cried what mortal of a wretched mind whose sighs infect the balmy wind has here presumed to hide at this the swain whose venurous soul no fears of magic art control advanced in open sight nor have i cause of dreed he said who view by no presumption led your revels of the night twas grief for scorn of faithful love which made my steps unweeting rove amid the nightly dew it is well the gallant cries again we fairies never injure men who dare to tell us true exalt thy lovedejected heart be mine the task or ere we part to make thee grief resign now take the pleasure of thy chance whilst i with mab my partner dance be little mable thine he spoke and all a sudden there light music floats in wanton air the monarch leads the queen the rest their fairie partners found and mable trimly tript the ground with edwin of the green the dancing past the board was laid and siker such a feast was made as heart and lip desire withouten hands the dishes fly the glasses with a wish come nigh and with a wish retire but now to please the fairie king full every deal they laugh and sing and antic feats devise some wind and tumble like an ape and othersome transmute their shape in edwins wondering eyes till one at last that robin hight renowned for pinching maids by night has hent him up aloof and full against the beam he slung where by the back the youth he hung to sprawl unneath the roof from thence reverse my charm he cries and let it fairly now suffice the gambol has been shown but oberon answers with a smile content thee edwin for a while the vantage is thine own here ended all the phantom play they smelt the fresh approach of day and heard a cock to crow the whirling wind that bore the crowd has clapped the door and whistled loud to warn them all to go then screaming all at once they fly and all at once the tapers dye poor edwin falls to floor forlorn his state and dark the place was never wight in such a case through all the land before but soon as dan apollo rose full jolly creature home he goes he feels his back the less his honest tongue and steady mind had rid him of the lump behind which made him want success with lusty livelyhed he talks he seems a dancing as he walks his story soon took wind and beauteous edith sees the youth endowed with courage sense and truth without a bunch behind the story told sir topaz moved the youth of edith erst approved to see the revel scene at close of eve he leaves his home and wends to find the ruined dome all on the gloomy plain as there he bides it so befell the wind came rustling down a dell a shaking seized the wall up sprung the tapers as before the fairies bragly foot the floor and music fills the hall but certes sorely sunk with woe sir topaz sees the elphin show his spirits in him die when oberon cries a man is near a mortal passion cleeped sear hangs flagging in the sky with that sir topaz hapless youth in accents faltring ay for ruth entreats them pity grant for als he been a mister wight betrayed by wandering in the night to tread the circled haunt ah losell vile at once they roar and little skilled of fairie lore thy cause to come we know now has thy kestrell courage fell and fairies since a lie you tell are free to work thee woe then will who bears the wispy fire to trail the swains among the mire the captive upward flung there like a tortoise in a shop he dangled from the chambertop where whilom edwin hung the revel now proceeds apace deftly they frisk it over the place they sit they drink and eat the time with frolic mirth beguile and poor sir topaz hangs the while till all the rout retreat by this the stars began to wink they shriek they fly the tapers sink and down ydrops the knight for never spell by fairie laid with strong enchantment bound a glade beyond the length of night chill dark alone adreed he lay till up the welkin rose the day then deemed the dole was over but wot ye well his harder lot his seely back the bunch had got which edwin lost before this tale a sybilnurse ared she softly stroakd my youngling head and when the tale was done thus some are born my son she cries with base impediments to rise and some are born with none but virtue can itself advance to what the favorite fools of chance by fortune seemed designed virtue can gain the odds of fate and from itself shake off the weight upon the unworthy mind palemon and lavinia mr thomson though in general a verbose and affected poet has told this story with unusual simplicity it is rather given here for being much esteemed by the public than by the editor  the lovely young lavinia once had friends and fortune smiled deceitful on her birth for in her helpless years deprived of all of every stay save innocence and heaven she with her widowed mother feeble old and poor lived in a cottage far retired among the windings of a woody vale by solitude and deep surrounding shades but more by bashful modesty concealed together thus they shunned the cruel scorn which virtue sunk to poverty would meet from giddy passion and lowminded pride almost on natures common bounty fed like the gay birds that sung them to repose content and careless of tomorrows fare her form was fresher than the morning rose when the dew wets its leaves unstained and pure as is the lilly or the mountain snow the modest virtues mingled in her eyes still on the ground dejected darting all their humid beams into the blooming flowers or when the mournful tale her mother told of what her faithless fortune promised once thrilled in her thought they like the dewy star of evening shone in tears a native grace sat fairproportiond on her polished limbs veiled in a simple robe their best attire beyond the pomp of dress for loveliness needs not the foreign aid of ornament but is when unadorned adorned the most thoughtless of beauty she was beautys self recluse amid the closeembowering woods as in the hollow breast of appenine beneath the shelter of encircling hills a myrtle rises far from human eye and breathes its balmy fragrance over the wild so flourished blooming and unseen by all the sweet lavinia till at length compelled by strong necessitys supreme command with smiling patience in her looks she went to glean palemons fields the pride of swains palemon was the generous and the rich who led the rural life in all its joy and elegance such as arcadian song transmits from ancient uncorrupted times when tyrant custom had not shackled man but free to follow nature was the mode he then his fancy with autumnal scenes amusing chanced beside his reapertrain to walk when poor lavinia drew his eye unconscious of her power and turning quick with unaffected blushes from his gaze he saw her charming but he saw not half the charms her downcast modesty concealed that very moment love and chaste desire sprung in his bosom to himself unknown for still the world prevailed and its dread laugh which scarce the firm philosopher can scorn should his heart own a gleaner in the field and thus in secret to his soul he sighed what pity that so delicate a form by beauty kindled where enlivening sense and more than vulgar goodness seem to dwell should be devoted to the rude embrace of some indecent clown she looks methinks of old acastos line and to my mind recalls that patron of my happy life from whom my liberal fortune took its rise now to the dust gone down his houses lands and once fairspreading family dissolved it is said that in some lone obscure retreat urged by remembrance sad and decent pride far from those scenes which knew their better days his aged widow and his daughter live whom yet my fruitless search could never find romantic wish would this the daughter were when strict enquiring from herself he found she was the same the daughter of his friend of bountiful acasto who can speak the mingled passions that surprised his heart and through his nerves in shivering transport ran then blazed his smothered flame avowed and bold and as he viewed her ardent over and over love gratitude and pity wept at once confused and frightened at his sudden tears her rising beauties flushed a higher bloom as thus palemon passionate and just poured out the pious rapture of his soul and art thou then acastos dear remains she whom my restless gratitude has sought so long in vain o heavens the very same the softened image of my noble friend alive his every look his every feature more elegantly touched sweeter than spring thou sole surviving blossom from the root that nourished up my fortune say ah where in what sequestered desert have thou drawn the kindest aspect of delighted heaven into such beauty spread and blown so fair though povertys cold wind and crushing rain beat keen and heavy on thy tender years o let me now into a richer soil transplant thee safe where vernal suns and showers diffuse their warmest largest influence and of my garden be the pride and joy ill it befits thee oh it ill befits acastos daughter his whose open stores though vast were little to his ampler heart the father of a country thus to pick the very refuse of those harvestfields which from his bounteous friendship i enjoy then throw that shameful pittance from thy hand but ill applied to such a rugged task the fields the master all my fair are thine if to the various blessings which thy house has on me lavished thou will add that bliss that dearest bliss the power of blessing thee here ceased the youth yet still his speaking eye expressed the sacred triumph of his soul with conscious virtue gratitude and love above the vulgar joy divinely raised nor waited he reply won by the charm of goodness irresistible and all in sweet disorder lost she blushed consent the news immediate to her mother brought while pierced with anxious thought she pined away the lonely moments for lavinias fate amazed and scarce believing what she heard joy seized her withered veins and one bright gleam of setting life shone on her eveninghours not less enraptured than the happy pair who flourished long in tender bliss and reared a numerous offspring lovely like themselves and good the grace of all the country round the bastard almost all things written from the heart as this certainly was have some merit the poet here describes sorrows and misfortunes which were by no means imaginary and thus there runs a truth of thinking through this poem without which it would be of little value as savage is in other respects but an indifferent poet  in gayer hours when high my fancy ran the muse exulting thus her lay began blessed be the bastards birth through wondrous ways he shines eccentric like a comets blaze no sickly fruit of faint compliance he he stamped in natures mint of extacy he lives to build not boast a generous race no tenth transmitter of a foolish face his daring hope no sires example bounds his firstborn lights no prejudice confounds he kindling from within requires no flame he glories in a bastards glowing name born to himself by no possession led in freedom fostered and by fortune fed nor guides nor rules his sovereign choice control his body independent as his soul loosed to the worlds wide range  enjoined no aim prescribed no duty and assigned no name natures unbounded son he stands alone his heart unbiased and his mind his own o mother yet no mother  it is to you my thanks for such distinguished claims are due you unenslavd to natures narrow laws warm championess for freedoms sacred cause from all the dry devoirs of blood and line from ties maternal moral and divine discharged my grasping soul pushed me from shore and launched me into life without an oar what had i lost if conjugally kind by nature hating yet by vows confined untaught the matrimonial bounds to slight and coldly conscious of a husbands right you had faintdrawn me with a form alone a lawful lump of life by force your own then while your backward will retrenched desire and unconcurring spirits lent no fire i had been born your dull domestic heir load of your life and motive of your care perhaps been poorly rich and meanly great the slave of pomp a cipher in the state lordly neglectful of a worth unknown and slumbering in a seat by chance my own far nobler blessings wait the bastards lot conceived in rapture and with fire begot strong as necessity he starts away climbs against wrongs and brightens into day thus unprophetic lately misinspird i sung gay fluttering hope my fancy fired inly secure through conscious scorn of ill nor taught by wisdom how to balance will rashly deceived i saw no pits to shun but thought to purpose and to act were one heedless what pointed cares pervert his way whom caution arms not and whom woes betray but now exposed and shrinking from distress i fly to shelter while the tempests press my muse to grief resigns the varying tone the raptures languish and the numbers groan o memory thou soul of joy and pain thou actor of our passions over again why do thou aggravate the wretches woe why add continuous smart to every blow few are my joys alas how soon forgot on that kind quarter thou invadst me not while sharp and numberless my sorrows fall yet thou repeatst and multiplyst em all is chance a guilt that my disastrous heart for mischief never meant must ever smart can selfdefence be sin  ah plead no more what though no purposed malice stained thee over had heaven befriended thy unhappy side thou had not been provoked  or thou had died far be the guilt of homeshed blood from all on whom unsought embroiling dangers fall still the pale dead revives and lives to me to me through pitys eye condemned to see remembrance veils his rage but swells his fate grieved i forgive and am grown cool too late young and unthoughtful then who knows one day what ripening virtues might have made their way he might have lived till folly died in shame till kindling wisdom felt a thirst for fame he might perhaps his countrys friend have proved both happy generous candid and beloved he might have saved some worth now doomed to fall and i perchance in him have murdered all o fate of late repentance always vain thy remedies but lull undying pain where shall my hope find rest  no mothers care shielded my infant innocence with prayer no fathers guardian hand my youth maintained called forth my virtues or from vice restrained is it not thine to snatch some powerful arm first to advance then screen from future harm i am returned from death to live in pain or would imperial pity save in vain distrust it not  what blame can mercy find which gives at once a life and rears a mind mother miscalled farewell  of soul severe this sad reflection yet may force one tear all i was wretched by to you i owed alone from strangers every comfort flowed lost to the life you gave your son no more and now adopted who was doomed before newborn i may a nobler mother claim but dare not whisper her immortal name supremely lovely and serenely great majestic mother of a kneeling state queen of a peoples heart who never before agreed  yet now with one consent adore one contest yet remains in this desire who most shall give applause where all admire the poet and his patron mr more was a poet that never had justice done him while living there are few of the moderns have a more correct taste or a more pleasing manner of expressing their thoughts it was upon these fables he chiefly founded his reputation yet they are by no means his best production  why celia is your spreading waist so loose so negligently laced why must the wrapping bedgown hide your snowy bosoms swelling pride how ill that dress adorns your head distained and rumpled from the bed those clouds that shade your blooming face a little water might displace as nature every morn bestows the crystal dew to cleanse the rose those tresses as the raven black that waved in ringlets down your back uncombd and injured by neglect destroy the face which once they decked whence this forgetfulness of dress pray madam are you married yes nay then indeed the wonder ceases no matter then how loose your dress is the end is won your fortunes made your sister now may take the trade alas what pity it is to find this fault in half the female kind from hence proceed aversion strife and all that sours the wedded life beauty can only point the dart it is neatness guides it to the heart let neatness then and beauty strive to keep a wavering flame alive it is harder far you will find it true to keep the conquest than subdue admit us once behind the screen what is there farther to be seen a newer face may raise the flame but every woman is the same then study chiefly to improve the charm that fixed your husbands love weigh well his humor was it dress that gave your beauty power to bless pursue it still be neater seen it is always frugal to be clean so shall you keep alive desire and times swift wing shall fan the fire in garret high as stories say a poet sung his tuneful lay so soft so smooth his verse you would swear apollo and the muses there through all the town his praises rung his sonnets at the playhouse sung high waving over his laboring head the goddess want her pinions spread and with poetic fury fired what phoebus faintly had inspired a noble youth of taste and wit approved the sprightly things he writ and sought him in his cobweb dome discharged his rent and brought him home behold him at the stately board who but the poet and my lord each day deliciously he dines and greedy quaffs the generous wines his sides were plump his skin was sleek and plenty wantoned on his cheek astonished at the change so new away the inspiring goddess flew now dropped for politics and news neglected lay the drooping muse unmindful whence his fortune came he stifled the poetic flame nor tale nor sonnet for my lady lampoon nor epigram was ready with just contempt his patron saw resolved his bounty to withdraw and ths with anger in his look the laterepenting fool bespoke blind to the good that courts thee grown whence has the sun of favor shone delighted with thy tuneful art esteem was growing in my heart but idly thou rejectst the charm that gave it birth and kept it warm unthinking fools alone despise the arts that taught them first to rise the wolf sheep and lamb duty demands the parents voice should sanctify the daughters choice in that is due obedience shown to choose belongs to her alone may horror seize his midnight hour who builds upon a parents power and claims by purchase vile and base the loathing maid for his embrace hence virtue sickens and the breast where peace had built her downy nest becomes the troubled seat of care and pines with anguish and despair a wolf rapacious rough and bold whose nightly plunders thinnd the fold contemplating his illspent life and cloyed with thefts would take a wife his purpose known the savage race in numerous crowds attend the place for why a mighty wolf he was and held dominion in his jaws her favorite whelp each mother brought and humbly his alliance sought but cold by age or else too nice none found acceptance in his eyes it happened as at early dawn he solitary crossed the lawn strayed from the fold a sportive lamb skippd wanton by her fleecy dam when cupid foe to man and beast discharged an arrow at his breast the timorous breed the robber knew and trembling over the meadow flew their nimblest speed the wolf oertook and courteous thus the dam bespoke stay fairest and suspend your fear trust me no enemy is near these jaws in slaughter often imbrued at length have known enough of blood and kinder business brings me now vanquished at beautys foot to bow you have a daughter  sweet forgive a wolfs address  in her i live love from her eyes like lightning came and set my marrow all on flame let your consent confirm my choice and ratify our nuptial joys me ample wealth and power attend wide over the plains my realms ex what midnight robber dare invade the fold if i the guard am made at home the shepherds cur may sleep while i secure his masters sheep discourse like this attention claimed grandeur the mothers breast inflamed now fearless by his side she walked of settlements and jointures talked proposed and doubled her demands of flowery fields and turniplands the wolf agrees her bosom swells to miss her happy fate she tells and of the grand alliance vain contemns her kindred of the plain the loathing lamb with horror hears and wearies out her dam with prayers but all in vain mamma best knew what unexperienced girls should do so to the neighboring meadow carried a formal ass the couple married torn from the tyrant mothers side the trembler goes a victimbride reluctant meets the rude embrace and bleats among the howling race with horror often her eyes behold her murdered kindred of the fold each day a sister lamb is served and at the gluttons table carved the crashing bones he grinds for food and slakes his thirst with streaming blood love who the cruel mind detests and lodges but in gentle breasts was now no more enjoyment past the savage hungerd for the feast but as we find in human race a mask conceals the villains face justice must authorize the treat till then he longed but durst not eat as forth he walked in quest of prey the hunters met him on the way fear wings his flight the marsh he sought the snuffing dogs are set at fault his stomach balked now hunger gnaws howling he grinds his empty jaws food must be had  and lamb is nigh his maw invokes the fraudful lie is this dissembling rage he cried the gentle virtue of a bride that leagued with mans destroying race she sets her husband for the chase by treachry prompts the noisy hound to scent his footsteps on the ground thou traitress vile for this thy blood shall glut my rage and dye the wood so saying on the lamb he flies beneath his jaws the victim dies the female seducers it is said of widow maid and wife that honor is a womans life unhappy sex who only claim a being in the breath of fame which tainted not the quickening gales that sweep sabaeas spicy vales nor all the healing sweets restore that breathe along arabias shore the travler if he chance to stray may turn uncensurd to his way polluted streams again are pure and deepest wounds admit a cure but woman no redemption knows the wounds of honor never close though distant every hand to guide nor skilled on lifes tempestuous tide if once her feeble bark recede or deviate from the course decreed in vain she seeks the friendly shore her swifter folly flies before the circling ports against her close and shut the wanderer from repose till by conflicting waves oppressed her foundring pinnace sinks to rest are there no offerings to atone for but a single error  none though woman is avowed of old no daughter of celestial mold her tempring not without allay and formed but of the finer clay we challenge from the mortal dame the strength angelic natures claim nay more for sacred stories tell that even immortal angels fell whatever fills the teeming sphere of humid earth and ambient air with varying elements endud was formed to fall and rise renewed the stars no fixed duration know wide oceans ebb again to flow the moon repletes her waining face allbeauteous from her late disgrace and suns that mourn approaching night refulgent rise with newborn light in vain may death and time subdue while nature mints her race anew and holds some vital spark apart like virtue hid in every heart it is hence reviving warmth is seen to cloathe a naked world in green no longer barred by winters cold again the gates of life unfold again each insect tries his wing and lifts fresh pinions on the spring again from every latent root the bladed stem and tendril shoot exhaling incense to the skies again to perish and to rise and must weak woman then disown the change to which a world is prone in one meridian brightness shine and never like evening suns decline resolved and firm alone  is this what we demand of woman  yes but should the spark of vestal fire in some unguarded hour expire or should the nightly thief invade hesperias chaste and sacred shade of all the blooming spoil possessed the dragon honor charmed to rest shall virtues flame no more return no more with virgin splendour burn no more the ravaged garden blow with springs succeeding blossom  no pity may mourn but not restore and woman falls to rise no more within this sublunary sphere a country lies  no matter where the clime may readily be found by all who tread poetic ground a stream called life across it glides and equally the land divides and here of vice the province lies and there the hills of virtue rise upon a mountains airy stand whose summit looked to either land an ancient pair their dwelling chose as well for prospect as repose for mutual faith they long were famed and temperance and religion named a numerous progeny divine confessed the honors of their line but in a little daughter fair was centered more than half their care for heaven to gratulate her birth gave signs of future joy to earth white was the robe this infant wore and chastity the name she bore as now the maid in stature grew a flower just opening to the view often through her native lawns she strayed and wrestling with the lambkins played her looks diffusive sweets bequeathed the breeze grew purer as she breathed the morn her radiant blush assumed the spring with earlier fragrance bloomed and nature yearly took delight like her to dress the world in white but when her rising form was seen to reach the crisis of fifteen her parents up the mountains head with anxious step their darling led by turns they snatched her to their breast and thus the fears of age expressed o joyful cause of many a care o daughter too divinely fair yon world on this important day demands thee to a dangerous way a painful journey all must go whose doubtful period none can know whose due direction who can find where reasons mute and sense is blind ah what unequal leaders these through such a wide perplexing maze then mark the warnings of the wise and learn what love and years advise far to the right thy prospect bend where yonder towering hills ascend lo there the arduous paths in view which virtue and her sons pursue with toil over lessening earth they rise and gain and gain upon the skies narrows the way her children tread no walk for pleasure smoothly spread but rough and difficult and steep painful to climb and hard to keep fruits immature those lands dispense a food indelicate to sense of taste unpleasant yet from those pure health with cheerful vigor flows and strength unfeeling of decay throughout the long laborious way hence as they scale that heavenly road each limb is lightened of its load from earth refining still they go and leave the mortal weight below then spreads the strait the doubtful clears and smooth the rugged path appears for custom turns fatigue to ease and taught by virtue pain can please at length the toilsome journey over and near the bright celestial shore a gulf black fearful and profound appears of either world the bounds through darkness leading up to light sense backward shrinks and shuns the sight for there the transitory train of time and form and care and pain and matters gross incumbring mass mans late associates cannot pass but sinking quit the immortal charge and leave the wondering soul at large lightly she wings her obvious way and mingles with eternal day thither o thither wing thy speed though pleasure charm or pain impede to such the allbounteous power has given for present earth a future heaven for trivial loss unmeasured gain and endless bliss for transient pain then fear ah fear to turn thy sight where yonder flowery fields invite wide on the left the pathway bends and with pernicious ease descends there sweet to sense and fair to show newplanted edens seem to blow trees that delicious poison bear for death is vegetable there hence is the frame of health unbracd each sinew slackning at the taste the soul to passion yields her throne and sees with organs not her own while like the slumbrer in the night pleased with the shadowy dream of light before her alienated eyes the scenes of fairyland arise the puppet worlds amusing show dipped in gaylycolourd bow scepters and wreaths and glittering things the toys of infants and of kings that tempt along the baneful plain the idly wise and lightly vain till verging on the gulphy shore sudden they sink and rise no more but list to what thy fates declare though thou art woman frail as fair if once thy sliding foot should stray once quit yon heavnappointed way for thee lost maid for thee alone nor prayers shall plead nor tears atone reproach scorn infamy and hate on thy returning steps shall wait thy form be loathed by every eye and every foot thy presence fly thus armed with words of potent sound like guardian angels placed around a charm by truth divinely cast forward our young adventrer passed forth from her sacred eyelids sent like morn forerunning radiance went while honor handmaid late assigned upheld her lucid train behind awestruck the muchadmiring crowd before the virgin vision bowed gazed with an ever new delight and caught fresh virtue at the sight for not of earths unequal frame they deemed the heavncompounded dame if matter sure the most refined high wrought and tempered into mind some darling daughter of the day and bodyd by her native ray wherever she passes thousands bend and thousands where she moves attend her ways observant eyes confess her steps pursuing praises bless while to the elevated maid oblations as to heaven are paid twas on an everblithsome day the jovial birth of rosy may when genial warmth no more suppressed new melts the frost in every breast the cheek with secret flushing dies and looks kind things from chastest eyes the sun with healthier visage glows aside his clouded kerchief throws and dances up the etherial plain where late he used to climb with pain while nature as from bonds set free springs out and gives a loose to glee and now for momentary rest the nymph her traveled step repressed just turned to view the stage attained and gloried in the height she gained outstretchd before her wide survey the realms of sweet perdition lay and pity touched her soul with woe to see a world so lost below when strait the breeze began to breathe airs gently wafted from beneath that bore commissioned witchcraft thence and reached her sympathy of sense no sounds of discord that disclose a people sunk and lost in woes but as of present good possessed the very triumph of the blessed the maid in wrapped attention hung while thus approaching sirens sung hither fairest hither haste brightest beauty come and taste what the powers of bliss unfold joys too mighty to be told taste what ecstasies they give dying raptures taste and live in thy lap disdaining measure nature empties all her treasure soft desires that sweetly languish fierce delights that rise to anguish fairest do thou yet delay brightest beauty come away list not when the froward chide sons of pedantry and pride snarlers to whose feeble sense april sunshine is offense age and envy will advise even against the joy they prize come in pleasures balmy bowl slake the thirstings of thy soul till thy raptured powers are fainting with enjoyment past the painting fairest do thou yet delay brightest beauty come away so sung the sirens as of yore upon the false ausonian shore and o for that preventing chain that bound ulysses on the main that so our fairone might withstand the covert ruin now at hand the song her charmed attention drew when now the tempters stood in view curiosity with prying eyes and hands of busy bold emprise like hermes feathered were her feet and like forerunning fancy fleet by search untaught by toil untird to novelty she still aspired tasteless of every good possessed and but in expectation blessed with her associate pleasure came gay pleasure frolicloving dame her mien all swimming in delight her beauties half revealed to sight loose flowed her garments from the ground and caught the kissing winds around as erst medusas looks were known to turn beholders into stone a dire reversion here they felt and in the eye of pleasure melt her glance with sweet persuasion charmed unnervd the strong the steeled disarmed no safety even the flying find who venurous look but once behind thus was the much admiring maid while distant more than half betrayed with smiles and adulation bland they joined her side and seized her hand their touch envenomed sweets instilled her frame with new pulsations thrilled while half consenting half denying repugnant now and now complying amidst a war of hopes and fears of trembling wishes smiling tears still down and down the winning pair compelled the struggling yielding fair as when some stately vessel bound to blessed arabias distant ground borne from her courses happily lights where barcas flowery clime invites concealed around whose treacherous land lurks the dire rock and dangerous sand the pilot warns with sail and oar to shun the much suspected shore in vain the tide too subtly strong still bears the wrestling bark along till foundring she resigns to fate and sinks overwhelmed with all her freight so baffling evy bar to sin and heavens own pilot placed within along the devious smooth descent with powers increasing as they went the dames accustomed to subdue as with a rapid current drew and over the fatal bounds conveyed the lost the long reluctant maid here stop ye fair ones and beware nor send your fond affections there yet yet your darling now deplored may turn to you and heaven restored till then with weeping honor wait the servant of her better fate with honor left upon the shore her friend and handmaid now no more nor with the guilty world upbraid the fortunes of a wretch betrayed but over her failing cast the veil remembring you yourselves are frail and now from allenquiring light fast fled the conscious shades of night the damsel from a short repose confounded at her plight arose as when with slumbrous weight oppressed some wealthy miser sinks to rest where felons eye the glittering prey and steal his hoard of joys away he borne where golden indus streams of pearl and quarryd dimond dreams like midas turns the glebe to oar and stands all wrapped amidst his store but wakens naked and despoiled of that for which his years had toiled so fared the nymph her treasure flown and turned like niobe to stone within without obscure and void she felt all ravaged all destroyed and o thou cursed insidious coast are these the blessings thou can boast these virtue these the joys they find who leave thy heavntopt hills behind shade me ye pines ye caverns hide ye mountains cover me she cried her trumpet slander raised on high and told the tidings to the sky contempt discharged a living dart a sidelong viper to her heart reproach breathed poisons over her face and soiled and blasted every grace officious shame her handmaid new still turned the mirror to her view while those in crimes the deepest died approached to whiten at her side and every lewd insulting dame upon her folly rose to fame what should she do attempt once more to gain the latedeserted shore so trusting back the mourner flew as fast the train of fiends pursue again the farther shores attained again the land of virtue gained but echo gathers in the wind and shows her instant foes behind amazed with headlong speed she tends where late she left an host of friends alas those shrinking friends decline nor longer own that form divine with fear they mark the following cry and from the lonely trembler fly or backward drive her on the coast where peace was wrecked and honor lost from earth thus hoping aid in vain to heaven not daring to complain no truce by hostile clamor given and from the face of friendship driven the nymph sunk prostrate on the ground with all her weight of woes around enthroned within a circling sky upon a mount over mountains high all radiant sat as in a shrine virtue first effluence divine far far above the scenes of woe that shut this cloud wrapped world below superior goddess essence bright beauty of uncreated light whom should mortality survey as doomed upon a certain day the breath of frailty must expire the world dissolve in living fire the gems of heaven and solar flame be quenched by her eternal beam and nature quickening in her eye to rise a newborn phoenix die hence unreveald to mortal view a veil around her form she threw which three sad sisters of the shade pain care and melancholy made through this her allenquiring eye attentive from her station high beheld abandoned to despair the ruins of her favorite fair and with a voice whose awful sound appald the guilty world around bid the tumultuous winds be still to numbers bowed each listening hill uncurld the surging of the main and smoothed the thorny bed of pain the golden harp of heaven she strung and thus the tuneful goddess sung lovely penitent arise come and claim thy kindred skies come thy sister angels say thou have wept thy stains away let experience now decide twixt the good and evil tried in the smooth enchanted ground say unfold the treasures found structures raised by morning dreams sands that trip the flitting streams down that anchors on the air clouds that paint their changes there seas that smoothly dimpling lie while the storm impends on high showing in an obvious glass joys that in possession pass transient fickle light and gay flattering only to betray what alas can life contain life like all its circles  vain will the stork intending rest on the billow build her nest will the be demand his store from the bleak and bladeless shore man alone intent to stray ever turns from wisdoms way lays up wealth in foreign land sows the sea and plows the sand soon this elemental mass soon the incumbring world shall pass form be wrapped in wasting fire time be spent and life expire then ye boasted works of men where is your assylum then sons of pleasure sons of care tell me mortals tell me where gone like traces on the deep like a scepter grasped in sleep dews exhaled from morning glades melting snows and gliding shades pass the world and what is behind virtues gold by fire refined from an universe depraved from the wreck of nature saved like the lifesupporting grain fruit of patience and of pain on the swains autumnal day winnowd from the chaff away little trembler fear no more thou have plenteous crops in store seed by genial sorrows sown more than all thy scorners own what though hostile earth despise heaven beholds with gentler eyes heaven thy friendless steps shall guide cheer thy hours and guard thy side when the fatal trump shall sound when the immortals pour around heaven shall thy return attest hailed by myriads of the blessed little native of the skies lovely penitent arise calm thy bosom clear thy brow virtue is thy sister now more delightful are my woes than the rapture pleasure knows richer far the weeds i bring than the robes that grace a king on my wars of shortest date crowns of endless triumphs wait on my cares a period blessed on my toils eternal

of the poetry and the justice of the thoughts constitute its principal beauty  clarinda dearly loved attend the counsels of a faithful friend who with the warmest wishes fraught feels all at least that friendship ought but since by ruling heavens design an others fate shall influence thine o may these lines for him prepare a bliss which i would die to share man may for wealth or glory roam but woman must be blessed at home to this should all her studies tend this her great object and her end distaste unmingld pleasures bring and use can blunt afflictions sting hence perfect bliss no mortals know and few are plunged in utter woe while nature armed against despair gives power to mend or strength to bear and half the thought content may gain which spleen employs to purchase pain trace not the fair domestic plan from what you would but what you can nor peevish spurn the scanty store because you think you merit more bliss ever differs in degree thy share alone is meant for thee and thou should think however small that share enough for it is thy all vain scorn will aggravate distress and only make that little less admit whatever trifles come units compose the largest sum o tell them over and say how vain are those who form ambitions train which swell the monarchs gorgeous state and bribe to ill the guilty great but thou more blessed more wise than these shall build up happiness on ease hail sweet content where joy serene guilds the mild souls unruffld scene and with blithe fancys pencil wrought spreads the white web of flowing thought shines lovely in the cheerful face and clothes each charm with native grace effusion pure of bliss sincere a vestment for a god to wear far other ornaments compose the garb that shrouds dissembled woes piecd out with motley dies and sorts freaks whimsies festivals and sports the troubled minds fantastic dress which madness titles happiness while the gay wretch to revels bears the pale remains of fighs and tears and seeks in crowds like her undone what only can be found in one but chief my gentle friend remove far from thy couch seducing love o shun the false magicians art nor trust thy yet unguarded heart charmed by his spells fair honor flies and thousand treacherous phantoms rise where guilt in beautys ray beguiles and ruin lurks in friendships smiles lo where the enchanted captive dreams of warbling groves and purling streams of painted meads of flowers that shed their odours round her fragrant bed quick shifts the scene the charm is lost she wakes upon a desert coast no friendly hand to lend its aid no guardian bower to spread its shade exposed to every chilling blast she treads the inhospitable waste and down the drear decline of life sinks a forlorn dishonored wife neglect not thou the voice of fame but clear from crime be free from blame though all were innocence within it is guilt to wear the garb of sin virtue rejects the foul disguise none merit praise who praise despise slight not in supercilious strain long practiced modes as low or vain the world will vindicate their cause and claim blind faith in customs laws safer with multitudes to stray than tread alone a fairer way to mingle with the erring throng than boldly speak ten millions wrong beware of the relentless train whom forms adore whom forms maintain lest prudes demure or coxcombs loud accuse thee to the partial crowd foes who the laws of honor slight a judge who measures guilt by spite behold the sage aurelia stand disgrace and fame at her command as if heavens delegate designed sole arbiter of all her kind whether she try some favored piece by rules devised in ancient greece or whether modern in her flight she tells what paris thinks polite for much her talents to advance she studied greece and traveled france there learned the happy art to please with all the charms of labored ease through looks and nods with meaning fraught to teach what she was never taught by her each latent spring is seen the workings foul of secret spleen the guilt that skulks in fair pretense or folly veiled in specious sense and much her righteous spirit grieves when worthlessness the world deceives whether the erring crowd commends some patriot swayed by private ends or husband trust a faithless wife secure in ignorance from strife averse she brings their deeds to view but justice claims the rigrous due humanely anxious to produce at least some possible excuse o never may virtues dire disgrace prepare a triumph for the base mere forms the fool implicit sway which witlings with contempt survey blind folly no defect can see half wisdom views but one degree the wise remoter uses reach which judgment and experience teach whoever would be pleased and please must do what others do with ease great precept undefind by rule and only

whatever the circle says implicit does whatever they do without one point in wish or view sure test of others faithful glass through which the various phantoms pass wide blank unfeeling when alone no care no joy no thought her own not thus succeeds the peerless dame who looks and talks and acts for fame intent so wide her cares extend to make the universe her friend now with the gay in frolics shines now reasons deep with deep divines with courtiers now extols the great with patriots sighs over britains fate now breathes with zealots holy fires now melts in less refined desires doomed to exceed in each degree too wise too weak too proud too free too various for one single word the high sublime of deep absurd while every talent nature grants just serves to show how much she wants although in  combine the virtues of our sex and thine her hand restrains the widows tears her sense informs and sooths and cheers yet like an angel in disguise she shines but to some favored eyes nor

go such sallies are of nobler kind than virtues of a narrow mind hans carvel this bagatelle for which by the bye mr prior has got his greatest reputation was a tale told in all the old italian collections of jests and borrowed from thence by fontaine it had been translated once or twice before into english yet was never regarded till it fell into the hands of mr prior a strong instance how much every thing is improved in the hands of a man of genius  hans carvel impotent and old married a lass of london mold handsome enough extremely gay loved music company and play high flights she had and wit at will and so her tongue lay seldom still for in all visits who but she to argue or to repartee she made it plain that human passion was ordered by predestination that if weak women went astray their stars were more in fault than they whole tragedies she had by heart entered into roxanas part to triumph in her rivals blood the action certainly was good how like a vine young ammon curled oh that dear conquror of the world she pitied betterton in age that ridiculed the godlike rage she first of all the town was told where newest india things were sold so in a morning without bodice slipped sometimes out to mrs thodys to cheapen tea to buy a screen what else could so much virtue mean for to prevent the least reproach betty went with her in the coach but when no very great affair excited her peculiar care she without fail was waked at ten drank chocolate then slept again at twelve she rose with much ado her clothes were huddled on by two then does my lady dine at home yes sure  but is the colnel come next how to spend the afternoon and not come home again too soon the change the city or the play as each was proper for the day a turn in summer to hyde park when it grew tolerably dark wifes pleasure causes husbands pain strange fancies come in hanss brain he thought of what he did not name and would reform but durst not blame at first he therefore preached his wife the comforts of a pious life told her how transient beauty was that all must die and flesh was grass he bought her sermons psalms and graces and doubled down the useful places but still the weight of worldly care allowed her little time for prayer and cleopatra was read over while scot and wake and twenty more that teach one to deny ones self stood unmolested on the shelf an untouched bible graced her toilet no fear that thumb of here is should spoil it in short the trade was still the same the dame went out the colnel came what is to be done poor carvel cried another battry must be tried what if to spells i had recourse it is but to hinder something worse the end must justify the means he only sins who ill intends since therefore it is to combat evil it is lawful to employ the devil forthwith the devil did appear for name him and he is always near not in the shape in which he plies at misss elbow when she lies or stands before the nursry doors to take the naughty boy that roars but without sawcer eye or claw like a grave barrister at law hans carvel lay aside your grief the devil says i bring relief relief says hans pray let me crave your name sir  satan  sir your slave i did not look upon your feet you will pardon me  ay now i see it and pray sir when came you from hell our friends there did you leave them well all well but prythee honest hans says satan leave your complaisance the truth is this i cannot stay flaring in sunshine all the day for enter nous we hellish sprites love more the fresco of the nights and oftener our receipts convey in dreams than any other way i tell you therefore as a friend ere morning dawns your fears shall end go then this evening master carvel lay down your fowls and broach your barrel let friends and wine dissolve your care whilst i the great receipt prepare  tonight i will bring it by my faith believe for once what satan says away went hans glad not a little obeyed the devil to a tittle invited friends some half a dozen the colnel and my ladys cousin the meat was served the bowls were crowned catches were sung and healths went round barbados waters for the close till hans had fairly got his dose the colnel toasted to the best the dame moved off to be undrest the chimes went twelve the guests withdrew but when or how hans hardly knew some modern anecdotes aver he nodded in his elbow chair from thence was carried off to bed john held his heels and nan his head my lady was disturbed new sorrow which hans must answer for tomorrow in bed then view this happy pair and think how hymen triumphed there hans fast asleep as soon as laid the duty of the night unpaid the waking dame with thoughts oppressed that made her hate both him and rest by such a husband such a wife twas achmes and septimius life the lady sighed the lover snord the punctual devil kept his word appeared to honest hans again but not at all by madam seen and giving him a magic ring fit for the finger of a king dear hans said he this jewel take and wear it long for satans sake twill do your business to a hair for long as you this ring shall wear as sure as i look over lincoln that never shall happen which you think on hans took the ring with joy extreme all this was only in a dream and thrusting it beyond his joint it is done he cried i have gained my point  what point said she you ugly beast you neither give me joy nor rest it is done  what is done you drunken bear you have thrust your finger g  d knows where the ladle the skeptics think twas long ago since gods came down incognito to see who were their friends or foes and how our actions fell or rose that since they gave things their beginning and set this whirlagig a spinning supine they in their heaven remain exempt from passion and from pain and frankly leave us human elves to cut and shuffle for ourselves to stand or walk to rise or tumble as matter and as motion jumble the poets now and painters hold this thesis both absurd and bold and your goodnatured gods they say descend some twice or thrice a day else all these things we toil so hard in would not avail one single farthing for when the hero we rehearse to grace his actions and our verse it is not by dint of human thought that to his latium he is brought iris descends by fates commands to guide his steps through foreign lands and amphitrite clears the way from rocks and quicksands in the sea and if you see him in a sketch though drawn by paulo or carrache he shows not half his force and strength strutting in armor and at length that he may take his proper figure the piece must yet be four yards bigger the nymphs conduct him to the field one holds his sword and one his shield mars standing by asserts his quarrel and fame flies after with a laurel these points i say of speculation as twere to save or sink the nation men idly learned will dispute assert object confirm refute each mighty angry mighty right with equal arms sustains the fight till now no umpire can agree em so both draw off and sing te deum is it in equilibrio if deities descend or no then let the affirmative prevail as requisite to form the tale for by all parties it is confessed that those opinions are the best which in their nature most conduce to present ends or private use two gods came therefore from above one mercury the the other jove the humor was it seems to know if all the favors they bestow could from our own perverseness ease us and if our wish enjoyed would please us discoursing largely on this theme over hills and dales their godships came till well nigh tired at almost night they thought it proper to alight note here that it as true as odd is that in disguise a god or goddess exerts no supernatral powers but acts on maxims much like ours they spied at last a country farm where all was snug and clean and warm for woods before and hills behind secured it both from rain and wind large oxen in the fields were lowing good grain was sowed good fruit was growing of last years corn in barns great store fat turkeys gobbling at the door and wealth in short with peace consented that people here should live contented but did they in effect do so have patience friend and thou shall know the honest farmer and his wife two years declined from prime of life had struggled with the marriage noose as almost every couple does sometimes my plague sometimes my darling kissing today tomorrow snarling jointly submitting to endure that evil which admits no cure our gods the outward gate unbarrd our farmer met em in the yard thought they were folks that lost their way and asked them civilly to stay told them for supper or for bed they might go on and be worse sped  so said so done the gods consent all three into the parlour went they compliment they sit they chat fight over the wars reform the state a thousand knotty points they clear till supper and my wife appear jove made his leg and kissed the dame obsequious hermes did the same jove kissed the farmers wife you say he did  but in an honest way oh not with half that warmth and life with which he kissed amphitryons wife  well then things handsomely were served my mistress for the strangers carved how strong the beer how good the meat how loud they laughed how much they eat in epic sumptuous would appear yet shall be passed in silence here for i should grieve to have it said that by a fine description led i made my episode too long or tired my friend to grace my song the grace cup served the cloth away jove thought it time to show his play landlord and landlady he cried folly and jesting laid aside that ye thus hospitably live and strangers with good cheer receive is mighty grateful to your betters and makes even gods themselves your debtors to give the thesis plainer proof you have tonight beneath your roof a pair of gods nay never wonder this youth can fly and i can thunder i am jupiter and he mercurius my page my son indeed but spurious form then three wishes you and madam and sure as you already had em the things desired in half an hour shall all be here and in your power thank ye great gods the woman says o may your altars ever blaze a ladle for our silver dish is what i want is what i wish  a ladle cries the man a ladle odzooks corsica you have prayed ill what should be great you turn to farce i wish the ladle in your a  with equal grief and shame my muse the sequel of the tale pursues the ladle fell into the room and stuck in old corsicas bum our couple weep two wishes past and kindly join to form the last to ease the womans awkward pain and get the ladle out again moral this commoner has worth and parts is praised for arms or loved for arts his head achs for a coronet and who is blessed that is not great some sense and more estate kind heaven to this welllotted peer has given what then he must have rule and sway and all is wrong till he is in play the miser must make up his plum and dares not touch the hoarded sum the sickly dotard wants a wife to draw off his last dregs of life against our peace we arm our will amidst our plenty something still for horses houses pictures planting to thee to me to him is wanting the cruel something unpossessd corrodes and leavens all the rest that something if we could obtain would soon create a future pain and to the coffin from the cradle it is all a wish and all a ladle baucis and philemon from swift this poem is very fine and though in the same strain with the preceding is yet superior  in ancient times as story tells the saints would often leave their cells and strole about but hide their quality to try good peoples hospitality it happened on a winter night as authors of the legend write two brother hermits saints by trade taking their tour in masquerade disguised in tattered habits went to a small village down in kent where in the strollers canting strain they begged from door to door in vain tried every tone might pity win but not a soul would let em in our wandering saints in woeful state treated at this ungodly rate having through all the village passed to a small cottage came at last where dwelt a good old honest yeman called in the neighborhood philemon who kindly did these saints invite in his poor hut to pass the night and then the hospitable sire bid goody baucis mend the fire while he from out the chimney took a flitch of bacon off the hook and freely from the fattest side cut out large slices to be fried then stepped aside to fetch em drink filled a large jug up to the brink and saw it fairly twice go round yet what is wonderful they found twas still replenished to the top as if they had not touched a drop the good old couple were amazed and often on each other gazed for both were frightened to the heart and just began to cry  what art then softly turned aside to view whether the lights were burning blue the gentle pilgrims soon aware on it told them their calling and their errand good folks you need not be afraid we are but saints the hermits said no hurt shall come to you or yours but for that pack of churlish boors not fit to live on christian ground they and their houses shall be drowned whilst you shall see your cottage rise and grow a church before your eyes they scarce had spoke when fair and soft the roof began to mount aloft aloft rose every beam and rafter the heavy wall climbed slowly after the chimney widend and grew higher became a steeple with a spire the kettle to the top was hoist and there stood fastened to a joist but with the upside down to show its inclination for below in vain for a superior force applied at bottom stops its course doomed ever in suspense to dwell it is now no kettle but a bell a wooden jack which had almost lost by disuse the art to roast a sudden alteration feels increased by new intestine wheels and what exalts the wonder more the number made the motion slower the flyer though it had leaden feet turned round so quick you scarce could see it but slackened by some secret power now hardly moves an inch an hour the jack and chimney near allied had never left each others side the chimney to a steeple grown the jack would not be left alone but up against the steeple reared became a clock and still adhered and still its love to household cares by a shrill voice at noon declares warning the cookmaid not to burn that roastmeat which it cannot turn the groaningchair began to crawl like a huge snail along the wall there stuck aloft in public view and with small change a pulpit grew the porringers that in a row hung high and made a glittering show to a less noble substance changed were now but leathern buckets ranged the ballads pasted on the wall of joan of france and english moll fair rosamond and robin hood the little children in the wood now seemed to look abundant better improved in picture size and letter and high in order placed describe the heraldry of every tribe a bedstead of the antique mode compact of timber many a load such as our ancestors did use was metamorphosd into pews which still their ancient nature keep by lodging folks disposed to sleep the cottage by such feats as these grown to a church by just degrees the hermits then desired their host to ask for what he fancied most philemon having paused awhile returned em thanks in homely style then said my house is grown so fine methinks i still would call it mine i am old and fain would live at ease make me the parson if you please he spoke and presently he feels his graziers coat fall down his heels he sees yet hardly can believe about each arm a pudding sleeve his waistcoat to a cassock grew and both assumed a sable hue but being old continued just as threadbare and as full of dust his talk was now of tithes and dues he smoked his pipe and read the news knew how to preach old sermons next vampd in the preface and the text at christnings well could act his part and had the service all by heart wished women might have children fast and thought whose sow had farrowd last against dissenters would repine and stood up firm for right divine found his head filled with many a system but classic authors  he never missed em thus having furbishd up a parson dame baucis next they played their farce on instead of homespun coifs were seen good pinners edged with colberteen her petticoat transformed apace became black satin flouncd with lace plain goody would no longer down twas madam in her grogram gown philemon was in great surprise and hardly could believe his eyes amazed to see her look so prim and she admired as much at him thus happy in their change of life were several years this man and wife when on a day which proved their last discoursing over old stories past they went by chance amidst their talk to the churchyard to take a walk when baucis hastily cried out my dear i see your forehead sprout sprout quoth the man what is this you tell us i hope you dont believe me jealous but yet methinks i feel it true and really yours is budding too  nay  now i cannot stir my foot it feels as if twere taking root description would but tire my muse in short they both were turned to yews old goodman dobson of the green remembers he the trees has seen he will talk of them from noon till night and goes with folks to show the sight on sundays after evening prayer he gathers all the parish there points out the place of either yew here baucis there philemon grew till once a parson of our town to mend his barn cut baucis down at which it is hard to be believed how much the other tree was grieved grew scrubby died atop was stunted so the next parson stubbd and burnt it to the earl of warwick on the death of mr addison this elegy by mr tickell is one of the finest in our language there is so little new that can be said upon the death of a friend after the complaints of ovid and the latin italians in this way that one is surprised to see so much novelty in this to strike us and so much interest to affect  if dumb too long the drooping muse has stayed and left her debt to addison unpaid blame not her silence warwick but bemoan and judge oh judge my bosom by your own what mourner ever felt poetic fires slow comes the verse that real woe inspires grief unaffected suits but ill with art or flowing numbers with a bleeding heart can i forget the dismal night that gave my souls best art for ever to the grave how silent did his old companions tread by midnight lamps the mansions of the dead through breathing statues then unheeded things through rows of warriors and through walks of kings what awe did the slow solemn knell inspire the pealing organ and the pausing choir the duties by the lawnrobd prelate paid and the last words that dust to dust conveyed while speechless over thy closing grave we bend accept these tears thou dear departed friend oh gone for ever take this long adieu and sleep in peace next thy loved montagu to strew fresh laurels let the task be mine a frequent pilgrim at thy sacred shrine mine with true sighs thy absence to bemoan and grave with faithful epitaphs thy stone if ever from me thy loved memorial part may shame afflict this alienated heart of thee forgetful if i form a song my lyre be broken and untuned my tongue my grief be doubled from thy image free and mirth a torment unchastisd by thee often let me range the gloomy isles alone sad luxury to vulgar minds unknown along the walls where speaking marbles show what worthies form the hallowed mould below proud names who once the reins of empire held in arms who triumphed or in arts excelled chiefs graced with scars and prodigal of blood stern patriots who for sacred freedom stood just men by whom impartial laws were given and saints who taught and led the way to heaven never to these chambers where the mighty rest since their foundation came a nobler guest nor ever was to the bowers of bliss conveyed a fairer spirit or more welcome shade in what new region to the just assigned what new employments please the unbodyd mind a winged virtue through the etherial sky from world to world unwearied does he fly or curious trace the long laborious maze of heavens decrees where wondering angels gaze does he delight to hear bold seraphs tell how michael batteld and the dragon fell or mixed with milder cherubim to glow in hymns of love not ill essayed below or do thou warn poor mortals left behind a task well suited to thy gentle mind oh if sometimes thy spotless form descend to me thy aid thou guardian genius lend when rage misguides me or when fear alarms when pain distresses or when pleasure charms in silent whisprings purer thoughts impart and turn from ill a frail and feeble heart lead through the paths thy virtue trod before till bliss shall join nor death can part us more that awful form which so ye heavens decree must still be loved and still deplored by me in nightly visions seldom fails to rise or roused by fancy meets my waking eyes if business calls or crowded courts invite the unblemished statesman seems to strike my sight if in the stage i seek to sooth my care i meet his soul which breathes in cato there if pensive to the rural shades i rove his shape oertakes me in the lonely grove twas there of just and good he reasoned strong cleared some great truth or raised some serious song there patient showed us the wise course to steer a candid censor and a friend severe there taught us how to live and oh too high the price for knowledge taught us how to die thou hill whose brow the antique structures grace reared by bold chiefs of warwicks noble race why once so loved when ever thy bower appears over my dim eye balls glance the sudden tears how sweet were once thy prospects fresh and fair thy sloping walks and unpolluted air how sweet the glooms beneath thy aged trees thy noontide shadow and thy evening breeze his image thy forsaken bowers restore thy walks and airy prospects charm no more no more the summer in thy glooms allayed thy evening breezes and thy noonday shade from other ills however fortune frowned some refuge in the muses art i found reluctant now i touch the trembling string bereft of him who taught me how to sing and these sad accents murmured over his urn betray that absence they attempt to mourn o must i then now fresh my bosom bleeds and craggs in death to addison succeeds the verse begun to one lost friend prolong and weep a second in the unfinished song these works divine which on his deathbed laid to thee o craggs the expiring sage conveyed great but illomend monument of fame nor he survived to give nor thou to claim swift after him thy social spirit flies and close to his how soon thy coffin lies blessed pair whose union future bards shall tell in future tongues each others boast farewell farewell whom joined in fame in friendship tried no chance could sever nor the grave divide colin and lucy a ballad through all tickells works there is a strain of balladthinking if i may so express it and in this professed ballad he seems to have surpassed himself it is perhaps the best in our language in this way  of leinster famed for maidens fair bright lucy was the grace nor ever did liffys limpid stream reflect so sweet a face till luckless love and pining care impaired her rosy hue her coral lips and damask cheeks and eyes of glossy blue oh have you seen a lily pale when beating rains descend so drooped the slowconsuming maid her life now near its end by lucy warned of flattering swains take heed ye easy fair of vengeance due to broken vows ye perjured swains beware three times all in the dead of night a bell was heard to ring and shrieking at her window thrice the raven flappd his wing too well the lovelorn maiden knew the solemn boding sound and thus in dying words bespoke the virgins weeping round i hear a voice you cannot hear which says i must not stay i see a hand you cannot see which beckons me away by a false heart and broken vows in early youth i die was i to blame because his bride was thrice as rich as i ah colin give not her thy vows vows due to me alone nor thou fond maid receive his kiss nor think him all thy own tomorrow in the church to wed impatient both prepare but know fond maid and know false man that lucy will be there then bear my corse my comrades bear this bridegroom blithe to meet he in his wedding trim so gay i in my winding sheet she spoke she died her corse was borne the bridegroom blithe to meet he in his weddingtrim so gay she in her winding sheet then what were perjured colins thoughts how were these nuptials kept the bridesmen flocked round lucy dead and all the village wept confusion shame remorse despair at once his bosom swell the damps of death bedewed his brow he shook he groaned he fell from the vain bride ah bride no more the varying crimson fled when stretched before her rivals corse she saw her husband dead then to his lucys newmade grave conveyed by trembling swains one mould with her beneath one sod for ever he remains often at this grave the constant hind and plighted maid are seen with garlands gay and truelove knots they deck the sacred green but swain forsworn whoever thou art this hallowed spot forbear remember colins dreadful fate and fear to meet him there the tears of scotland written in the year mdccxlvi this ode by dr smellet does rather more honor to the authors feelings than his taste the mechanical part with regard to numbers and language is not so perfect as so short a work as this requires but the pathetic it contains particularly in the last stanza but one is exquisitely fine  i mourn hapless caledonia mourn thy banished peace thy laurels torn thy sons for valor

hapless caledonia mourn thy banished peace thy laurels torn on the death of the lord protector our poetry was not quite harmonized in wallers time so that this which would be now looked upon as a slovenly sort of versification was with respect to the times in which it was written almost a prodigy of harmony a modern reader will chiefly be struck with the strength of thinking and the turn of the compliments bestowed upon the usurper every body has heard the answer our poet made charles ii who asked him how his poem upon cromwell came to be finer than his panegyric upon himself your majesty replies waller knows that poets always succeed best in fiction  we must resign heaven his great soul does claim in storms as loud as his immortal fame his dying groans his last breath shakes our isle and trees uncut fall for his funeral pile about his palace their broad roots are tossed into the air  so romulus was lost new rome in such a tempest missed her king and from obeying fell to worshipping on oetas top thus hercules lay dead with ruined oaks and pines about him spread the poplar too whose bough he wont to wear on his victorious head lay prostrate there those his last fury from the mountain rent our dying hero from the continent ravished whole towns and forts from spaniards reft as his last legacy to britain left the ocean which so long our hopes confined could give no limits to his vaster mind our bounds enlargement was his latest toil nor has he left us prisoners to our isle under the tropic is our language spoke and part of flanders has received our yoke from civil broils he did us disengage found nobler objects for our martial rage and with wise conduct to his country showed the ancient way of conquering abroad ungrateful then if we no tears allow to him that gave us peace and empire too princes that feared him grieve concerned to see no pitch of glory from the grave is free nature herself took notice of his death and sighing swelled the sea with such a breath that to remotest shores her billows rolled the approaching fate of their great ruler told the story of phoebus and daphne applied the french claim this as belonging to them to whomsoever it belongs the thought is finely turned  thyrsis a youth of the inspired train fair sacharissa loved but loved in vain like phoebus sung the no less amorous boy like daphne she as lovely and as coy with numbers he the flying nymph pursues with numbers such as phoebus self might use such is the chase when love and fancy leads over craggy mountains and through flowery meads invoked to testify the lovers care or form some image of his cruel fair urged with his fury like a wounded deer over these he fled and now approaching near had reached the nymph with his harmonious lay whom all his charms could not incline to stay yet what he sung in his immortal strain though unsuccessful was not sung in vain all but the nymph that should redress his wrong attend his passion and approve his song like phoebus thus acquiring unsought praise he caught at love and filled his arms with bays night thoughts by dr young these seem to be the best of the collection from whence only the two first are taken they are spoken of differently either with exaggerated applause or contempt as the readers disposition is either turned to mirth or melancholy  night the first on life death and immortality tired natures sweet restorer balmy sleep he like the world his ready visit pays where fortune smiles the wretched he forsakes swift on his downy pinions flies from woe and lights on lids unsullied with a tear from short as usual and disturbed repose i wake how happy they who wake no more yet that were vain if dreams infest the grave i wake emerging from a sea of dreams tumultuous where my wrecked desponding thought from wave to wave of fancied misery at random drove her helm of reason lost though now restored it is only change of pain a bitter change severer for severe the day too short for my distress and night even in the zenith of her dark domain is sunshine to the color of my fate night sable goddess from her ebon throne in rayless majesty now stretches forth her leaden scepter over a slumbering world silence how dead and darkness how profound nor eye nor listening ear an object finds creation sleeps it is as the general pulse of life stood still and nature made a pause an awful pause prophetic of her end and let her prophecy be soon fulfilled fate drop the curtain i can lose no more silence and darkness solemn sisters twins from ancient night who nurse the tender thought to reason and on reason build resolve that column of true majesty in man assist me i will thank yon in the grave the grave your kingdom there this frame shall fall a victim sacred to your dreary shrine but what are ye  thou who did put to flight primaeval silence when the morning stars exulting shouted over the rising ball o thou whose word from solid darkness struck that spark the sun strike wisdom from my soul my soul which flies to thee her trust her treasure as misers to their gold while others rest through this opaque of nature and of soul this double night transmit one pitying ray to lighten and to cheer o lead my mind a mind that fain would wander from its woe lead it through various scenes of life and death and from each scene the noblest truths inspire nor less inspire my conduct than my song teach my best reason reason my best will teach rectitude and fix my firm resolve wisdom to wed and pay her long arrear nor let the phial of thy vengeance poured on this devoted head be poured in vain the bell strikes one we take no note of time but from its loss to give it then a tongue is wise in man as if an an angel spoke i feel the solemn sound if heard aright it is the knell of my departed hours where are they with the years beyond the flood it is the signal that demands dispatch how much is to be done my hopes and fears start up alarmed and over lifes narrow verge

perpetual in perpetual change of stable pleasures on the tossing wave eternal sunshine in the storms of life how richly were my noontide trances hung with gorgeous tapestries of pictured joys joy behind joy in endless perspective till at deaths toll whose restless iron tongue calls daily for his millions at a meal starting i woke and found myself undone where now my phrensys pompous furniture

moment plays his little weapon in the narrower sphere of sweet domestic comfort and cuts down the fairest bloom of sublunary bliss bliss sublunary bliss  proud words and vain implicit treason to divine decree a bold invasion of the rights of heaven i clasped the phantoms and i found them air o had i weighed it ever my fond embrace what darts of agony had missed my heart death great proprietor

flushed thy glowing cheek ambition truly great of virtuous praise deaths subtle seed within sly treacherous miner working in the dark smiled at thy wellconcerted scheme and beckoned the worm to riot on that rose so red unfaded ere it fell one moments prey mans foresight is conditionally wise lorenzo wisdom into folly turns often the first instant its idea fair to laboring thought is born how dim our eye the present moment terminates our sight clouds thick as those on doomsday drown the next we penetrate we prophesy in vain time is dealt out by particles and each ere mingled with the streaming sands of life by fates inviolable oath is sworn deep silence where eternity begins by natures law what may be may be now there is no prerogative in human hours in human hearts what bolder thought can rise than mans presumption on tomorrows dawn where is tomorrow in another world for numbers this is certain the reverse is sure to none and yet on this perhaps this peradventure infamous for lies as on a rock of adamant we build our mountain hopes spin our eternal schemes as we the fatal sisters would outspin and big with lifes futurities expire not even philander had bespoke his shroud nor had he cause a warning was denied how many fall as sudden not as safe as sudden though for years admonisht home of human ills the last extreme beware beware lorenzo a slowsudden death how dreadful that deliberate surprise be wise today it is madness to defer next day the fatal precedent will plead thus on till wisdom is pushed out of life procrastination is the thief of time year after year it steals till all is fled and to the mercies of a moment leaves the vast concerns of an eternal scene if not so frequent would not this be strange that it is so frequent this is stranger still of mans miraculous mistakes this bears the palm that all men are about to live for ever on the brink of being born all pay themselves the compliment to think they one day shall not drivel and their pride on this reversion takes up ready praise at least their own their future selves applauds how excellent that life they never will lead time lodged in their own hands is follys vails that lodged in fates to wisdom they consign the thing they cannot but purpose they postpone it is not in folly not to scorn a fool and scarce in human wisdom to do more all promise is poor dilatory man and that through every stage when young indeed in full content we sometimes nobly rest unanxious for ourselves and only wish as duteous sons our fathers were more wise at thirty man suspects himself a fool knows it at forty and reforms his plan at fifty chides his infamous delay pushes his prudent purpose to resolve in all the magnanimity of thought resolves and reresolves then dies the same and why because he thinks himself immortal all men think all men mortal but themselves themselves when some alarming shock of fate strikes through their wounded hearts the sudden dread but their hearts wounded like the wounded air soon close where passed the shaft no trace is found as from the wing no scar the sky retains the parted wave no furrow from the keel so dies in human hearts the thought of death even with the tender tear which nature sheds over those we love we drop it in their grave can i forget philander that were strange o my full heart  but should i give it vent the longest night though longer far would fail and the lark listen to my midnight song the sprightly larks shrill matin wakes the morn griefs sharpest thorn hard pressing on my breast i strive with wakeful melody to cheer the sullen gloom sweet philomel like thee and call the stars to listen every star is deaf to mine enamored of thy lay yet be not vain there are who thine excel and charm through distant ages wrapped in shade prisoner of darkness to the silent hours how often i repeat their rage divine to lull my griefs and steal my heart from woe i roll their raptures but not catch their fire dark though not blind like thee maeonides or milton thee ah could i reach your strain or his who made maeonides our own man too he sung immortal man i sing often bursts my song beyond the bounds of life what now but immortality can please o had he pressed his theme pursued the track which opens out of darkness into day o had he mounted on his wing of fire soared where i sink and sung immortal man how had it blessed mankind and rescued me night the second on time death friendship when the cock crew he wept  smote by that eye which looks on me on all that power who bids this midnight sentinel with clarion shrill emblem of that which shall awake the dead rouse souls from slumber into thoughts of heaven shall i too weep where then is fortitude and fortitude abandoned where is man i know the terms on which he sees the light he that is born is listed life is war eternal war with woe who bears it best deserves it least  on other themes i will dwell lorenzo let me turn my thoughts on thee and thine on themes may

pride pride that impartial passion reigns through all attends our glory nor deserts our fall as in its home it triumphs in high place and frowns a haughty exile in disgrace some lords it bids admire their wands so white which bloom like aarons to their ravished sight some lords it bids resign and turns their wands like moses into serpents in their hands these sink as diverse for renown and boast with pride inverted of their honors lost but against reason sure it is equal sin to boast of merely being out or in what numbers here through odd ambition strive to seem the most transported things alive as if by joy desert was understood and all the fortunate were wise or good hence aching bosoms wear a visage gay and stifled groans frequent the ball and play completely dressed by monteuel and grimace they take their birthday suit and public face their smiles are only part of what they wear put off at night with lady b  s hair what bodily fatigue is half so bad with anxious care they labor to be glad what numbers here would into fame advance conscious of merit in the coxcombs dance the tavern park assembly mask and play those dear destroyers of the tedious day that wheel of fops that

shenstone are chiefly commended for the natural simplicity of the thoughts and the harmony of the versification however they are not excellent in either  i absence i ye shepherds so cheerful and gay whose flocks never carelessly roam should corydons happen to stray oh call the poor wanderers home allow me to muse and to sigh nor talk of the change that ye find none once was so watchful as i  i have left my dear phyllis behind ii now i know what it is to have strove with the torture of doubt and desire what it is to admire and to love and to leave her we love and admire ah lead forth my flock in the morn and the damps of each evening repel alas i am faint and forlorn  i have bade my dear phyllis farewell iii since phyllis vouchsafed me a look i never once dreamt of my vine may i lose both my pipe and my crook if i knew of a kid that was mine i prized every hour that went by beyond all that had pleased me before but now they are passed and i sigh and i grieve that i prized them no more iv but why do i languish in vain why wander thus pensively here oh why did i come from the plain where i fed on the smiles of my dear they tell me my favorite maid the pride of that valley is flown alas where with her i have strayed i could wander with pleasure alone v when forced the fair nymph to forego what anguish i felt at my heart yet i thought  but it might not be so  twas with pain that she saw me depart she gazed as i slowly withdrew my path i could hardly discern so sweetly she bade me adieu i thought that she bade me return vi the pilgrim that journeys all day to visit some far distant shrine if he bear but a relic away is happy nor heard to repine thus widely removed from the fair where my vows my devotion i owe soft hope is the relic i bear and my solace wherever i go ii hope i my banks they are furnished with bees whose murmur invites one to sleep my grottoes are shaded with trees and my hills are white over with sheep i seldom have met with a loss such health do my fountains bestow my fountains all bordered with moss where the harebells and violets grow ii not a pine in my grove is there seen but with tendrils of woodbine is bound not a beechs more beautiful green but a sweetbriar twines it around not my fields in the prime of the year more charms than my cattle unfold not a brook that is limpid and clear but it glitters with fishes of gold iii one would think she might like to retire to the bower i have labored to rear not a shrub that i heard her admire but i hasted and planted it there o how sudden the jessamin strove with the lilac to render it gay already it calls for my love to prune the wild branches away iv from the plains from the woodlands and groves what strains of wild melody flow how the nightingales warble their loves from thickets of roses that blow and when her bright form shall appear each bird shall harmoniously join in a concert so soft and so clear as  she may not be fond to resign v i have found out a gift for my fair i have found where the woodpigeons breed but let me that plunder forbear she will say twas a barbarous deed for he never could be true she averred who could rob a poor bird of its young and i loved her the more when i heard such tenderness fall from her tongue vi i have heard her with sweetness unfold how that pity was due to  a dove that it ever attended the bold and she called it the sister of love but her words such a pleasure convey so much i her accents adore let her speak and whatever she say methinks i should love her the more vii can a bosom so gentle remain unmoved when her corydon sighs will a nymph that is fond of the plain these plains and this valley despise dear regions of silence and shade soft scenes of contentment and ease where i could have pleasingly strayed if aught in her absence could please viii but where does my phyllida stray and where are her grots and her bowers are the groves and the valleys as gay and the shepherds as gentle as ours the groves may perhaps be as fair and the face of the valleys as fine the swains may in manners compare but their love is not equal to mine iii solicitude i why will you my passion reprove why term it a folly to grieve ere i show you the charms of my love she is fairer than you can believe with her mien she enamours the brave with her wit she engages the free with her modesty pleases the grave she is every way pleasing to me ii o you that have been of her train come and join in my amorous lays i could lay down my life for the swain that will sing but a song in her praise when he sings may the nymphs of the town come trooping and listen the while nay on him let not phillida frown  but i cannot allow her to smile iii for when paridel tries in the dance any favor with phyllis to find o how with one trivial glance might she ruin the peace of my mind in ringlets he dresses his hair and his crook is bestudded around and his pipe  oh may phyllis beware of a magic there is in the sound iv it is his with mock passion to glow it is his in smooth tales to unfold how her face is as bright as the snow and her bosom be sure is as cold how the nightingales labor the strain with the notes of his charmer to vie how they vary their accents in vain repine at her triumphs and die v to the grove or the garden he strays and pillages every sweet then suiting the wreath to his lays he throws it at phylliss feet o phyllis he whispers more fair more sweet than the jessamines flower what are pinks in a morn to compare what is eglantine after a shower vi then the lily no longer is white then the rose is deprived of its bloom then the violets die with despite and the woodbines give up their perfume thus glide the soft numbers along and he fancies no shepherd his peer yet i never should envy the song were not phyllis to lend it an ear vii let his crook be with hyacinths bound so phyllis the trophy despise let his forehead with laurels be crowned so they shine not in phylliss eyes the language that flows from the heart is a stranger to paridels tongue  yet may she beware of his art or sure i must envy the song iv disappointment i ye shepherds give ear to my lay and take no more heed of my sheep they have nothing to do but to stray i have nothing to do but to weep yet do not my folly reprove she was fair  and my passion begun she smiled  and i could not but love she is faithless  and i am undone ii perhaps i was void of all thought perhaps it was plain to foresee that a nymph so complete would be sought by a swain more engaging than me ah love every hope can inspire it banishes wisdom the while and the lip of the nymph we admire seems for ever adorned with a smile iii she is faithless and i am undone ye that witness the woes i endure let reason instruct you to shun what it cannot instruct you to cure beware how you loiter in vain amid nymphs of an higher degree it is not for me to explain how fair and how fickle they be iv alas from the day that we met what hope of an end to my woes when i cannot endure to forget the glance that undid my repose yet time may diminish the pain the flower and the shrub and the tree which i reared for her pleasure in vain in time may have comfort for me v the sweets of a dewsprinkled rose the sound of a murmuring stream the peace which from solitude flows henceforth shall be corydons theme high transports are shown to the sight but we are not to find them our own fate never bestowed such delight as i with my phyllis had known vi o ye woods spread your branches apace to your deepest recesses i fly i would hide with the beasts of the chase i would vanish from every eye yet my reed shall resound through the grove with the same sad complaint it begun how she smiled and i could not but love was faithless and i am undone phoebe a pastoral this by dr byron is a better effort than the preceding  i my time o ye muses was happily spent when phoebe went with me wherever i went ten thousand soft pleasures i felt in my breast sure never fond shepherd like colin was blessed but now she is gone and has left me behind what a mavelous change on a sudden i find when things were as fine as could possibly be i thought it was spring but alas it was she ii the fountain that wont to run sweetly along and dance to soft murmurs the pebbles among thou know little cupid if phoebe was there it was pleasure to look at twas music to hear but now she is absent i walk by its side and still as it murmurs do nothing but chide must you be so cheerful whilst i go in pain peace there with your bubbling and hear me complain iii my dog i was ever well pleased to see come wagging his tail to my fair one and me and phoebe was pleased too and to my dog said come hither poor fellow and patted his head but now when he is fawning i with a sour look cry sirrah and give him a blow with my crook and i will give him another for why should not tray be dull as his master when phoebes away iv sweet music went with us both all the wood through the lark linnet throstle and nightingale too winds over us whispered flocks by us did bleat and chirp went the grasshopper under our feet but now she is absent though still they sing on the woods are but lonely the melodys gone her voice in the concert as now i have found gives every thing else its agreeable sound v will no pitying power that hears me complain or cure my disquiet or soften my pain to be cured thou must collin thy passion remove but what swain is so silly to live without love no deity bid the dear nymph to return for never was poor shepherd so sadly forlorn ah what shall i do i shall die with despair take heed all ye swains how you love one so fair a song this by mr row is better than any thing of the kind in our language  i despairing beside a clear stream a shepherd forsaken was laid and while a false nymph was his theme a willow supported his head the wind that blew over the plain to his sighs with a sigh did reply and the brook in return to his pain ran mournfully murmuring by ii alas silly swain that i was thus sadly complaining he cried when first i beheld that fair face twere better by far i had died she talked and i blessed her dear tongue when she smiled it was pleasure too great i listened and cried when she sung was nightingale ever so sweet iii how foolish was i to believe she could dote on so lowly a clown or that her fond heart would not grieve to forsake the fine folk of the town to think that a beauty so gay so kind and so constant would prove or go clad like our maidens in gray or live in a cottage on love iv what though i have skill to complain though the muses my temples have crowned what though when they hear my soft strains the virgins sit weeping around ah colin thy hopes are in vain thy pipe and thy laurel resign thy fair one inclines to a swain whose music is sweeter than thine v all you my companions so dear who sorrow to see me betrayed whatever i suffer forbear forbear to accuse the false maid though through the wide world i should range it is in vain from my fortune to fly twas here is to be false and to change it is mine to be constant and die vi if while my hard fate i sustain in her breast any pity is found let her come with the nymphs of the plain and see me laid low in the ground the last humble boon that i crave is to shade me with cypress and yew and when she looks down on my grave let her own that her shepherd was true vii then to her new love let her go and deck her in golden array be finest at every fine show and frolic it all the long day while colin forgotten and gone no more shall be talked of or seen unless when beneath the pale moon his ghost shall glide over the green an essay on poetry this work by the duke of buckingham is enrolled among our great english productions the precepts are sensible the poetry not indifferent but it has been praised more than it deserves  of all those arts in which the wise excel natures chief masterpiece is writing well no writing lifts exalted man so high as sacred and soulmoving poesy no kind of work requires so nice a touch and if well finished nothing shines so much but heaven forbid we should be so profane to grace the vulgar with that noble name it is not a flash of fancy which sometimes dazzling our minds sets off the slightest rhimes bright as a blaze but in a moment done true wit is everlasting like the sun which though sometimes behind a cloud retired breaks out again and is by all admired number and rhyme and that harmonious sound which not the nicest ear with harshness wound are necessary yet but vulgar arts and all in vain these superficial parts contribute to the structure of the whole without a genius too for that is the soul a spirit which inspires the work throughout as that of nature moves the world about a flame that glows amidst conceptions fit even something of divine and more than wit itself unseen yet all things by it shown describing all men but described by none where do thou dwell what caverns of the brain can such a vast and mighty thing contain when i at vacant hours in vain thy absence mourn oh where do thou retire and why do thou return sometimes with powerful charms to hurry me away from pleasures of the night and business of the day even now too far transported i am fain to check thy course and use the needful rein as all is dullness when the fancys bad so without judgment fancy is but mad and judgment has a boundless influence not only in the choice of words or sense but on the world on manners and on men fancy is but the feather of the pen reason is that substantial useful part which gains the head while the other wins the heart here i shall all the various sorts of verse and the whole art of poetry rehearse but who that task would after horace do the best of masters and examples too echoes at best all we can say is vain dull the design and fruitless were the pain it is true the ancients we may rob with ease but who with that mean shift himself can please without an actors pride a players art is above his who writes a borrowed part yet modern laws are made for later faults and new absurdities inspire new thoughts what need has satire then to live on theft when so much fresh occasion still is left fertile our soil and full of rankest weeds and monsters worse than ever nilus breeds but hold the fools shall have no cause to fear it is wit and sense that is the subject here defects of witty men deserve a cure and those who are so will even this endure first then of songs which now so much abound without his song no fop is to be found a most offensive weapon which he draws on all he meets against apollos laws though nothing seems more easy yet no part of poetry requires a nicer art for as in rows of richest pearl there lies many a blemish that escape our eyes the least of which defects is plainly shown in one small ring and brings the value down so songs should be to just perfection brought yet where can one be seen without a fault exact propriety of words and thought expression easy and the fancy high yet that not seem to creep nor this to fly no words transposed but in such order all as wrought with care yet seem by chance to fall here as in all things else is most unfit bare ribaldry that poor pretense to wit such nauseous songs by a late author made call an unwilling censure on his shade not that warm thoughts of the transporting joy can shock the chastest or the nicest cloy but words obscene too gross to move desire like heaps of fuel only choke the fire on other themes he well deserves our praise but palls that appetite he meant to raise next elegy of sweet but solemn voice and of a subject grave exacts the choice the praise of beauty valor wit contains and there too often despairing love complains in vain alas for who by wit is moved that phoenixshe deserves to be beloved but noisy nonsense and such fops as vex mankind take most with that fantastic sex this to the praise of those who better knew the many raise the value of the few but here as all our sex too often have tried women have drawn my wandering thoughts aside their greatest fault who in this kind have writ is not defect in words or want of wit but should this muse harmonious numbers yield and every couplet be with fancy filled if yet a just coherence be not made between each thought and the whole model laid so right that every line may higher rise like goodly mountains till they reach the skies such trifles may perhaps of late have passed and may be liked awhile but never last it is epigram it is point it is what you will but not an elegy nor writ with skill no panegyric nor a coopers hill a higher flight and of a happier force are odes the muses most unruly horse that bounds so fierce the rider has no rest here foams at mouth and moves like one possessed the poet here must be indeed inspired with fury too as well as fancy fired cowley might boast to have performed this part had he with nature joined the rules of art but sometimes diction mean or verse illwrought deadens or clouds his noble frame of thought though all appear in heat and fury done the language still must soft and easy run these laws may sound a little too severe but judgment yields and fancy governs here which though extravagant this muse allows and makes the work much easier than it shows of all the ways that wisest men could find to mend the age and mortify mankind satire wellwrit has most successful proved and cures because the remedy is loved it is hard to write on such a subject more without repeating things said often before some vulgar errors only well remove that stain a beauty which we so much love of chosen words some take not care enough and think they should be as the subject rough this poem must be more exactly made and sharpest thoughts in smoothest words conveyed some think if sharp enough they cannot fail as if their only business was to rail but human frailty nicely to unfold distinguishes a satyr from a scold rage you must hide and prejudice lay down a satyrs smile is sharper than his frown so while you seem to slight some rival youth malice itself may pass sometimes for truth the laureat here may justly claim our praise crowned by mackfleckno with immortal bays yet once his pegasus has borne dead weight rid by some lumpish minister of state here rest my muse suspend thy cares awhile a more important task attends thy toil as some young eagle that designs to fly a long unwonted journey through the sky weighs all the dangerous enterprise before over what wide lands and seas she is to soar doubts her own strength so far and justly fears that lofty road of airy travelers but yet incited by some bold design that does her hopes beyond her fears incline prunes every feather views herself with care at last resolved she cleaves the yielding air away she flies so strong so high so fast she lessens to us and is lost at last so though too weak for such a weighty thing the muse inspires a sharper note to sing and why should truth offend when only told to guide the ignorant and warn the bold on then my muse adventrously engage to give instructions that concern the stage the unities of action time and place which if observed give plays so great a grace are though but little practiced too well known to be taught here where we pretend alone from nicer faults to purge the present age less obvious errors of the english stage first then soliloquies had need be few extremely short and spoke in passion too our lovers talking to themselves for want of others make the pit their confidant nor is the matter mended yet if thus they trust a friend only to tell it us the occasion should as naturally fall as when bellario confesses all figures of speech which poets think so fine arts needless varnish to make nature shine are all but paint upon a beauteous face and in descriptions only claim a place but to make rage declaim and grief discourse from lovers in despair fine things to force must needs succeed for who can choose but pity a dying hero miserably witty but oh the dialogues where jest and mock is held up like a rest at shittlecock or else like bells eternally they chime they sigh in simile and die in rhyme what things are these who would be poets thought by nature not inspired nor learning taught some wit they have and therefore they deserve a better course than this by which they starve but to write plays why it is a bold pretense to judgment breeding wit and eloquence nay more for they must look within to find those secret turns of nature in the mind without this part in vain would be the whole and but a body all without a soul all this united yet but makes a part of dialogue that great and powerful art now almost lost which the old grecians knew from whom the romans fainter copies drew scarce comprehended since but by a few plato and lucian are the best remains of all the wonders which this art contains yet to ourselves we justice must allow shakespeare and fletcher are the wonders now consider them and read them over and over go see them played then read them as before for though in many things they grossly fail over our passions still they so prevail that our own grief by theirs is rocked asleep the dull are forced to feel the wise to weep their beauties imitate avoid their fau first on a plot employ thy careful thoughts turn it with time a thousand several ways this often alone has given success to plays reject that vulgar error which appears so fair of making perfect characters there is no such thing in nature and you will draw a faultless monster which the world never saw some faults must be that his misfortunes drew but such as may deserve compassion too besides the main design composed with art each moving scene must be a plot apart contrive each little turn mark every place as painters first chalk out the future face yet be not fondly your own slave for this but change hereafter what appears amiss think not so much where shining thoughts to place as what a man would say in such a case neither in comedy will this suffice the player too must be before your eyes and though it is drudgery to stoop so low to him you must your secret meaning show expose no single fop but lay the load more equally and spread the folly broad mere coxcombs are too obvious often we see a fool derided by as bad as he hawks fly at nobler game in this low way a very owl may prove a bird of prey small poets thus will one poor fop devour but to collect like bees from every flower ingredients to compose that precious juice which serves the world for pleasure and for use in spite of faction this would favor get but falstaff stands inimitable yet another fault which often may befall is when the wit of some great poet shall so overflow that is be none at all that even his fools speak sense as if possessed and each by inspiration breaks his jest if once the justness of each part be lost well we may laugh but at the poets cost that silly thing men call sheerwit avoid with which our age so nauseously is cloyed humor is all wit should be only brought to turn agreeably some proper thought but since the poets we of late have known shine in no dress so much as in their own the better by example to convince cast but a view on this wrong side of sense first a soliloquy is calmly made where every reason is exactly weighed which once performed most opportunely comes some hero frighted at the noise of drums for her sweet sake whom at first sight he loves and all in metaphor his passion proves but some sad accident though yet unknown parting this pair to leave the swain alone he strait grows jealous though we know not why then to oblige his rival needs will die but first he makes a speech wherein he tells the absent nymph how much his flame excels and yet bequeaths her generously now to that loved rival whom he does not know who strait appears but who can fate withstand too late alas to hold his hasty hand that just has given himself the cruel stroke at which his very rivals heart is broke he more to his new friend than mistress kind most sadly mourns at being left behind of such a death prefers the pleasing charms to love and living in a ladys arms what shameful and what monstrous things are these and then they rail at those they cannot please conclude us only partial to the dead and grudge the sign of old ben johnsons head when the intrinsic value of the stage can scarce be judged but by a following age for dances flutes italian songs and rhyme may keep up sinking nonsense for a time but that must fail which now so much oerrules and sense no longer will submit to fools by painful steps at last we labor up parnassus hill on whose bright airy top the epick poets so divinely show and with just pride behold the rest below heroic poems have a just pretense to be the utmost stretch of human sense a work of such inestimable worth there are but two the world has yet brought forth homer and virgil with what sacred awe do those mere sounds the worlds attention draw just as a changeling seems below the rest of men or rather is a twoleggd beast so these gigantic souls amazed we find as much above the rest of human kind natures whole strength united endless fame and universal shouts attend their name read homer once and you can read no more for all books else appear so mean so poor verse will seem prose but still persist to read and homer will be all the books you need had bossu never writ the world had still like indians viewed this wondrous piece of skill as something of divine the work admired not hoped to be instructed but inspired but he disclosing sacred mysteries has shown where all the mighty magic lies described the seeds and in what order sown that have to such a vast proportion grown sure from some angel he the secret knew who through this labyrinth has lent the clue but what alas avails it poor mankind to see this promised land yet stay behind the way is shown but who has strength to go who can all sciences profoundly know whose fancy flies beyond weak reasons sight and yet has judgment to direct it right whose just discernment virgillike is such never to say too little or too much let such a man begin without delay but he must do beyond what i can say must above tassos lofty flights prevail succeed where spencer and even milton fail cadenus and vanessa this is thought one of dr swifts correctest pieces its chief merit indeed is the elegant ease with which a story but ill conceived in itself is told  the shepherds and the nymphs were seen pleading before the cyprian queen the council for the fair began accusing the false creature man the brief with weighty crimes was charged on which the pleader much enlarged that cupid now has lost his art or blunts the point of every dart  his altar now no longer smokes his mothers aid no youth invokes this tempts freethinkers to refine and bring in doubt their powers divine now love is dwindled to intrigue and marriage grown a moneyleague which crimes aforesaid with her leave were as he humbly did conceive against our sovereign ladys peace against the statute in that case against her dignity and crown then prayed an answer and sat down the nymphs with scorn beheld their foes when the defendants council rose and what no lawyer ever lacked with impudence owned all the fact but what the gentlest heart would vex laid all the fault on the other sex that modern love is no such thing as what those ancient poets sing a fire celestial chaste refined conceived and kindled in the mind which having found an equal flame unites and both become the same in different breasts together burn together both to ashes turn but women now feel no such fire and only know the gross desire their passions move in lower spheres wherever caprice or folly steers a dog a parrot or an ape or some worse brute in human shape engross the fancies of the fair the few soft moments they can spare from visits to receive and pay from scandal politics and play from fans and flounces and brocades from equipage and parkparades from all the thousand female toys from every trifle that employs the out or inside of their heads between their toylets and their beds in a dull stream which moving slow you hardly see the current flow if a small breeze obstructs the course it whirls about for want of force and in its narrow circle gathers nothing but chaff and straws and feathers the current of a female mind stops thus and turns with every wind thus whirling round together draws fools fops and rakes for chaff and straws hence we conclude no womens hearts are won by virtue wit and parts nor are the men of sense to blame for breasts incapable of flame the fault must on the nymphs be placed grown so corrupted in their taste the pleader having spoke his best had witness ready to attest who fairly could on oath depose when questions on the fact arose that every article was true nor further those deponents knew  therefore he humbly would insist the bill might be with costs dismissed the cause appeared of so much weight that venus from her judgment seat desired them not to talk so loud else she must interpose a cloud for if the heavenly folk should know these pleadings in the court below that mortals here disdain to love she never could show her face above for gods their betters are too wise to value that which men despise and then said she my son and i must strole in air twixt earth and sky or else shut out from heaven and earth fly to the sea my place of birth there live with daggled mermaids pent and keep on fish perpetual lent but since the case appeared so nice she thought it best to take advice the muses by their kings permission though foes to love attend the session and on the right hand took their places in order on the left the graces to whom she might her doubts propose on all emergencies that rose the muses often were seen to frown the graces halfashamd looked down and twas observed there were but few of either sex among the crew whom she or her assessors knew the goddess soon began to see things were not ripe for a decree and said she must consult her books the lovers fletas bractons cooks first to a dapper clerk she beckoned to turn to ovid book the second she then referred them to a place in virgil vide didos case as for tibulluss reports they never passed for law in courts for cowleys briefs and pleas of waller still their authority was smaller there was on both sides much to say she would hear the cause another day and so she did and then a third she heard it  there she kept her word but with rejoinders and replies long bills and answers stuffed with lies demur imparlance and essoign the parties never could issue join for sixteen years the cause was spun and then stood where it first begun now gentle clio sing or say what venus meant by this delay the goddess much perplexed in mind to see her empire thus declined when first this grand debate arose above her wisdom to compose conceived a project in her head to work her ends which if it sped would show the merits of the cause far better than consulting laws in a glad hour lucinas aid produced on earth a wondrous maid on whom the queen of love was bent to try a new experiment she threw her law books on the shelf and thus debated with herself since men allege they never can find those beauties in a female mind which raise a flame that will endure for ever incorrupt and pure if it is with reason they complain this instant shall restore my reign i will search where every virtue dwells from courts inclusive down to cells what preachers talk or sages write these i will gather and unite and represent them to mankind collected in that infants mind this said she plucks in heavens high bowers a sprig of amaranthine flowers in nectar thrice infuses bays three times refined in titans rays then calls the graces to her aid and sprinkles thrice the newborn maid from whence the tender skin assumes a sweetness above all perfumes from whence a cleanliness remains incapable of outward stains from whence that decency of mind so lovely in the female kind where not one careless thought intrudes less modest than the speech of prudes where never blush was called in aid that spurious virtue in a maid a virtue but at secondhand they blush because they understand the graces next would act their part and showed but little of their art their work was half already done the child with native beauty shone the outward form no help required each breathing on her thrice inspired that gentle soft engaging air which in old times adorned the fair and said vanessa be the name by which you shall be known to fame vanessa by the gods enrolled her name on earth  shall not be told but still the work was not complete when venus thought on a deceit drawn by her doves away she flies and finds out pallas in the skies dear pallas i have been this morn to see a lovely infant born a boy in yonder isle below so like my own without his bow by beauty could your heart be won you would swear it is apollos son but it shall never be said a child so hopeful has by me been spoiled i have enough besides to spare and give him wholly to your care wisdoms above suspecting wiles the queen of learning gravely smiles down from olympus comes with joy mistakes vanessa for a boy then sows within her tender mind seeds long unknown to womankind for manly bosoms chiefly fit the seeds of knowledge judgment wit her soul was suddenly endud with justice truth and fortitude with honor which no breath can stain which malice must attack in vain with open heart and bounteous hand but pallas here was at a stand she knew in our degenerate days bare virtue could not live on praise  that meat must be with money bought she therefore upon second thought infused yet as it were by stealth some small regard for state and wealth of which as she grew up there stayed a tincture in the prudent maid she managed her estate with care yet liked three footmen to her chair but lest he should neglect her studies like a young heir the thrifty goddess for fear young master should be spoiled would use him like a younger child and after long computing found twould come to just five thousand pound the queen of love was pleased and proud to see vanessa thus endowed she doubted not but such a dame through every breast would dart a flame that every rich and lordly swain with pride would drag about her chain that scholars would desert their books to study bright vanessas looks as she advanced that womankind would by her model form their mind and all their conduct would be tried by her as an unerring guide offending daughters often would hear vanessas praise rung in their ear miss betty when she does a fault lets fall a knife or spills the salt will thus be by her mother chid it is what vanessa never did thus by the nymphs and swains adored my power shall be again restored and happy lovers bless my reign  so venus hoped but hoped in vain for when in time the martial maid found out the trick that venus played she shakes her helm she knits her brows and fired with indignation vows tomorrow ere the setting sun she would all undo that she had done but in the poets we may find a wholesome law time out of mind had been confirmed by fates decree that gods of whatsoever degree resume not what themselves have given or any brothergod in heaven which keeps the peace among the gods or they must always be at odds and pallas if she broke the laws must yield her foe the stronger cause a shame to one so much adored for wisdom at joves council board besides she feared the queen of love would meet with better friends above and though she must with grief reflect to see a mortal virgin decked with graces hitherto unknown to female breasts except her own yet she would act as best became a goddess of unspotted fame she knew by augury divine venus would fail in her design she studied well the point and found her foes conclusions were not found from premises erroneous brought and therefore the deductions naught and must have contrary effects to what her treacherous foe expects in proper season pallas meets the queen of love whom thus she greets for gods we are by homer told can in celestial language scold perfidious goddess but in vain you formed this project in your brain a project for thy talents fit with much deceit and little wit thou have as thou shall quickly see deceived thyself instead of me for how can heavenly wisdom prove an instrument to earthly love know thou not yet that men commence thy votaries for want of sense nor shall vanessa be the theme to manage thy abortive scheme she will prove the greatest of thy foes and yet i scorn to interpose but using neither skill nor force leave all things to their natural course the goddess thus pronounced her doom when lo vanessa in her bloom advanced like atalantas star but rarely seen and seen from far in a new world with caution stepped watched all the company she kept well knowing from the books she read what dangerous paths young virgins tread would seldom at the park appear nor saw the playhouse twice a year yet not incurious was inclined to know the converse of mankind first issued from perfumers shops a crowd of fashionable fops they asked her how she liked the play then told the tattle of the day a duel fought last night at two about a lady  you know who mentioned a new italian come either from muscovy or rome gave hints of who and who is together then fell to talking of the weather last night was so extremely fine the ladies walked till after nine then in soft voice and speech absurd with nonsense every second word with fustian from exploded plays they celebrate her beautys praise run over their cant of stupid lies and tell the murders of her eyes with silent scorn vanessa sat scarce listening to their idle chat further than sometimes with a frown when they grew prt to pull them down at last she spitefully was bent to try their wisdoms full extent and said she valued nothing less than titles figure shape and dress that merit should be chiefly placed in judgment knowledge wit and taste and these she offered to dispute alone distinguished man from brute that present times have no pretense to virtue in the noble sense by greeks and romans understood to perish for our countrys good she named the ancient heroes round explained for what they were renowned then spoke with censure or applause of foreign customs rites and laws through nature and through art she ranged and gracefully her subject changed in vain her hearers had no share in all she spoke except to stare their judgment was upon the whole  that lady is the dullest soul  then tipped their forehead in a jeer as who should say  she wants it here she may be handsome young and rich but none will burn her for a witch a party next of glittering dames from round the purlieus of st james came early out of pure good will to see the girl in deshabille their clamor lighting from their chairs grew louder all the way up stairs at entrance loudest where they found the room with volumes litterd round vanessa held montaigne and read whilst mrs susan combed her head they called for tea and chocolate and fell into their usual chat discoursing with important face on ribbons fans and gloves and lace showed patterns just from india brought and gravely asked her what she thought whether the red or green were best and what they cost vanessa guessed as came into her fancy first named half the rates and liked the worst to scandal next  what awkward thing was that last sunday in the ring i am sorry mopsa breaks so fast i said her face would never last corinna with that youthful air is thirty and a bit to spare her fondness for a certain earl began when i was but a girl phillis who but a month ago was married to the tunbridge beau i saw coquetting the other night in public with that odious knight they rallied next vanessas dress that gown was made for old queen bess dear madam let me see your head dont you intend to put on red a petticoat without a hoop sure you are not ashamed to stoop with handsome garters at your knees no matter what a fellow sees filled with disdain with rage inflamed both of herself and sex ashamed the nymph stood silent out of spite nor would vouchsafe to set them right away the fair detractors went and gave by turns their censures vent she is not so handsome in my eyes for wit i wonder where it lies she is fair and clean and that is the most but why proclaim her for a toast a baby face no life no airs but what she learnt at country fairs scarce knows what difference is between rich flanders lace and colberteen i will undertake my little nancy in flounces has a better fancy with all her wit i would not ask her judgment how to buy a mask we begged her but to patch her face she never hit one proper place which every girl at five years old can do as soon as she is told i own that outoffashion stuff becomes the creature well enough the girl might pass if we could get her to know the world a little better to know the world a modern phrase for visits ombre balls and plays thus to the worlds perpetual shame the queen of beauty lost her aim too late with grief she understood pallas had done more harm than good for great examples are but vain where ignorance begets disdain both sexes armed with guilt and spite against vanessas power unite to copy her few nymphs aspired her virtues fewer swains admired so stars beyond a certain height give mortals neither heat nor light yet some of either sex endowed with gifts superior to the crowd with virtue knowledge taste and wit she condescended to admit with pleasing arts she could reduce mens talents to their proper use and with address each genius held to that wherein it most excelled thus making others wisdom known could please them and improve her own a modest youth said something new she placed it in the strongest view all humble worth she strove to raise would not be praised yet loved to praise the learned met with free approach although they came not in a coach some clergy too she would allow nor quarreled at their awkward bow but this was for cadenus sake a gownman of a different make whom pallas once vanessas tutor had fixed on for her coadjutor but cupid full of mischief longs to vindicate his mothers wrongs on pallas all attempts are vain one way he knows to give her pain vows on vanessas heart to take due vengeance for her patrons sake those early seeds by venus sown in spite of pallas now were grown and cupid hoped they would improve by time and ripen into love the boy made use of all his craft in vain discharging many a shaft pointed at colnels lords and beaux cadenus warded off the blows for placing still some books betwixt the darts were in the cover fixed or often blunted and recoiled on plutarchs morals struck were spoiled the queen of wisdom could foresee but not prevent the fates decree and human caution tries in vain to break that adamantine chain vanessa though by pallas taught by love invulnerable thought searching in books for wisdoms aid was in the very search betrayed cupid though all his darts were lost yet still resolved to spare no cost he could not answer to his fame the triumphs of that stubborn dame a nymph so hard to be subdued who neither was coquette nor prude i find said he she wants a doctor both to adore her and instruct her i will give her what she most admires among those venerable fires cadenus is a subject fit grown old in politics and wit caressed by ministers of state of half mankind the dread and hate whatever vexations love attend she need no rivals apprehend her sex with universal voice must laugh at her capricious choice cadenus many things had writ vanessa much esteemed his wit and called for his poetic works mean time the boy in secret lurks and while the book was in her hand the urchin from his private stand took aim and shot with all his strength a dart of such prodigious length it pierced the feeble volume through and deep transfixed her bosom too some lines more moving than the rest stuck to the point that pierced her breast and borne directly to the heart with pains unknown increased her smart vanessa not of years a score dreams of a gown of fortyfour imaginary charms can find in eyes with reading almost blind cadenus now no more appears declined in health advanced in years she fancies music in his tongue nor farther looks but thinks him young what mariner is not afraid to venture in a ship decayed what planter will attempt to yoke a sapling with a falling oak as years increase she brighter shines cadenus with each day declines and he must fall a prey to time while she continues in her prime cadenus common forms apart in every scene had kept his heart had sighed and languishd vowed and writ for pastime or to show his wit but time and books and state affairs had spoiled his fashionable airs he now could praise esteem approve but understood not what was love his conduct might have made him styled a father and the nymph his child that innocent delight he took to see the virgin mind her book was but the masters secret joy in school to hear the finest boy her knowledge with her fancy grew she hourly pressed for something new ideas came into her mind so fast his lessons laggd behind she reasoned without plodding long nor ever gave her judgment wrong but now a sudden change was wrought she minds no longer what he taught cadenus was amazed to find such marks of a distracted mind for though she seemed to listen more to all he spoke than ever before he found her thoughts would absent range yet guessed not whence could spring the change and first he modestly conjectures his pupil might be tired with lectures which helped to mortify his pride yet gave him not the heart to chide but in a mild dejected strain at last he ventured to complain said she should be no longer teased might have her freedom when she pleased was now convinced he acted wrong to hide her from the world so long and in dull studies to engage one of her tender sex and age that every nymph with envy owned how she might shine in the grandemonde and every shepherd was undone to see her cloistered like a nun this was a visionary scheme he waked and found it but a dream a project far above his skill for nature must be nature still if he was bolder than became a scholar to a courtly dame she might excuse a man of letters thus tutors often treat their betters and since his talk offensive grew he came to take his last adieu vanessa filled with just disdain would still her dignity maintain instructed from her early years to scorn the art of female tears had he employed his time so long to teach her what was right and wrong yet could such notions entertain that all his lectures were in vain she owned the wandering of her thoughts but he must answer for her faults she well remembered to her cost that all his lessons were not lost two maxims she could still produce and sad experience taught their use that virtue pleased by being shown knows nothing which it dares not own can make us without fear disclose our inmost secrets to our foes that common forms were not designed directors to a noble mind now said the nymph i will let you see my actions with your rules agree that i can vulgar forms despise and have no secrets to disguise i knew by what you said and writ how dangerous things were men of wit you cautioned me against their charms but never gave me equal arms your lessons found the weakest part aimed at the head but reached the heart cadenus felt within him rise shame disappointment guilt surprise he knew not how to reconcile such language with her usual style and yet her words were so expressed he could not hope she spoke in jest his thoughts had wholly been confined to form and cultivate her mind he hardly knew till he was told whether the nymph were young or old had met her in a public place without distinguishing her face much less could his declining age vanessas earliest thoughts engage and if her youth indiffrence met his person must contempt beget or grant her passion be sincere how shall his innocence be clear appearances were all so strong the world must think him in the wrong would say he made a treacherous use of wit to flatter and seduce the town would swear he had betrayed by magic spells the harmless maid and every bean would have his jokes that scholars were like other folks that when platonic flights were over the tutor turned a mortal lover so tender of the young and fair it showed a true paternal care  five thousand guineas in her purse the doctor might have fancied worse  hardly at length he silence broke and faulterd every word he spoke interpreting her complaisance just as a man fans consequence she rallied well he always knew her manner now was something new and what she spoke was in an air as serious as a tragic player but those who aim at ridicule should fix upon some certain rule which fairly hints they are in jest else he must enter his protest for let a man be never so wise he may be caught with sober lies a science which he never taught and to be free was dearly bought for take it in its proper light it is just what coxcombs call a bite but not to dwell on things minute vanessa finished the dispute brought weighty arguments to prove that reason was her guide in love she thought he had himself described his doctrines when she first imbibed what he had planted now was grown his virtues she might call her own as he approves as he dislikes love or contempt her fancy strikes selflove in nature rooted fast attends us first and leaves us last why she likes him admire not her she loves herself and that is the matter how was her tutor want to praise the geniuss of ancient days those authors he so often had named for learning wit and wisdom famed was struck with love esteem and awe for persons whom he never saw suppose cadenus flourished then he must adore such godlike men if one short volume could comprize all that was witty learned and wise how would it be esteemed and read although the writer long were dead if such an author were alive how all would for his friendship strive and come in crowds to see his face and this she takes to be her case cadenus answers every end the book the author and the friend the utmost her desires will reach is but to learn what he can teach his converse is a system fit alone to fill up all her wit while every passion of her mind in him is centered and confined love can with speech inspire a mute and taught yanessa to dispute this topic never touched before displayed her eloquence the more her knowledge with such pains acquired by this new passion grew inspired through this she made all objects pass which gave a tincture over the mass as rivers though they bend and twine still to the sea their course incline or as philosophers who find some favorite system to their mind in every point to make it fit will force all nature to submit cadenus who could never suspect his lessons would have such effect or be so artfully applied insensibly came on her side it was an unforeseen event things took a turn he never meant whoever excels in what we prize appears a hero in our eyes each girl when pleased with what is taught will have the teacher in her thought the nymph in sober words entreats a truce with all sublime conceits for why such raptures flights and fancies to her who durst not read romances in lofty style to make replies which he had taught her to despise but when her tutor will affect devotion duty and respect he fairly abdicates his throne the government is now her own but though her arguments were strong at least could hardly wish them wrong however it came he could not tell but sure she never talked so well his pride began to interpose preferred before a crowd of beaux so bright a nymph to come unsought such wonder by his merit wrought it is merit must with her prevail he never knew her judgment fail she noted all she ever read and had a most discerning head it is an old maxim in the schools that vanitys the food of fools yet now and then your men of wit will condescend to take a bit so when cadenus could not hide he chose to justify his pride when miss delights in her spinnet a fiddler may a fortune get a blockhead with melodious voice in boardingschools can have his choice and often the dancingmasters art climbs from the toe to touch the heart in learning let a nymph delight the pedant gets a mistress by it cadenus to his grief and shame could scarce oppose vanessas flame where hot and cold where sharp and sweet in all their equipages meet where pleasures mixed with pains appear sorrow with joy and hope with fear wherein his dignity and age forbid cadenus to engage but friendship in its greatest height a constant rational delight on virtues basis fixed to last when loves allurements long are past which gently warms but cannot burn he gladly offers in return his want of passion will redeem with gratitude respect esteem with that devotion we bestow when goddesses appear below while thus cadenus entertains vanessa in exalted strains constring the passion she had shown much to her praise more to his own nature in him had merit placed in her a most judicious taste love hitherto a transient guest never held possession in his breast so long attending at the gate disdained to enter in so late love why do we one passion call when it is a compound of them all he has a forfeiture incurred she vows to take him at his word and hopes he will not think it strange if both should now their stations change the nymph will have her turn to be the tutor and the pupil he though she already can discern her scholar is not apt to learn or wants capacity to reach the science she designs to teach wherein his genius was below the skill of every common beau who though he cannot spell is wise enough to read a ladys eyes and will each accidental glance interpret for a kind advance but what success vanessa met is to the world a secret yet whether the nymph to please her swain talks in a high romantic strain or whether he at last descends to like with less seraphic ends or to compound the business whether they temper love and books together must never to mankind be told nor shall the conscious muse unfold mean time the mournful queen of love led but a weary life above she ventures now to leave the skies grown by vanessas conduct wise for though by one perverse event pallas had crossed her first intent though her design was not obtained yet had she much experience gained and by the project vainly tried could better now the cause decide she gave due notice that both parties coram regina prox die martis should at their peril without fail come and appear and save their bail all met and silence thrice proclaimed one lawyer to each side was named the judge discovered in her face resentments for her late disgrace and full of anger shame and grief directed them to mind their brief nor spend their time to show their reading she would have a summary proceeding she gathered under every head the sum of what each lawyer said gave her own reasons last and then decreed the cause against the men but in a weighty case like this to show she did not judge amiss which evil tongues might else report she made a speech in open court wherein she grievously complains how she was cheated by the swains on whose petition humbly showing that women were not worth the wooing and that unless the sex would mend the race of lovers soon must end she was at lord knows what expense to form a nymph of wit and sense a model for her sex designed who never could one lover find she saw her favor was misplaced the fellows had a wretched taste she needs must tell them to their face they were a senseless stupid race and were she to begin again she would study to reform the men or add some grains of folly more to women than they had before to put them on an equal foot and this or nothing else would do it this might their mutual fancy strike since every being loves its like but now repenting what was done she left all business to her son she puts the world in his possession and let him use it at discretion the cryr was ordered to dismiss the court so made his last o yes the goddess would no longer wait but rising from her chair of state left all below at six and sevn harnessed her doves and flew to heaven alma or the progress of the mind   incert ad stobaeum what prior meant by this poem i cannot understand by the greek motto to it one would think it was either to laugh at the subject or his reader there are some parts of it very fine and let them save the badness of the rest  canto i matthew met richard when or where from story is not mighty clear of many knotty points they spoke and pro and con by turns they took rats half the manuscript have eat dire hunger which we still regret o may they never again digest the horrors of so sad a feast yet less our grief if what remains dear jacob by thy care and pains shall be to future times conveyed it thus begins     here matthew said alma in verse in prose the mind by aristotles pen defined throughout the body squat or tall is bona fide all in all and yet slap dash is all again in every sinew nerve and vein runs here and there like hamlets ghost while every where she rules the roast this system richard we are told the men of oxford firmly hold the cambridge wits you know deny with ipse dixit to comply they say for in good truth they speak with small respect of that old greek that putting all his words together it is three blue beans one blue bladder alma they strenuously maintain sits cockhorse on her throne the brain and from that seat of thought dispenses her sovereign pleasure to the senses two optic nerves they say she ties like spectacles across the eyes by which the spirits bring her word whenever the balls are fixed or stirred how quick at park and play they strike the duke they court the toast they like and at st jamess turn their grace from former friends now out of place without these aids to be more serious her power they hold had been precarious the eyes might have conspired her ruin and she not known what they were doing foolish it had been and unkind that they should see and she be blind wise nature likewise they suppose has drawn two conduits down our nose could alma else with judgment tell when cabbage stinks or roses smell or who would ask for her opinion between an oyster and an onion for from most bodies dick you know some little bits ask leave to flow and as through these canals they roll bring up a sample of the whole like footmen running before coaches to tell the inn what lord approaches by nerves about our palate placed she likewise judges of the taste else dismal thought our warlike men might drink thick port for fine champagne and our illjudging wives and daughters mistake small beer for citronwaters hence too that she might better hear she sets a drum at either ear and loud or gentle harsh or sweet are but the alarums which they beat last to enjoy her sense of feeling a thing she much delights to deal in a thousand little nerves she sends quite to our toes and fingers ends and these in gratitude again return their spirits to the brain in which their figure being printed as just before i think i hinted alma informed can try the case as she had been upon the place thus while the judge gives different journeys to country counsel and attorneys he on the bench in quiet sits deciding as they bring the writs the pope thus prays and sleeps at rome and very seldom stirs from home yet sending forth his holy spies and having heard what they advise he rules the churchs blessed dominions and sets mens faith by his opinions the scholars of the stagyrite who for the old opinion fight would make their modern friends confess the difference but from more to less the mind say they while you sustain to hold her station in the brain you grant at least she is extended ergo the whole dispute is ended for till tomorrow should you plead from form and structure of the head the mind as visibly is seen extended through the whole machine why should all honor then be taken from lower parts to load the brain when other limbs we plainly see each in his way as brisk as he for music grant the head receive it it is the artists hand that gave it and though the skull may wear the laurel the soldiers arm maintains the quarrel besides the nostrils ears and eyes are not his parts but his allies even what you hear the tongue proclaim comes ab origin from them what could the head perform alone if all their friendly aids were gone a foolish figure he must make do nothing else but sleep and ache nor matters it that you can show how to the head the spirits go those spirits started from some goal before they through the veins could roll now we should hold them much to blame if they went back before they came if therefore as we must suppose they came from fingers and from toes or toes or fingers in this case of numsculls self should take the place disputing fair you grant thus much that all sensation is but touch dip but your toes into cold water their correspondent teeth will chatter and strike the bottom of your feet you set your head into a heat the bully beat and happy lover confess that feeling lies all over note here lucretius dares to teach as all our youth may learn from creech that eyes were made but could not view nor hands embrace nor feet pursue but heedless nature did produce the members first and then the use what each must act was yet unknown till all is moved by chance alone a man first builds a country seat then finds the walls not good to eat another plants and wondering sees nor books nor medals on his trees yet poet and philosopher was he who durst such whims aver blessed for his sake be human reason that came at all though late in season but no man sure ever left his house and saddled ball with thoughts so wild to bring a midwife to his spouse before he knew she was with child and no man ever reapt his corn or from the oven drew his bread ere hinds and bakers yet were born that taught them both to sow and knead before they are asked can maids refuse can  pray says dick hold in your muse while you pindaric truths rehearse she hobbles in alternate verse verse mat replied is that my care go on quoth richard soft and fair this looks friend dick as nature had but exercised the salesmans trade as if she happily had sat down and cut out clothes for half the town then sent them out to monmouthstreet to try what persons they would fit but every free and licensed tailor would in this thesis find a failure should whims like these his head perplex how could he work for either sex his clothes as atoms might prevail might fit a pismire or a whale no no he views with studious pleasure your shape before he takes your measure for real kate he made the boddice and not for an ideal goddess no error near his shopboard lurked he knew the folks for whom he worked still to their size he aimed his skill else prythee who would pay his bill next dick if chance herself should vary observe how matters would miscarry across your eyes friend place your shoes your spectacles upon your toes then you and memmius shall agree how nicely men would walk or see but wisdom peevish and crossgrained must be opposed to be sustained and still your knowledge will increase as you make other peoples less in arms and science it is the same our rivals hurts create our fame at fauberts if disputes arise among the champions for the prize to prove who gave the fairer butt john shows the chalks on roberts coat so for the honor of your book it tells where other folks mistook and as their notions you confound those you invent get farther ground the commentators on old aristotle it is urged in judgment vary they to their own conceits have brought the image of his general thought just as the melancholy eye sees fleets and armies in the sky and to the poor apprentice ear the bell sounds whittington lordmayr the conjrer thus explains his scheme thus spirits walk and prophets dream north britons thus have second sight and germans free from gunshot fight theodoret and origin and fifty other learned men attest that if their comments find the traces of their masters mind alma can never decay or die this flatly the other sect deny simplicius theophrast durand great names but hard in verse to stand they wonder men should have mistook the tenets of their masters book and hold that alma yields her breath overcome by age and seized by death now which were wise and which were fools poor alma sits between two stools the more she reads the more perplexed the comment ruining the text now fears now hopes her doubtful fate but richard let her look to that  whilst we our own affairs pursue these different systems old or new a man with half an eye may see were only formed to disagree now to bring things to fair conclusion and save much christian inks effusion let me propose an healing scheme and sail along the middle stream for dick if we could reconcile old aristotle with gassendus how many would admire our toil and yet how few would comprehend us here richard let my scheme commence oh may my words be lost in sense while pleased thalia deigns to write the slips and bounds of almas flight my simple system shall suppose that alma enters at the toes that then she mounts by just degrees up to the ancles legs and knees next as the sap of life does rise she lends her vigor to the thighs and all these underregions past she nestles somewhere near the waist gives pain or pleasure grief or laughter as we shall show at large hereafter mature if not improved by time up to the heart she loves to climb from thence compelled by craft and age she makes the head her latest stage from the feet upward to the head pithy and short says dick proceed dick this is not an idle notion observe the progress of the motion first i demonstratively prove that feet were only made to move and legs desire to come and go for they have nothing else to do hence long before the child can crawl he learns to kick and wince and sprawl to hinder which your midwife knows to bind those parts extremely close lest alma newly entered in and stunned at her own christnings din fearful of future grief and pain sold silently sneak out again full piteous seems young almas case as in a luckless gamesters place she would not play yet must not pass again as she grows something stronger and masters feet are swathed no longer if in the night too often he kicks or shows his locomotive tricks these first assaults fat kate repays him when half asleep she overlays him now mark dear richard from the age that children tread this wordly stage broomstaff or poker they bestride and round the parlor love to ride till thoughtful fathers pious care provides his brood next smithfield fair with supplemental hobbyhorses and happy be their infant courses hence for some years they never stand still their legs you see direct their will from opening morn till setting sun around the fields and woods they run they frisk and dance and leap and play nor heed what friend or snape can say to her next stage as alma flies and likes as i have said the thighs with sympathetic power she warms their good allies and friends the arms while betty dances on the green and susan is at schoolball seen while john for ninepins does declare and roger loves to pitch the bar both legs and arms spontaneous move which was the thing i meant to prove another motion now she makes o need i name the seat she takes his thought quite changed the stripling finds the sport and race no more he minds neglected tray and pointer lie and covies unmolested fly sudden the jocund plain he leaves and for the nymph in secret grieves in dying accents he complains of cruel fires and raging pains the nymph too longs to be alone leaves all the swains and sighs for one the nymph is warmed with young desire and feels and dies to quench his fire they meet each evening in the grove their parley but augments their love so to the priest their case they tell he ties the knot and all goes well but o my muse just distance keep thou art a maid and must not peep in nine months time the boddice loose and petticoats too short disclose that at this age the active mind about the waist lies most confined and that young life and quickening sense spring from his influence darted thence so from the middle of the world the suns prolific rays are hurled it is from that seat he darts those beams which quicken earth with genial flames dick who thus long had passive sat here stroakd his chin and cocked his hat then slappd his hand upon the board and thus the youth put in his word loves advocates sweet fir would find him a higher place than you assigned him loves advocates dick who are chose  the poets you may well suppose i am sorry sir you have discarded the men with whom till now you herded prosemen alone for private ends i thought forsook their ancient friends in cor stillavit cries lucretius if he may be allowed to teach us the selfsame thing soft ovid says a proper judge in such a case horace his phrase is torret jecur and happy was that curious speaker here virgil too has placed this passion what signifies too long quotation in ode and epic plain the case is that love holds one of these two places dick without passion or reflection i will straight demolish this objection first poets all the world agrees write half to profit half to please matter and figure they produce for garnish this and that for use and in the structure of their feasts they seek to feed and please their guests but one may balk this good intent and take things otherwise than meant thus if you dine with my lordmayr roastbeef and venson is your fare thence you proceed to swan and bustard and persevere in tart and custard but tulipleaves and lemon peel help only to adorn the meal and painted flags superb and neat proclaim you welcome to the treat the man of sense his meat devours but only smells the peel and flowers and he must be an idle dreamer who leaves the pie and gnaws the streamer that cupid goes with bow and arrows and venus keeps her coach and sparrows is all but emblem to acquaint one the son is sharp the mother wanton such images have sometimes shown a mystic sense but oftener none for who conceives what bards devise that heaven is placed in celias eyes or where is the sense direct and moral that teeth are pearl or lips are coral your horace owns he various writ as wild or sober maggots bit and where too much the poet ranted the sage philosopher recanted his grave epistles may disprove the wanton odes he made to love lucretius keeps a mighty pother with cupid and his fancied mother calls her great queen of earth and air declares that winds and seas obey her and while her honor he rehearses implores her to inspire his verses yet free from this poetic madness next page he says in sober sadness that she and all her fellowgods sit idling in their high abodes regardless of this world below our health or hanging weal or woe nor once disturb their heavenly spirits with scapins cheats or caesars merits nor ever can latin poets prove where lies the real seat of love jecur they burn and cor they pierce as either best supplies their verse and if folks ask the reason for it say one was long and the other short thus i presume the british muse may take the freedom strangers use in prose our property is greater why should it then be less in meter if cupid throws a single dart we make him wound the lovers heart but if he takes his bow and quiver it is sure he must transfix the liver for rhyme with reason may dispense and sound has right to govern sense but let your friends in verse suppose what never shall be allowed in prose anatomists can make it clear the liver minds his own affair kindly supplies our public uses and parts and strains the vital juices still lays some useful bile aside to tinge the chyles insipid tide else we should want both gibe and satyr and all be burst with pure goodnature now gall is bitter with a witness and love is all delight and sweetness my logic then has lost its aim if sweet and bitter be the same and he methinks is no great scholar who can mistake desire for choler the like may of the heart be said courage and terror there are bred all those whose hearts are loose and low start if they hear but the tattoo and mighty physical their fear is for soon as noise of combat near is their heart descending to their breeches must give their stomach cruel twitches but heroes who overcome or die have their hearts hung extremely high the strings of which in battles heat against their very corslets beat keep time with their own trumpets measure and yield em most excessive pleasure now if it is chiefly in the heart that courage does itself exert twill be prodigious hard to prove that this is eke the throne of love would nature make one place the seat of fond desire and fell debate most people only take delight in those hours when they are tired with fighting and has no man but who has killed a father right to get a child these notions then i think but idle and love shall still possess the middle this truth more plainly to discover suppose your hero were a lover though he before had gall and rage which death or conquest must assuage he grows dispirited and low he hates the fight and shuns the foe in scornful sloth achilles slept and for his wench like tallboy wept nor would return to war and slaughter till they brought back the parsons daughter antonius fled from actiums coast augustus pressing asia lost his sails by cupids hand unfurled to keep the fair he gave the world edward our fourth revered and crowned vigorous in youth in arms renowned while englands voice and warwicks care designed him gallias beauteous heir changed peace and power for rage and wars only to dry one widows tears frances fourth henry we may see a servant to the sair destree when quitting coutras prosperous field and fortune taught at length to yield he from his guards and midnight tent disguised over hills and valleys went to wanton with the sprightly dame and in his pleasure lost his fame bold is the critic who dares prove these heroes were no friends to love and bolder he who dares aver that they were enemies to war yet when their thought should now or never have raised their heart or fired their liver fond alma to those parts was gone which love more justly calls his own examples i could cite you more but be contented with these sour for when ones proofs are aptly chosen four are as valid as four dozen one came from greece and one from rome the other two grew nearer home for some in ancient books delight others prefer what moderns write now i should be extremely loath not to be thought expert in both canto ii but shall we take the muse abroad to drop her idly on the road and leave our subject in the middle as butler did his bear and fiddle yet he consummate master knew when to recede and where pursue his noble negligences teach what others toils despair to reach he perfect dancer climbs the rope and balances your fear and hope if after some distinguished leap he drops his pole and seems to slip straight gathering all his active strength he rises higher half his length with wonder you approve his slight and owe your pleasure to your fright but like poor andrew i advance false mimic of my masters dance around the cord awhile i sprawl and thence though low in earnest fall my preface tells you i digressd he is half absolved who has confessed i like quoth dick your simile and in return take two from me as masters in the clare obscure with various light your eyes allure a flaming yellow here they spread draw off in blue or change in red yet from these colors oddly mixed your sight upon the whole is fixed or as again your courtly dames whose clothes returning birthday claims by arts improve the stuffs they vary and things are best as most contrary the gown with stiff embroidry shining looks charming with a slighter lining the out if indian figure stain the inside must be rich and plain so you great authors have thought fit to make digression temper wit when arguments too fiercely glare you calm em with a milder air to break their points you turn their force and furbelow the plain discourse richard quoth mat these words of thine speak something sly and something fine but i shall even resume my theme however thou may praise or blame as people marry now and settle fierce love abates his usual mettle worldly desires and household cares disturb the godheads soft affairs so now as health or temper changes in larger compass alma ranges this day below the next above as light or solid whimsies move so merchant has his house in town and country seat near bansteddown from one he dates his foreign letters sends out his goods and duns his debtors in the other at his hours of leisure he smokes his pipe and takes his pleasure and now your matrimonial cupid lashed on by time grows tired and stupid for story and experience tell us that man grows old and woman jealous both would their little ends secure he sighs for freedom she for power his wishes tend abroad to roam and here is to domineer at home thus passion flags by slow degrees and ruffled more delighted less the busy mind does seldom go to those once charming seats below but in the breast encamped prepares for well bred feints and future wars the man suspects his ladys crying when he last autumn lay a dying was but to gain him to appoint her by codicil a larger jointure the woman finds it all a trick that he could swoon when she was sick and knows that in that grief he reckoned on blackeyd susan for his second thus having strove some tedious years with feigned desires and real fears and tired with answers and replies of john affirms and martha lies leaving this endless altercation the mind affects a higher station poltis that generous king of thrace i think was in this very case all asia now was by the ears and gods beat up for volunteers to greece and troy while poltis sat in quiet governing his state and whence said the pacific king does all this noise and discord spring why paris took atrides wife  with ease i could compose this strife the injured hero should not lose nor the young lover want a spouse but helen changed her first condition without her husbands just permission what from the dame can paris hope she may as well from him elope again how can her old good man with honor take her back again from hence i logically gather the woman cannot live with either now i have two right honest wives for whose possession no man strives one to atrides i will send and the other to my trojan friend each prince shall thus with honor have what both so warmly seem to crave the wrath of gods and men shall cease and poltis live and die in peace dick if this story pleases thee pray thank dan pope who told it me however swift almas flight may vary take this by way of carollary some limbs she finds the very same in place and dignity and name these dwell at such convenient distance that each can give his friend assistance thus he who runs or dances begs the equal vigor of two legs so much to both does alma trust she never regards which goes the first teague could make neither of them stay when with himself he ran away the man who struggles in the fight fatigues left arm as well as right for whilst one hand exalts the blow and on the earth extends the foe the other would take it wondrous ill if in your pocket he lay still and when you shoot and shut one eye you cannot think he would deny to lend the the other friendly aid or wink as coward and afraid no sir whilst he withdraws his flame his comrade takes the surer aim one moment if his beams recede as soon as ever the bird is dead opening again he lays his claim to half the profit half the fame and helps to pocket up the game it is thus one tradesman slips away to give his partner fairer play some limbs again in bulk or stature unlike and not akin by nature in concert act like modern friends because one serves the tothers ends the arm thus waits upon the heart so quick to take the bullys part that one though warm decides more slow than the other executes the blow a standerby may chance to have it ere hack himself perceives he gave it the amorous eyes thus always go astrolling for their friends below for long before the squire and dame have tete a tete relieved their flame ere visits yet are brought about the eye by sympathy looks out knows florimel and longs to meet her and if he sees is sure to greet her though at sashwindow on the stairs at court nay authors say at prayers the funeral of some valiant knight may give this thing its proper light view his two gantlets these declare that both his hands were used to war and from his two gilt spurs it is learned his feet were equally concerned but have you not with thought beheld the sword hang dangling over the shield which shows the breast that plate was used to had an ally right arm to trust to and by the peepholes in his crest is it not virtually confessed that there his eyes took distant aim and glanced respect to that bright dame in whose delight his hope was centered and for whose glove his life he ventured objections to my general system may rise perhaps and i have mist them but i can call to my assistance proximity mark that and distance can prove that all things on occasion love union and desire adhesion that alma merely is a scale and motives like the weights prevail if neither side turn down or up with loss or gain with fear or hope the balance always would hang even like mahmets tomb twixt earth and heaven this richard is a curious case suppose your eyes sent equal rays upon two distant pots of ale not knowing which was mild or stale in this sad state your doubtful choice would never have the casting voice which best or worst you could not think and die you must for want of drink unless some chance inclines your sight setting one pot in fairer light then you prefer or a or b as lines and angles best agree your sense resolved impells your will she guides your hand  so drink your fill have you not seen a bakers maid between two equal panniers swayed her tallies useless lie and idle if placed exactly in the middle but forced from this unactive state by virtue of some casual weight on either side you hear em clatter and judge of right and left hand matter now richard this coercive force without your choice must take its course great kings to wars are pointed forth like loaded needles to the north and thou and i by power unseen are barely passive and sucked in to henaults vaults or celias chamber as straw and paper are by amber if we sit down to play or set suppose at ombre or basset let people call us cheats or fools our cards and we are equal tools we sure in vain the cards condemn ourselves both cut and shuffle them in vain on fortunes aid rely she only is a standerby poor men poor papers we and they do some impulsive force obey and are but played with  do not play but space and matter we should blame they palmd the trick that lost the game thus to save further contradiction against what you may think but fiction i for attraction dick declare deny it those bold men that dare as well your motion as your thought is all by hidden impulse wrought even saying that you think or walk how like a country squire you talk mark then  where fancy or desire collects the beams of vital fire into that limb fair alma slides and there pro tempore resides she dwells in nicholinis tongue when pyrrhus chants the heavenly song when pedro does the lute command she guides the cunning artists hand through macers gullet she runs down when the vile glutton dines alone and void of modesty and thought she fallows bibos endless draught through the soft sex again she ranges as youth caprice or fashion changes fair alma careless and serene in fannys sprightly eyes is seen while they diffuse their infant beams themselves not conscious of their flames again fair alma sits confessed on florimels experter breast when she the rising sigh constrains and by concealing speaks her pains in cynthias neck fair alma glows when the vain thing her jewels shows when jennys stays are newly laced fair alma plays about her waist and when the swelling hoop sustains the rich brocade fair alma deigns into that lower sphere to enter of the large round herself the center again that single limb or feature such is the cogent force of nature which most did almas passion move in the first object of her love for ever will be found confessed and printed on the amorous breast o abelard illfated youth thy tale will justify this truth but well i weet that cruel wrong adorns a nobler poets song dan pope for thy misfortune grieved with kind concern and skill has weaved a silken web and never shall fade its colors gently as he laid the mantle over thy sad distress and venus shall the texture bless he over the weeping nun has drawn such artful folds of sacred lawn that love with equal grief and pride shall see the crime he strives to hide and softly drawing back the veil the god shall to his votries tell each conscious tear each blushing grace that decked dear eloisas face happy the poet blessed the lays that buckingham has deigned to praise next dick as youth and habit sways a hundred gambols alma plays if whilst a boy jack ran from school fond of his huntinghorn and pole though gout and age his speed detain old john halloos his hounds again by his fireside he starts the hare and turns her in his wicker chair his feet however lame you find have got the better of his mind if while the mind was in her leg the dance affected nimble peg old madge bewitched at sixtyone calls for green sleeves and jumping joan in public mask or private ball from lincolns end to goldsmithshall all christmas long away she trudges trips it with prentices and judges in vain her children urge her stay and age or palsy bar the way but if those images prevail which whilom did affect the tail she still renews the ancient scene forgets the forty years between aukwardly gay and oddly merry her scarf pale pink her headknot cherry oerheated with ideal rage she cheats her son to wed her page if alma whilst the man was young slipped up too soon into his tongue pleased with his own fantastic skill he lets that weapon never lie still on any point if you dispute depend upon it he will confute change sides and you increase your pain for he will confute you back again for one may speak with tullys tongue yet all the while be in the wrong and it is remarkable that they talk most who have the least to say your dainty speakers have the curse to plead bad causes down to worse as dames who native beauty want still uglier look the more they paint again if in the female sex alma should on this member fix a cruel and a desperate case from which heaven shield my lovely lass for evermore all care is vain that would bring alma down again as in habitual gout or stone the only thing that can be done is to correct your drink and diet and keep the inward foe in quiet so if for any sin of ours or our forefathers higher powers severe though just afflict our life with that prime ill a talking wife till death shall bring the kind relief we must be patient or be deaf you know a certain lady dick who saw me when i last was sick she kindly talked at least three hours of plastic forms and mental powers described our preexisting station before this vile terrene creation and lest i should be wearied madam to cut things short came down to adam from whence as fast as she was able she drowns the world and builds up babel through syria persia greece she goes and takes the romans in the close but well descant on general nature this is a system not a satyr turn we this globe and let us see how different nations disagree in what we wear or eat and drink nay dick perhaps in what we think in water as you smell and taste the soils through which it rose and past in almas manners you may read the place where she was born and bred one people from their swaddling bands released their infants feet and hands here alma to these limbs was brought and spartas offspring kicked and fought another taught their babes to talk ere they could yet in goecarts walk there alma settled in the tongue and orators from athens sprung observe but in these neighboring lands the different use of mouths and hands as men reposed their various hopes in battles these and those in tropes in britains isles as heylin notes the ladies trip in petticoats which for the honor of their nation they quit but on some great occasion men there in breeches clad you view they claim that garment as their due in turkey the reverse appears long coats the haughty husband wears and greets his wife with angry speeches if she be seen without her breeches in our fantastic climes the fair with cleanly powder dry their hair and round their lovely breast and head fresh flowers their mingled odors shed your nicer hottentots think meet with tripe and guts to deck their feet with downcast looks on tottas legs the ogling youth most humbly begs she would not from his hopes remove at once his breakfast and his love and if the skittish nymph should fly he in a double sense must die we simple toasters take delight to see our womens teeth look white and every saucy illbred fellow sneers at a mouth profoundly yellow in china none hold women sweet except their snaggs are black as jett king chihu put nine queens to death convict on statute ivory teeth at tonquin if a prince should die as jesuits write who never lie the wife and counselor and priest who served him most and loved him best prepare and light his funeral fire and cheerful on the pile expire in europe twould be hard to find in each degree one half so kind now turn we to the farthest east and there observe the gentry dressed prince giolo and his royal sisters scarrd with ten thousand comely blisters the marks remaining on the skin to tell the quality within distinguished slashes deck the great as each excels in birth or state his oyletholes are more and ampler the kings own body was a samplar happy the climate where the beau wears the same suit for use and show and at a small expense your wife if once well pinkd is clothed for life westward again the indian fair is nicely smeared with fat of bear before you see you smell your toast and sweetest she who stinks the most the finest sparks and cleanliest beaux drip from the shoulders to the toes how sleek their skins their joints how easy there slovens only are not greasy i mentioned different ways of breeding begin we in our childrens reading to master john the english maid a hornbook gives of gingerbread and that the child may learn the better as he can name he eats the letter proceeding thus with vast delight he spells and knaws from left to right but show a hebrews hopeful son where we suppose the book begun the child would thank you for your kindness and read quite backward from our finis devour he learning never so fast great a will be reserved the last an equal instance of this matter is in the manners of a daughter in europe if a harmless maid by nature and by love betrayed should ere a wife become a nurse her friends would look on her the worse in china dampiers travels tell ye look in his index for pagelli soon as the british ships unmoore and jolly longboat rows to shore down comes the nobles of the land each brings his daughter in his hand beseeching the imperious tar to make her but one hour his care the tender mother stands affrighted lest her dear daughter should be slighted and poor miss yaya dreads the shame of going back the maid she came observe how custom dick compels the lady that in europe dwells after her tea she slips away and what to do one need not say now see how great pomonques queen behaved herself among the men pleased with her punch the gallant soul first drank then watered in the bowl and sprinkled in the captains face the marks of her peculiar grace  to close this point we need not roam for instances so far from home what parts gay france from sober spain a little rising rocky chain of men born south or north of the hill those seldom move these never stand still dick you love maps and may perceive rome not far distant from geneve if the good pope remains at home he is the first prince in christendom choose then good pope at home to stay nor westward curious take thy way thy way unhappy should thou take from tibers bank to lemanlake thou art an aged priest no more but a young flaring painted whore thy sex is lost thy town is gone no longer rome but babylon that some few leagues should make this change to men unlearned seems mighty strange but need we friend insist on this since in the very cantons swiss all your philosophers agree and prove it plain that one may be a heretic or true believer on this or the other side a river here with an artful smile quoth dick your proofs come mighty full and thick  the bard on this extensive chapter wound up into poetic rapture continued richard call your eye by night upon a winter sky cast it by daylight on the strand which compasses fair albions land if you can count the stars that glow above or sands that lie below into these commonplaces look which from great authors i have took and count the proofs i have collected to have my writings well protected these i say by for time of need and thou may at thy leisure read for standing every critics rage i safely will to future age my system as a gift bequeath victorious over spite and death canto iii richard who now was half asleep roused nor would longer silence keep and sense like this in vocal breath broke from his twofold hedge of teeth now if this phrase too harsh be thought pope tell the world it is not my fault old homer taught us thus to speak if it is not sense at least it is greek as folks quoth richard prone to leasing say things at first because they are pleasing then prove what they have once asserted nor care to have their lie deserted till their own dreams at length deceive em and often repeating they believe em or as again those amorous blades who trifle with their mothers maids though at the first their wild desire was but to quench a present fire yet if the object of their love chance by lucinas aid to prove they seldom let the bantling roar in basket at a neighbors door but by the flattering glass of nature viewing themselves in cakebreads feature with serious thought and care support what only was begun in sport just so with you my friend it fares who deal in philosophic wares atoms you cut and forms you measure to gratify your private pleasure till airy seeds of casual wit do some fantastic birth beget and pleased to find your system mended beyond what you at first intended the happy whimsey you pursue till you at length believe it true caught by your own delusive art you fancy first and then assert quoth matthew friend as far as i through art or nature cast my eye this axiom clearly i discern that one must teach and the other learn no fool pythagoras was thought whilst he his weighty doctrines taught he made his listening scholars stand their mouth still covered with their hand else may be some oddthinking youth less friend to doctrine than to truth might have refused to let his ears attend the music of the spheres denied all transmigrating scenes and introduced the use of beans from great lucretius take his void and all the world is quite destroyed deny descart his subtle matter you leave him neither fire nor water how oddly would sir isaac look if you in answer to his book say in the front of your discourse that things have no elastic force how could our chymic friends go on to find the philosopbic stone if you more powerful reasons bring to prove that there is no such thing your chiefs in sciences and arts have great contempt of almas parts they find she giddy is or dull she doubts if things are void or full and who should be presumed to tell what she herself should see or feel she doubts if two and two make four though she has told them ten times over it cannot  it may be  and it must to which of these must alma trust nay further yet they make her go in doubting if she doubts or no can syllogism set things right no majors soon with minors fight or both in friendly consort joined the consequence limps false behind so to some cunningman she goes and asks of him how much she knows with patience grave he hears her speak and from his short notes gives her back what from her tale he comprehended thus the dispute is wisely ended from the account the loser brings the conjror knows who stole the things squire interrupted dick since when were you amongst these cunningmen dear dick quoth mat let not thy force of eloquence spoil my discourse i tell thee this is almas case still asking what some wiseman says who does his mind in words reveal which all must gra though few can spell you tell your dor that y are ill and what does he but write a bill of which you need not read one letter the worse the scrawl the dose the better for if you knew but what you take though you recover he must break ideas forms and intellects have furnished out three different sects substance or accident divides all europe into adverse sides now as engaged in arms or laws you must have friends to back your cause in philosophic matters so your judgment must with others go for as in senates so in schools majority of voices rules poor alma like a lonely deer over hills and dales does doubtful err with panting haste and quick surprise from every leaf that stirs she flies till mingled with the neighboring herd she slights what erst she singly feared and now exempt from doubt and dread she dares pursue if they dare lead as their example still prevails she tempts the stream or leaps the pales he then quoth dick who by your rule thinks for himself becomes a fool as partyman who leaves the rest is called but whimsical at best now by your favor master mat like ralpho here i smell a rat i must be listed in your sect who though they teach not can protect right richard mat in triumph cried so put off all mistrust and pride and while my principles i beg pray answer only with your leg believe what friendly i advise be first secure and then be wise the man within the coach that sits and to anothers skill submits is safer much whatever arrives and warmer too than he that drives so dick adept tuck back thy hair and i will pour into thy ear remarks which none did ever disclose in smoothpacd verse or hobbling prose attend dear dick but dont reply and thou may prove as wise as i when alma now in different ages has finished her ascending stages into the head at length she gets and there in public grandeur sits to judge of things and censure wits here richard how could i explain the various labrinths of the brain surprise my readers whilst i tell em of cerebrum and cerebellum how could i play the commentator on dura and on pia matter where hot and cold and dry and wet strive each the others place to get and with incessant toil and strife would keep possession during life i could demonstrate every pore where memory lays up all her store and to an inch compute the station twixt judgment and imagination o friend i could display much learning at least to men of small discerning the brain contains ten thousand cells in each some active fancy dwells which always is at work and framing the several follies i was naming as in a hives vimineous dome ten thousand bees enjoy their home each does her studious actions vary to go and come to fetch and carry each still renews her little labor nor justles her assiduous neighbor each  whilst this thesis i maintain i fancy dick i know thy brain o with the mighty theme affected could i but see thy head dissected my head quoth dick to serve your whim spare that and take some other limb sir in your nice affairs of system wise men propose but fools assist em says matthew richard keep thy head and hold thy peace and i will proceed proceed quoth dick sir i aver you have already gone too far when people once are in the wrong each line they add is much too long who fastest walks but walks astray is only furthest from his way bless your conceits must i believe however absurd what you conceive and for your friendship live and die a papist in philosophy i say whatever you maintain of alma in the heart or brain the plainest man alive may tell ye her seat of empire is the belly from hence she sends out those supplies which makes us either stout or wise the strength of every other member is founded on your bellytimber the qualms or raptures of your blood rise in proportion to your food and if you would improve your thought you must be fed as well as taught your stomach makes your fabric roll just as the bias rules the bowl that great achilles might employ the strength designed to ruin troy he dined on lions marrow spread on toasts of ammunitionbread but by his mother sent away amongst the thracian girls to play effeminate he sat and quiet strange product of a cheesecake diet now give my argument fair play and take the thing the other way the youngster who at nine and three drinks with his sisters milk and tea from breakfast reads till twelve oclock burnet and heylin hobbes and lock he pays due visits after noon to cousin alice and uncle john at ten from coffeehouse or play returning finishes the day but give him port and potent sack from milksop he starts up mohack holds that the happy know no hours so through the street at midnight scowrs breaks watchmens heads and chairmens glasses and thence proceeds to nicking sashes till by some tougher hand overcome and first knocked down and then led home he damns the footman strikes the maid and decently reels up to bed observe the various operations of food and drink in several nations was ever tartar fierce or cruel upon the strength of water gruel but who shall stand his rage and force if first he rides then eats his horse sallads and eggs and lighter fare tune the italian sparks guitar and if i take dan congreve right pudding and beef make britons fight tokay and coffee cause this work between the german and the turk and both as they provisions want chicane avoid retire and faint hunger and thirst or guns and swords give the same death in different words to push this argument no further to starve a man in law is murder as in a watchs fine machine though many artful springs are seen the added movements which declare how full the moon how old the year derive their secondary power from that which simply points the hour for though those gimcracks were away quare would not swear but quare would say however more reduced and plain the watch would still a watch remain but if the horal orbite ceases the whole stands still or breaks to pieces is now no longer what it was and you may even go sell the case so if unprejudiced you scan the goings of this clockwork man you find a hundred movements made by fine devices in his head but it is the stomachs solid stroke that tells his being what is oclock if you take off his rhetric trigger he talks no more in mode and figure or clog his mathematicwheel his buildings fall his ships stand still or lastly break his politicweight his voice no longer rules the state yet if these finer whims were gone your clock though plain would still go on and spoil the engine of digestion and you entirely change the question almas affairs no power can mend the jest alas is at an end soon ceases all this worldly bustle and you consign the corpse to russel now make your alma come or go from leg to hand from top to toe your system without my addition is in a very sad condition so harlequin extolled his horse fit for the war or road or course his mouth was soft his eye was good his foot was sure as ever trod one fault he had a fault indeed and what was that the horse was dead dick from these instances and fetches thou make of horses clocks and watches quoth mat to me thou seem to mean that alma is a mere machine that telling others what is oclock she knows not what herself has struck but leaves to standersby the trial of what is marked upon her dial here hold a blow good friend quoth dick and raised his voice exceeding quick fight fair sir what i never meant dont you infer in argument similies are like songs in love they much describe they nothing prove mat who was here a little gravelled tossed up his nose and would have cavilld but calling hermes to his aid half pleased half angry thus he said where mind it is for the authors fame that matthew called and hermes came in danger heroes and in doubt poets find gods to help em out friend richard i begin to see that you and i shall scarce agree observe how oddly you behave the more i grant the more you crave but comrade as i said just now i should affirm and you allow we systemmakers can sustain the thesis which you grant was plain and with remarks and comments teaze ye in case the thing before was easy but in a point obscure and dark we fight as leibnits did with clark and when no reason we can show why matters this or that way go the shortest way the thing we try and what we know not we deny true to our own oerbearing pride and false to all the world beside that old philosopher grew cross who could not tell what motion was because he walked against his will he faced down men that he stood still and he who reading on the heart when all his quidlibets of art could not expound its pulse and heat swore he had never felt it beat chrysippus foiled by epicurus makes bold jove bless him to assure us that all things which our mind can view may be at once both false and true and mallbranch has an odd conceit as ever entered frenchmans pate says he so little can our mind of matter or of spirit find that we by guess at least may gather something which may be both or neither faith dick i must confess it is true but this is only enter nous that many knotty points there are which all discuss but few can clear as nature slily had thought fit for some byends to crossbite wit circles to square and cubes to double would give a man excessive trouble the longitude uncertain roams in spite of whiston and his bombs what system dick has right averred the cause why woman has no beard or why as years our frame attack our hair grows white our teeth grow black in points like these we must agree our barbers know as much as we yet still unable to explain we must persist the best we can with care our systems still renew and prove things likely though not true i could thou see in quaint dispute by dint of logic strike the mute with learned skill now push now parry from darii to bocardo vary and never yield or what is worst never conclude the point discoursed yet that you hic and nunc may know how much you to my candor owe i will from the disputant descend to show thee i assume the friend i will take thy notion for my own  so most philosophers have done it makes my system more complete dick can it have a nobler fate take what thou will said dick dear friend but bring thy matters to an end i find quoth mat reproof is vain who first offend will first complain thou wishest i should make to shore yet still putst in thy thwarting oar what i have told thee fifty times in prose receive for once in rhimes a huge fat man in countryfair or citychurch no matter where labored and pushed amidst the crowd still bauling out extremely loud lord save us why do people press another marking his distress friendly replied plump gentleman get out as fast as ever you can or cease to push or to exclaim you make the very crowd you blame says dick your moral does not need the least return so even proceed your tale however applied was short so far at least i thank you for it mat took his thanks and in a tone more magisterial thus went on now alma settles in the head as has before been sung or said and here begins this farce of life enter revenge ambition strife behold on both sides men advance to form in earnest bayss dance lavare not using half his store still grumbles that he has no more strikes not the present tun for fear the vintage should be bad next year and eats today with inward sorrow and dread of fancied want tomorrow abroad if the surtout you wear repels the rigor of the air would you be warmer if at home you had the fabric and the loom and if two boots keep out the weather what need you have two hides of leather could pedro think you make no trial of a sonata on his viol unless he had the total gut whence every string at first was cut when rarus shows you his cartone he always tells you with a groan where two of that same hand were torn long before you or he were born poor ventos mind so much is crossed for part of his petronius lost that he can never take the pains to understand what yet remains what toil did honest curio take what strict enquiries did he make to get one medal wanting yet and perfect all his roman set it is found and o his happy lot it is bought locked up and lies forgot of these no more you hear him speak he now begins upon the greek these ranged and shown shall in their turns remain obscure as in their urns my copperlamps at any rate for being true antique i bought yet wisely melted down my plate on modern models to be wrought and trifles i alike pursue because they are old because they are new dick i have seen you with delight for georgy make a paperkite and simple odes too many show ye my servile complaisance to cloe parents and lovers are decreed by nature fools  that is brave indeed quoth dick such truths are worth receiving yet still dick looked as not believing now alma to divines and prose i leave thy frauds and crimes and woes nor think tonight of thy ill nature but of thy follies idle creature the turns of thy uncertain wing and not the malice of thy sting thy pride of being great and wise i do but mention to despise i view with anger and disdain how little gives thee joy or pain a print a bronze a flower a root a shell a butterfly can do it even a romance a tune a rhyme help thee to pass the redious time which else would on thy hand remain though flown it never looks back again and cards are dealt and chefsboards brought to ease the pain of coward thought happy result of human wit that alma may herself forget dick thus we act and thus we are or tossed by hope or sunk by care with endless pain this man pursues what if he gained he could not use and the other fondly hopes to see what never was nor ever shall be we err by use go wrong by rules in gesture grave in action fools we join hypocrisy to pride doubling the faults we strive to hide or grant that with extreme surprise we find ourselves at sixty wise and twenty pretty things are known of which we cannot accomplish one whilst as my system says the mind is to these upper rooms confined should i my friend at large repeat her borrowed sense her fond conceit the bederoll of her vicious tricks my poem will be too prolix for could i my remarks sustain like socrates or miles montaigne who in these times would read my books but tom of styles or john of nokes as brentford kings discreet and wise after long thought and grave advice into lardellas coffin peeping saw naught to cause their mirth or weeping so alma now to joy or grief superior finds her late relief wearied of being high or great and nodding in her chair of state stunned and worn out with endless chat of will did this and nan said that she finds poor thing some little crack which nature forced by time must make through which she wings her destined way upward she soars and down drops clay while some surviving friend supplies hic jacet and a hundred lies o richard till that day appears which must decide our hopes and fears would fortune calm her present rage and give us playthings for our age would clotho wash her hands in milk and twist our thread with gold and silk would she in friendship peace and plenty spin out our years to four times twenty and should we both in this condition have conquered love and worse ambition else those two passions by the way may chance to show us scurvy play then richard then should we sit down far from the tumult of the town i fond of my wellchosen seat my pictures medals books complete or should we mix our friendly talk oershaded in that favorite walk which thy own hand had whilom planted both pleased with all we thought we wanted yet then even then one cross reflection would spoil thy grove and my collection thy son and his ever that may die and time some uncouth heir supply who shall for nothing else be known but spoiling all that thou have done who set the twigs shall he remember that is in haste to sell the timber and what shall of thy woods remain except the box that threw the main nay may not time and death remove the near relations whom i love and my coz tom or his coz mary who hold the plough or skim the dairy my favorite books and pictures sell to smart or doiley by the ell kindly throw in a little figure and set the price upon the bigger those who could never read the grammar when my dear volumes touch the hammer may think books best as richest bound my copper medals by the pound may be with learned justice weighed to turn the balance othos head may be thrown in and for the metal the coin may mend a tinkers kettle  tired with these thoughts  less tired than i quoth dick with your philosophy  that people live and die i knew an hour ago as well as you and if fate spins us longer years or is in haste to take the shears i know we must both fortunes try and bear our evils wet or dry yet let the goddess smile or frown bread we shall eat or white or brown and in a cottage or a court drink fine champagne or muddled port what need of books these truths to tell which folks perceive who cannot spell and must we spectacles apply to view what hurts our naked eye sir if it be your wisdoms aim to make me merrier than i am i will be all night at your devotion  come on friend broach the pleasing notion but if you would depress my thought your system is not worth a groat  for platos fancies what care i i hope you would not have me die like simple cato in the play for any thing that he can say even let him of ideas speak to heathens in his native greek if to be sad is to be wise i do most heartily despise whatever socrates has said or tully writ or wanley read dear drift to set our matters right remove these papers from my sight burn mats descart and aristottle here jonathan your masters bottle finis
