london as he had no turn to any expensive vices he was reckoned a sober decent man but he was covetous and proud selfish and conceited as soon as he got forward in the world his vanity began to display itself but not in the ordinary method of making a figure and living away but still he was tormented with a longing desire to draw public notice and to distinguish himself he felt a general sense of discontent at what he was with a general ambition to be something which he was not but this desire had not yet turned itself to any particular object it was not by his money he could hope to be distinguished for half his acquaintance had more and a man must be rich indeed to be noted for his riches in london mr fantoms mind was a prey to vain imaginations he despised all those little acts of kindness and charity which every man is called to performevery day and while he was contriving grand schemes which lay quite out of his reach he neglected the ordinary duties of life which lay directly before him  about this time he got hold of a famous little book written by the new philosopher whose pestilent doctrines found a ready entrance into mr fantoms mind a mind at once shallow and inquisitive speculative and vain ambitious and dissatisfied as almost every book was new to him he fell into the common error of those who begin to read late in life that of thinking that what he did not know himself was equally new to others and he was apt to fancy that he and the author he was reading were the only two people in the world who knew any thing this book led to the grand discovery he had now found what his heart panted after a way to distinguish himself to start out a full grown philosopher at once to be wise without education to dispute without learning and to make proselytes without argument was a short cut to fame which well suited his vanity and his ignorance he rejoiced that he had been so clever as to examine for himself pitied his friends who took things upon trust and was resolved to assert the freedom of his own mind to a man fond of bold novelties and daring paradoxes solid argument would be flat and truth would be dull merely because it is not new mr fantom believed not in proportion to the strength of the evidence but to the impudence of the assertion the trampling on holy ground with dirty shoes the smearing the sanctuary with filth and mire the calling prophets and apostles by the most seurrilous names was new and dashing and dazzling mr fantom now being set free from the chains of slavery and superstition was resolved to show his zeal in the usual way by trying to free others but it would have hurt his vanity had he known that he was the convert of a man who had written only for the vulgar who had invented nothing no not even one idea of original wickedness but who had stooped to rake up out of the kennel of infidelity all the loathsome dregs and offal dirt which politer unbelievers had thrown away as too gross and offensive for their better bred readers  mr fantom who considered that a philosopher must set up with a little sort of stock in trade now picked up all the common place notions against christianity which have been answered a hundred times over these he kept by him ready cut and dried and brought out in all companies with a zeal which would have done honor to a better cause but which the friends to a better cause are not so apt to discover he soon got all the cant of the new school he talked of narrowness and ignorance and bigotry and prejudice and priestcrast on the one hand and on the other of public good the love of mankind and liberality and candor and toleration and above all benevolence benevolence he said made up the whole of religion and all the other parts of it were nothing but cant and jargon and hypocrisy finding however that he made little impression on his old club at the cat and bagpipes he grew tired of their company yet there was one member whose society he could not resolve to give up though they seldom agreed as indeed no two men in the same class and habits of life could less resemble each other mr trueman was an honest plain simple hearted tradesman of the good old cut who feared god and followed his business he went to church twice on sundays and minded his shop all the week spent frugally gave liberally and saved moderately  mr fantom resolved to retire for a while into the country and devote his time to his new plans schemes theories and projects for the public good a life of talking and reading and writing and disputing and teaching and proselyting now struck him as the only life so he soon set out for the country with his family to which was now added his new footman william wilson whom he had taken with a good character out of a sober family he was no sooner settled than he wrote to invite mr trueman to come and pay him a visit for he would have burst if he could not have got some one to whom he might display his new knowledge he knew that if on the one hand trueman was no scholar yet on the other he was no fool and though he despised his prejudices yet he thought he might he made a good decoy duck for if he could once bring trueman over the whole club at the cat and bagpipes might be brought to follow his example and thus he might see himself at the head of a society of his own proselytes the supreme object of a philosophers ambition trueman came accordingly he soon found that however he might be shocked at the impious doctrines his friend maintained yet that an important lesson might be learnt even from the worst enemies of truth namely an everwakeful attention to their grand object if they set out with talking of trade or politics of private news or public affairs still mr fantom was ever on the watch to hitch in his darling doctrines whatever he began with he was sure to end with a pert squib at the bible a vapid jest on the clergy the miseries of superstition and the blessings of philosophy oh said trueman to himself when shall i see christians half so much in earnest why is it that almost all zeal is on the wrong side  well mr fantom said trueman next day at breakfast i am afraid you areleading but an idle sort of life here sir said fantom i now begin to live to some purpose i have indeed lost too much time and wasted my talents on a little retail trade in which one is of no note one cannot distinguish ones self so much the better said trueman i had rather not distinguish myself unless it was by leading a better life than my neighbors there is nothing i should dread more than being talked about i dare say now heaven is in a good measure filled with people whose names were never heard out of their own street or village so i beg leave not to distinguish myself yes but one may if it is only by signing ones name to an essay or a paragraph in a newspaper said fantom heaven keep john truemans name out of a newspaper interrupted he in a fright for it must either be found in the old bailey or the bankrupt list unless indeed i were to remove shop or sell off my old stock but in your present confined situation you can be of no use said fantom that i deny interrupted the other i have filled all the parish offices with some credit i never took a bribe at an election no not so much as a treat i take care of my apprentices and dont set them a bad example by running to plays and sadlers wells in the week or jaunting about in a gig all day on sundays for i look upon it that the country jaunt of the master on sundays exposes his servants to more danger than their whole weeks temptations in trade put together  fantom i once had the same vulgar prejudices about the church and the sabbath and all that antiquated stuff but even on your own narrow principles how can a thinking being spend his sunday better if he must lose one day in seven by having any sunday at all than by going into the country to admire the works of nature  trueman i suppose you mean the works of god for i never read in the bible that nature made any thing i should rather think that she herself was made by him who made all things by him who when he said thou shall not murder said also thou shall keep holy the sabbath day but now do you really think that all that multitude of coaches chariots chaises visavis booby hutches sulkies sociables phaetons gigs curricles cabrioles chairs stages pleasure carts and horses which crowd our roads all those country houses within reach to which the london friends pour in to the gorgeous sunday feast which the servants are kept from church to dress all those public houses under the signs of which you read these alluring words an ordinary on sundays i say do you believe that all those houses and carriages are crammed with philosophers who go on sundays into the country to admire the works of nature as you call it indeed from the reeling gait of some of them when they go back at night one might take them for a certain sect call i the tippling philosophers then in answer to your charge that a little tradesman can do no good i must tell you that i belong to the society for relieving prisoners for small debts and to the sick mans friend and to   fantom oh enough  all these are petty occupations  trueman then they are better suited to petty men of petty fortune i had rather have an ounce of real good done with my own hands and seen with my own eyes than speculate about doing a ton in a wild way which i know can never be brought about  fantom i despise a narrow field o for the reign of universal benevolence i want to make all mankind good and happy  trueman dear me sure that must be a whole sale sort of a job had not you better try your hand at a town or a parish first  fantom sir i have a plan in my head for relieving the miseries of the whole world every thing is bad as it now stands i would alter all the laws and do away all the religions and put an end to all the wars in the world i would every where redress the injustice of fortune or what the vulgar call providence i would put an end to all punishments i would not leave a single prisoner on the face of the globe this is what i call doing things on a grand scale a scale with a vengeance said trueman as to releasing the prisoners however i dont so much like that as it would be pleasing a few rogues at the expense of all honest men but as to the rest of your plan if all christian countries would be so good as turn christians it might be helped on a good deal there would be still misery enough left indeed because god intended this world should be earth and not heaven but still banishing religion from the world would be like striking off all the pounds from an overcharged bill and all the troubles which would be left would be reduced to mere shillings pence and farthings as one may say  fantom your project would rivet the chains which mine is designed to break  trueman sir i have no projects projects are in general the offspring of restlessness vanity and idleness i am too busy for projects too contented for theories and i hope have too much humility for a philosopher the utmost extent of my ambition at present is to redress the wrongs of a parish prentice who has been cruelly used by his master indeed i have another little scheme which is to prosecute a fellow in our street who has let a poor wretch in a workhouse of which he had the care perish through neglect and you must assist me  fantom the parish must do that as to me i own that the wrongs of the poles and south americans so fill my mind as to leave me no time to attend the petty sorrows of workhouses and parish prentices it is provinces empires continents that the benevolence of the philosopher embraces every one can do a little paltry good to his next neighbor  trueman every one can but i dont see every one does if they would indeed your business would be ready done to your hands and your grand ocean of benevolence would be filled with the drops which private charity would throw into it i am glad however you are such a friend to the prisoners because i am just now getting a little subscription from our club to set free your poor old friend tom saunders a very honest brother tradesman who got first into debt and then into goal through no fault of his own but merely through the pressure of the times we have each of us allowed a trifle every week toward maintaining toms young family since he has been in prison but we think we shall do much more service to saunders and indeed in the end lighten our own expense by paying down at once a little sum to restore to him the comforts of life and put him in a way of maintaining his family again we have made up the money all except five guineas i am already promised four and you have nothing to do but to give me the fifth and so for a single guinea without any of the trouble the meetings and the looking into his affairs which we have had you will at once have the pleasure and it is no small one of helping to save a worthy family from starving of redeeming an old friend from gaol and of putting a little of your boasted benevolence into action realize master fantom there is nothing like realizing why hearkee mr trueman said fantom stammering and looking very black dont think i value a guinea no sir i despise money it is trash it is dirt and beneath the regard of a wise man it is one of the unfeeling inventions of artificial society sir i could talk to you for half a day on the abuse of riches and on my own contempt of money  trueman o pray dont give yourself the trouble it will be an easier way by half of proving both just to put your hand in your pocket and give me the guinea without saying a word about it and then to you who value time so much and money so little it will cut the matter short but come now for i see you will give nothing i should be mighty glad to know what is the sort of good you do yourselves since you always object to what is done by others sir said mr fantom the object of a truephilosopher is to diffuse light and knowledge i wish to see the whole world enlightened  trueman amen if you mean with the light of the gospel but if you mean that one religion is as good as another and that no religion is the best of all in short if you want to make the whole world philosophers why they had better stay as they are but as to the true light i wish it to reach the very lowest and i therefore bless god for charity schools as instruments of diffusing it  fantom who had no reason to expect that his friend was going to call upon him for a subscription on this account ventured to praise them saying i am no enemy to these institutions i would indeed change the object of instruction but i would have the whole world instructed  here mrs fantom who with her daughter had quietly sat by at their work ventured to put in a word a liberty she seldom took with her husband who in his zeal to make the whole world free and happy was too prudent to include his wife then my dear said she i wonder you dont let your own servants be taught a little the maids can scarcely tell a letter or say the lords prayer and you know you will not allow them time to learn william too has never been at church since we came out of town he was at first very orderly and obedient but now he is seldom sober of an evening and in the morning when he should be rubbing the tables in the parlour he is generally lolling upon them and reading your little manual of the new philosophy mrs fantom said her husband angrily you know that my labors for the public good leave me little time to think of my own family i must have a great field i like to do good to hundreds at once  i am very glad of that papa said miss polly for then i hope you will not refuse to subscribe to all those pretty children at the sunday school as you did yesterday when the gentleman came a begging because that is the very thing you were wishing for there are two or three hundred to be done good to at once  trueman well mr fantom you are a wonderful man to keep up such a stock of benevolence at so small an expense to love mankind so dearly and yet avoid all opportunities of doing them good to have such a noble zeal for the millions and to feel so little compassion for the units surely none but a philosopher could indulge so much philanthrophy and so much frugality at the same time  fantom i despise the man whose benevolence is swallowed up in the narrow concerns of his own family or parish or country  trueman well now i have a notion that it is as well to do ones own duty as that of another man and to do good at home as well as abroad and i had as lieve help tom saunders to freedom as a pole or a south american though i should be very glad to help them too but one must begin to love somewhere and to do good somewhere and i think it is as natural to love ones own family and to do good in ones own neighborhood as to any body else and if every man in every family parish and county did the same why all the schemes would meet and the end of one parish where i was doing good would be the beginning of another where somebody else was doing good so my schemes would jut into my neighbors and all would fit with a sort of dovetail exactness  here they were told dinner was on table dont think said mr fantom that you have the best of the argument because you happen to have the last word we will finish our talk some other time so saying they went into dinner  when they sat down mr fantom was not a little out of humor to see his table in some disorder william was also rather more negligent than usual if the company called for bread he gave them beer and he took away the clean plates and gave them dirty ones mr fantom soon discovered that his servant was very drunk he flew into a violent passion and ordered him out of the room charging that he should not appear in his presence in that condition william obeyed but having slept an hour or two and got about half sober he again made his appearance his master gave him a most severe reprimand and called him an idle drunken vicious fellow sir said william very pertly if i do get drunk now and then i only do it for the good of my country and in obedience to your wishes mr fantom thoroughly provoked now began to scold him in words not fit to be repeated and asked him what he meant why sir said william you are a philosopher you know and i have often overheard you say to your company that private vices are public benefits and so i thought that getting drunk was as pleasant a way of doing good to the public as any especially when i could oblige my master at the same time  get out of my house said mr fantom in a great rage i do not desire to stay a moment longer so pay me my wages not i indeed replied the master nor will i give you a character so never let me see your face again william took his master at his word and not only got out of the house but out of the country too as fast as possible when they found he was really gone they made a hueand cry in order to detain him till they had examined if he had left every thing in the house as he had found it but william had got out of reach knowing he could not stand such a scrutiny on examination mr fantom found that all his port was gone and mrs fantom missed three of her best new spoons william was pursued but without success and mr fantom was so much discomposed that he could not for he rest of the day talk on any subject but his wine and his spoons nor harangue on any project but that of recovering both by bringing william to justice  some days passed away in which mr fantom having had time to cool began to be ashamed that he had been betrayed into such ungoverned passion he made the best excuse he could said no man was perfect and though he owned he had been too violent yet he still hoped william would be brought to the punishment he deserved in the mean time said mr trueman seeing how ill philosophy has agreed with your man suppose you were to set about teaching your maids a little religion mr fantom coolly replied that the impertinent retort of a drunken footman could not spoil a system your system however and your own behavior said trueman have made that footman a scoundrel and you are answerable for his offenses not i truly said fantom he has seen me do no harm he has neither seen me cheat gamble nor get drunk and i defy you to say i corrupt my servants i am a moral man sir mr fantom said truman if you were to get drunk every day and game every night you would indeed endanger your own soul and give a dreadful example to your family but great as those sins are and god forbid that i should attempt to lessen them still they are not worse nay they are not so bad as the pestilent doctrines with which you infect your house and your neighborhood a bad action is like a single murder but a wicked principle is throwing lighted gunpowder into a town it is poisoning a river there are no bounds no certainty no end to its mischief the ill effects of the worst action may cease in time and the consequences of your example may end with your life but souls may be brought to perdition by a wicked principle after the author of it has been dead for ages  fantom you talk like an ignoramus who has never read the new philosophy all this nonsense of future punishment is now done away it is our benevolence which makes us reject your creed we can no more believe in a deity who permits so much evil in the present world than one who threatens eternal punishment in the next  trueman what shall mortal be more merciful than god do you pretend to be more compassionate than that gracious father who sent his son into the world to die for sinners  fantom you take all your notions of the deity from the vulgar views your bible gives you of him to be sure i do said trueman can you tell me any way of getting a better notion of him i dont want any of your farthingcandle philosophy in the broad sunshine of the gospel mr fantom my bible tells me that god is love not merely loving but love now do you think a being whose very essence is love would permit any misery among his children here if it was not to be some way or other or somewhere or other for their good you forget too that in a world where there is sin there must be misery then too i suppose god permits misery partly to exercise the sufferers and partly to try the prosperous for by trouble god corrects some and tries others suppose now tom saunders had not been put in prison you and i  no i beg pardon you saved your guinea well then our club and i could not have shown our kindness by getting him out nor would poor saunders himself have had an opportunity of exercising his own patience under want and imprisonment so you see one reason why god permits misery is that good men may have an opportunity of lessening it mr fantom replied there is no object which i have more at heart i have as i told you a plan in my head of such universal benevolence as to include the happiness of all mankind mr fantom said trueman i feel that i have a general good will toward all my brethren of mankind and if i had as much money in my purse as i have love in my heart i trust i should prove it all i say is that in a station of life where i cannot do much i am more called upon to procure the happiness of a poor neighbor who has no one else to look to than to form wild plans for the good of mankind too extensive to be accomplished and too chimerical to be put in practice i cannot free whole countries nor reform the evils of society at large but i can free an aggrieved wretch in a workhouse and i can reform myself and my own family  some weeks after a letter was brought to mr fantom from his late servant william who had been turned away for drunkenness as related in the former part of this history and who had also robbed his master of some wine and some spoons mr fantom glancing his eye over the letter said it is dated from chelmsford jail that rascal is got into prison i am glad of it with all my heart it is the fittest place for such scoundrels i hope he will be sent to botany bay if not hanged o ho my good friend said trueman then i find that in abolishing all prisons you would just let one stand for the accommodation of those who should happen to rob you mr fantom drily observed that he was not fond of jokes and proceeded to read the letter it expressed an earnest wish that his late master would condescend to pay him one visit in his dark and doleful abode as he wished to say a few words to him before the dreadful sentence of the law which had already been pronounced should be executed  let us go and see the poor fellow said trueman it is but a mornings ride if he is really so near his end it would be cruel to refuse him not i truly said fantom he deserves nothing at my hands but the halter he is likely to meet with such port as is not to be had for money and the spoons part of my new dozen as to the wine said trueman i am afraid you must give that up but the only way to get any tiding of the spoons is to go and hear what he has to say i have no doubt but he will make such a confession as may be very useful to others which you know is one grand advantage of punishments and besides we may afford him some little comfort as to comfort he deserves none from me said fantom and as to his confessions they can be of no use to me but as they give me a chance of getting my spoons so i dont much care if i do take a ride with you  when they came to the prison mr truemans tender heart sunk within him he deplored the corrupt nature of man which makes such rigorous confinement needful not merely for the punishment of the offender but for the safety of society fantom from mere trick and habit was just preparing a speech on general benevolence and the cruelty of imprisonment till the recollection of his old port and his new spoons cooled his ardour and he went on without saying a word when they reached the cell where the unhappy william was confined they stopped at the door the poor wretch had thrown himself on the ground as well as his chains would give him leave he groaned piteously and was so swallowed up with a sense of his own miseries that he neither heard the door open nor saw the gentlemen he was attempting to pray but in an agony which made his words hardly intelligible thus much they could make out  god be merciful to me a sinner  the chief of sinners then suddenly attempting to start up but prevented by his irons he roared out o god thou can not be merciful to me for i have denied thee i have ridiculed my savior who died for me i have derided his word i have resisted his spirit i have laughed at that heaven which is shut against me i have denied those torments which await me tomorrow to morrow o for a longer space for repentance o for a short reprieve from hell  mr trueman wept so loud that it drew the attention of the criminal who now lifted up his eyes and cast on his late master a look so dreadful that fantom wished for a moment that he had given up all hope of the spoons rather than have exposed himself to such a scene at length the poor wretch said in a voice that would have melted a heart of stone o sir are you there i did wish to see you before my dreadful sentence is put in execution oh sir tomorrow tomorrow but i have a confession to make to you this revived mr fantom who again ventured to glance a hope at the spoons sir said william i could not die without making my confession aye and restitution too i hope replied fantom where are my spoons  sir they are gone with the rest of my wretched booty but oh sir these spoons make so petty an article in my black account that i hardly think of them murder sir murder is the crime for which i am justly doomed to die oh sir who can dwell with everlasting burnings as this was a question which even a philosopher could not answer mr fantom was going to steal off especially as he now gave up all hope of the spoons but william called him back   stay sir stay i conjure you as you will answer it at the bar of god you are the cause of my being about to suffer a shameful death yes sir you made me a drunkard a thief and a murderer how dare you william cried mr fantom with great emotion accuse me with being the cause of such horrid crimes sir answered the criminal from you i learnt the principles which lead to those crimes by the grace of god i should never have fallen into sins deserving of the gallows if i had not often overheard you say there was no hereafter no judgment no future reckoning o sir there is a hell dreadful inconceivable eternal here through the excess of anguish the poor fellow fainted away mr fantom who did not at all relish this scene said to his friend well sir we will go if you please for you see there is nothing to be done  sir replied mr trueman mournfully you may go if you please but i shall stay for i see there is a great deal to be done what rejoined the other do you think it possible his life can be saved no indeed said trueman but i hope it is possible his soul may be saved i dont understand these things said fantom making toward the door nor i neither said trueman but as a fellow sinner i am bound to do what i can for this poor fellow do you go home mr fantom and finish your treatise on universal benevolence and the blessed effects of philosophy and hark ye be sure you let the frontispiece of your book represent william on the gibbet that will be what our parson calls a practical illustration you know i hate theories this is realizing this is philosophy made easy to the meanest capacity  mr fantom sneaked off to finish his work at home and mr trueman staid to finish his in the prison he passed the night with the wretched convict he prayed with him and for him and read to him the penetential psalms and some portions of the gospel but he was too humble and too prudent a man to venture out of his depth by arguments and consolations which he was not warranted to use this he left for the minister but he pressed on william the great duty of making the only amends now in his power to those whom he had led astray they then drew up the following paper which mr trueman got printed and gave away at the place of execution  the last words confession and dying speech of william wilson who was executed at chelmsford for murder i was bred up in the fear of god and lived with credit in many sober families in which i was a faithful servant but being tempted by a little higher wages i left a good place to go and live with mr fantom who however made good none of his fine promises but proved a hard master in his service i was not allowed time to go to church this troubled me at first till i overheard my master say that going to church was a superstitious prejudice and only meant for the vulgar upon this i resolved to go no more for i thought there could not be two religions one for the master and one for the servant finding my master never prayed i too left off praying this gave satan great power over me so that i from that time fell into almost every sin i was very uneasy at first and my conscience gave me no rest but i was soon reconciled by over hearing my master and another gentleman say that death was only a long sleep and hell and judgment were but an invention of priests to keep the poor in order i mention this as a warning to all masters and mistresses to take care what they converse about while servants are waiting at table they cannot tell how many souls they have sent to perdition by such loose talk the crime for which i die is the natural consequence of the principles i learnt of my master a rich man indeed who throws off religion may escape the gallows because want does not drive him to commit the crimes which lead to it but what shall restrain a needy man who has been taught that there is no dreadful reckoning oh my dear fellow servants take warning by my sad fate never be tempted away from a sober service for the sake of a little more wages never venture your immortal souls in houses where god is not feared and now hear me o my god though i have blasphemed thee forgive me o my savior though i have denied thee o lord most holy o god most mighty deliver me from the bitter pains of eternal death and receive my soul for his sake who died for sinners  william wilson  mr trueman would never leave this poor penitent till he was launched into eternity but attended him with the minister in the cart this pious minister never cared to tell me what he thought of williams state when i ventured to mention my hope that though his penitence was late yet it was sincere and spoke of the dying thief on the cross as a ground of encouragement the minister with a very serious look made me this answer sir that instance is too often brought forward on occasions to which it does not apply i do not choose to say any thing to your application of it in the present case but i will answer you in the words of a good man speaking of the penitent thief there is one such instance given that nobody might despair and there is but one that nobody might presume  poor william was turned off just a quarter before eleven and may the lord have had mercy on his soul  z  the end a list of the tracts published during the year
