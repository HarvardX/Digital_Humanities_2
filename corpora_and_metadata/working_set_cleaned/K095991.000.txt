will applaud you especially when they know what sort of lovers they are and that the sole motive of their affection is the ladies fortune no poor girl sure was ever plagued with such a brood as i am  the first upon my list is a high minded northbritish knight who sets up for a wit a man of learning and sentiment he bears himself fair while you are present but abuses the whole world when their backs are turned and withal has so high a notion of the dignity of his family that he would no doubt think he laid me under a great obligation in honoring me with his hand  the second is a downright idiot a fluttering frivolous thing well known in most public places by the name of beau mordecai an english jew  the next in cupids train is your nephew whose irish voice and military aspect make me fancy that he was not only born in a siege but that belona alone could be his nurse mars his preceptor and the camp the acadamy where he received the first rudiments of his education   sir theo my

naething but a knowledge of sic things as wad make um be kend by aw judicious even as the outcasto the world and first this mordecai to be sure the fellows wealthy yes he is wealthy but then a reptile madam he is a reptile whase common place notions are of nae farther extent than changealley or the coffeehouses and whase only ideas are cent per cent schemes stocks annuities and south sea bubbles   charl ay sir archy you are above such grovelling thoughts  your ambition is to adorn your mind   sir archy then madam as to squire groom to be sure he is a great sportsman but he is a beggar  a beggar and nae doubt but your fortune would be very acceptable  twould enable him to redeem his stead of horses put him on his legs again and according till his ain phrase he would be bottom madam he would be bottom but in a few years madam your whole fortune the wise scraping of your ancestors would be wantonly squandered away upon cockfighting horseracing grooms jockeys and siclike spendthrift amusements and your ladyship not hae a blanket left to cover you then as to sir callaghan obrallaghan the fellows well enough to laugh at but ye maun look about you there for your guardian is his uncle and to my certain knowledge there is a design upon your fortune in that quarter depend upon it there is a design upon your fortune   charl i believe indeed a ladys fortune is the principal object of every lover   sir archy i grant ye madam wi sir calloghan obralaghan squire groom and siclike fallows but men of honor have ither principles i assure ye madam it is not for the pecuniary but for the divine graces of your mind and the mental perfections of your soul and body which are more to me than all the riches of peru and mexico   charl o sir archy   sir archy besides madam gin ye marry me ye will marry a man of sobriety and economy  it is true i am not in the heyday of my bluid yet far frae the vale of years as the poet says  i am nor like the young whipsters of this age wha are aw spirits at the first onset but gang aff like a squi or a cracker on a rejoicing night and are never heard of mair  the young men now adays madam are mere baubles absolute baubles   charl now i think old men sir archy are but baubles   sir archy besides madam consider the dignity and antiquity of our family madam in our family there are three viscounts four barons six earls seven marquisses and two dukes the families of the south arena to be compared to families of the north  there is as muckle difference as between a hound of blood and a mongrel   charl and why so sir   sir archy i will tell you madam the noblility of scotland are aw descended frae renowned warriors and heroes of glorious achievements wha disdained to make alliances or contaminate their bluid wi any that were na as great as their ain but here in the south ye of the south ye are aw sprung frae naething in the world but wool packs hop sacks sugar kists tar barrels and rum puncheons   charl ha ha ha   sir archy what gars you laugh madam   charl the opinion you have of our nobility   sir archy guide troth madam its true aw we families of the north are of another kidney than ye of the south we are of another kidney quite we disdain a mixture of bluid that is na as pure as our ain whereas here ye are a strange amphibious breed being a composition of turks jews nabobs and refugees   charl we are indeed a strange mixture sir archy   sir archy vera true vera true my family is a family of rank and consequence which if ye marry into will purify your blood and refine it frae the lees and draps of trade with which it is contaminated which your money cannot do for you were it as meikle as the bank of edinburgh   enter mordecai mord sir archy he is just without he is coming   sir calloghan without is

hear we shall soon be deprived of your company sir calloghan i thought the war in germany had been all over   sir call yes madam it was all over but it began again a soldier never lives in quiet till he has nothing to do then he quits the field with more safety   sir archy the lady was just saying she would be glad if you would favor her with a slight narrative of what happened in germany   sir call pray madam dont ax me i am afraid it would look like gasconading in me and i will assure you there is no such thing in nature as giving a description of a fiery battle for there is so much done every where that no body knows what is done any where then there is such drumming and trumpeting and such delightful confusion altogether that you can no more give an account of it than you can of the stars in the sky   sir archy it is a vera good account he gives of it aside to mordecai let us smoke him and see if we can get a little fun with him  try if he will give you some account of the battle   mord pray sir calloghan how many might you kill in any one battle you have been at   sir call starting i will tell you i generally kill more in a battle than a coward would choose to look upon or than an impertinent fellow would be able to eat are you answered mr mordecai   sir archy you was devilish sharp upon him faith   mord was not i   sir archy yes but have another cut at him  the israelite will bring himself intil a damned scrap aside   mord sir calloghan give me leave to tell you if i was a general    sir call a general upon my soul and you would make a fine general  oh madam look upon the general  mr mordecai do not look upon being a general as so light a matter it is a very difficult trade to learn to be able to rejoice with danger on the one side and death on the other and a great many more things that you know no more of than i do of being high priest to a synagogue so hold your tongue my dear mr mordecai about that and go mind your cent per cent and your lottery tickets in changealley   sir archy aha ha by the lord he has tickled up the israelite he has given it to the moabite on both sides of the head   charl but you have been frequently in danger sir   sir call danger madam is the soldiers profession and death his best reward   mord a bull a bull pray how do you make that out you say death is the soldiers best reward   sir call i will tell you how a general dead in the field of battle is a monument of fame that makes him as much alive as caeser or alexander or any dead hero of them all and when the history of america comes to be written there is your brave young general that died in the battle before quebec will be alive to the end of the world   charl true sir calloghan the actions of that day will be remembered while britain or british gratitude have a name   sir archy wha was it did the business at quebec oh the highlanders bore the bell that day had you but seen them with their andrew ferraras how they cut them and slashed them about they did the business and gained imortal fame upon the spot   sir call sir archy give me your hand i assure you your countrymen are brave soldiers and so are mine too   charl i think i hear sir theodores coach stop   enter servant serve madam sir theodore waits for you and dinner is almost ready exit   mord madam will you honor me with the tip of your wedding finger  adieu sir calloghan  sir archy your servant  adieu sir calloghan   exeunt charlotte and mordecai sir call a very impudent fellow this mr mordecai if it had not been for the lady i would have been a little upon the cavee with him   sir archy because the rascal has been let into our company at bath he intrudes upon you wherever you go but have you written the letter to the lady   sir call faith i have not for i thought it would not be right to make my addresses to the lady till i had made my affections known to her guardian so i have indicted the letter to him   sir archy that is right that is right for so as ye do but write it matters not to whom  but where is it   sir call here it is   sir archy i warrant it is a bonny epistle   sir call reads sir as i have the honor to bear the character of a soldier and to call sir theodore goodchild uncle i do not think it would be consistent for a man of honor to behave like a scoundrel   sir archy that is an excellent remark an excellent remark and vera new   sir call therefore i thought proper before i proceeded any further for i have done nothing as yet to open my mind to you before i gain the affections of the lady you see sir archy i was for carrying on my approaches like a soldier alamilitaire as we say abroad  you are sensible my family is as old as any in the three kingdoms and older too i shall therefore come to the point at once  you see i have given him a little rub by way of a hint about our family because sir theodore is a bit of a relation by the mothersside only which is a little upstart family that came in with one strong bow to other day not above six or seven hundred years ago now my fathers family are all related to the ostrickesses the ocannakans the ocalloghans and i myself am an obralaghan which is the oldest of them all   sir archy yes sir i believe ye are of a very ancient family but you are out in ae point   sir call what is that sir arcy   sir archy why sir where ye said ye was as auld as any family in the three kingdoms   sir call why then i said no more than is true sir archy   sir archy hout awa man ye dinna consider the families of the north ye of hibernia are as low as the bushy bramble wha took refuge frae a corners in that wild spot where ye lived penned up like a set of outcasts and as such you remain until this hour   sir call i beg your pardon sir archy that is the scotch account which never speaks truth because it is partial but the irish account which must be true because it was written by one of my own family says the scotch are all irishmens bastards   sir archy bastards what do ye make us illegitimate  illegitimate sir   sir call why little ference flaerty obralaghan was the man who went over from carrickfergus and peopled all scotland with his own hands   sir archy sir calloghan though your ignorance and vanity would make ravishers of your ancestors and harlots and sabines of our mothers yet ye shall find in me    sir call harkee sir archy what was that you said just now about ignorance and vanity   sir archy sir i denounce you both ignorant and vain and make your may od   sir call faith i can make nothing at all of it because they are not words that a gentleman is used to therefore you must unsay them again   sir archy how sir eat my words a north britain eat his words   sir call by my soul you must and that immediately   sir archy sir you shall eat a piece of my weapon first  draws   sir call put up for shame sir archy consider drawing a sword is a very serious piece of business and should be done in private   sir archy defend yourself for by the sacred cross of st andrew i will have satisfaction for making us illegitimate   sir call now by the cross of st patrick you are a very foolish man but if you have a mind for a little of that sport come away to the right spot   sir archy no equivocation sir dinna think you have gotten beaux mordecai to cope with   sir call come on then for the honor the sod oh you are as welcome as the flowers in may  they fight   enter charlotte charl for heavens sake what is the matter what is all this about   sir call it is about sir archys greatgrandmother madam   carl sir archys greatgrandmother   sir archy madam he has cast an affront upon a hail nation   sir call i am sure if i did it was more than i intended it was only to prove the antiquity of my family   charl pray let me make peace between you   sir archy sir as ye say ye didna intend the affront i am satisfied   sir call sir archy there are two things i am always afraid of the one is of being affronted myself and the other of affronting any man   charl a very generous disposition sir calloghan but i hope this afair is over   sir archy i am satisfied madam but let me tell you sir calloghan as a friend as a friend man you should never enter into disputes about history literature or antiquity of families for you have got such a cursed wicked jargon upon your tongue    sir call oh i beg your pardon sir archy it is you have got such a damned twist of scotch brogue that you dont understand good english when i speak it   sir archy very weel very weel but you are out again for every body kens that i speak the south country dialect sae weel that wharever i gang i am always taken for an englishman  but well appeal to the lady which of us two has the brogue   sir call with all my heart  pray madam

hear that you and the filly both run a wrong side the post   sir theo squire this is no time to joke and triffle on so serious and severely affecting a stroke to make an attempt to disguise our feelings however sir this is a charming girl whose virtues deserve a noble fortune but the loss of it will surely make no abatement in your affections   groom hark sir theodore i always make a match agreeable to the speed or age of my cattle or the weight my things can carry when i offered to match her give and take the filly was neither piper nor blinker  chest bound nor spavind but i hear now

some blood and will do well enough to breed out of but i will not keep her in training though for she cannot carry weight sufficient to come through matrimony sir is a cursed long course  devilish heavy and sharp turnings it will not do  she cannot come through  no damme she cannot come through   sir archy i think squire ye judge right in my thoughts  the best thing the lady can do is to snap the irishman   mord well observed sir archy   groom ay ay archy has an excellent nose and hits aff a fault as well as any hound i ever followed   sir archy he is sic a luiver as a lady in her circumstances could wish   charl thou wretch whose sentiments of honor are still more despicable than your sentiments of love but though i am to fortune lost my mind shall never be guilty of

loves her vehemently  three excellent qualities come come madam truelove is impatient and despises ceremony  gie him your hand at anes   charl no sir i cannot impose myself upon sir calloghan though unworthy of his esteem and destitute of friends and fortune   sir call what means all this   sir theo why nephew this lady here my unfortunate ward this morning was possessed of a legacy as we thought fit to make happy the first of families but by my ill conduct and want of care her fortune is lost abroad which i had ventured in trade and the law suit lost at home  therefore her virtue not fortune must now be the object of your affections   sir call i assure you sir theodore i rejoice at her distress  for when she was rich i approached her with fear and trembling because i was not her equal but now she is poor and has nobody to defend her i fell something warm about my heart that tells me i love her better than when i thought she was rich and if my life and fortune will be of any service to her she shall command them for ever and ever   charl generous man   sir theo and will you take her for life   sir call ay and for death too which is a great deal longer than life you know   sir theo

cross upon us slung by heavens  distancd to damnation   sir archy gently gently whist  he is only taking him in  the bubbles bit   sir theo why do you now pause dear nephew it was only a scheme to try the mean the mercenary illiberal arts of those who are a disgrace to mankind their country and themselves   sir call why this is something like what those little jackanapes about town call humbugging a man  first she has no fortune and then she has a fortune and then she has no fortune again   sir theo what i now tell you is a sacred truth take her sir and with her a heart worthy your acceptance  take her as a reward for your disinterested affection   sir call take her  the devil take me if i dont   charl and i yield sir to your disposal with unfeigned pleasure   sir call by the glory of a soldier i had rather be at her foot than at the head of a regiment  and now she is mine by all the rules of war  i have a right to lay her under contribution for her kisses are lawful plunder kisses her o ye are a little tight creature  pon honor her breath is as sweet as the sound of a trumpet   groom why the knowing ones are all taken in here  stripped and double distancd  zounds the filly has run a crimp upon us   mord damn it she has jilted us most confoundedly   sir archy by the cross of st andrew i will be revenged  i ken a lad of an honorable family wha understands the ancient classics
