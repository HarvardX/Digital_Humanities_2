the guardian goddess of health or the whole art of preventing and curing diseases and of enjoying peace and happiness of body and of mind to the longest possible period of human existence with precepts for the preservation and exaltation of personal beauty and loveliness  to which is added an account of the composition preparation and properties of the three great medicines prepared and dispensed at the temple of health adelphi and at the temple of hymen pall mall london  by james graham m d  this book is of so much real importance to the health and happiness of each individual among the public that though it contains more matter or reading than most two shilling pamphlets it is ordered to be sold for only two pence  a price very inadequate to the prime cost of the paper printing distribution etc but  salus populi suprema lex est  london printed for the people and by the rosy heralds of health distributed  a short description of the composition preparation and properties of the three great medicines prepared and dispensed at the temple of health in the center of the royal terrace adelphi london and which are now sold in almost every city and great town in the world being perhaps the first advertised medicines that sovereign princes and crowned heads were ever advisd or by their physicians permitted to take with ample directions for using the medicines  i electrical ether or an aggregate compound of the most active faculties of the material soul of the universe this admirable composition is one of the purest and most subtle essences in nature it is a combination or concentration of all her elementary powers and vivifying influences being an essence extracted by air magnetism and the electrical or celestial fire from the richest oriental aromatics etc with the balmiest and most active ether a few of the richest mildest and most cordial roots barks seeds flowers fruits gums and balsams which flow into this great metropolis from the four quarters of the globe especially those from asia and the choicest of the british simples are under my own immediate inspection selected properly prepared and put into massy glass vessels and upon them is poured a due quantity of the finest aetherial spirit they are then placed in one of the great metallic globes on the dome of the electrical temples of health and of hymen in the apollo and other apartments of those great and most useful institutions to be acted upon by the celestial fire etc and lastly the essence is purified by filtration upon a new principle which prevents all possibility of the finest and most volatile parts evaporating  the globes are entirely lined with metal in the in  as well as on the outside they are twelve in number each containing full thirtysix gallons the glass vessels too are covered with metal enclosed in curious magnetic cases and their stoppers are pierced with glass tubes and thick metal rods which end in a multitude of points from which streams of the electrical fire etc  are continually pouring in upon the ether and aromatics in luminous and most glorious streams  the immense quantity of this vivifying restorative fire etc which is accumulated in these temples flows thus into the medicines through the rods and tubes abovementioned which with the magnetic effluvium passes even through the outside of the glasses etc to the substances contained in them for each of the four great globes becomes a genial cool oven glowing with the plenitude of these salutary vital and harmonious influences  by this curious and most wonderful process like every operation which i perform on my patients with this or with any other part of my astonishing and tremendous apparatus which altogether in both the temples occupies in fact twenty rooms i have it in absolute command and subjection acting arbitrarily or at pleasure on the medicines  on my patients  or on any part of their body or limbs particularly affected in any quantity or with any degree of power according to the nature of the substances or as the various constitutions etc  of my patients require in short the whole of the apparatus employed in making the three great medicines mentioned in this description if solid metal would weigh considerably above seven hundred thousand pounds after the above account of the composition and preparation of the electrical ether it would be quite unnecessary for me to dwell on its manifold and surprising virtues philosophers physicians and chemists must plainly see that by the above means a rich yet simple homogene and vivifying quintessence must be produced  an utter enemy to diseases and corruption  and a cordial peacemaker in all strife and discord in the human body these facts must be too obvious to every person of even a very common understanding to require commenting upon i shall just say that for preventing every species of infection and for curing all low nervous lingering and putrid diseases nothing on earth can equal this most noble quintessence which i choose to call simply  electrical ether and as it is much easier and wiser to prevent diseases than to cure them i shall point out very briefly its uses in the first place as a preventive  first then all persons who frequent public places and who regard their health ought never to be without a vial of the electrical ether even in their pocket  those especially who are subject to catch colds and dangerous disorders  or who have weakness and oppressions at their breast and stomach  or a nervous system irritable and relaxed  it is well known by every person who knows any thing at all of medicine or philosophy that the air of any place after it has been breathed and charged with the phlogisticated or mephitic breath perspiration etc of even the cleanest soundest and healthiest persons  becomes not only altogether unfit for respiration but likewise absoutely and highly poisonous but how much more dangerous and unwholesome must it be to draw into our lungs perhaps for several hours together the foul and putrid exhalations which reek from the dirty bodies and garments  secret sores  and corrupted lungs crammed up in places of public amusement  i am not at all surprised at the severe diseases and sudden deaths which happen among both young and old no but i am astonished that many more do not happen and that so many rational beings should submit to the drudgery and danger not to mention the expense of attending crowded  nonsensical  public places but as it is in vain to oppose the tyrannic force of fashion or to shake off the mighty influence of habit which with absolute sway govern every thing that has the breath of life i would advise every prudent person before they go into such places to fortify their body and harmonize their mind with taking a tea spoonful of the electrical ether or nervous aetherial balsam on sugar or in any thing they like best  and even to smell now and then to the former in such places when they suspect danger or when they find themselves languid or oppressed  by these precautions many hundreds of the nobility and gentry in europe experience daily from it the happiest effects and when they return home faint relaxed and exhausted from over heated rooms public or private from enervating indulgencies too in sacrificing to venus or bacchus or from violent agitations of body and of mind  they are presently refreshed recruited composed and invigorated by smelling to the electrical ether for a few minutes by taking a tea spoonful or two of it or rather of the nervous aetherial balsam in a glass of brandy  of wine  or of cold water  or even by pouring a little of the electrical ether into a basin or quart mug half filled with hot water coffee green tea or an infusion of aromatic british herbs flowers etc and breathing over it for a few minutes by these means under god sweet sound and refreshing sleep and mental tranquillity are with certainty procured  and all possibility of disease or decay effectually warded off  and these happy effects are rendered still more certain kindly and lasting if the persons will wash or bathe their face neck hands feet and private parts  especially the latter with pure cold water  or with milk and water  about blood warm this simple and delightful affair of bathing the private parts and fundament every night and morning summer and winter in sickness and in health in cold milk or water  is of more importance to the bodily health youthful beauty and sweet desireableness of men and women than any thing i can possibly mention or inculcate if this most salutary practice of applying even partially cold or at most tepid water or milk to the surface of the body and limbs  if simplicity moderation regularity and temperance in the indulgence of every appetite and in the gratification of every desire  in a word if prudence wisdom delicacy virtue and that genuine religion which flows warm and silent in an everlasting and supremely cordial circulation between the perfection of every excellence  the eternal source of life love light and happiness  and the benevolent  the melting  the enlarged human breast  if this sterling  this allblessing religion which knows no distinction of sect church age or country  and whose signet of divinity is liberty forbearance and universal love  if these with their whiterobed attendants who came down from heaven and who will conduct us thither  namely innocence activity and peace  were permitted to direct and control our thoughts words and actions daily from our birth to the last day of life  the image of god which he stamped on mankind at their original creation would be in a great measure recovered and preserved  we should continue very long and very happily in this transient  probationary state of existence  a hundred years seeming but as one summers day while with a gradual descent we would glide gently and sweetly down the hill of life under the serene and lucid influence of its evening sky  behold here in a few words my courteous and intelligent reader a complete system or the whole art of health beauty loveliness longlife and happiness temporal and eternal which if properly and constantly attended to physicians and dignified clergymen would be almost as unnecessary in the world as soldiers and solicitors and as are such codes of laws and discipline in church and in state as they are at present administered in almost every nation on earth  which are in general dark unreasonable unjust and diabolical and extremely contradictory to the spirit and advancement of true religion sound policy and of the healing art however agreeable to the letter of the law the canons of the churches or the practice of the royal colleges of physicians millions of the human species have felt and millions do now feel too sensibly the truth of this assertion  o law o physic o divinity when  when will you under go a necessary ordeal  a thorough a rational reformation i  as to wars  i will not mention them for my whole frame quivers with horror even at the thought of them  carnage  bankruptcies poverty  devastation  hunger and thirst  horrible apprehensions  forced from our native land  and all these for what why for the honor and glory of the god of mercy and peace  for a punctilio of what is called national honor  too often indeed for nothing at all  to obtain an eventual evil  or for the acquisition of the shadow of a shade i could almost venture i think to prophecy that the time will come though perhaps it is very distant when the interests and differences of nations and what is called the balance of power will be settled by less horrible  less unnatural  less diabolical means than fire and sword and that the children of those men naval and military who are now trained up to and who glory in ruin and devastation carnage theft depredation and murder will be taught to adorn the sciences embellish the arts or to illuminate the human mind  instead of hewing down like savage monsters their fellow creatures  or of eating up like drones the bread of the children of industry but i beg pardon for making this digression i beg pardon i mean of their worships and high mightinesses the clergy the heroes or men of war the lawyers and the physicians and i will now return to finish the descriptive sketch of the nature and properties of my electrical ether  in the course of last winter i had frequent opportunities of observing the good effects of this essence and of the nervous aetherial balsam upon many ladies and gentlemen who were uncommonly susceptible of the evils which arise from the cold rawness and fogs of this variable climate occasioning rehumatic complaints in the joints and still more particularly in the head and face with swellings of the cheek and gums sore throats and tickling defluxions on the breast and lungs by the use of these two medicines and by keeping the body open with the imperial pills those complaints which formerly had confined them almost constantly through the winter to the house were happily prevented and in others who were seized as usual the cough soreness of the breast fevers and inquietudes were speedily carried off by the gentle and moderate use of these precious and most friendly medicines  but the electrical ether is more especially necessary for those who attend courts of justice public meetings sick persons and those places where hundreds of common people are crammed up in the galleries etc nothing in nature is or can be equal to the electrical ether the nervous aetherial balsam and the cool open air in curing all even the very worst and most confirmed species of lownervousputrid fevers ulcerated and gangrenous sore throats the smallpox  mortifications and the whole tribe of putrid consumptive dropsical scorbutic and paralytic disorders by only smelling to or breathing over the ether and taking now and then a tea spoonful of it or of the balsam in a cup of white wine  tar water or common cold water  the patient always finds instant relief and generally a perfect cure while those about him or in the house are effectually secured from that dangerous malignancy which often sweeps off whole families into one common and untimely grave  as the effects or rather the medicines themselves fly in a moment with the swiftness of light from the sun  over the whole system no other cordial whatever in nature has been found so instantaneously and so lastingly to recruit the strength and spirits after great fatigue or violent exertions of body or of mind especially in venereal pleasures  they refresh brace compose comfort and literally speaking illuminate all the bodily  and through them  all the mental faculties in short in all severe illnesses in sinkings and in faintings in consequence of severe excruciating pain profuse evacuations of blood etc and draining weaknesses of every kind or from whatever causes proceeding these medicines especially the nervous aetherial balsam are always found to produce the most astonishing good effects which are manifested to the patient and to every one present even the first minute they are used  ii nervous aetherial balsam or the restorative aetherial oil for decayed and worn out constitutions if the reader can conceive of the richest  purest  and most strengthening parts of all the cordial and nourishing things he is acquainted with in nature  being extracted purified exalted harmonized and concentrated into a small compass  he may also conceive of the nature and properties of this precious balsam  the peruvian bark cinnamon saffron castor lavender sage rosemary redrosebuds electrical nitre ambergrise myrrh amber and benjamin  the balsams of tolu and gilead  and various other balmy bracers and fragrant aromatic strengtheners are selected with my own hand and prepared under my own eye a pure aetherial essence combined with a certain portion of the richest and most genuine wine is then poured upon the ingredients and being properly mixed and secured they are placed to macerate and digest like the electrical ether under the united influences of dephlogisticated or vivifying air ether magnetism and electricity in the great globes which compose the tremendous pyramids on the domes of the temples  from the present general style of living  from the luxury folly dissipation and enervating indulgences of persons perhaps of every rank the disorders which now a days prevail and which harass and wear out human life are such as proceed either from condensed fluids morbid humors and heterogeneous viscidities in the blood or lymph  or from irritation relaxation and debility of the solids and nervous system the former however complicated  however various in their appearances are very justly attributed to venereal scorbutic gouty or scrophulous humors  and the latter are promiscuously and not improperly termed nervous they arise chiefly from tepid soft luxurious and artificial living enervating indulgencies i mean in venereal pleasures and from drinking daily that agonizing yet bewitching poison foreign tea and are often so distressing and oppressive to the miserable patient  as to make riches and honors and even life itself a burden  a weary and heavy burden which they would gladly  nay even sometimes  impiously and fatally venture to lay down  in the former cases namely in viscidities and impurities of the blood and juices from scorbutic venereal gouty and rheumatic humors the imperial pills by and by to be described will be found in general the safest and most certain antidote and in the latter viz in all nervous putrid and debilitated habits this nervous atherial balsam is without exception the mildest and most effectual remedy that can be met with in the whole circle of nature  for in all nervous complaints and weaknesses  in all convulsions epileptic apoplectic and hysteric fits in all obstructions and irregularities in the monthly periods of women particularly at the two critical and most dangerous periods of commencement and final cessation this balsam the electrical ether or the imperial pills are absolutely infallable in producing the happiest effects for i will venture to say that there is scarce a menstrual obstruction in the world  however complicated or however confirmed but what will be overcome and effectually removed by taking three tea spoonfuls of the electrical ether and as much of the nerv aeth balsam mixed both together in a pint of cold water for three successive mornings if the patient is plump and sanguine but if on the contrary she is lean cold and languid she must take three tea spoonfuls of the nervous aetherial balsam and the like quantity of the electrical ether thrice every day in wine spirits or herb tea and continue it for only three days in both cases and under these opposite circumstances with due attention to the above distinctions a perfect cure will undoubtedly take place especially if plenty of the medicines be rubbed on the loins and back bone and in the former case the application of cold water is made to the parts hands and feet for hours daily  and in the latter case warm wine or spirits and water  be applied daily in like manner  in both and in every case running about in the open air is earnestly recommended  but when the patient is too much weakened and reduced from the opposite causes  namely too long  too copious and profuse a flow  and great paleness and debility brought on  rest cool air  the application to the parts and indeed to every part of the body and limbs of cold milk and water or red wine and a course of the nervous aetherial balsam with an infusion or tea of the peruvian bark red rose leaves and a little nitre with bristol or spa water  will build her up into a rock of snowy alabaster studded with roses and streaked with celestial blue removing the causes of sterility or barrenness  making her a lovely and desirable companion  a healthy and a happy mother  but for farther particulars relative to these delicate and important matters see my private medical advice to married ladies and gentlemen to those especially who are not blessed with children  with full directions for prevention or for speedy and perfect recovery after miscarriages and dangerous lyingsin to be had comprised and printed in two sheets folio sealed up alone at my house in the adelphi and at the temple of hymen in pall mall price only one guinea  n b in the above such simple natural and effectual means for removing the causes of barrenness in both sexes as never were recommended or even thought of before in any age or nation  are pointed out  and such directions given as will if duly attended to make man and wife sweeter  lovelier  more amiable  and more desirable in the eyes of one another  after what has been already said i need scarcely add that in all scarlet miliary jail bilious nervous putrid spotted and malignant fevers  especially those of the east and west indies america etc these medicines are absolute and speedy specifics a person armed and provided with these and with the genuine powder of dr james need not fear any inflammatory fever or any low putrid malignant or bisious fever or complaint whatever in any climate season or in any part of the terraqueous globe these will be a most complete apothecarys shop and nature common sense and the patients own feelings  a trio of the safest and wisest physicians  in every case therefore where the patient is low faint feeble or emaciated from scorbutic or venereal virus a sharp poverty  or putrid dissolution of the blood and juices  or from want of a due elastic tone of the solids  arising from a deficiency of the vital spirits  or of the balmy nervous fluid this nervous aetherial balsam has not its equal in nature  and this i aver confidently from very much and very happy experience in actual practice which in all things is the only infallible guide  the only incontrovertible evidence thousands by it alone have been snatched from the grave and still many more thousands of the human species when languid and worn out with diseases excesses irregularities enormities and early imprudencies have been suddenly built up into firm rocks of blooming health and intellectual happiness  i shall conclude this short account of this great medicine by observing that in all lesser nervous complaints and uneasinesses occasioned by tea coffee adulterated wine or pernicious liquors and in all those little lingering fevers heats and chillinesses and those tremors and quiverings of body and restless anxieties dread horrors discontent and unsettlednesses of mind which proceed merely from an irregular circulation of the blood or from spasms debility or relaxation of the nervous system  this aetherial balsam will always be found of immediate service and by a gentle  persevering course of it and of the imperial pills duly attending to the directions given with them a perfect and a lasting cure will in general be obtained because by them the blood and juices are purified sweetened tempered and brought to a pure fluid state while the solids are braced and strengthened and the nerves sheathed nourished steadied and coiled up  many fanciful rich and luxurious people who are in fact in good health and who ought by no means to take this precious aetherial balsam or any other medicine nevertheless accustom themselves to take more or less of it and even an imperial pill or two every day  with such people or when at any time they are taken into a sound and tranquil body they produce no other operation or sensation than a more genial and brisker flow of the blood and animal spirits  and that species of contentment thankfulness and benevolent gladness of heart which makes us happy in ourselves and agreeable to all about us but where they meet with diseases and corruption they encounter them with the boldness and majesty of a lion effecthally expelling them and leaving a clean and a quiet house for health and happiness to reside in  the nervous aetherial balsam then is by very far and without exception the most exhilerating antispasmodic bracing restorative strengthening and consequently antisceptic medicine in the world  infinitely superior to the common tinctures of the bark valerian castor saffron lavender etc  and infinitely more cordial and mild than the burning inflammatory salts and fiery fetid spirits of hartshorn eau de luce sal volatile and all the liqueurs drams and cordials foreign and domestic which only bewitch and give a temporary relief which must soon give way to additional horror darkness dejection and despair  iii the imperial pills or the universal purifiers of the blood and juices this title was given to them to mark their exceeding superiority over all the analeptic or stomachic pills antiscorbutis drops and alterative purifying medicines that perhaps ever were invented or which are now used in the world  in all weaknesses oppressions flatulencies cholickly gripings and windy distensions of the stomach and bowels especially when those uneasy and indeed tormenting complaints proceed from scorbutic venereal gouty or bilious humors freting corroding and irritating the nervous coats of the stomach and bowels  or from heats acidities crudities and indigestions occasioned by full and foul feeding excessive drinking of hot and foul wines and liquors heats and colds or surfeits irregular and late hours as to sleep want of exercise and perspiration etc etc  in all such cases the imperial pills are constantly found to give immediate relief and if the person is prudent and temperate by a regular and gentle perseverance in the use of them  a perfect and a lasting cure will with a moral certainty be obtained  these pills are a composition of the purest parts of the choicest articles of the materia medica combined and rendered still more active by the united influences of air ether and magnetism hippocrates galen celsus sir isaac newton van helmont paracelfus descartes sydenham boil boerhaave and many others of the greatest philosophers and physicians ancient and modern that ever blessed and enlightened the world prophesied and in all their writings insisted upon it that whenever the practice of physic arrived to a high degree of perfection or medicines were discovered which would effectually eradicate diseases inducing health and peace in the body and mind alleviating the pressures of age and lengthening human life to the longest possible period it would be done by attending to the simple yet divine voice of nature and by the united influences of the great primary principles or natural agents which i so happily employ for those most important porposes animated by the concurring opinions of those great men  stimulated by the prospects which were opened to my view by those bright luminaries of science  shocked too at the very transcient rapid and painful progress of man through this world  and moreover almost mad at the trifling absurdities of the ordinary practice in this useful but dangerous art  and at the too feeble  or too harsh effect of most medicines as commonly used  i was compelled with a certain as it were divine or supernatural energy or impulse to search for wider and more rational paths and more effectual means for the prevention and cure of diseases how far i have succeeded those who are acquainted with my medicines and practice or who even have read my late publications will be able to judge  i will only say that according to my abilities and agreeable to the ideas and directions of those great men i have studied and endeavored to unite every affinity that there is between the elements and man  between the sun moon and stars and man  and in short between man and every thing in the great system of the universe which affects his body and through that his mind however remotely however invisibly connected with his frame but as the perfecting all this vast and most comprehensive system requires a degree of intelligeuce far  very far superior to what i can pretend to i trust that god will raise up a succession of men who will carry on and perfect what i have so happily begun in the mean time i respectfully entreat the correspondence of all men of learning science and ingenuity most earnestly beseeching every man and woman in the world without exception to communicate to me personally by their friends or by letter any thing that they already know or may hereafter discover for the cure alleviation or prevention of any one disease or for rendering human existence longer or happier on this earth and likewise whatever they now know or may hereafter discover for the improvement or embellishment of religion philosophy or the useful arts especially in metals and minerals i will be extremely happy to be favored with the opinions and conjectures of persons of ingenuity of goodness of heart or of excentric brilliant imaginations and as this correspondence will cost each of my friends individually but a few pence for paying the postages of their letters while otherwise the aggregate centring in me would cost probably several hundred pounds annually i hope therefore that my liberal polite and ingenious correspondents will continue to have the goodness to write to me post paid their favors shall as usual be registered and a true account of the success of what they recommend or have discovered sent to them in whatever part of the world they reside  once more for the honor and glory of god  for the good and happiness of the human species in general i earnestly invite and most solemnly exhort every man and woman of worth goodness and ingenuity in whatever sphere of life they move from the imperial throne to the beggars hut  to the above mentioned communications or correspondence and by benefactions of money or lands or testamentary donations to establish a fund to defray the expenses which necessarily attend printing books and chemical and philosophical processes and investigations  for the adcancement of true vital and universal religion for the improvement of science and for the embellishment and extension of the useful arts   according to the true principles of electricity and of the philosophic chemistry and are constantly acted upon by these powerful and most genial agents for several months in the upper globe of the pyramidal metal dome of the temple of health which globe alone like each of the other three contains thirtysix gallons and is of the finest burnished gold  the imperial pills are of so mild and friendly a nature that they are found to agree perfectly well with both sexes and with every age and constitution they operate first by dissolving all tough cold phlegm or slime and other gross corrupted bilious and putrid humors which not only clog and irritate the stomach and bowels but form a nest and nourishment for those common and most destructive vermin worms  which they effectually kill evacuate and carry off by stool and urine after that by continuing their moderate use as an alterative without change of diet confinement or any irksome restraint whatever they subdue eradicate and expel by stool urine and a breathing insensible perspiration all scorbutic gouty rheumatic venereal bilious and scrophulous humors however long they may have lurked and prevailed in the system preying on and exhausting the strength and spirits and undermining and destroying all the springs and principles of life  rubbing and exercise are universally allowed to be good for the recovery as well as for the preservation of health now these act by exciting the electrical fire in the body which removes obstructions animates and braces the imperial pills therefore and the aetherial balsam being filled with the electrical or celestial fire and solar light which the balmy resins of which they are composed have imbibed and do retain promote all the natural and necessary circulations secretions and absorptions and consequently must be of the greatest service to those persons especially to females who take too little free air and exercise though at the same time they live full and are of a costive or irregular habit upon the same grounds they are found exceedingly beneficial in those heats spasms pains and uneasinesses in females occasioned by the periodical fullness of their vessels and from certain other causes but the good effects in gouty scorbutic and rheumatic cases and in all eruptions or pimples of the face  sores or blotches of the body and limbs however invete rately blended in the blood  however obstinately confirmed in the constitution  are really astonishing the dreadful train of sufferings which the miserable patients in the above cases endure and even the most obstinate rheumatic swellings and weaknesses of the joints etc yield very readily to the superior efficacy of these excellent pills  and they are a diuretic of so soft yet searching a nature that they generally give very speedy ease in severe fits of the stone and gravel and by persevering in a proper course of them and of my nervous aetherial balsam at the same time and drinking veal broth with plenty of gum arabic dissolved in it or of a decoction of liquorice linseed and marshmallow roots poured upon shred leeks and bruised fennil seeds with some honey or treacle they often have been found to cure radically those most painful and most excruciating disorders  but in all less grievous though abundantly troublesome complaints of the first passages  they are an absolute specific for they immediately restore lost appetite and correct all hot acrid and four fermentations in the stomach and bowels which they so genially cool and invigotate as to enable them to concoct and extract those fine mild nutritious juices of our food and drink which nourish the body and gladden the soul by these means the breath is rendered balmy and sweet the face is cleared from scurf heat and pimples premature wrinkles are smoothed away and obliterated and the complexion rendered clear smooth fresh and youthful and all these happy effects are produced insensibly as it were without as i said before confinement particular regimen in food or drink or hindrance of business their operation like the nervous aetherial balsam being so mild and congenial to human nature that they may be taken under any circumstance in any climate or at any season of the year though when taken merely as a preserver of health the spring and autumn seasons are doubtless the most proper  the imperial pills therefore while they fortify the stomach and bowels and purge the blood and lymph from all morbid humors and heterogeneous sharpnesses and viscidities they so perfectly eradicate all venereal and scorbutic diseases that i defy the world to bring me any such case if at all curabl but what i will radically speedily and safely cure by a proper course first of these pills and afterward of my aetherial balsam without the use of one grain of that horrible poison mercury indeed than these medicines and my electrical sulphur there has been no others as yet discovered whatever quacks and empyries may pretend which so speedily and so completely counteract the deadly effects of mercury and other violent medicines which often so tear shake and debilitate the constitution as to make the dear bought cure of the primary complaint no great blessing to the feeble unnerved patient this singular and most invaluable quality of the imperial pills is ocularly demonstrated to the patient and to all his friends by almost instantly stopping the highest salivation throwing off the pocky or scorbutic virus etc by stool by urine and by sweat and by making the quicksilver run off in globules by stool in quantities nearly proportioned to those that had been unfortunately used now the universally allowed and two well known effects of mercury are to dissolve and break down the mass of blood into a sharp watery putrid gore  and to tear deaden relax and render tremulous the whole nervous system but the imperial pills carry the mercury and all venereal and scorbutic humors entirely out of the body restoring the healthy tone of the stomach bowels and solids in general  and the nervous aetherial balsam very speedily warms and steadies the cold  quivering  tottering body restoring the balmy crasis of the blood and juices sheathing bracing and invigorating the dry shrunk and tremulous nerves and absolutely cures all seminal weaknesses and debility in both sexes from whatever causes proceeding but those especially which arise from ill cured neglected improperly treated or repeated venereal complaints early imprudencies irregularities and all unnatural and inordinate exertions and indulgencies especially in the sacrifices that are made to venus or to bacchus one of the peculiar and most important properties of my nervous aetherial balsam is to recover and produce that genial vital warmth which is so different from an inflaming feverish heat  let the inventors or proprietors of other medicines which are sent abroad into the world make a parade of their patents etc  for these great medicines i never thought of such securities or sanctions no i am not afraid of any one counterfeiting them though i find it has been vainly and ridiculously attempted the compositions are so curious and complex and the ingredients so very subtle that they will not bear to be analyzed by even the most skilful adept in philosophical or pharmaceutical chemistry i repeat it the ingredients are too costly and too numerous  the processes too complex and tedious  and the apparatus employed in the preparation of them costs too many thousand pounds for most adventurers even of abilities in the medical or medicinal line to engage with or even to think of they are now i find bought by some of the most eminent of the faculty in various parts of the world as well as in these kingdoms and exhibited in severe dangerous and important cases sometimes as their own preparations and i assure the nobility gentry and even the faculty who are desirous of knowing every ingredient in the composition of each or of either of the three medicines that they need only apply to me to be fully satisfied in every particular which they feel themselves interested in to know them is to approve of them and to use them once is to use and recommend them most cordially for ever such is their intrinsic excellency that they will bear every test  even the test  the criterion  the fiery ordeal of experience in the most confirmed and most hopeless cases  for they have been brought to their present high state of perfection by long and deliberate investigations of the real qualities of medicines by the deepest researches into chemistry enlightened by the important discoveries and improvements which have lately been made in natural philosophy and finally by the nicest and most assiduous attention to the effects and operations of the medicines themselves in a most extensive course of private practice in this as well as in various foreign countries and the invariable result of their judicious use has been effectually to prevent and with certainty to cure most diseases to which mankind is obnoxious  but especially those which the natives of these islands are liable to at sea or in foreign countries  insomuch that many gentlemen especially of the army and navy would now almost as soon go to sea without provisions or upon along journey without money as without a certain stock of these three precious remedies indeed in the hands of people of prudence and good sense they supersede the need of a traveling physician or of any medicine chest  for they are of themselves an apothecarys shop fully adequate to the prevention and cure of most diseases and so thoroughly convinced am i of the universal salutariness and superior efficacy of these three great medicines that in a very few years i will probably relinquish the practical part of medicine altogether but continue to dispense these medicines all over the world while for the good of the human species of every nation and clime  even for the children of those who shall be born a thousand years hence i will publicly teach medicine and philosophy in academical lectures and from time to time publish what i am now compiling viz a complete system of prophylactic and practical medicine or the whole art without even a shadow of reserve of preventing and curing diseases perhaps likewise i may send into the world a complete and rational body of divinity or true vital religion which i am now likewise preparing and perhaps moreover a manual of human prudence  or a safe and complete guide of life and a simple yet full and naturally digested code of laws for civil political and ecclesiastical government  submitted with great deference to those to whom they more immediately and more properly belong but to return i was observing the efficacy of the three great medicines in restoring decayed consumptive and wornout constitutions or after severe diseases harsh and improper medicines or hardships and sickness in foreign hot climates upon this subject i can scarce say enough yet to those who are acquainted with the medicines everything which even i could say would be quite unnecessary what need is there to expatiate on the genial qualities of the sun which are universally felt and universally acknowledged  i will only observe for the information of the world in general that in all such cases they moisten warm refresh and build up the whole system with bland mild balmy and nutritious juices and by inducing a free regular steady and genial circulation of the blood which is the true radical moisture spirits and nervous fluid or that aetherial invisible principle which actuates the nerves and which altogether constitute the balmy life of the body and finally by inducing the due and reciprocal action of the solids and fluids on each other or in other words that happy equilibrium  that peaceful balance which nature delights in and constantly endeavors to maintain in the whole visible as well as invisible creation  they produce in the human body that peaceful homogene tranquil state which we call health and which is doubtless the natural and original state of all created things for pain discord and disease are so very unnatural that even pain and disease are only a departure from and imply a possibility of health  or the attainment of that state which nature pants after and which man originally possessed all distempers are in fact but a struggle between the vis vitae and the peculiar miasma or fomes merbi indeed every species and degree of pleasure and of bodily and mental happiness which we enjoy in this world are only the irradiations or emanations of this primary principle namely concord or health this is the great unity  the root and branches  the flowers and the fruits  the sap and the life of mankind to contrive and adapt from the harmonious combination of the four elements acting on natural substances of known efficacy such medicines as could root out disease discord and strife from the human body and produce cultivate and nourish this heavenly unity has been my constant study i may say day and night for many years how far i have succeeded has been long and abundantly obvious not only from the prodigious and unprecedented sale of these great medicines but from the astonishing and well known numbers which are daily dismissed from the temple of health perfectly cured of diseases which had baffled all other human means now this unity or health  this selfremedy in nature for all her disorders was the seal with which god impressed every thing at the creation and it was this in man which was emphatically called the image of god  this was paradise for man this was the paradise of the earth and of all the elements  but man departing from god and from the innocence and simplicity in which he was created brought discord and diseases into his soul and body  from hence proceeds his short and uncertain existence in this world hence flow pain disease and death  and from hence too perhaps all evil and commotions within and without in the natural and in the moral world all fevers fermentations jarrings restlessness commotions pains and diseases in the human body are therefore proofs of that hidden  constitutional peace and health which it has lost and necessarily gravitates unto and endeavors to regain although it knows not the way  nor is it always so happy as to meet with or follow a friendly and unerring guide  that the above medicines conjunctly are such a friend  such a guide no one will doubt who has attended properly to the plain open and simple description which i have given of them nor will any one deny the truth of the fact who has fairly and prudently used them  even in the most desperate cases these great medicines then will restore health and tranquillity  because they restore in our body as i have above shown that original unity  balance  harmony or equilibrium which nature delights in and continually strives to maintain in all her works  especially in the human body and mind as being the most perfect and important of all that she has created or placed on this terraqueous globe  these therefore conjunctly may justly be esteemed the true and genuine universal medicine  the boasted and long wished for prima materia  aurum potabile or elixir vitae of the philosophers chemists and physicians of every age since medicine became a science  in these three medicines by the wonderful influence of the mighty  primary  simple agents upon each other and upon the simple substances above mentioned which for so many ages have been found so friendly to man  is produced and fixed  a vivifying  homogene principle which counteracts disease insures health and the prolongation of our mortal existence in the balmy bed of these three medicines all elementary and intestine strife ceases here the active  the irresistible powers of air earth fire and water blend their seemingly jarring principles and are at peace here wih the swiftness of thought they meet in one common center they kiss each other as it were  cordially embrace and are at rest in this paradisiacal  this balmy bed for be it known and however paradoxical it may appear it is nevertheless a certain  sublime and philosophical truth that the quickest motion is the most perfect rest when a boy whips his top into the briskest motion  it turns about with such exceeding swiftness that it appears perfectly motionless  and he says it is asleep would not any thing that could pass from this to the east indies and back again in the thousandth part of a moment  be at perfect rest  could a thought  or any thing that could glance or be shot from your eye in london to the farthest verge  to the most distant point of the globe and back again in the millionth part of the time of a twinkle in your eye  could it be said to move at all  surely not  when the cause of disease therefore is expelled by these great medicines they instantly compose all strife i never swallow any wine spirits or malt liquor strong or weak mixed nor unmixt and yet i undergo daily with pleasure cheerfulness and good health more fatigue of body and of mind than perhaps any other man in london  if after the business of the day or when i am forced to be up all night when sent for in great emergencies  i find myself faint and exhausted  i immediately draw the vapor of the electrical ether with great force into my nostrils  or pour a few teaspoonfuls of it into a basin of warm water and breathe over it  and ordering a few new laid eggs to be beat as it were into a thin oil and then mixed with some sugar and very cold water i drink it off and eating a bit of biscuit rich ripe fruits or dry bread two days old i find myself in a few minutes perfectly fresh and recruited but what always astonishes me above measure is the seemingly miraculous effect of my electrical ether or nervous aetherial balsam of which when i take a teaspoonful or two into my mouth upon a bit of sugar i feel my body refreshed braced and strengthened and my mind enlarged and illuminated in one moment it darts its genial aetherial soul with the swiftness of light  or with the inconceivable swiftness above mentioned through every nerve  vein  artery i desire to repeat in other words what i have already expressed namely that if through extreme bodily fatigue and anxiety i feel myself as it were crampt in a cold dark room  in a moment  by the means of the electrical ether and nervous aetherial balsam i find myself saluted as it were by love  joy health and harmony who in a moment fling open celestial scenes  and smiling transport me on soft waving wings  with balmy and melodious gales into the sweet  brilliant and flowery palace where they the handmaids of happiness reside  illuminated with ten thousand lights of virgin wax  or warmed and gilded with a vernal  a meridian sun but to descend from the regions of metaphor  these wonderful and most genial medicines attune the body and through it the mind  or rather the mind and the body freed from discord and disease recover by their own energy their natural and original healthy tone and brilliancy  and this happy state attained  every thing which surrounds us appears likewise pleasant gay and harmonious like as in musical instruments tuned in unison every chord which is touched strikes and calls forth by its own vibratory force alone a corresponding musical tone from every octave in the other instruments in the same room thus invisibly touched these are facts perfectly well known to philosophers and to those who have studied music as a science but to return i say that upon the grounds of reason and common sense it is no wonder that these medicines when judiciously applied are so efficacious as to remove all disorders that arise from the jarrings and disproportions of the constituent parts or qualities in human bodies  because these medicines are adapted and accommodate themselves to all and health ensues in the most easy simple and natural manner the wise and sacred writer says that god has created medicines out of the earth and that he who is wise will not despise them  now as the qualities or virtues of all roots leaves flowers fruits and seeds  and of every medicinal substance in nature whether animal vegetable or mineral must undoubtedly reside in some little drops  some exquisitely small particles of one prima materia which is the fountain or center of existence life and health  and as this fountain  or source  or center is to be found alone by the gift of god or in other words by his blessing on the reverential and assiduous labors and investigations of those who search unweariedly into the vast treasures of nature with a view of promoting the good and happiness of the world and the honor and glory of god  whenever therefore we can extract and concentrate from the adventitious gross or inactive parts  the balmy simple homogeneous and vivisying particles of substances truly medicinal by means of the harmonious combination of the great universal principles of air ether magnetism electricity and solar light we need look for no other medicines and i defy any physician to mention an indication in the cure of any disease whether by altering attenuating opening purifying sweating purging vomiting passing off by the kidneys or by taking off spasms and irritations  by bracing and comforting the nerves  or by strengthening and vivifying the whole system but may be answered in the completest and most friendly manner by the judicious modulations and exhibitions of these three great medicines they will therefore upon principles perfectly demonstrable cure all curable diseases gladden the heart illuminate the mind and prolong human existence to the longest possible period because this exact mixture of hot and cold moist and dry  this harmonious tempering of the primary vital elements coalescing like chords in music must be peace makers in the strife or disorders of the constituent parts and qualities of mans body  and because the true quintessence of nature is fire i dont mean the gross impure consuming culinary fire which we have every day before us in the world by no means the fire which i employ in the cure of diseases and in the preparation of those three great medicines is the true elementary fire which has been worshipped as it were by the philosophers of all ages they had glimpses of it and even its dawn gleaming on their horizon filled them with ideas so vast and sublime that the herd of the world called them mad enthusiasts how much greater felicity must we enjoy upon whom the sun of science shines so bright as at this day how much more may we benefit and enlighten the human species but still the sun just alluded to is far  very  very far from having attained its meridian altitude it even now points but at six oclock of a summer morning yet how fast  how sweetly  do the buds of every branch of science open  the birds sing  all nature rejoices but those charming fields  these delightful prospects tempt me to wander too far i will return the fire i say which i employ in the cure of diseases and for the preparation of these great medicines is the universal living fire which connects and moves the whole solar system  which animates all nature and which you my courteous reader  this book the chair you sit in the charming object by your side and in a word every thing in the universe is full of and which we can now in a moment extract and make visible or perceptable to all your five senses this fire is the breath of life  the spirit of god  which he breathed at the creation into mans nostrils and which gives and maintains life throughout all his other works  it is the vital principle of generation the fire which quickens the embryo in the womb  even the pure fluid celestial electrical fire which pervades purges and animates all nature consuming disease and corruption  attracting and uniting the four elements  without destroying their variety or distinct powers  because it is itself a composition of them all  the joy of them all  and in a word the great band or material soul of the universe  this then is the natural  the celestial quintessence or instuence with which those three great medicines are impregnated  and with which they are replete  even with the harmonious combination of the four elementary qualities in one  and whenever this pure and simple light or concord is received into the body  disease and discord must vanish as the cold and darkness of the night must vanish at the presence of the morning  of the summers sun  and i will now conclude this short and very imperfect account of my great medicines with assuring those sick and infirm persons who have not yet had the happiness to partake of their salutary influences  that they are in their nature and operations easy and benign  genial and gentle as a dove  strengthening and exhilirating the soul and body of those who will have the soul to be immaterial will be perhaps highly offended at my bringing it in upon every occasion head and shoulders with the body the reason is because i can no way succeed in separating them we all know that light though supremely pure and infinitely subtle  is nevertheless material and i agree so far with the generality of the world as to consider the human soul as a substance or emanation in consequence of the exquisite organization of our body  so exquisitely  so supremely pure and subtilias to be absolutely invisible and inconceivable to any or all of our senses i find that the materiality or nature of the soul is now a point bitterly disputed by philosophors for my own part i profess that i know nothing at all about the matter i know however that it is a point which we have no sort of business with  and as to this and all other matters which are not essential to our happiness in this or in any other state of existence  and which cannot possibly be settled in this world  i think we had better be easy and not quarrel  wrangle  and disturb one another about such abstruse metaphysical and i may say nonsensical matters thus i have in three words written all that i ever intend to write upon this subject those to whom they are thankfully and prudently administered  whilst at the same time they are as strong and as furious as lions in subduing and evacuating diseases and every thing that is injurious or unfriendly to good health or to human existence but the strength above alluded to is the strength of a protector  and the fury that of love  because they hurt not the weakest or most delicate in infancy or in old age  to the former they are as milk and honey  to the latter as generous wine or the smoothest  the sweetest oil  and to pursue the metaphor they are in the last stages of most severe and fatal diseases what fresh oil is to an expiring lamp  when the flame is like a sickly shadow quivering and gasping in the dry socket  these great medicincs which are sold at no other place in london or westminster but at the temple of heath adelphi and at the temple of hymen in pall mall are carefully put up and secured in strong flint vials  even the imperial pills  because they would immediately lose their virtue if kept in a pillbox  or exposed to the open air the three medicines are all sold at the same price viz  in vials of five shillings half a guinea and one guinea each  for the convenience of the navy and army  of the commanders of east and west india ships  and of ladies and gentlemen traveling by sea or land proper assortments of all the three medicines are put up in mahogany cabinets of five ten and twentyfive guineas  with very ample directions by which means not only much money to physicians apothecaries etc may be saved but likewise under god the lives of many hundred persons of worth fashion and of fortune who travel into foreign countries  may be yearly preserved  who otherwise might be swept off by diseases in a few days  when absent from their families and far distant from their affectionate friends  proper allowance is made to merchants and captains of ships who buy them in large quantities for sale in foreign countries in all fevers and relaxations  and in biliou spasmodic putrid malignant and consumptive complaints in the east and west indies and in america  they are immediate and absolute specifics so that any lady or gentleman of sense and liberality may thus assisted become sovereign physicians and often save not only their own but the life of a friend or of a fellow creature when apparently at the point of death  and when given over by even the best physicians but above all they are most earnestly recommended to people of weak nerves and relaxed habits  who are particularly susceptible of catching colds and infectious disorders  to those likewise who are apprehensive of strokes of the apoplexy or pally  and still more especially to those under sentence of death  i mean those persons who have already been visited by those sudden  dreadful  and merciless harbingers of the awful  the tremendous hour   any respectable person not of the faculty in any capital city or town in great britain or ireland  or in any other part of the world where these great medicines are not yet established  and who are very desirous to vend them ought to lose no time in applying to me through their agents or correspondents in london as ready money is expected a proper allowance is made but all expenses of carriage advertizing etc  must be defrayed by the persons themselves and it is an invariable rule with me to return immediately the money for what ever quantity may at any time be sent back as unsold  in order to prevent trouble i think it right to be very particular in mentioning the terms or conditions upon which i dispense these medicines all over the globe for the general good of mankind as well as for my own honor and emolument  general directions for using my three great medicines the principles or constituent parts of these medicines being similar  they are found to produce the best effects and the greatest and most extraordinary cures when taken together or assisted by each other but in all cases whatever i desire that those who take them do not regard my directions so much as the effects of the medicines  their own feelings and their own prudence and good sense in acute cases they can scarcely be used too plentifully but in dangerous and long confirmed chronic cases  they may be used more sparingly and continued longer but after a course of six weeks if a complete cure be not obtained they should be discontinued for three six or nine weeks and then resumed again as formerly in all cases and constitutions in all habits of body at every period of life and under perhaps every circumstance cool air drinking cold water plentifully and bathing the whole body or at least the private parts with tepid or icy cold water agrees perfectly well and produces the happiest and most divine effects  let therefore my innumerable tribes of patients i mean all who are taking my medicines be almost constantly bustling about in the cool open air regardless of wind or rain let them be daily and very frequently applying cold water to their face neck bosom stomach private parts and limbs in short the partial or universal application of cold water to the surface of the body i earnestly and most cordially recommend but still more earnestly and above all things do i exhort to moderation simplicity and regularity in eating drinking and sleeping and in all pleasureable indulgences in those especially venereal which drain the blood of its most precious balsam and the nerves of their vital spirits sapping the sources of health and totally incapacitating both soul and body from the proper performance of their natural necessary and more noble functions  and from enjoying with a keen healthy relish the balmy  the celestial pleasures  which the allwise and supremely beneficent author of our existence has annexed to our animal as well as to our intellectual nature  as to the electrical ether the manner of using it has been already pretty well explained in the account which is given of its nature preparation and properties in all cases of weakness fainting putrefaction and debility especially in asthmas consumptions and all painful obstructions of the head or breast it may be smelled to for several minutes and very often the vial should be held in a warm hand to the patients nostril and the other stopped by pressing it sideways with the finger while the cold vapor is drawn up with great force it should not be taken away from the nose notwithstanding its strength for the longer the patient smells at it the better able he is for his breath becomes longer and he seems to enter delighted into the flowery fields of elysium  often very often have i exhausted a whole bottle in one day or evening merely by smelling a little of it may be poured into a pot or basin of warm or hot water brandy and water green tea coffee or into an infusion of aromatic herbs  flowers or seeds  especially a mixture of mint rosemary lavender flowers and bruised anniseeds over which the patients hands and mouth open may be held while it continues warm drawing the vapor with great force into the lungs in some cases it may be advisable to fling a large piece of flannel loosely over the patients head which will more effectually promote perspiration any of the above especially the latter aromatics may be used afterward when almost cold to bathe the stomach private parts limbs or feet the electrical ether alone may be poured plentifully on the head breast backbone or limbs of a person in any low  nervous  or putrid complaint this ether camphorated spirits or vinegar may be made to distill by a lamp or be scattered about the room and bed clothes  i have often used half a dozen guinea bottles of it in one day on and about one person when the case has been very bad and the life very dear and precious it may be taken inwardly in the quantity of a teaspoonful more or less and as often as may be found good perhaps every hour or two on sugar or mixed with the syrup of capillaire cold water wine or herb tea the thicker and colder the vehicle the better the syrup or icy cold vehicle should be poured into an empty vial then the ether added to it perhaps by guess then closely stopped with the thumb or a cork well shaken and drank immediately  in the very same manner in similar quantities and at any or at all times may be taken the nervous aetherial balsam indeed they may be taken together at the same time or the latter taken inwardly while the electrical ether is smelled to or applied outwardly for the one tempers and cooperates with and promotes the good effects of the other in so cordial friendly and effectual a manner that they act like a pair of crutches to a crippled and enfeebled body for a more full and particular account of the nature properties etc of this divine balsam  or restorative aetherial oil which so effectually renovates and invigorates decayed and worn out constitutions i refer my intelligent reader to the descriptions already given  as to the imperial pills or universal purifiers and sweetners of the blood and juices they may be taken conveniently at any season and under any circumstance when they are taken as an alterative in costive gouty bilious and scorbutic habits or to throw off wind and flatulencies from the stomach and bowels in nervous weaknesses spasms and relaxations one may be taken every night or immediately after eating when a person is oppressed and uneasy because they so amazingly promote lively digestion and healthy nourishment blunting all acid and bilious acrimony strengthening the relaxed tone of the stomach and increasing the peristaltic or screwlike motion of the intestines but when they are taken to subdue eradicate and expel by stool urine and a fine breathing perspiration all venereal scorbutic gouty rheumatic bilious and scrophulous humors and foulnesses the patient may begin with one pill and increase the dose one every night till they begin to produce a more copious discharge by stool urine or sweat than the patient can or ought to bear long in such cases the patient may diminish the number one every night till he comes to one only and then after totally omitting them for as many days as in number he had taken the pills in one day he may begin again increasing the number one every night as at first  this mode being observed and repeated several times  will most assuredly  will infallibly eradicate every particle of virus disease and impurity however long they may have lurked and prevailed in the system or however inveterately they have been blended and rooted in the constitution sapping or undermining the springs and sources of life and of health rendering life a tiresome and painful burden to the feeble spiritless wretched possessor it is really astonishing how speedily and effectually these pills counteract and carry off the deadly effects of mercury and other strong and improper medicines this important and singular quality and effects are produced by the large portion of electrical sulphur or celestial phosphorous which they contain  while a person takes these most excellent pills they may drink as much cold water as they please or go out in any weather the following drinks will likewise be very proper  chicken veal or mutton broth without salt beeftea capillaire and cold water infusions of simple herbs etc but when the pills are taken for severe and confirmed diseases proper regard should be paid to the nature and degree of the disorder or complaint and the drinks management etc  ordered accordingly for instance in the venereal scorbutic or scrophulous diseases a strong decoction of sarsaparilla or of the guaiacum and sassafras woods with plenty of liquorice root should be drank daily in gouty bilious asthmatic consumptive and rheumatic cases infusions of baum rosemary tansey horseradish root chamomile flowers pennyroyal hysop groundivy horehound linseeds liquorice root with bruised fennil or aniseeds sweetened with treacle honey sugar candy or barley sugar will be found extremely serviceable and in all nervous and windy complaints and in relaxation irritation and debility of the system in general strong decoctions or rather infusions of the peruvian bark in gross powder columbo or comfry roots red rose leaves chamomile flowers bitter orange peel with a little bruised cinnamon  will be productive of the happiest and most astonishing good effects but in every case and in every constitution when any one or all of my three great medicines are taken i have found half a pint or a whole one of apple tea water gruel barley water or of the following compound infusion extremely good and agreeable viz of baum sage rosemary mint and bruised aniseeds  each an equal quantity and the tea sweetened with sugar candy barley sugar  treacle or honey or rather with a mixture of the two last this tea or infusion should be drank warm and indeed very warm and often when any considerable degree of perspiration is wished for or intended  in the intervals between taking the medicines and indeed in most constitutions even at the time of taking them a milk diet is warmly recommended a quart or two or even three quarts of good new milk may be used every day not warm from the cow or boiled but cold and as it is called raw for the natural heat of the human stomach is fully sufficient to cook or prepare milk eggs etc for every purpose of nutrition and of health the previous application of fire renders them hard and indigestible  many people lose the great  the unspeakable  the balmy benefit of a milk diet by relinquishing it too soon they find the first day or two a fullness or sickness at their stomach  a griping or laxity of their bowels they therefore conclude that it disagrees with them and they leave it off but they ought to continue it by all means for a week or ten days and at length it would in general be found to agree perfectly well and to produce the happiest effects  i cannot conclude without taking notice of the general odium there is against a panacea or medicine for the cure of all diseases at first i was very far from expecting that even these three medicines could singly or when combined cure or even relieve all disorders but as i advanced in improving them and in discovering their virtues in actual and most extensive practice i confess that my wonder and surprise exceeded the astonishment and delight which was excited in my happy patients the wonderful good effects which i say are produced by these medicines in every case and in every constitution will at first sight alarm and disgust persons of sense and learning but on candid and mature views of these matters they will be found to agree with and to result from the fixed nature of things  for the general notion of diseases reasonably consists in this that what is taken into the body is not duly assimilated and distributed by the force of the animal economy is it not therefore true that whatever assists and strengthens the vis vitae enables nature either to assimilate or to discharge all gross and noxious particles unsubdued humors and in a word the seeds or causes of all diseases whatsoever for the celestial or electrical light or ether detained in these medicines and with which they are so fully impregnated or saturated being of the very same nature with the animal spirits or nervous clastic light or fluid is an accession of so much strength to the constitution or powers of nature or staff of life by which it is assisted to assimilate whatever is friendly and nourishing or to throw off or expel whatever is alien or noxious to her nature  or prejudicial to good health thus then these great medicines may be justly called universal ones inasmuch as they work principally by assisting the vis vitae or staff of life as an alterative and cordial enabling nature by a prodigious accession of congenial vital spirits to assimilate those friendly and necessary recruits or powers which could not be assimilated by her own proper force for subduing diseases or maintaining health those who think that this cannot be effectually done but by strong evacuations entertain a most dangerous opinion for great and repeated evacuations weaken nature as well as the disease and thousands who have recovered of distempers by great evacuations and poisonous medicines such as mercury etc have never during their whole life been able to recover of the remedies  but the luminous  balmy  celestial spirit or fire which is lodged and detained in these three great medicines is of a nature so mild benign and proportioned to the human constitution as to warm without heating to cheer but not inebriate or inflame and to produce that calm serenity that steady joy which naturally accompanies good health and a virtuous mind  and that too without those agitations irregular motions and subsequent horrible sinkings or depressions of the animal spirits which are the constant and inseparable effects of volatile salts spirits foreign waters and drams and indeed of all fermented vinous spiritous and even maltliquors  n b these great  these truly celestial medicines will keep good any length of time and in any climate provided they are kept very tightly stopped and as cool as possible   in a few days will be published and added to this pamphlet about fifty extraordinary cures lately effected by my three great medicines in the mean time i have authority to mention the following very extraordinary case of a respectable and very amiable young lady a miss beatt at mr schroeders warehouse robe and habitmaker to her majesty in tavistockstreet coventgarden  late pritchard and spilsburys  about the beginning of last march miss beatt was seized with a severe disorder which broke out on one side of her face and spread to her eye ear neck and throat it was taken and properly attended to from the very beginning but nevertheless in two or three weeks it had spread over both sides of her face and neck which with both her eyes and ears it had swelled to a monstrous degree the humor was so sharp and so excessively profuse that day and night it would wet and run through twenty folds of cloths or handkerchiefs in one quarter of an hour but notwithstanding that incredible discharge the swellings did not abate and those under her ear and about her throat were as hard as a stone the catastrophe of the scene being now at hand and the young lady herself her affectionate father and her anxious friends being alarmed and apprehensive of the most fatal consequences  the services of the medical gentlemen who attended her were dispensed with and i was called in the chilly shivering coldness which indeed had been a most unfavourable symptom from the beginning increased now very fast  the terrible humor began to fall inward and to be absorbed into her blood which it dissolved and broke down into a putrid watery gore and on the sunday morning i found her laying with scarce any pulse  cold sleepy like complaining that she could not swallow and of a dead coldness in her limbs on her left side particularly  and a want of smell and all sense of feeling in one side of her nose her face neck eyes and ears were entirely covered over with a thick black cold crust or scab  like a complete mask  she had been quite blind for near two days and on examining her throat inwardly i found the mortification there far advanced from these symptoms and appearances joined to what is called the rattles in her throat which had now come on and the putrid smell which notwithstanding every precaution began to spread all over the house every body was persuaded that the melancholy scene would be closed in a very few hours and i myself was apprehensive that the deadly sweep in the house might be great a gentleman a few streets off his wife and some of their children and servants having been all swept into the grave by a putrid disorder within the space of one week a few days before  to whom i regret exceedingly that i had not the good fortune to be called but to return what was to be done  miss beatt could not swallow but a few drops at a time and that very slowly and with the greatest languor and danger of suffocation  no time was to be lost with the patient nor any thing left undone for the security of the family every window in the house which mrs schroeder had very judiciously thrown open and the frankincense and other aromatics which that lady had wisely burned on the stairs by way of fumigation were with the addition of camphorated ether to sprinkle with all continued  i immediately mixed a large vial of my nervous aetherial balsam and another of my electrical ether with an equal quantity of the syrup of capillaire to soften them  of this mixture i gave miss beatt spoonful after spoonful as fast as she could let it over till she had taken the whole of it that part of it which run out of her mouth was not lost for it was absorbed by her neck and breast  in the course of a quarter of an hour i used no less than three whole vials of my electrical ether on her face neck throat etc  another very large vial containing four ounces or one guineas worth of it was held continually to her nostrils and some of it a little diluted was thrown into her nostrils and upon her throat inwardly with a syringe and an infusion with boiling water was immediately prepared of half a pound of the finest peruvian bark and an ounce of cinnamon both in powder and half a pound of red rose leaves  to this when strained no less than half a pint of mr joness mr jones who is a chemist and druggist in russel street covent garden is a man of fortune and character and particularly attentive in having the best and most genuine medicines that can be procured very excellent tincture of the bark was added this was exhibited very often by way of glyster and a cupful of it drank as often as possible but before it could be prepared i had given miss beatt another whole large vial of my nervous aetherial balsam and had sprinkled the bedcloaths well all over with my electrical ether  a large blister likewise was applied between her shoulders and one under each collar bone backward toward the top of her shoulders what were the effects of these bold  these great operations  they were most happy  they appeared miraculous  they snatched an amiable young person  an useful member of society  i may say from the very bottom of the grave what would ordinary medicines  what would what is called the regular practice have done in this desperate case  why  nothing the patient must inevitably have died how very fortunate it was for miss beatt that i was personally present to direct the proper exhibition of the three great medicines  to which under god she owes her life in a quarter of an hour from the time that the aetherial balsam was first given to her  she broke out into a general perspiration her pulse was better  the fullness choking and inability of swallowing went off the rattles ceased at the end of another half hour all these favorable appearances were more strikingly manifested  and at the expiration of one hour more so rapidly did the cold numbness and sleepiness go off and the mortification and putrefaction abate that i conceived her to be even out of all danger the putrid morbid matter which had fallen inward and carried death to every vessel and fiber of the system being now so much overcome and subdued by the nervous aetherial balsam and electrical ether i was determined to lose no time in carrying as much of it as possible out of the body for that purpose as miss beatt could not be supposed to be as yet capable of swallowing pills  and even if she could it would have been a considerable time before they could have dissolved in her stomach i therefore dissolved nine of my imperial pills in a proper vehicle and gave the whole of them to her in the space of an hour the consequence was that they operated so properly and effectually that i ventured to leave her that same night being called into the city to attend to some cases of great importance  i had ordered my servant to enquire after miss beatt by six in the morning and a gentleman a surgeon in the east india companys service who had the goodness to sit up all night being on a visit at mr schroeders and to whose kind and judicious care we were all very much indebted sent me word that miss beatt was amazingly better that she had slept sweetly great part of the night that she was then refreshed and cheerful with both her eyes quite open and every unfavourable symptom entirely gone off  i shall not trespass any longer on my readers time suffice it to assure him that by continuing the medicines etc in one week or ten days more miss beatt came down stairs quite recovered the black crusty scabs or mask dropped off her face neck head throat and eats entirely she was once more perfectly herself  and free from every spot redness or disagteeable appearance  and with a good appetite and high spirits she has continued perfectly well ever since and thinks that she even enjoys better health than she did before she was attacked with that terrible disorder  and it pleased god that not one individual of that large and respectable family suffered an hours illness from the imminent danger which had threatened them  n b very few of the fifty cures lately performed by these medicines which have been selected from a much greater number and which are now printing are less extraordinary or important than this abovementioned  advertisement suavissimum est immanes dolores rescindere  praecipue cum nec sumptu nec longa abstinentia  vel dolor id obteneri possit  the temple of health in

genius and of study has been strained and the four quarters of the globe ransacked to enrich and embellish it and to render it one of the most useful of all the institutions which adorn the age and nation we have the happiness to live in  dr grahams new and improved methods of curing diseases consist in regimen herbs simple medicines the choicest articles of the materia medica and aetherial essences rendered more salutary and active by means of the most powerful vital agents in nature viz electricity vivifying air medical music and magnetism or in other words by gently conveying to those at the altar or on the medicoelectrical throne without shock or any kind of uneasiness into the general system to the seat of the disease or only to parts particularly affected the pure active genial balmy bracing and restorative effluvia of medicines animal mineral or vegetable simply or combined with the celestial fire or vital light magnetic effluvium harmonious vibrations or musical modulations of celestial sounds or with any of those great primaryelementary vital principles which are the universal pabulum or vivifying soul of the universe the great numbers who daily by these means under god are cured of the most dangerous and most confirmed diseases after they have been turned incurable out of hospitals and given over by even the most celebrated physicians who stand in the regular medical trammels are really astonishing dr graham therefore for the public good as well as for his own honor and emolument thinks it his duty to depart from what is called the regular mode by giving this public notice which is addressed to the friends of persons apparently at the point of death and to every individual who labors under any kind of complaint or infirmity which has resisted the ordinary remedies  to such in whatever station of life this advertisement is addressed but more especially to the charitably disposed christian  to the affectionate parent  the dutiful child  the fond compannion  and the tender  the anxious friend  the cases which dr graham has been the most remarkably successful in curing are the following  viz violently dangerous fevers particularly scarlet putrid and nervous ones  consumptions asthmas and coughs  excruciating pain and imminent danger from the gout in the head or stomach  apoplexy  putrid ulcerated throats  stone and gravel  inflammations of the brain lungs bowels or bladder  obstinate and confirmed venereal complaints from repeated infections and irregularities or from having been neglected trifled with or improperly treated with that deadly poison mercury severe purging etc  stomach and bowel complaints  total suppressions of urine too  relaxing sinking weaknessess and the more immediately dangerous female complaints  fits spasms and convulsions especially in children and young people  the measles smallpox mortifications nervous and consumptive weaknesses  immoderate fluxes  severe fits of coughing suffocation or asthma  acute bilious and other obstructions  the dropsy recent strokes of the palsy etc in these and in most other diseases particularly in glandular and white swellings complicated severe and wandering rheumatisms the rheumatic gout obstinate scurvies in blindness and in deafness too and most of the disorders of those most precious and most delicate organs the eye and ear his medicines and gentle aetherial and electrical applications produce the most amazing good effects they open obstructions promote a due and regular circulation of the blood and spirits which they sweeten purify enrich and animate nourishing bracing and coiling up the nervous system when weakened and relaxed overcoming every degree of putrefaction recruiting decayed strength and generally acting on an exhausted body like fresh oil poured into an expiring lamp after all however dr graham is far from pretending to work miracles or impossibilities no he is abundantly sensible of the impossibility of curing many diseases in their advanced and confirmed stages and of the fallibility and uncertainty of all sublunary things all that he contends for is that his methods of treating diseases are far more powerful safe and rational than those in general employed by any other physician in the world and that he often succeeds in curing effectually and lastingly diseases internal and external when the most celebrated surgeons and physicians and even when the more friendly powers of regimen air exercise and the best mineral waters have failed  so amazingly has his business increased that he has now found it necessary from motives of humanity more than for his own emolument to fit up additional appartments and to receive at any hour of the day such sick and lame persons as cannot afford to give fees for advice and that they are now admitted daily sundays excepted from eight oclock in the morning till eight at night to whom advice and all necessary medicoelectrical operations etc are administered gratis in rotation according to priority of arrival without respect of persons paying the apothecary for such medicines only if any as their respective cases require but as the greatest hindrances have arisen from multitudes crowding into the temple of health under the pretense of attending sick friends but merely to gratify their curiosity by staring at the apparatus to obviate therefore in future those inconveniences and impertinencies and that as many diseased persons as possible may partake of the salutary effects of this grand system of healing no poor person whatever will be admitted without a ticket which must be had of the porter price halfacrown this is required only at the first consultation for dr graham on receiving it gives another ticket gratis which admits the patient during the whole course of the cure  no sort of objection however is made to one friend attending each patient  that being often necessary as well as decent  the nobility gentry and others in genteel or easy circumstances must pay a guinea the first consultation and at least half aguinea every time after no persons whomsoever even personages of high rank need expect to be attended at their own houses unless confined to bed by sickness or to their room through extreme weakness and from those whom he attends at their own houses two guineas the first and one guinea each visit after is expected dr graham for reasons of the highest importance to the public as well as to himself has a large chemical laboratory and great medicinal cabinets in his own house and in the above fixed fees either at home or abroad every expense attending his advice medicines applications operations and influences is included  a few tedious complex and expensive operations in the great apollo apartment only excepted but in cases where electricity or attendance are not necessary and medicines are required to be taken at home or when any are sent into the country if they are furnished and prepared by dr grahams chemists or apothecaries they must be paid for separately  before he concludes this address it may not be amiss to say a few words on the dangerous and even fatal effects which may be produced by so mighty an agent as the electrical fire in the hands of ignorant and rash people so very powerful an element cannot be indifferent when applied to the human body it must do considerable good or considerable harm striking instances of both have repeatedly fallen under dr grahams observations  and he trembles with apprehension for his fellow creatures when he sees in almost every street in this great metropolis a barber  a surgeon  a toothdrawer  an apothecary  or a common mechanic turned electrical operator how dangerous  how ridiculous must it be in most cases to venture so curious so complex and so delicate a machine as the human body and that too even when diseased into such hands to be shook torn and convulsed with the ignorant and improper application of this awful element  for his own part he has been taught by reason and by the most attentive observations in innumerable experiments on almost every substance in nature and in a course of practice in the cure of diseases far more extensive than that of perhaps any other man in the world he has been taught that all violence is hurtful that electrical shocks ought seldom or never to be given that partial frictions sparks and brushings with rich medicinal substances charged with electricity or gently pervading the whole system with a copious tide of that celestial fire fully impregnated with the purest most subtle and balmiest parts of medicines which are extracted by and flow softly into the blood and nervous system with the electrical fluid or restorative aetherial essences in those cases where shocks are absolutely necessary instead of charging bottles lined with tin foil or other gross impure and perhaps arsenical metals his jars are filled with loadstones sulphur quicksilver and with the mildest yet most active medicinal substances from the animal mineral or vegetable kingdoms  these are charged with the celestial fire solar vital light vivifying air and with the powerful and salutary effluvia of oriental balsams aromatic oils peruvian bark castor camphire musk ambergrease the balsams of juniper peru tolu and gilead and the influences of electricity air aetherial medicines and magnetism thus combined and positively charged with the pure celestial fire or with the magnetic effluvium are made to pass through the whole or any particular part of the patients body giving in such cases as require them a great number or quick succession of pleasant little vibratory shocks so genial and gentle as not to hurt or alarm even an infant but as he said before he generally prefers the effluvia of these genial aromatic balsamic antispasmodic substances or the effluvia of the magnetic aerial or aetherial essences passing silently sweetly and insensibly into the body or confined to the seat or cause of the disease while the spasmodic tensions and stiffnesses are relaxed  or the relaxed and debilitated tone of the nerves or muscular fibers braced up or invigorated as the case or constitution requires with the above and with properly adapted harmonious vibrations or musical modulations of celestial sounds  lest it should be thought that dr graham uses electricity in all cases he desires to inform the public that many of his greatest and most extraordinary cures have been done entirely without the assistance of electricity and that he makes it an invariable rule to reject the incurable  and to inform every patient or their friends at first fight whether a perfect cure or what degree of relief may be expected  dr graham after a regular classical and medical education of many years at the justly celebrated university of edinburgh and after attending to the practice in the best hospitals and the lectures of the greatest physicians in london dublin etc became exceedingly dissatisfied at the trifling absurdities and feebleness of what is called the regular practice of physic but animated with the hopes of being able to make valuable discoveries and important improvements in the cure of diseases and for the prolongation of human life he traveled into various foreign countries making in the course of twelve years several tours through the continent of europe and over the extensive provinces of america at length after gathering and digesting the falrest flowers and the choicest fruits of the sciences by conversing with and attending to the labors and the lectures of the most learned and most ingenious men in every country through which he passed after investigating the nature and properties of the various natural productions and making the most accurate chemical analyzes of the most celebrated mineral waters in europe he returned to britain and after fitting up with infinite labor and expense the most powerful most useful and most magnificent medical apparatus that ever was in the world he has now practiced a whole year in the metropolis of his native country and of the world with the greatest honor and emolument to himself and to the greatest benefit and advantage of thousands of his fellow creatures of every rank and denomination who had labored under pains and diseases which the best regular practitioners and the most powerful medicines in common use could neither cure nor alleviate  the same and emoluments which dr graham in consequence of his successes in the cure of diseases is honored with have long since placed him in a sphere which is an object of envy to the selfish and narrowminded part of the faculty but which neither the envy jealous and mean artifices nor the illiberal false and wicked representations insinuations and libels of theatrical buffoons or of rascally avaricious editors of news papers have been able to remove him from let them continue to act  to print and to publish whatever their avaricious and diabolical nature prompts them to dr graham never has nor ever will take the least notice or answer one of them no he looks down upon them all with smiles of sovereign  of ineffible contempt  what  shall the genial  the lifegiving sun cease to shine because his beams offend the weak or distorted eyes of those foul animals  those vile venomous reptiles which assassinate and devour in the dark  dr g has at least the negative consolation that those villainous and lying representers of things which concern him cannot treat him worse than they have done his betters  even the first most respectable most innocent and even the most sacred characters in the british dominions the liberal and discerning public can readily distinguish true merit from pretended knowledge  facts are incontrovertible  his superiority is universally acknowleged he basks in the sunshine of riches and honor he rejoices in the applause of the candid and of the learned world  he exults in the testimony of his own conscience  and in the approbation of his own heart  but in order to remove effectually every unfavourable impression which the jealous and envious insinuations of the faculty or their friends alarmed at dr grahams unprecedented fame and success may have created in the minds of those who are unacquainted with dr graham and his valuable discoveries and improvements and to demonstrate to the world at large the infinite superiority of his peculiar modes of treating diseases he will continue for another year to attend at their own home patients in severe acute diseases when given over for death by any other even by the most celebrated apothecary surgeon or physician without any expense whatever either for attendance advice or medicines the first fee only excepted if his endeavors to preserve life under god prove ineffectual when restored to health his gratuity shall as usual be regulated by the generosity or circumstances of the patient no ordinary or trifling case will be attended to the above is confined to those  and to those alone who are thought to be near death in severe acute diseases seldom very seldom a day passes but he has the blessedness of easing excruciating pain and of snatching from the grave one or more sick persons even when struggling in the agonies of death and even after they have been abandoned by the the most celebrated physicians indeed so very amazing so unprecedented has been the success which has attended his practice that not more than three or four persons have died in the whole course or circuit of his practice during the last twelve months  of the multitudes who come or are brought every day to his house  or of those whom he has been sent for to attend when near death at their own habitations while he assures the public of the above fact he defies the whole world to disprove the truth of it such suecess is an honor of which few other physicians can boast  a pleasure which very few have experienced  nor than the above can any thing so effectually demonstrate the infinite superiority of his methods of treating diseases especially as it is well known that for several years past he seldom has had less than one hundred persons every day under his care and often more than even double that number he may therefore with the poet exclaim  aeque pauperibus prodest locupletibus aeque aeque neglectum pueris  senibusque nocebit hor this day are published i a new edition being the sixth of the present trifling absurd and ineffectual state of medical

examine his medicoelectrical apparatus is hurt and mortified to the extremest degree at ordering the tickets of admission to be now sold as above but the multitudes of people of every rank and station who crowd constantly to see it were so inconvenient to his bufiness that he was compelled to adopt the above in order that he might be less interrupted in attending to the cases of those who apply to him on account of their health the number of whom recommended by the great numbers who are cured it is well known often exceeds two hundred daily  the following ode which was set to music and performed in the great apollo apartment at the solemn dedication of the temple of health on the organ the harmonica and the celestina accompanied with flutes clarionets and by some of the finest vocal

explored and now happily confirmed is of the highest importance not only to the inhabitants of the british empire at present but likewise to the whole human species throughout the whole earth and perhaps for thousands of years to come i propose to continue to practice in this great metropolis of my native country till the beginning of the year       which will be a period of full three years  in order to demonstrate to the entire satisfaction of persons of every rank from the throne to the cottage the facility certainty and in a word the infinite superiority of my methods of propagation in difficult cases of preventing and curing all curable diseases external as well as internal to which the human body is liable and of extending life free from sickness and with the clear healthy exercise of the mental faculties to the longest possible period  at the expiration of the three years i intend to make proposals to the british parliament concerning publishing to the world all my discoveries improvements and methods of propagation and of managing and curing diseases etc without any reserve whatever and that i may continue to communicate from time to time such farther discoveries and improvements as assiduous investigation and a practice with an apparatus more potent and more extensive than that of any other physician on the face of the globe shall enable me to make  if i do not meet with that benevolence and encouragement from the legislature of my own country which the vast importance of the object merits  i propose to reside and practice about a year at each of the principal courts in europe and after that under the royal and imperial auspices of european wisdom and munificence at large i will then publish to mankind the great prolific code and system of health and of the healing art which i am now digesting compiling and perfecting as far as the experience of one age will permit  i say one age because i am now establishing a medical
