the claims of the people of england  n b those persons who have not leisure in the present awful and important crisis of public affairs to peruse this little tract may view the substance of it in an abstract at the end of the book  the work of righteousness which necessarily includes the duty of restoring to all men their rights and just claims  shall be peace and the effect of righteousness quietness and assurance for ever  isaiah xxxii     for the throne is established by righteousness prove xvi    but  there is no peace says my god to the wicked  isaiah lvii    london printed in the year mdcclxxxii  the claims of the people of england in the beginning of the present century anno   0     w iii a sensible and loyal writer drew up a small tract of political information which he entitled  the claims of the people of england essayed in a letter from the country but before the tract was printed the author had the satisfaction to hear that the claims he had asserted were in many respects established by a new act of the parliament then sitting which seasonable attention to the peoples rights he most gratefully acknowledged in a postscript to his letter  the act of settlement by virtue of which the present royal family succeeded to the crown of these realms was the statute which then so happily in the opinion of that writer secured the claims of the people of england  it is entitled an act for the farther limitation of the crown and better securing the rights and liberties of the subject  and accordingly contains eight very excellent articles of limitation agreeable to the claims of the people of england which it seems were enacted with the unanimous concurrence of both houses of parliament for the express purpose of securing our religion laws and liberties  one of these articles ordained  that  all matters and things relating to the well governing of this kingdom which are properly cognizable in the privy council by the laws and customs of this realm shall be transacted there and all resolutions taken thereupon shall be signed by such of the privy council as shall advise and consent to the same this excellent provision would effectually prevent any secret council or faction from becoming efficient without responsibility   and by another of these articles it was ordained  that no person who has an office or place of profit under the king or receives a pension from the crown shall be capable of serving as a member of the house of commons it might perhaps have been objected at that time as well as at present that such a total exclusion of placemen would withdraw from parliament the council and assistance of many worthy men in office or that ought to be in office whose parliamentary abilities are the most distinguished and eminent in the kingdom yet there is and obvious answer to this objection viz that it is very easy for a free parliament if in their wisdom they shall think it proper to permit the great officers of state or even their secretaries or first clerks to have seats in parliament and as members not only to declare their opinions but also for the better information of the house even to debate and reply upon all questions relating to public affairs which might be allowed without any dangerous effect provided they are duly restrained from the single privilege of voting the nation by this means may have ample benefit in the exercise of their great and shining abilities without risque of undue influence which cannot justly be attributed to mere argument as that has no other weight or effect than what is fairly due to its merit and any unreasonable length of speech whenever it is used with an apparent intention to procrastinate and obstruct the intention of the majority may be duly restrained at the pleasure of the house but otherwise i e without some due restriction and more especially without an absolute exclusion from the power of voting a treasury bench or any other bench of placemen in the house of commons is a manifest abomination utterly repugnant to all just ideas of a free uninfluenced parliament and consequently is highly derogatory to the honor of that house   but as the parliament was at that time invested with the dangerous unconstitutional power of a triennial duration without reelection it was impossible that the elected who thereby acquired a temporary independency of the electors and of course too many of them a separate interest of their own could long continue real representatives of the peoples claims and consequently these two most excellent provisions against undue influence were unhappily repealed a very few years afterward in the  th year of queen anne c   which amply proves that the most salutary provisions for the claims of the people cannot be securely established under triennial or septennial parliaments and of course that the ancient usage of sessional elections is a claim of all others the most essentially necessary for our welfare  since the fatal repeal above mentioned the prevalence of undue influence has so rapidly and enormously increased that the everloyal citizens of london thought it their duty in the year    0 to bear testimony against it and accordingly they asserted in a public declaration to the king himself that the then house of commons did not represent the people representatives of the people are essential to the making of laws and there is a time when it is morally demonstrable that men cease to be representatives that time is now arrived the present house of commons do not represent the people  address of the mayor aldermen etc of the city of london    0   subsequent facts have demonstrated the absolute necessity we are now under to claim and promote an unequivocal abolition of all undue influence in parliament  measures the most unrighteous as well as the most ruinous that could have been devised have been adopted and carried on under a pretended sanction of parliamentary authority this must of course be understood to refer if you please only to former parliaments that began the mischief whose pretended sanction had more of the name than the reality of parliamentary authority if a real representation of the commons be at all essential to constitute a true legal parliament the representatives are chosen by a very small proportion of the people and even that small proportion of people is so monstrously unequal in their power of delegation that the small number of      borough voters elect     representatives which is very near half the number of representatives that are due to six millions of people and more than half or a majority of the numbers that are ever known to attend at any one time the injustice of such an enormous disproportion in the representation of the whole people cannot be parallelled by any other gross absurdity except the iniquity of rendering that disproportionate representation still more contemptible and nugatory by septennial or what were nearly as pernicious triennial instead of the ancient constitutional usage of sessional elections   which have involved both king and people whose true interests are inseparable in the most alarming difficulties and the ostensible agents in the mischief have obstinately persevered to the utmost extension of ability until public disasters and a happy preventive incapacity of their own their heads and funds being equally exhausted of council and resource have compelled them to make a temporary retreat though the numerous corpse of placemen pensioners contractors etc occasionally procured them a shameful majority almost to the last  hence it is evident that the corruption of parliament is the real source of all our national calamities and grievances which cannot therefore be relieved by a mere change of ministry  the minority in parliament has once before in the memory of most men become the majority and the worthy opposers of bad measures were indulged with a temporary administration of public affairs until the secret efficient cabinet could recover from the surprise and dismay of their former defeat in parliament and by a renewed exertion of their undue influence were able to shackle the new administration with the rueful alternative either to abandon their newlyacquired dignities or else to adopt such measures as must effectually deprive them of the peoples confidence after which they were contemptuously compelled one by one or as it might best suit the purposes of the reigning system of undue influence to yield up their places for the emolument of the more pliant creatures of the secret faction  it would be madness for englishmen after such galling experience to neglect their just and indispensible claim to some immediate and effectual precaution against similar delusions to trust another new administration without insisting at the same time on a constitutional limitation of power by a free uninfluenced representation of the commons may be dangerous to our very existence as an independent kingdom  the reduced circumstances of the nation cannot admit the risque of another such credulous experiment  it is therefore become absolutely necessary for the security both of king and people which includes the true interest of all parties that the just claims of the people be satisfied in an immediate restoration of the ancient legal and responsible government by a revival of the two repealed articles of the act of settlement above recited and by a revival also of that most excellent statute for sessional parliaments passed in the  th of k ed iii c    declaring that a parliament meaning a newlyelected parliament as the writs of those times incontestably demonstrate shall be holden every year once and more often if need be but this indispensible right and claim of the people for the act itself is no more than an authentic declaration or acknowledgement of an ancient right cannot have complete effect without totally repealing an act of the  th year of k hen vi cap vii which on false pretenses whereby it is rendered unworthy the title and dignity of a statute disfranchised at once by far the greatest part of the english nation by robbing them of their birthright in the act of settlement by virtue of which the present king sits on the throne it is declared that the laws of england are the birthright of the people thereof and according to an ancient maxim of the common law this our birthright in the laws is to be esteemed our most valuable inheritance superior to every other denomination of property major haereditas unicuique venit a jure et legibus quam a parentibus lord coke says it  is the best birthright the subject has for thereby his goods lands wife children his body life honor and estimation are protected from injury and wrong and then he cites the maxim   major haereditas etc   inst p    an act of parliament therefore which sets up an inferior and mere pecuniary property as the object of representation not only in preference but to the total exclusion of that superior property or personal right which ought to be esteemed the most valuable inheritance or best birthright the subject has etc is such a malum in so such an iniquitous contempt and infringement of common right against reason and justice and against the express declaration of a fundamental principle of the english constitution  cannot fail to render the act null and void in itself if the people will but unite in maintaining this just and legal plea against it for which they have ample authority see doctor and student c  0 wherein it is declared that statutes cannot exist against reason or the law divine  nec contra rationem nec contra legem divinam existant for the execrable iniquity abovementioned is surely against both and therefore as these two laws the law of reason and the law of god cannot abate or turn aside  hae duae leges declinari non possunt ib c    it is manifest that the unjust act is utterly unworthy to be named a statute and must needs be void plowden has reported a variety of cases wherein acts of parliament were esteemed void in law through the want of truth in the recitals see pages     to  00 sharps declaration p     which legal disqualification is obvious in the preamble to the act in question as it cannot otherwise be esteemed than a mere corruption or corruptela according to the express direction of the same approved author in his  d chapter  viz  against this law i e the law of reason prescription statute nor custom may not prevail and if any be brought in against it they be not prescriptions statutes nor customs but corruptions corruptelae things void and against justice  doct et stud eng ed      p   the inestimable right of voting for representatives in parliament without which they cannot properly be esteemed freemen because the laws their birthright and most valuable property may be changed suspended or entirely withdrawn from them without their consent whereas in ancient times they enjoyed not only the privilege of voting in plen county i e the full county court or parliament of each county for the knights of the shire but frequently also for the citizens and burgesses elected in their respective counties whereby the equality of representation was then preserved and may again be happily restored by some such equitable mode of transferring the representation of depopulated or notoriously venal boroughs to the decision of their respective county courts which method of equalizing representation deserves preference to all others because it is not liable to the odious charge of innovation but on the contrary is authenticated by longcontinued usage and legal precedents of ancient times and the same may be said of all the other changes already recommended in this address  by these approved and tried means the just claims of the people may be amply as well as easily established and the happy effects of such a perfect reformation would be security and support to any virtuous administration for it would prevent their just measures from being impeded and clogged by the secret machinations of any private cabal or cabinet faction that might otherwise be efficient without responsibility and it would also exclude the interested opposition of needy unprincipled persons who at present can introduce themselves into p  l  m  t if they can but find credit for the purchasemoney merely for the purposes of private interest a trade as dishonorable to themselves as it is baneful to the nation for the representation of many boroughs is now commonly esteemed a mere pecuniary property and as such has in many instances been either notoriously bought and sold or else is holden at the absolute disposal of single individuals peers and other overgrown landholders for the dangerous purpose of enhancing their own personal consequence an undue influence this in whatsoever hands it is lodged that is most detestably disgraceful to the nation as well as fundamentally derogatory to the validity of every legislative resolution and what is still more alarming will completely ruin the kingdom if the
