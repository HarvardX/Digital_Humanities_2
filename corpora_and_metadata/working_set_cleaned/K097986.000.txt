thy aid invoking while thy power we praise all hail to thee allpowrful harmony wise nature owns thy undisputed sway her wondrous works resigning to thy care the planetary orbs thy rule obey and tuneful roll unerring in their way thy voice informing each melodious sphere chorus all hail to thee allpowrful harmony ii thy voice o harmony with awful sound could penetrate the abyss profound explore the realms of ancient night and search the living source of unborn light confusion heard thy voice and fled and chaos deeper plunged his vanquished head then did thou harmony give birth to this fair form of heaven and earth then all those shining worlds above in mystic dance began to move around the radiant sphere of central fire a never ceasing never silent choir chorus confusion heard thy voice and fled and chaos deeper plunged his vanquished head iii thou only goddess first could tell the mighty charms in numbers found and did to heavenly minds reveal the secret force of tuneful sound when first cyllenius formed the lyre thou did the god inspire when first the vocal shell he strung to which the muses sung then first the muses sung melodious strains apollo played and music first begun by thy auspicious aid hark hark again urania sings again apollo strikes the trembling strings and see the listening deities around attend insatiate and devour the sound chorus hark hark again urania sings again apollo strikes the trembling strings and see the listening deities around attend insatiate and devour the sound iv descend urania heavenly fair to the relief of this afflicted world repair see how with various woes oppressed the wretched race of men is worn consumed with cares with doubts distressed or by conflicting passions torn reason in vain employs her aid the furious will on fancy waits while reason still by hopes or fears betrayed too late advances or too soon retreats music alone with sudden charms can bind the wandering sense and calm the troubled mind chorus music alone with sudden charms can bind the wandering sense and calm the troubled mind v begin the powerful song ye sacred nine your instruments and voices join harmony peace and sweet desire in every breast inspire revive the melancholy drooping heart and soft repose to restless thoughts impart appease the wrathful mind to dire revenge and death inclined with balmy sounds his boiling blood assuage and melt to mild remorse his burning rage it is done and now tumultuous passions cease and all is hushed and all is peace the weary world with welcome ease is blessed by music lulled to pleasing rest chorus it is done and now tumultuous passions cease and all is hushed and all is peace the weary world with welcome ease is blessed by music lulled to pleasing rest vi ah sweet repose too soon expiring ah foolish man new toils requiring cursed ambition strife pursuing wakes the world to war and ruin see see the battle is prepared behold the hero comes loud trumpets with shrill fifes are heard and hoarse resounding drums war with discordant notes and jarring noise the harmony of peace destroys chorus war with discordant notes and jarring noise the harmony of peace destroys vii see the forsaken fair with streaming eyes her parting lover mourn she weeps she sighs despairs and dies and watchful wastes the lonely livelong nights bewailing past delights that may no more no never more return o sooth her cares with softest sweetest airs till victory and peace restore her faithful lover to her tender breast within her folding arms to rest thence never to be parted more no never to be parted more chorus let victory and peace restore her faithful lover to her tender breast within her folding arms to rest thence never to be parted more no never to be parted more viii enough urania heavenly fair now to thy native skies repair and rule again the starry sphere cecilia comes with holy rapture filled to ease the world of care cecilia more than all the muses skilled phoebus himself
