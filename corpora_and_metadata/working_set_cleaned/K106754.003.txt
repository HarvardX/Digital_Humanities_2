a simple story  in four volumes  by mrs inchbald  vol iii  london printed for g g j and j robinson paternoster row mdccxci  a simple story chapter i throughout life there cannot happen an event to arrest the reflection of a thoughtful mind more powerfully or to leave so lasting an impression as that of returning to a place after a few years absence and observing an entire alteration in respect to all the persons who once formed the neighborhood  to find some who but a few years before were left in the bloom of youth and health dead  to find children left at school married with children of their own  some persons who were in riches reduced to poverty  others who were in poverty become rich  those once renowned for virtue now detested for their vice  roving husbands grown constant  constant ones become rovers  the firmest friends changed to the most implacable enemies  beauty faded  in a word every change to demonstrate all is transitory on this side the grave  actuated by a wish that the reflective reader may experience the sensation which an attention to circumstances such as these must cause he is desired to imagine seventeen years elapsed since he has seen or heard of any of those persons who in the foregoing volumes have been introduced to his acquaintance  and now supposing himself at the period of those seventeen years follow the sequel of their history  to begin with the first female object of this story  the beautiful the beloved miss milner  she is no longer beautiful  no longer beloved  no longer  tremble while you read it  no longer  virtuous  dorriforth the pious the good the tender dorriforth is become a hardhearted tyrant the compassionate the feeling the just lord elmwood an example of implacable rigor and injustice  miss woodley is grown old but less with years than grief  the child rushbrook is become a man and the apparent heir of lord elmwoods fortune while his own daughter his only child by his once adored miss milner he refuses ever to see again in vengeance to her mothers crimes  the least wonderful change is the death of mrs horton except  sandford who remains much the same as heretofore  we left lady elmwood in the last volume at the summit of human happiness a loving and beloved bride  we begin this volume and find her upon her death bed  at thirtyfive her course was run  a course full of perils of hopes of fears of joys and at the end of sorrows all exquisite of their kind for exquisite were the feelings of her susceptible heart  at the commencement of this story her father is described in the last moments of his life with all his cares fixed upon her his only child  how vain these cares how vain every precaution that was taken for her welfare she knows she reflects upon this and yet torn by that instinctive power which a parent feels lady elmwood on her dying day has no worldly thought but that of the future happiness of her only child  to every other prospect before her thy will be done is her continual exclamation but where the misery of her daughter presents itself the dying penitent would there combat the will of heaven  to state the progression by which vice gains a predominance in the heart may be a useful lesson but it is one so little to the satisfaction of most readers that it is not meant to be related here all the degrees of frailty by which lady elmwood fell but instead of picturing every occasion of her fall come briefly to the events that followed  there are nevertheless some articles under the former class which ought not to be entirely omitted  lord elmwood after four years passed in the most perfect enjoyment of happiness the marriage state could give after seeing himself the father of a beautiful daughter whom he loved with a tenderness nearly equal to his love for her mother lord elmwood was then under the indispensable necessity of leaving them both for a time in order to save from the depredation of his steward a very large estate in the west indies his voyage was tedious his residence there from various accidents prolonged from time to time till near three years had at length passed away  lady elmwood at first only unhappy became at last provoked and giving way to that impatient irritable disposition she had so seldom governed resolved in spite of his injunctions to divert the melancholy hours his absence caused by mixing in the gaiest circles of london his lordship at this time and for many months before had been detained abroad by a severe and dangerous illness which a too cautious fear of her uneasiness had prompted him to conceal and she received his frequent aplogies for not returning with a suspicion and resentment they were calculated but not intended to inspire  to violent anger succeeded a degree of indifference still more fatal  lady elmwoods heart was never formed for such a state  there where all the passions tumultuous strove by turns one among them soon found the means to occupy all vacancies  that one was love  the dear object of her fondest truest affections was away and those affections painted the time so irksome that was past so wearisome that which was still to come she flew from the present tedious solitude to the dangerous society of one whose every care to charm her could not repay her for a moments loss of him whose absence he supplied  or if the delirium gave her a moments recompense what were her sufferings and remorse when she was awakened from the sleeting joy by the unexpected arrival of her husband  how happy how transporting had been that arrival a few months before  as it had then been felicitous it was now bitter  this word however weakly expresses  language affords none to describe lady elmwoods sensations on being told her lord was arrived and that necessity only had so long delayed his return  guilty but not hardened in her guilt her pangs her shame were the more excessive she fled the place at his approach fled his house never again to return to a habitation where he was the master  she did not however escape with her paramour but eloped to shelter herself in the most dreary retreat where she partook of no one comfort from society or from life but the still unremitting friendship of miss woodley  even her infant daughter she left behind nor would allow herself the consolation of her innocent but reproachful smiles  she left her in her fathers house that she might be under his protection parted with her as she thought for ever with all the agonies that mothers part from their infant children and yet even a mother scarcely can conceive how much more sharp those agonies were on beholding the child sent after her as the perpetual outcast of its father  lord elmwoods love to his lady had been extravagant  the effect of his hate was extravagant likewise beholding himself separated from her by a barrier never to be removed he vowed in the deep torments of his revenge not to be reminded of her by one individual object much less by one so nearly allied to her as her child to bestow upon that his affections would be he imagined still in some sort to divide them with the mother  firm in his resolution the beautiful matilda was at the age of six years sent out of her fathers house and received by her mother with the tenderness but with the anguish of those parents who behold their offspring visited with the punishment due only to their own offenses  during this transaction which was performed by his lordships agents at his command he himself was engaged in an affair of still weightier importance  that of life or death  he determined upon his own death or the death of the man who had wounded his honor and his happiness a duel with his old antagonist was the result of this determination nor was the duke of avon before the decease of his father and eldest brother lord frederick lawnly backward to render all the satisfaction that was required  for it was no other than he whose love for lady elmwood had still subsisted and whose art and industry left no means unessayed to perfect his designs  no other than he who next to lord elmwood was ever of all her lovers most prevalent in her heart to whom lady elmwood yielded her own and her husbands future peace and gave to his vanity a prouder triumph than if she had never given her hand in preference to another this triumph however was but short  a month only after the return of lord elmwood his grace was called upon to answer for his conduct and was left upon the spot where they met so maimed and defaced with scars as never again to endanger the honor of a husband as lord elmwood was inexorable to all accommodation their engagement lasted for some space of time nor any thing but the steadfast assurance his opponent was slain could at last have torn his lordship from the field though he himself was mortally wounded  yet even during that period of his danger while for days he laid in the continual expectation of his own death not all the entreaties of his dearest most intimate and most respected friends could prevail upon him to pronounce forgiveness to his wife or suffer them to bring his daughter to him for his last blessing  lady elmwood who was made acquainted with the minutest circumstance as it passed appeared to wait the news of her lords decease with patience but upon her brow and in every lineament of her face it was marked his death was an event she would not for a day survive  and she had left her child an orphan to have followed lord elmwood to the grave  she was prevented the trial he recovered and from the ample and distinguished vengeance he had obtained upon the irresistible person of the duke in a short time seemed to regain his usual tranquillity  he recovered while lady elmwood fell sick and lingered  possessed of youth and a good constitution she lingered till ten years decline brought her to that period with which the reader is now going to be presented  chapter ii in a lonely country on the borders of scotland a single house by the side of a dreary heath was the residence of the once gay volatile miss milner  in a large gloomy apartment of this solitary habitation the windows of which scarce rendered the light accessible was laid upon her deathbed the once lovely lady elmwood  pale half suffocated with the loss of breath yet her senses perfectly clear and collected which served but to sharpen the anguish of dying  in one corner of the room by the side of an oldfashioned stool kneels miss woodley praying most devoutly for her still beloved friend but in vain endeavoring to pray composedly  floods of tears pour down her furrowed cheeks and frequent sobs of sorrow break through each pious ejaculation  close by her mothers side one hand supporting her head the other wiping from her face the damp dew of death behold lady elmwoods daughter  lord elmwoods daughter too  yet he far away negligent of what either suffers  lady elmwood turns to her often and attempts an embrace but her feeble arms forbid and they fall motionless  the daughter perceiving those ineffectual efforts has her whole face convulsed with sorrow kisses her mother holds her to her bosom and hangs upon her neck as if she wished to cling there and the grave not to part them  on the other side the bed sits sandford  his hair grown white  his face wrinkled with age  his heart the same as ever  the reprover the enemy of the vain idle and wicked but the friend the comforter of the forlorn and miserable  upon those features where sarcasm reproach and anger dwelt to threaten and alarm the sinner mildness tenderness and pity beamed to support and console the penitent compassion changed his language and softened all those harsh tones that used to denounce resentment  in the name of god said he to lady elmwood that god who suffered for you and suffering knew and pitied all our weaknesses  by him who has given his word to take compassion on the sinners tears i bid you hope for mercy  by that innocence in which you once lived be comforted  by the sorrows you have known since your degradation hope in some degree to have atoned  by that sincerity which shone upon your youthful face when i joined your hands those thousand virtues you have at times given proof of you were not born to die the death of the wicked  as he spoke these words of consolation her trembling hand clasped his  her dying eyes darted a ray of brightness  but her failing voice endeavored in vain to articulate  at length her eyes fixing upon her daughter as their last dear object she was just understood to utter the word father  i understand you replied sandford and by all that influence i ever had over him by my prayers my tears and they flowed at the word i will implore him to own his child  she could now only smile in thanks  and if i should fail continued he yet while i live she shall not want a friend or protector  all an old man like me can answer for  here his tears interrupted him  lady elmwood was sufficiently sensible of his words and their import to make a sign as if she wished to embrace him but finding her life leaving her fast she reserved this last token of love for her daughter  with a struggle she lifted herself from her pillow clung to her child  and died in her arms  chapter iii lord elmwood was by nature and more from education of a serious thinking and philosophic turn of mind his religious studies had completely taught him to consider this world but as a passage to another to enjoy with gratitude what heaven in its bounty should bestow and to bear with submission all which in its vengeance it might inflict  in a greater degree than most people he practiced this doctrine and as soon as the first shock he received from lady elmwoods conduct was abated an entire calmness and resignation ensued but still of that sensible and feeling kind which could never force him to forget the happiness he had lost and it was this sensibility which urged him to fly from its more keen recollection as much as possible  this he alleged as the reason he would never suffer lady elmwood or even her child to be named in his hearing but this injunction which all his friends and even the servants in the house who attended his person had received was by many people suspected rather to proceed from his resentment than his tenderness nor did he himself deny that resentment mingled with his prudence for prudence he called it not to remind himself of happiness he could never taste again and of ingratitude that might impel him to hatred and prudence he called it not to form another attachment near to his heart more especially so near as a parents which might a second time expose him to all the torments of ingratitude from one whom he affectionately loved  upon these principles he formed the unshaken resolution never to acknowledge lady matilda as his child  or acknowledging her as such  never to see hear of or take one concern whatever in her fate and fortune the death of her mother appeared a favorable time had he been so inclined to have recalled this declaration which he had solemnly and repeatedly made  she was now destitute of the protection of her other parent and it became his duty at least to provide her a guardian if he did not choose to take that tender title upon himself  but to mention either the mother or child to lord elmwood was an equal offense and prohibited in the strongest terms to all his friends and household and as he was an excellent good master a sincere friend and a most generous patron not one of his acquaintance or dependants were hardy enough to draw upon themselves his certain displeasure which was violent in the extreme by even the official intelligence of lady elmwoods death  sandford himself intimidated through age or by the austere and even morose manners lord elmwood had of late years adopted sandford wished if possible some other would undertake the dangerous task of recalling to his lordships memory there ever was such a person as his wife he advised miss woodley to indite a proper letter to him on the subject but she reminded him such a step was still more perilous in her than any other person as she was the most destitute being on earth without the benevolence of lord elmwood the death of her aunt mrs horton had left her sole reliance on lady elmwood and now her death had left her totally dependant upon the earl  for her ladyship long before her decease had declared it was not her intention to leave a single sentence behind her in the form of a will  she had no will she said but what she would wholly submit to lord elmwoods and if it were even his will her child should live in poverty as well as banishment it should be so  but perhaps in this implicit submission to his lordship there was a distant hope that the necessitous situation of his daughter might plead more forcibly than his parental love and that knowing her abandoned of every support but through himself that idea might form some little tie between them and be at least a token of the relationship  but as lady elmwood anxiously wished this principle upon which she acted should be concealed from his lordships suspicion she included her friend miss woodley in the same fate and thus the only persons dear to her she left but at lord elmwoods pleasure to be preserved from perishing in want  her child was too young to advise her on this subject her friend too disinterested and at this moment they were both without the smallest means of support except through the justice or compassion of his lordship  sandford had indeed promised his protection to the daughter but his liberality had no other source than from his patron with whom he still lived as usual except during the winter when his lordship resided in town he then mostly stole a visit to lady elmwood  on this last visit he staid to see her buried  after some mature deliberations sandford was now preparing to go to lord elmwood at his house in town and there to deliver himself the news that must sooner or later be told and he meant also to venture at the same time to keep the promise he had made to his dying lady  but the news reached lord elmwood before sandford arrived it was announced in the public papers and by that means came first to his knowledge  he was breakfasting by himself when the newspaper that first gave the intelligence of lady elmwoods death was laid before him  the paragraph contained these words  on wednesday last died at dring park a village in northumberland the right honorable countess elmwood  this lady who has not been heard of for many years in the fashionable world was a rich heiress and of extreme beauty but although she received overtures from many men of the first rank she preferred her guardian the present lord elmwood then the humble mr dorriforth to them all  and it is said they enjoyed an uncommon share of felicity till his lordship going abroad and remaining there some time the consequences to a most captivating young woman left without a protector were such as to cause a separation on his return  her ladyship has left one child a daughter about fifteen lord elmwood had so much feeling upon reading this as to lay down the paper and not take it up again for several minutes  nor did he taste his chocolate during this interval but leaned his elbow on the table and rested his head upon his hand  he then rose up  walked two or three times across the room  sat down again  took up the paper  and read as usual  nor let the vociferous mourner or the perpetual weeper here complain of his want of sensibility  but let them remember lord elmwood was a man  a man of understanding  of courage  of fortitude  with all a man of the nicest feelings  and who shall say but that at the time he leaned his head upon his hand and rose to walk away the sense of what he felt he might not feel as much as lady elmwood did in her last moments  be this as it may his lordships susceptibility on the occasion was not suspected by any one  he passed that day the same as usual the next day too and the day after  on the morning of the fourth day he sent for his steward to his study and after talking of other business said to him  is it true that lady elmwood is dead  it is my lord replied the man  his lordship looked unusually grave and at this reply fetched an involuntary sigh  mr sandford my lord continued the steward sent me word of the news but left it to my own discretion whether i made your lordship acquainted with it or not  where is sandford asked lord elmwood  he was with my lady replied the steward  when she died asked his lordship  yes my lord  i am glad of it  he will see every thing she desired done  sandford is a good man and would be a friend to every body  he is a very good man indeed my lord  there was now a silence  mr giffard then bowing said has your lordship any farther commands  write to sandford said lord elmwood hesitating as he spoke and tell him to have every thing performed as she desired  and whoever she may have selected for the guardian of her child has my consent to act as such  nor in one instance where i myself am not concerned will i contradict her will  the tears rushed to his eyes as he said this and caused them to start in the stewards  observing which he sternly resumed  do not suppose from this conversation that any of those resolutions i have long since taken are or will be changed  they are the same and shall continue the same  and your interdiction sir as well as every other persons remains just the same as formerly never to mention this subject to me in future  my lord i always obeyed you replied mr giffard and hope i always shall  i hope so too replied his lordship in a threatening accent  write to sandford continued he to let him know my pleasure and that is all you have to do  the steward bowed and withdrew  but before his letter arrived to sandford sandford arrived in town and mr giffard related to him word for word what had passed between him and his lord  upon every occasion and upon every topic except that of lady elmwood and her child sandford was just as free with lord elmwood as he had ever been and as usual after his interview with the steward went into his lordships apartment without any previous notice his lordship shaked him by the hand as upon all other meetings and yet whether his fears suggested it or not sandford thought he appeared more cool and reserved with him than common  during the whole day the slightest mention of lady elmwood or of her child was cautiously avoided  and not till the evening after sandford had rung for his candle to retire to rest it was brought and he had wished his lordship good night did he dare to mention the subject  he then after taking leave and going to the door  turned back and said my lord   it was easy to guess on what he was preparing to speak  his voice failed the tears began to trickle down his cheeks he took out his handkerchief and could proceed no farther  i thought said lord elmwood angrily i thought i had given my orders upon this subject  did not my steward write them to you  he did my lord said sandford humbly but i was set out before they arrived  has he not told you my mind then cried his lordship more angrily still  he has replied sandford  but   but what sir  cried lord elmwood  your lordship continued sandford was mistaken in supposing lady elmwood left a will she left none  no will no will at all  said his lordship surprised  no my lord answered sandford she wished every thing to be as you willed  she left me all the trouble then you mean  no great trouble sir for except two persons her ladyship has not left any one else to hope for your protection  and who are those two cried he hastily  one my lord i need not name  the other is miss woodley  there was a delicacy and an humility in the manner in which sandford delivered this reply that lord elmwood could not resent and he only returned  miss woodley is she yet living  she is  i left her at the house i came from  well then answered his lordship you must see that my steward provides for those two persons  that care i leave to you  and should there be any complaints on you they fall  sandford bowed and was going  and now resumed his lordship in a stern and exalted voice let me never hear again on this subject  you have full power to act in regard to the persons you have mentioned and upon you their situation their care their whole management depend  but be sure you never let them be named before me from this moment  then said sandford as this must be the last time they are mentioned i must now take the opportunity to disburthen my mind of a charge   what charge  cried his lordship morosely interrupting him  though lady elmwood my lord left no will behind she left a request  request  said his lordship starting  if it is for me to see her daughter i tell you now before you ask i will not grant it  for by heaven and he spoke and looked most solemnly though i have no resentment to the innocent child and wish her happy yet i will never see her  never for her mothers sake suffer my heart to be again softened by an object i might dote on  therefore sir if that is the request it is already answered my will is fixed  the request my lord replied sandford taking out a pocket book from whence he drew several papers is contained in this letter nor do i rightly know what its contents are  and he held it out to him  is it lady elmwoods writing cried his lordship extremely discomposed  it is my lord  she called for ink and paper and wrote it a few days before she died and enjoined me to deliver it to you with my own hands  i refuse to read it  cried he putting it from him  and trembling while he did so  she desired me said sandford still presenting the letter to conjure you to read it for her fathers sake  lord elmwood took it instantly  but as soon as it was in his hand he seemed distressed to know what he should do with it  in what place to go to read it  or how fortify himself against its contents  he appeared ashamed too that he had been so far prevailed upon and said by way of excuse  for mr milners sake i would do much  nay any thing but that to which i have just now sworn never to consent  for his sake i have borne a great deal  for his sake alone his daughter died my wife  you know no other motive than respect for him prevented my divorcing her  pray and he hesitated was she buried with him  no my lord  she expressed no such desire and as that was the case i did not think it necessary to carry the corpse so far  at the word corpse lord elmwood shrunk and looked shocked beyond measure  but recovering himself said i am sorry for it  for he loved her sincerely if she did not love him  and i wish they had been buried together  it is not then too late said sandford and was going on  but his lordship interrupted him  no no  we will have no disturbing of the dead  read her letter then said sandford and bid her rest in peace  if it is in my power returned his lordship to grant what she asks i will  but if her demand is what i apprehend i cannot i will not bid her rest by complying  you know my resolution and my disposition and take care how you provoke me  you may do an injury to the very person you are seeking to befriend  the very maintenance i mean to allow her daughter i can withdraw  poor sandford all alarm at this menace replied with energy my lord unless you begin the subject i never will presume to mention it again  i take you at your word  returned his lordship and in consequence of that and that alone we are friends  good night sir  sandford bowed with all humility and they went to their separate bedchambers  chapter iv after lord elmwood had retired into his chamber it was some time before he read the letter sandford had given him he first walked backwards and forwards in the room  he then began to take off some part of his dress but did it slowly at length he dismissed his valet and sitting down took the letter from his pocket  he looked at the seal but not at the direction for he seemed to dread to see lady elmwoods hand writing  he then laid it on the table and began again to undress he did not proceed but taking up the letter quickly with a kind of effort in making the resolution broke it open these were its contents  my lord who writes this letter i well know  i well know also to whom it is addressed  i feel with the most powerful force both our situations  nor should i dare to offer you even this humble petition but that at the time you receive it there will be no such person as i am in existance  for myself then all concern will be over  but there is a care that pursues me to the grave and threatens my want of repose even there  i leave a child  i will not call her mine that has undone her  i will not call her yours that will be of no avail  i present her before you as the grand daughter of mr milner  oh do not refuse an assylum even in your own house to the destitute offspring of your friend the last and only remaining branch of his family  receive her into your household be her condition there ever so abject  i cannot write distinctly what i would  my senses are not impaired but the powers of expression are  the unfortunate child in the scripture a lesson i have studied his complaint has made this wish cling so fast to my heart that without the distant hope of its being fulfilled death would have more terrors than my weak mind could support  i will go to my father how many servants live in my fathers house and are fed with plenty while i starve in a foreign land  i do not ask a parents festive rejoicing at her approach  i do not even ask her father to behold her  but let her live under his protection  for her grandfathers sake do not refuse this  to the child of his child whom he trusted to your care do not refuse it  be her host i remit the tie of being her parent  never see her  but let her sometimes live under the same roof with you  it is miss milner your ward to whom you never refused a request suplicates you  not now for your nephew rushbrook but for one so much more dear that a denial  she dares not suffer her thoughts to glance that way  she will hope  and in that hope bids you farewell with all the love she ever bore you  farewell lord elmwood  and before you throw this letter from you with contempt or anger cast your imagination into the gravewhere i am lying  reflect upon all the days of my past life  the anxious moments i have known and what has been their end  behold me also  in my altered face there is no anxiety  no joy or sorrow  all is over  my whole frame is motionless  my heart beats no more  look at my horrid habitation too  and ask yourself  whether i am an object of resentment   while lord elmwood read this letter it trembled in his hand he once or twice wiped the tears from his eyes as he read and once laid the letter down for a few minutes at its conclusion the tears flowed fast down his face but he seemed both ashamed and angry they did and was going to throw the paper upon the fire he however suddenly checked his hand and putting it hastily into his pocket went to bed  chapter v the next morning when lord elmwood and sandford met at breakfast sandford was pale with fear for the success of lady elmwoods letter  his lordship was pale too but there was beside upon his face something which evidently marked he was displeased  sandford observed it and was all humbleness both in his words and looks in order to soften him  as soon as the breakfast was removed his lordship drew lady elmwoods letter from his pocket and holding it toward sandford said  that may be of more value to you than it is to me therefore i give it you  sandford called up a look of surprise as if he did not know the letter again  it is lady elmwoods letter said his lordship and i give it to you for two reasons  sandford took it and putting it up asked fearfully what those two reasons were  first said lord elmwood because i think it is a relick you may like to preserve  my second reason is that you may show it to her daughter and let her know why and on what conditions i grant her mothers request  you do then grant it cried sandford joyfully i thank you  you are kind  you are considerate  be not too hasty in your gratitude returned his lordship you may have cause to recall it  i know what you have said replied sandford you have said you grant lady elmwoods request  you cannot recall these words nor i my gratitude  do you know what her request is said lord elmwood  not exactly my lord  i told you before i did not but it is no doubt something in favor of her child  i think not replied his lordship such as it is however i grant it  but in the strictest sense of the word  no farther  and one neglect of my commands releases my promise totally  we will take care sir not to disobey them  then listen to what they are  and to you i give the charge of delivering them again  lady elmwood has petitioned me in the name of her father a name i reverence to give his grandchild the sanction of my protection  in the litteral sense to suffer her to reside occasionally at one of my seats dispensing at the same time with my ever seeing her  and you will comply  i will till she encroaches on this concession and dare to ask for a greater  i will while she avoids my sight or the giving me any remembrance of her  but whether by design or by accident i ever see or hear from her that moment my compliance to her mothers supplication ceases and i abandon her once more  sandford sighed  his lordship continued  i am glad her request stopped where it did  i would rather comply with her desires than not and i rejoice they are such as i can grant with ease and honor to myself i am seldom now at elmwood house let her daughter go there  the few weeks or months i am down in the summer she may easily in that extensive house avoid me  while she does she lives in security  when she does not you know my resolution  sandford bowed  his lordship resumed  nor can it be a hardship to obey this command  she cannot lament the separation from a parent whom she never knew   sandford was going eagerly to prove the error of that assertion but his lordship prevented him saying in a word  without farther argument  if she obeys me in this i certainly provide for her as my daughter during my life and leave her a fortune at my death  but if she dares    sandford interrupted the menace he saw prepared for utterance saying and you still mean i suppose to make mr rushbrook your heir  have you not heard me say so and do you imagine i have changed my determination i am not given to alter my resolutions mr sandford and i thought you knew i was not  besides will not my title be extinct whoever i make my heir  could any thing but a son have preserved my title  then it is yet possible    by marrying again you mean  no  no  i have had enough of marriage  and henry rushbrook i leave my heir therefore sir    my lord i do not presume    do not sandford and we may still be friends  but i am not to be controled as formerly my temper is changed of late changed to what it was originally till your scholastic and religious rules reformed it you may remember how troublesome it was to conquer my stubborn disposition in my youth then indeed you did but in my manhood you will find the task more difficult  sandford again repeated he should not presume    to which his lordship again made answer do not sandford and added for i have a sincere regard for you and should be loath at these years to quarrel with you seriously  sandford turned away his head to hide his tears  nay if we do quarrel resumed his lordship you know it must be your own fault  and as this is a theme the most likely of any indeed the only one on which we can have a difference such as we cannot forgive take care never from this day to resume it  indeed that of itself is an offense i will not pardon  i have been clear and explicit in all i have said there can be no fear of mistaking my meaning therefore all future explanation is unnecessary  nor will i permit a word or a hint on the subject from any one without showing my resentment to the hour of my death he was going out of the room  but before we bid adieu to the subject for ever my lord  there was another person whom i named to you    do you mean miss woodley  oh by all means let her live at elmwood house too  on consideration i have no objection to see miss woodley at any time  i shall be glad to see her  do not let her be frightened at me  to her i shall be the same i have always been  she is a good woman my lord cried sandford pleased  you need not tell me that mr sandford i know her worth  and his lordship left the room  sandford to relieve miss woodley and her lovely charge from the suspense in which he had left them set off for their habitation the next day in order himself to conduct them from thence to elmwood house and appoint some retired part of it for lady matilda against the annual visit her father paid there but before he left london giffard the steward took an opportunity to wait upon him and let him know that his lord had acquainted him with the consent he had given for his daughter to be admitted at elmwood castle and upon what restrictions likewise that he had denounced the most severe threats should these restrictions be broken sandford thanked giffard for his friendly information which served him as a second warning of the circumspection that was necessary and having taken leave of his lordship under the pretense he could not live in the smoke of london he set out for the north  it is unnecessary to say with what delight sandford was received by miss woodley and the hapless daughter of lady elmwood even before he told his errand they both loved him sincerely more especially lady matilda whose forlorn state and innocent sufferings had ever excited his compassion in the extremest degree and had caused him ever to treat her with the utmost affection tenderness and respect she knew too how much he had been her mothers friend for that she also loved him and being honored with the friendship of her father she looked up to him with reverence and awe for matilda with an excellent understanding a sedateness above her years and early accustomed to the most private converse between lady elmwood and miss woodley was perfectly acquainted with the whole fatal history of her mother and was by her taught that respect and admiration of her fathers virtues which they justly merited  notwithstanding the joy of beholding mr sandford once more to cheer by his presence their solitary dwelling no sooner were the first kind greetings over than the dread of what he might have to inform them possessed both poor matilda and miss woodley so powerfully their gladness was changed into affright  their apprehensions were far more forcible than their curiosity  they durst not ask a question and even began to wish he would continue silent upon the subject on which they feared to listen  for near two hours he was so  at length after a short interval from speaking during which they waited with anxiety for what he might next say he turned to lady matilda and said  you dont ask for your father my dear  i did not know it was proper she replied timidly  it is always proper answered sandford for you to think of him though he should never think on you  she burst into tears saying she  did think of him but she felt an apprehension at mentioning his name  and she wept bitterly while she spoke  nay do not think i reproved you said sandford i but told you what was right  nay said miss woodley it is not for that she cries thus  she fears her father has not complied with her mothers request  perhaps not even read her letter  yes he has read it returned sandford  oh heavens exclaimed matilda clasping her hands together and the tears falling faster still  do not be so much alarmed my dear said miss woodley you know we are prepared for the worst and you know you promised your mother whatever your fate was to submit with patience  yes replied matilda and i am prepared for every thing but my fathers refusal to my dear mother  your father has not refused your mothers request replied sandford  she was leaping from her seat in ecstasy  but continued he do you know what her request was  not entirely replied matilda and since it is granted i am careless  but she told me her letter concerned none but me  to explain perfectly to matilda lady elmwoods letter and that she might perfectly understand upon what terms she was admitted into elmwood house sandford now read the letter to her and repeated as nearly as he could remember the whole of the conversation that passed between lord elmwood and himself not even sparing with an erroneous delicacy any of those threats her father had denounced should she dare to break through the limits he prescribed  nor did he try to soften in one instance a word his lordship uttered she listened sometimes with tears sometimes with hope but always with awe and terror to every sentence wherein her father was concerned once she called him cruel  then exclaimed he was kind but at the end of sandfords intelligence concluded she was happy and grateful for the boon bestowed  even her mother had not a more exalted and transcendent idea of lord elmwoods worth than his daughter had formed and this little bounty just obtained had not been greater in her mothers estimation than it was now in here is  miss woodley too smiled at the prospect before her  she esteemed lord elmwood beyond any mortal living  she was proud to hear what he had said in her praise and overjoyed at the prospect she should be once again in his company picturing at the same time a thousand of the brightest hopes from watching every emotion of his soul and catching every proper occasion to excite or increase his paternal sentiments  yet she had the prudence to conceal those vague hopes from his child lest a disappointment might prove fatal and assuming a behavior not too much elated or depressed she advised they should hope for the best but yet as usual expect and prepare for the worst  after taking measures for quitting their melancholy abode within the fortnight they all departed for elmwood castle  matilda miss woodley and even sandford first visiting lady elmwoods grave and bedewing it with their tears  chapter vi it was on a dark evening in the month of march that lady matilda accompanied by sandford and miss woodley arrived at elmwood castle the magnificent seat of her father  sandford chose the evening rather to steal into the house privately than by any appearance of parade suffer lord elmwood to be reminded of it by the public prints or by any other accident  nor would he give the neighbors or servants the slightest reason to suppose the daughter of their lord was admitted into his house in any other situation than that which she really was  as the porter opened the gates of the avenue to the carriage that brought them matilda felt an awful and yet a gladsome sensation no terms can describe  as she entered the door of the house this sensation increased  and as she passed along the spacious hall the splendid staircase and many stately apartments wonder with a crowd of the tenderest yet most afflicting sentiments rushed to her heart  she gazed with astonishment  she reflected with more  and is my father the master of this house she cried  and was my mother once the mistress of this house  here a flood of tears relieved her from a part of that burden which was before insupportable  yes replied sandford and you are the mistress of it now till your father arrives  good god exclaimed she and will he ever arrive and shall i live to sleep under the same roof with my father  my dear replied miss woodley have not you been told so  yes said she but though i heard it with extreme pleasure yet the idea never so forcibly affected me as at this moment  i now feel as the reality approaches this has been kindness sufficient  i do not ask for more  i am now convinced from what this trial makes me feel that to see my father would cause a sensation a feeling i could not survive  the next morning gave to matilda more objects still of admiration and wonder as she walked over the extensive gardens groves and other pleasure grounds belonging to the house she who had never been beyond the dreary ruinate place where her deceased mother had chosen her residence was naturally struck with amazement and delight at the grandeur of a seat which travelers have come for miles to see and not thought their time misspent  there was one object however among all she saw which attracted her attention above the rest and she would stand for hours to look at it  this was a full length portrait of lord elmwood esteemed a very capital picture and a great likeness  to this picture she would sigh and weep though when it was first pointed out to her she shrunk back with fear and it was some time before she dared venture to cast her eyes completely upon it in the features of her father she was proud to discern the exact moulds in which her own appeared to have been modelled yet matildas person shape and complexion were so extremely like what her mothers once were that at the first glance she appeared to have a still greater resemblance of her than of her father  but her mind and manners were all lord elmwoods softened by the delicacy of her sex the extreme tenderness of her heart and the melancholy of her situation  she was now in her seventeenth year  of the same age within a year and a few months of her mother when she became the ward of dorriforth  she was just three years old when her father went abroad and remembered something of bidding him farewell but more of taking cherries from his hand as he pulled them from the tree to give to her  educated in the school of adversity and inured to retirement from her infancy she had acquired a taste for all those amusements which a recluse life affords  she was fond of walking and riding  was accomplished in the arts of music and drawing by the most careful instructions of her mother  and as a scholar she excelled most of her sex from the great pains sandford had taken with that part of her education and the great abilities he possessed for the task  in devoting certain hours of the day to study with him others to music riding and such recreations matildas time never appeared tedious at elmwood house although she neither received nor paid one visit  for it was soon divulged in the neighborhood upon what stipulation she resided at her fathers and intimated that the most prudent and friendly behavior of the friends both of her father and of herself would be to take no notice whatever that she lived among them and as lord elmwoods will was a law all around such was the consequence of his will being known or supposed  neither did miss woodley regret the want of visiters but found herself far more satisfied in her present situation than her most sanguine hopes could have formed  she had a companion whom she loved with an equal fondness with which she had loved her deceased mother and frequently in this charming mansion where she had so often beheld lady elmwood her imagination pictured matilda as her risen from the grave in her former youth health and exquisite beauty  in peace in content though far from happiness the days and weeks passed away till about the middle of august when preparations began to be made for the arrival of lord elmwood  the week in which he was to come was at length fixed and some part of his retinue was arrived before him  when this was told to matilda she started and looked just as her mother at her age often times had done when in spite of her love she was conscious she had offended him and was terrified at his approach sandford observing this put out his hand and taking hers shook it kindly and bade her but it was not in a cheerful tone not be afraid this gave her no confidence and she began before his lordships arrival to seclude herself in those apartments which were allotted for her during the time of his stay and in the timorous expectation of his coming her appetite declined and she lost all her color  even miss woodley whose spirits had been for some time elated with the hopes she had formed on drawing near to the test found those hopes vanished and though she endeavored to conceal it she was replete with apprehensions  sandford had certainly fewer fears an either yet upon the eve of the day on which his patron was to arrive he was evidently cast down  lady matilda once asked him  are you certain mr sandford you made no mistake in respect to what lord elmwood said when he granted my mothers request are you sure he did grant it  was there nothing equivocal on which he may ground his displeasure should he hear i am here  oh do not let me hazard the being once again turned out of his house  oh save me from provoking him perhaps to curse me  and here she clasped her hands together with the most fervent petition in the dread of what might happen  if you doubt my word or my senses said sandford call giffard and let him inform you  my lord repeated the same words to him he did to me  though from her reason matilda could not doubt of any mistake from mr sandford yet her fears suggested a thousand scruples and this reference to the steward she received with the utmost satisfaction though she did not think it necessary to apply to him as it perfectly convinced her of the folly of those suspicions she had entertained  and yet mr sandford said she if it is so why are you less cheerful than you were i cannot help thinking but it must be the expectation of lord elmwood which has caused in you this change  i dont know replied sandford carelessly but i believe i am grown afraid of your father  his temper is a great deal altered from what it once was  he exalts his voice and uses harsh expressions upon the least provocation  his eyes flash lightning and his face is distorted with anger on the slightest motives  he turns away his old servants at a moments warning and no concession can make their peace  in a word i am more at my ease when i am away from him  and i really believe added he with a smile but with a tear at the same time i really believe i am more afraid of him in my age than he was of me when he was a boy  miss woodley was present she and matilda looked at one another and each saw the other turn pale at this description  the day at length came on which lord elmwood was expected to dinner  it had been a high gratification to his daughter to have gone to the topmost window of the house to have only beheld his chariot enter the avenue but it was a gratification which her fears her tremor her extreme sensibility would not permit her to enjoy  miss woodley and she sat down that day to dinner in their retired apartments which were detached from the other part of the house by a gallery and of the door leading to the gallery they had a key to impede any one from passing that way without first ringing a bell to answer which was the sole employment of a servant who was placed there during his lordships residence lest by any accident he might chance to come near that unfrequented part of the house on which occasion the man was to give immediate notice to his lady  miss woodley and she sat down to dinner but did not dine  sandford ate as usual with lord elmwood  when the servant brought up tea miss woodley asked him if he had seen his lord  the man answered yes madam and he looks vastly well  matilda wept with joy to hear it  about nine in the evening sandford rung at the bell and was admitted  and never was he so welcome  matilda hung upon him as if his recent society with her father had endeared him to her more than ever and staring anxiously in his face seemed to ask him to tell her something of lord elmwood and something that should not alarm her  well  how do you find yourself said he to her  how are you mr sandford she returned with a sigh  oh very well replied he  is my lord in a good temper asked miss woodley  yes very well replied sandford with indifference  did he seem glad to see you asked matilda  he shook me by the hand replied sandford  that was a sign he was glad to see you was it not said matilda  yes but he could not do less  nor more replied she  he looks very well our servant tells us said miss woodley  extremely well indeed answered sandford and to tell the truth i never saw him in better spirits  that is well said matilda and sighed a weight of fears from her heart  where is he now mr sandford  gone to take a walk about his grounds and so i stole here the time  what was your conversation during dinner  horses hay farming and politics  will not you sup with him  i shall see him again before i go to bed  and again tomorrow  cried matilda what happiness  he has visiters tomorrow said sandford coming for a week or two  thank heaven said miss woodley he will then be diverted from thinking on us  do you know returned sandford it is my firm opinion that his thinking of ye at present is the cause of his good spirits  oh heavens cried matilda lifting up her hands with rapture  nay do not mistake me said sandford i would not have you build a foundation for joy upon this for if he is in spirits that you are in this house  so near him  positively under his protection  yet he will not allow himself to think that is the cause of his content  and the sentiments he has adopted and are now become natural to him will remain the same as ever nay perhaps with greater force while he suspects his weakness as he calls it acting in opposition  if he does but think of me with tenderness cried matilda i am recompensed  and what recompense would his kind thoughts be to you said sandford were he to turn you out to beggary  a great deal  a great deal she replied  but how are you to know he has these kind thoughts while he gives you no proof of them  no mr sandford but supposing we could know them without the proof  but as that is impossible answered he i shall suppose till the proof appears i am mistaken  matilda looked deeply concerned that the argument should conclude in her disappointment for to have believed herself thought of with tenderness by her father would have alone constituted her happiness  when the servant came up with something by way of supper he told mr sandford his lordship was returned from his walk and had enquired for him sandford immediately bade his companions good night and left them  how strange is this cried matilda when miss woodley and she were alone my father within a few rooms of me and yet i am debarred from seeing him  only by walking a few paces i might be at his feet and perhaps receive his blessing  you make me shudder said miss woodley but some spirits less fearful than mine might perhaps advise you to try the experiment  not for worlds returned matilda no counsel could tempt me to such temerity and yet to entertain the thought that it is possible i could do this is a source of great comfort  this conversation lasted till bed time and later for they sat up beyond their usual hour to indulge it  miss woodley slept little but matilda less  she awaked repeatedly during the night and every time sighed to herself i sleep in the same house with my father blessed spirit of my mother look down and rejoice  chapter vii the next day the whole castle appeared to lady matilda though she was in some degree retired from it all tumult and bustle as was usually the case while his lordship was there she saw from her windows servants running across the yards and park horses and carriages driving with fury all the suit of a nobleman and it seemed sometimes to elate at other times to depress her  these impressions however and others of fear and anxiety which her fathers first arrival had excited by degrees wore away and after some short time she was in the same tranquil state she enjoyed before he came  he had visitors to stay a week or two he paid some visits himself for several days and thus the time passed till it was about four weeks since he arrived during which sandford with all his penetration could never clearly discover whether he had once called to mind his daughter was living in the same house he had not named her that was not extraordinary consequently no one durst name her to him but he had not even mentioned miss woodley of whom he had so lately spoken in the kindest terms and said he should take pleasure in seeing her again from these contradictions in lord elmwoods behavior in respect to her it was miss woodleys plan neither to throw herself in his way or avoid him she therefore frequently walked about the house while he was in it not indeed wholly without restraint but at least with the show of liberty this freedom indulged for some time without peril became at last less cautious and no ill consequences arising from its practice her scruples gradually ceased  one morning however as she was crossing the large hall thoughtless of danger a footstep at a distance alarmed her almost without knowing why  she stopped for a moment thinking to return the steps approached quicker and before she could retreat she beheld lord elmwood at the other end of the hall and perceived that he saw her  it was now too late to hesitate what was to be done she could not go back and had not courage to go on she therefore stood still  disconcerted and much affected at his sight their former intimacy coming to her mind together with the many years and many sad occurrences passed since she last saw him all her intentions all her meditated plans how to conduct herself on such an occasion gave way to a sudden shock  and to make the meeting yet more distressing her very fright she knew must serve to recall more powerfully to his mind the subject she most wished him to forget the steward was with his lordship and as they came up close by her side giffard observing him look at her earnestly said softly but so as she heard him my lord it is miss woodley lord elmwoods hat was off immediately and coming to her with alacrity he took her by the hand and said indeed miss woodley i did not know you  i am very glad to see you and while he spoke shook her hand with a cordiality her tender heart could not bear  and never did she feel so hard a struggle as to restrain her tears but the thought of matildas fate  the idea of awaking in his mind a sentiment that might irritate him against his child wrought more forcibly than every other effort and though she could not reply distinctly she replied without weeping  whether he saw her embarrassment and wished to release her from it or was in haste to conceal his own he left her almost instantly but not till he had entreated she would dine that very day with him and mr sandford who were to dine without other company  she curtsied assent and flew to tell matilda what had occurred  after listening with anxiety and joy to all she told matilda laid hold of that hand she said lord elmwood had held and pressed it to her lips with love and reverence  when miss woodley made her appearance at dinner sandford who had not seen her since the invitation and did not know of it looked amazed  on which his lordship said do you know sandford i met miss woodley this morning and had it not been for giffard i should have passed her without knowing her  but miss woodley if i am not so much altered but that you knew me i take it unkind you did not speak first  she was unable to speak even now  he saw it and changed the conversation which sandford was happy to join for in the present discourse he did not feel himself very comfortable  as they advanced in their dinner miss woodleys and sandfords embarrassment diminished while lord elmwood in his turn became not embarrassed but absent and melancholy  he now and then sighed heavily  and called for wine much oftener than he was accustomed  when miss woodley took her leave his lordship invited her to dine with him and sandford whenever it was convenient to her  he said many things too of the same kind and all with the utmost civility yet not with that warmth with which he had spoken in the morning  into that he had been surprised while this coolness was the effect of reflection  when she came to lady matilda and sandford had joined them they talked and deliberated on what had passed   you acknowledge mr sandford said miss woodley that you think my presence affected lord elmwood so as to make him much more thoughtful than usual if you imagine these thoughts were upon lady elmwood i will never intrude again but if you suppose i caused him to think upon his daughter i cannot go too often  i dont see how he can divide those two objects in his mind replied sandford and therefore you must even visit him on and take your chance what reflections you may inspire  but be they what they will time will take away from you that power of affecting him  she concurred in the opinion and occasionally walked into his lordships apartments dined or took coffee with him as the accident suited and observed according to sandfords prescience that time wore off that impression her visits first made  lord elmwood now became just the same before her as before others  she easily discerned too through all that politeness which he assumed  he was no longer the considerate the forbearing character he formally was but haughty impatient imperious and more than ever implacable  chapter viii when lord elmwood had been at his country seat about six weeks mr rushbrook his nephew and his adopted child the friendless boy whom poor lady elmwood first introduced into his uncles house and by her kindness preserved there  arrived from his travels and was received by his lordship with all that affectionate warmth due to the man he thought worthy to make his heir rushbrook had been a beautiful boy and was now an extremely handsome young man he had made an unusual progress in his studies had completed the tour of italy and germany and returned home with the air and address of a perfect man of fashion  there was beside an elegance and persuasion in his manner almost irresistible  yet with all those accomplishments when he was introduced to sandford and put out his hand to take his sandford with evident reluctance gave it to him and when lord elmwood asked him in the young mans presence if he did not think his nephew greatly improved he looked at him from head to foot and muttered he could not say he observed it the color heightened in mr rushbrooks face upon this occasion but he was too well bred not to be still in perfect good humor  sandford saw this young man treated in the house of lord elmwood with the same respect and attention as if he had been his lordships son and it was but probable the old priest should make a comparison between the situation of him and of lady matilda elmwood  before her it was sandfords meaning to have concealed his thoughts upon the subject and never to have mentioned it but with composure that was however impossible  unused to conceal his feelings at the name of rushbrook his countenance would always change and a sarcastic sneer and sometimes a frown of resentment force their way in spite of his resolution  miss woodley too with all her boundless charity and good will was upon this occasion induced to limit their excess and they did not extend so far as to reach poor rushbrook  she even and in reality did not think him handsome or engaging in his manners  she thought his gaiety frivilousness his complaisance affectation and his good humor impertinence  it was impossible to conceal those unfavourable sentiments entirely from matilda for when the subject arose as it frequently did miss woodleys undisguised heart and sandfords undisguised countenance told them instantly  matilda had the understanding to imagine she was perhaps the object who had thus deformed mr rushbrook and frequently though he was a stranger to her and one who had caused her many a jealous heartach frequently she would speak in his vindication  you are very good said sandford one day to her you like him because you know your father loves him  this was a hard sentence to the daughter of lord elmwood to whom her fathers love would have been more precious than any other blessing  she however checked the assault of envy and kindly replied  my mother loved him too mr sandford  yes answered sandford he has been a grateful man to your poor mother  she did not suppose when she took him into the house when she entreated your father to take him and through her caresses and officious praises of him to his uncle first gave him that power he now possesses over him she little foresaw at that time his ingratitude and its effects  very true said miss woodley with a heavy sigh  what ingratitude said matilda do you suppose mr rushbrook is the cause my father will not see me oh do not pay lord elmwoods motives so ill a compliment  i do not say he is the absolute cause returned sandford but if a parents heart is void i would have it remain so till stored by its lawful owner  a usurper i detest  no one can take lord elmwoods heart by force replied his daughter it must i believe be a free gift to the possessor and as such whoever has it has a right to it  in this manner she would plead the young mans excuse  perhaps but to hear what could be said in his disfavour for secretly his name was bitter to her  and once she exclaimed in vexation on sandfords saying lord elmwood and mr rushbrook were gone out shooting together  all that pleasure is now eclipsed which i used to take in listening to the report of my fathers gun for i cannot now distinguish his from his parasites  sandford much as he disliked rushbrook  for this expression which comprised her father in the reflection turned to matilda in extreme anger but as he saw the color mount to her face for what in the strong feelings of her heart had escaped her lips he did not say a word  and by a flood of tears that followed after he rejoiced to see how much she reproved herself  miss woodley vexed to the heart and provoked every time she saw lord elmwood and rushbrook together and saw the familiar terms on which this young man lived with his benefactor now made her visits to his lordship very seldom  if lord elmwood observed this he did not appear to observe it and though he received her very politely when she did pay him a visit it was always very coldly nor did she suppose if she never went he would ever ask for her for his daughters sake however she thought it right sometimes to show herself before him for she knew it must be impossible that with all his seeming indifference lord elmwood could ever see her without thinking for a moment on his child and what one fortunate thought might sometime bring about was an object too serious for her to slight  she therefore after remaining confined to her apartments near three weeks excepting those short and anxious walks she and matilda stole while lord elmwood dined or before he rose in a morning went one forenoon into his lordships apartments where as usual she found him mr sandford and mr rushbrook  after she had sat about half an hour conversing with them all though but very little with the latter his lordship was called out of the room upon some business presently after sandford and now not much pleased with the companion with whom she was left she rose and was going likewise when rushbrook fixed his speaking eyes upon her and cried  miss woodley will you pardon me what i am going to say  certainly sir  you can i am sure say nothing but what i must forgive  but she made this reply with a distance and a reserve very unlike the usual manners of miss woodley  he looked at her earnestly and cried ah miss woodley you dont behave so kindly to me as you used to do  i do not understand you sir  she replied very gravely  times are changed mr rushbrook since you were last here  you were then but a child  yet i love all those persons now i loved then replied he and so i shall for ever  but you mistake mr rushbrook i was not even then so very much the object of your affections  there were other ladies you loved better  perhaps you dont remember lady elmwood  dont i  cried he oh clasping his hands and lifting up his eyes to heaven shall i ever forget her  that moment lord elmwood opened the door the conversation of course that moment ended but confusion at the sudden surprise was on the face of both the parties  his lordship saw it and looked at each by turns with a sternness that made poor miss woodley ready to faint while rushbrook with the most natural and happy laugh that ever was affected cried no dont tell my lord pray miss woodley  she was more confused than before and his lordship turning to him asked what the subject was  by this time he had invented one and continuing his laugh said miss woodley my lord will to this day protest she saw my apparition when i was a boy and she says it is a sign i shall die young and is really much affected at it  lord elmwood turned away before this ridiculous speech was concluded yet so well had it been acted he did not for an instant doubt its truth  miss woodley felt herself greatly relieved and yet so little is it in the power of those we dislike to do any thing to please us that from this very circumstance she formed a still more unfavourable opinion of mr rushbrook than she had done before  she saw in this little incident the art of dissimulation cunning and duplicity in its most glaring shape and detested the method by which they had each escaped lord elmwoods suspicion and perhaps anger the more because it was so dexterously managed  lady matilda and sandford were both in their turns informed of this trait in mr rushbrooks character and although miss woodley had the best of dispositions and upon every occasion spoke the strictest truth yet in relating this occurrence she did not speak all the truth for every circumstance that would have told to the young mans advantage literally slipped her memory  the twenty ninth of october arrived on which a dinner a ball and supper was given by lord elmwood to all the neighboring gentry  the peasants also dined in the park off a roasted bullock several casks of ale were distributed and the bells of the village rung  matilda who heard and saw some part of this festivity from her windows inquired the cause but even the servant who waited upon her had too much sensibility to tell her and answered he did not know miss woodley however soon learnt the reason and groaning with the painful secret informed her mr rushbrook on that day was come of age  my birth day was last week replied matilda but not a word beside  in their retired apartments the day passed away not only soberly but almost silently for to speak upon any subject that did not engage their thoughts had been difficult and to speak upon the only one that did had been afflictive  just as they were sitting down to dinner their bell gently rung and in walked sandford  why are not you among the revellers mr sandford cried miss woodley with an ironical sneer  the first her features ever wore  pray were not you invited to dine with the company  yes replied sandford but my head aked and so i had rather come and take a bit with you  matilda as if she had beheld his heart as he spoke clung round his neck and sobbed on his bosom he put her peevishly away crying nonsense nonsense  eat your dinner but he did not eat himself  chapter ix about a week after this lord elmwood went out two days for a visit consequently rushbrook was for that time master of the house the first morning he went a shooting and returning about noon enquired of sandford who was sitting in the room if he had taken up a volume of plays left upon the table  i read no such things replied sandford and quitted the room abruptly rushbrook then rung for his servant and desired him to look for the book asking him angrily who had been in the apartment for he was sure he had left it there when he went out  the servant withdrew to enquire and presently returned with the volume in his hand and miss woodleys compliments she begs your pardon sir she did not know the book was yours and hopes you will excuse the liberty she took  miss woodley cried rushbrook with surprise she comes so seldom into these apartments i did not suppose it was her who had it  take it back to her instantly with my respects and i beg she will keep it  the man went but returned with the book again and laying it on the table without speaking was going away when rushbrook hurt at receiving no second message said i am afraid sir you did very wrong in taking this book from miss woodley  it was not from her i took it sir replied the man it was from lady matilda  since he had entered the house rushbrook had never before heard her name  he was shocked  confounded more than ever  and to conceal what he felt instantly ordered the man out of the room  in the mean time miss woodley and matilda were talking over this trifling occurrence and frivolous as it was drew from it strong conclusions of rushbrooks insolence and power  in spite of her pride the daughter of lord elmwood even wept at the insult she had received on this insignificant occasion for the volume being merely taken from her at mr rushbrooks command she felt an insult and the manner in which it was done by the servant might contribute to the offense  while miss woodley and she were upon this conversation a note came from rushbrook to miss woodley wherein he entreated he might be permitted to see her  she sent a verbal answer she was engaged he sent again begging she would name her own time but certain of a second denial he followed the servant who took the last message and as miss woodley came out of her apartment into the gallery to speak to him rushbrook presented himself and told the man to retire  mr rushbrook said miss woodley this intrusion is insupportable  and destitute as you may think me of the friendship of lord elmwood   in the ardour with which rushbrook was waiting to express himself he interrupted her and caught hold of her hand  she immediately snatched it from him and withdrew into her chamber  he followed saying in a low voice dear miss woodley hear me  at that juncture lady matilda who was in an inner room came out of it into miss woodleys  perceiving a gentleman she stopped short at the door  rushbrook cast his eyes upon her and stood motionless  his lips only moved do not dep madam said he without hearing my apology for being here  though matilda had never seen him since her infancy there was no cause to tell her who it was that addressed her  his elegant and youthful person joined to the incident which had just occurred convinced her it was rushbrook and she looked at him with an air of surprise but with still more of dignity  miss woodley is severe upon me madam continued he she judges me unkindly and i am afraid she will prepossess you with the same unfavourable sentiments  still matilda did not speak but looked at him with the same air of dignity  if lady matilda resumed he i have offended you and must quit you without pardon i am more unhappy than i should be with the loss of your fathers protection  more forlorn than when an orphan boy your mother first took pity on me  at this last sentence matilda turned her eyes on miss woodley and seemed in doubt what reply she was to give  rushbrook immediately fell upon his knees  oh lady matilda cried he if you knew the sensations of my heart you would not treat me with this disdain  we can only judge of those sensations mr rushbrook said miss woodley by the effect they have upon your conduct and while you insult lord and lady elmwoods daughter by an intrusion like this and then ridicule her abect state by mockery such as the present   he flew from his knees instantly and interrupted her crying what can i do  what am i to say to make you change your opinion of me  while lord elmwood has been at home i have kept at an awful distance and though every moment i breathed was a wish to cast myself at his daughters feet yet as i feared miss woodley you were incensed against me by what means was i to procure an interview but by stratagem or force  this accident has given a third method and i had not strength i had not courage to let it pass  lord elmwood will soon return and we may both be hurried to town immediately  then how for a tedious winter could i sustain the thought that i was despised nay perhaps considered as an object of ingratitude by the only child of my deceased benefactress  matilda replied with all her fathers haughtiness depend upon it sir if you should ever enter my thoughts it will only be as an object of envy  suffer me then madam said he as an earnest you do not think worse of me than i merit suffer me to be sometimes admitted into your presence  she scarcely permitted him to finish the period before she replied this is the last time sir we shall ever meet depend upon it  unless indeed lord elmwood should delegate to you the control of me  his commands i never dispute and here she burst into a flood of tears  rushbrook walked to the window and did not speak for a short time  then turning himself to make a reply both matilda and miss woodley were somewhat surprised to see he had shed tears too  having conquered them he said i will not offend you madam by staying one moment longer and i give my honor that upon no pretense whatever will i presume to intrude here again  professions i find have no weight and only by this obedience to your orders can i give a proof of that respect which you inspire  and let the agitation i now feel convince you lady matilda that with all my seeming good fortune i am not happier than yourself  and so much was he agitated while he delivered this it was with difficulty he came to the conclusion  when he did he bowed with reverence as if he had left the presence of a deity and went away  matilda immediately entered the chamber she had come from and without casting a single look at miss woodley by which she might guess of the opinion she had formed of mr rushbrooks conduct  the next time they met they did not even mention his name for they were ashamed to own any partiality in his favor and were too just to bring any serious accusation against him  but miss woodley the day following communicated the intelligence of this visit to mr sandford who not being present and a witness of those marks of humility and respect which were conspicuous in the deportment of mr rushbrook was highly offended at his presumption and threatened if he ever dared to force his company there again he would acquaint lord elmwood with his arrogance whatever might be the event  miss woodley however assured him she believed he would have no cause for such a complaint as the young man had made the most solemn promise never to commit the like offense and she thought it her duty to enjoin sandford till he did repeat it not to mention the circumstance even to rushbrook himself  matilda could not but feel a regard toward her fathers heir in return for that which he had so fervently declared for her yet the more favorable her opinion of his mind and manners the more he became a proper object of her jealousy for the affections of lord elmwood and was now consequently an object of greater sorrow to her than when she believed him less worthy  this was the reverse on his part toward her  no jealousy intervened to bar his admiration and esteem and the beauty of her person and grandeur of her mien not only confirmed but improved the exalted idea he had formed of her previous to their meeting and which his affection to both her parents had inspired  the next time he saw his benefactor he began to feel a new esteem and regard for him for his daughters sake as he had at first an esteem for her on the foundation of his love for lord and lady elmwood  he gazed with wonder at his uncles insensibility to his own happiness and longed to lead him to the jewel he cast away though even his own expulsion should be the fatal consequence  such was the youthful warm generous grateful but unthinking mind of rushbrook  chapter x after this incident miss woodley left her own apartments less frequently than before  she was afraid though till now mistrust had been a stranger to her heart she was afraid duplicity might be concealed under the apparent friendship of rushbrook it did not indeed appear so from any part of his behavior but she was apprehensive for the fate of matilda she disliked him also and therefore she suspected him  for near three weeks she had not now paid a visit to lord elmwood and though to herself every visit was a pain yet as matilda took a delight in hearing of her father what he said what he did what his attention seemed most employed on and a thousand other circumstantial informations in the detail of which sandford would scorn to be half so particular it was a deprivation to her miss woodley did not go oftener  now too the middle of november had arrived and it was expected his lordship would shortly quit the country  partly therefore to indulge her hapless companion and partly because it was a necessary duty miss woodley paid his lordship a morning visit and staid dinner  rushbrook was officiously polite to her for that was the epithet she gave his attention in relating it to lady matilda yet she owned he had not that forward impertinence she had formerly discovered in him but appeared much more grave and sedate  but tell me of my father said matilda  i was going my dear  but dont be concerned  dont let it vex you  what what cried matilda frightened by the preface  why on my observing that i thought mr rushbrook looked paler than usual and appeared not to be in perfect health which was really the case your father expressed the greatest anxiety imaginable he said he could not bear to see him look so ill begged him with all the tenderness of a parent to take the advice of a physician and added a thousand other affectionate things  i detest mr rushbrook  said matilda with her eyes flashing indignation  nay for shame returned miss woodley do you suppose i told you this to make you hate him  no there was no occasion for that replied matilda my sentiments though i have never before avowed them were long ago formed he was always an object which added to my unhappiness but since his daring intrusion into my apartments he has been an object of my hatred  but now perhaps i may tell you something to please you cried miss woodley  and what is that said matilda with indifference for the first intelligence had hurt her spirits too much to suffer her to listen with pleasure to any other  mr rushbrook continued miss woodley replied to your father his indisposition was but a slight nervous fever and he would defer a physicians advice till he went to london  on which his lordship said and when do you expect to be there  he replied within a week or two i suppose my lord but your father answered i do not mean to go myself till after christmas  no indeed my lord said mr sandford with surprise you have not passed your christmas here continued he these many a year  no returned his lordship but i think i feel myself more attached to this house at present than ever i did in my life  you imagine then my father thought of me when he said that cried matilda eagerly  but i may be mistaken replied miss woodley  i leave you to judge  but i am sure mr sandford imagined he thought of you for i saw a smile over his whole face immediately  did you miss woodley  yes it appeared on every feature except his lips those he closed fast together for fear lord elmwood should perceive it  miss woodley with all her minute intelligence did not however acquaint matilda that rushbrook followed her to the window while his lordship was out of the room and sandford half asleep at the other end of it and inquired respectfully and anxiously for her ladyship adding it is my concern for lady matilda which makes me thus indisposed i suffer more than her but i am not permitted to tell her so nor can i hope miss woodley you will  she replied you are right sir nor did she reveal this conversation while not a sentence that passed except that was omitted  when christmas arrived lord elmwood had many convivial days at elmwood house but the name of matilda was never mentioned by one of his guests and most probably never thought of  during all those holidays she was unusually melancholy but sunk into the deepest dejection when she was told the day was fixed on which her father was to depart for the season  on the morning of that day she wept incessantly and all her consolation was she would go to the chamber window which was fronting the door he was to pass through to his carriage and for the first time and most likely for the last time of her life behold him  this design was soon forgot in another  she would rush boldly into the apartment where he was and at his feet take leave of him for ever  she would lay hold of his hands clasp his knees provoke him to spurn her which would be joy in comparison to this cruel indifference  in the bitterness of her grief she once called upon her mother and reproached her memory  but the moment she recollected the offense which was almost instantaneously she became all mildness and resignation what have i said cried she dear dear saint forgive me and behold for your sake i will bear all with patience  i will not groan i will not even sigh again  this task i set myself to atone for what i have dared to utter  while lady matilda labored under these variety of sensations miss woodley was occupied in bewailing and endeavoring to calm her sorrows  and lord elmwood with rushbrook was prepared ready to set off  his lordship however loitered and did not once seem in haste to be gone  when at last he got up to depart sandford thought he pressed his hand and shook it with more warmth than ever he had done in his life  encouraged by this supposition sandford with the tears starting in his eyes said my lord will not you condescend to take your leave of miss woodley  certainly sandford replied his lordship and seemed glad of an excuse to sit down again  impressed with the idea of the state in which she had left his only child miss woodley when she came before lord elmwood to bid him farewell was pale trembling and in tears  sandford notwithstanding his lordships apparent kind humor was shocked at the construction he must put upon her appearance and cried what miss woodley are you not recovered of your illness yet lord elmwood however took no notice of her looks but after wishing her health and happiness walked slowly out of the house turning back frequently and speaking to sandford or some other person who was behind him as if part of his thoughts were left behind and he went with reluctance  when he had quitted the room where miss woodley was rushbrook timid before her as she had been before her benefactor went up to her all humility and said miss woodley we ought to be friends our concern our devotion is paid to the same objects and one common interest should teach us to be friendly  she made no reply  will you permit me to write to you when i am away said he you may wish to hear of lord elmwoods health and of what changes may take place in his resolutions  will you permit me  at that moment a servant came and said sir my lord is in his carriage and waiting for you he hasted away and miss woodley was relieved from the pain of giving him a denial  no sooner was the chariot with all its attendants out of sight than lady matilda was conducted by miss woodley from her lonely retreat into that part of the house from whence her father had just departed  and she visited every spot where he had so long resided with a pleasing curiosity that for a while diverted her grief  in the breakfast and dining rooms she leaned over those seats with a kind of filial piety on which she was told he had been accustomed to sit and in the library she took up with filial delight the pen with which he had been writing and looked with the most curious attention into those books that were laid upon his reading desk  but a hat lying on one of the tables gave her a sensation beyond any other she experienced on thi occasion  in that trifling article of his dress she thought she saw he himself and held it in her hand with pious reverence  in the mean time lord elmwood and rushbrook were proceeding on their road with hearts not less heavy than those which they had left at elmwood house though neither of them could so well as matilda tell the cause of the weight  chapter xi young as lady matilda was during the life of her mother neither her youth nor the recluse state in which she lived had precluded her from the notice and solicitations of a nobleman who had professed himself her lover viscount margrave had an estate not far distant from the retreat lady elmwood had chosen and being devoted to the sports of the country he seldom quitted it for any of those joys which the town offered  he was a young man of a handsome person and was what his neighbors styled a man of spirit  he was an excellent foxhunter and as excellent a companion over his bottle at the end of the chase  he was prodigal of his fortune in all cases where his pleasures were concerned and as those pleasures were mostly social his sporting companions and his mistresses for these were also of the plural number partook largely of his wealth  two months previous to lady elmwoods death miss woodley and lady matilda were taking their usual walk in some fields and lanes near to their house when chance threw lord margrave in their way during a thunder storm in which they were suddenly caught and he had the satisfaction to convey his new acquaintances to their home in his carriage safe from the fury of the elements  grateful for the service his lordship had rendered them miss woodley and her charge permitted him to enquire occasionally of their healths and would somesee him  the story of lady elmwood was known to lord margrave and as he beheld her daughter with a passion such as he had been unused to overcome he indulged it with the probable hope that on the death of the mother lord elmwood would receive his child and perhaps accept him as his soninlaw  wedlock was not the plan which lord margrave had ever proposed to himself for happiness but the excess of his love on this new occasion subdued every resolution he had taken against the marriage state and not daring to hope for the consummation of his wishes by any other means he suffered himself to look forward to that as his only resource  no sooner was the longexpected death of lady elmwood arrived than his lordship waited with impatience to hear lady matilda was sent for and acknowledged by her father for he meant to be the first to lay before lord elmwood his pretensions as a suitor  but those pretensions were founded on the vague hopes of a lover only and miss woodley to whom he first declared them said every thing possible to convince him of their falaciousness  as to the object of his passion she was not only insensible but totally inattentive to all that was said to her on the subject  lady elmwood died without ever being disturbed with it for her daughter did not even remember his proposals so as to repeat them again and miss woodley thought it prudent to conceal from her friend every new incident which might give her cause for fresh anxieties  when sandford and the ladies left the north and came to elmwood house so much were their thoughts employed with other ideas lord margrave did not occupy a place and during the whole time they had been at their new abode they had never once heard of him  he had nevertheless his whole mind fixed upon lady matilda and placed spies in the neighborhood to inform him of every circumstance in her situation  having imbibed an aversion to matrimony he heard with but little regret that there was no prospect of her ever becoming her fathers heir while such an information gave him the hope of obtaining her upon the illegal terms of a mistress  lord elmwoods departure to town forwarded this hope and flattering himself that the humiliating situation in which matilda must feel herself in the house of her father might gladly induce her to take shelter under any other protection he boldly advanced as soon as the earl was gone to make such overtures as his wishes and his vanity told him could not be rejected  inquiring for miss woodley he easily gained admittance but at the sight of so much modesty and dignity in the person of matilda so much good will and yet such circumspection in her companion and the good sense and proper spirit which were always apparent in the manners of sandford his lordship fell once more into the despondency of becoming to lady matilda nothing more important to his reputation than a husband  even that humble hope was however sometimes denied him while sandford set forth the impropriety of troubling lord elmwood on such a subject at present and while the viscounts penetration small as it was discovered in his fair one much more to discourage than to favor his wishes  plunged however too deep in his passion to emerge from it in haste he meant still to visit and wait for a change to happier circumstances when he was peremptorily desired by mr sandford to desist from ever coming again  wherefore mr sandford cried his lordship  for two reasons my lord  in the first place your visits might be displeasing to lord elmwood  in the next place i know they are so to his daughter  unaccustomed to be spoken to so plainly particularly in a case where his heart was interested his lordship nevertheless submitted with patience but in his own mind determined how long this patience should continue  no longer than it served as the means to prove his obedience and by that artifice secure his better reception at some future period  on his return home cheered with the huzzas of his jovial companions he began to consult those friends what scheme was best to be adopted for the accomplishment of his desires  some boldly advised application to the father in defiance to the old priest but that was the very last method his lordship himself approved as marriage must inevitably have followed lord elmwoods consent besides though a peer lord margrave was unused to rank with peers and even the necessary formality of an interview with one of his equals carried along with it a terror or at least a fatigue to a rustic baron  others of his companions advised seduction but happily his lordship possessed no arts of this kind to affect a heart appendant to such a mind as matildas  there were not wanting among his most favorite counselors some who painted the triumph and gratification of force those assured him there was nothing to apprehend under this head as from the behavior of lord elmwood to his child it was more than probable he would be utterly indifferent to any violence that might be offered her  this last advice seemed inspired by the aid of wine and no sooner had the wine freely circulated than this was always the scheme which appeared by far the best  while lord margrave alternately cherished his hopes and his fears in the country rushbrook in town gave way to his fears only  every day of his life made him more acquainted with the firm unshaken temper of lord elmwood and every day whispered more forcibly to his own heart that pity gratitude and friendship strong and affectionate as these passions are are weak and cold to that which had gained the possession of him  he doubted but he did not long doubt that which he felt was love  and yet said he to himself it is love of that kind which arising from causes independent of the object itself can scarcely deserve this sacred title  did i not love lady matilda before i beheld her  for her mothers sake i loved her  and even for her fathers  should i have felt the same affection for her had she been the child of other parents  no or should i have felt that sympathetic tenderness which now preys upon my health had not her misfortunes excited it  no  yet the love which is the result of gratitude and pity only he thought had little claim to rank with his and after the most deliberate and deep reflection he concluded with this decisive opinion  he had loved lady matilda in whatever state in whatever circumstances and that the tenderness he felt toward her and the anxiety for her happiness before he knew her extreme as they were were yet cool and dispassionate sensations compared to that which her person and demeanor had incited  and though he acknowledged that by those preceding sentiments his heart was softened prepared and molded as it were to receive this last impression yet the violence of his passion told him genuine love if not the basis on which it was founded had been the certain consequence  with a strict scrutiny into his heart he sought this knowledge but arrived at it with a regret that amounted to despair  to shield him from despondency he formed in his mind a thousand projects depicting the joys of his union with lady matilda but her fathers implacability stood foremost and confounded them all  his lordship was a man who made but few resolutions  those were the effect of deliberation and as he was not the least capricious or inconstant in his temper they were resolutions which no probable event could shake  love that produces wonders that seduces and subdues the most determined and rigid spirits had in two instances overcome the inflexibility of lord elmwood he married lady elmwood contrary to his determination because he loved and for the sake of this beloved object he had contrary to his resolution taken under his immediate care young rushbrook but the magic which once enchanted away this spirit of immutability was no more  lady elmwood was no more and the charm was broken  as miss woodley was deprived the opportunity of desiring rushbrook not to write when he asked her the permission he passed one whole morning in the gratification of forming and writing a letter to her which he thought might possibly be shown to matilda  as he durst not touch upon any of those circumstances in which he was the most interested that joined to the respect he wished to pay the lady to whom he wrote limited his letter to about twenty lines yet the studious manner with which these lines were dictated the hope and fear they might or might not be seen and regarded by lady matilda rendered the task an anxiety so pleasing he could have wished it to have lasted for a year and in all this magnifying of trifles was discoverable the neverfailing symptom of ardent love  a reply to this formal address was a reward he wished for with impatience but he wished in vain and in the midst of his chagrin at the disappointment a sorrow little thought of occurred and gave him a perturbation of mind he had never before experienced  lord elmwood proposed a wife to him and in a way so assured of his acquiescence that if rushbrooks life had depended upon his daring to dispute his benefactors will he would not have had the courage to have done so there was however in his reply and his embarrassment something which his lordship discerned from a free concurrence and looking steadfastly at him he said in that stern manner which he now almost constantly adopted  you have no engagements i suppose have made no previous promises  none on earth my lord replied rushbrook heartily  nor have you disposed of your heart  no my lord replid he but not heartily  nor with the appearance of candor for though he spoke hastily it was rather like a man frightened than assured  he hurried to tell the falsehood he thought himself obliged to tell that the pain and shame might be over but there rushbrook was deceived the lie once told was as troublesome as in the conception and added to his first conconfusion an increasing one  lord elmwood now fixed his eyes upon him with a sullen contempt and rising from his seat said rushbrook if you have been so inconsiderate as to give away your heart tell me so at once and tell me the object  rushbrook shuddered at the thought  i here continued his lordship tolerate the first untruth you ever told me as the false assertion of a lover and give you an opportunity to recall it  but after this moment it is a lie between man and man  a lie to your friend and father and i will not forgive it  rushbrook stood silent confused alarmed and bewildered in his thoughts  his lordship resumed  name the person if there is any such on whom you have bestowed your heart and though i do not give you the smallest hope i shall not censure your folly i will at least not reproach you for having at first denied it  to repeat these words in writing the reader must condemn the young man that he could hesitate to own he loved if he was even afraid to name the object of his passion but his lordship in his question had made the two answers inseparable and all evasions of the second rushbrook knew would be fruitless after having avowed the first  and how could he confess the latter the absolute orders he received from the steward on his first return from his travels were never to mention his daughter any more than his late wife before lord elmwood  the fault of having rudely intruded into lady matildas presence rushed too upon his mind for he did not even dare to say by what means he had beheld her  but more than all the threatening manner in which his lordship uttered this rational and seeming conciliating speech the menaces the severity which sat upon his countenance while he delivered those moderate words might have intimidated a man wholly independent and less used to fear him than his nephew had been  you make no answer sir said his lordship after waiting a few moments for his reply  i have only to say my lord returned rushbrook that although my heart may be totally disengaged i may yet be disinclined to the prospect of marriage  may may your heart may be disengaged repeated his lordship do you dare to reply to me equivocally when i have asked a positive answer  perhaps i am not positive myself my lord but i will inquire the state of my mind and make you acquainted with it very soon  as the angry demeanor of his uncle affected rushbrook with fear so that fear powerfully but with proper manliness expressed again softened the displeasure of lord elmwood and seeing and pitying his nephews sensibilit e now changed his austere voice and  mildly but firmly  i give you a week to consut  yourself at the expiration of that ti i shall talk with you again and i command you to be then prepared to speak not only without deceit but without hesitation he left the room at these words and left rushbrook released from a fate which his apprehensions had beheld depending that moment  he had now a week to call his thoughts together to weigh every circumstance and to determine whether implicitly to submit to his lordships recommendation for a wise or revolt from it and see some other more subservient to his will appointed his heir  undetermined how to act upon this great trial which was to decide his future destiny rushbrook suffered so poignant an uncertainty that he became at length ill and before the end of the week which his uncle had allotted him for his reply he was confined to his bed in a high fever  his lordship was extremely affected at his indisposition he gave him every care he could bestow and even a great deal of his personal attendance  this last favor had a claim upon the young mans gratitude superior to every other obligation which since his infancy his benefactor had conserred and he was at times so moved by those marks of kindness he received from lord elmwood he would form the intention of tearing from his heart every trace lady matilda had left there and as soon as his health permitted him obey to the utmost of his views every wish his uncle had conceived  yet again matildas pitiable situation presented itself to his compassion and her beauteous person to his love  divided between the claims of obligation to the father and tender attachment to the daughter his sickness was increased by the tortures of his mind and he once sincerely wished for that death of which he was in danger to free him from the dilemma into which his affections had involved him  at the time his illness was at its height and he lay complaining of the violence of his fever lord elmwood taking his hand asked him if there was any thing he could do for him  yes yes my lord a great deal he replied eagerly  what is it harry asked his lordship kindly  oh my lord replied he that is what i must not tell you  defer it then till you are well said his lordship fearful of being surprised or affected by the state of his health into any promises which he might hereafter find the impropriety of granting  and when i recover my lord you give me leave to reveal to you that which i wish you to comply with let it be what it will  his lordship hesitated  but seeing an anxiety for the answer by his raising himself upon his elbow in the bed and staring wildly lord elmwood at last said certainly  yes yes as a child is answered for its quiet  that lord elmwood could have no idea what was the real petition which rushbrook meant to present him is certain but it is certain he expected he had some request to make with which it might be wrong for him to comply and therefore he avoided hearing what it was for great as his compassion for him in his present state it was not of force to urge him to give a promise he did not mean to perform  rushbrook on his part was pleased with the assurance he might speak when he was restored to health but no sooner was his fever abated and his senses perfectly recovered from the slight derangement his malady had caused than the lively remembrance of what he had hinted alarmed him and he was even afraid to look his kind but awful relation in the face  lord elmwoods cheerfulness however on his returning health and his undiminished attention soon convinced him he had nothing to fear  but alas he found too he had nothing to hope  as his health reestablished his wishes reestablished also and with his wishes his despair  convinced now that his nephew had something on his mind which he feared to reveal his lordship no longer doubted but some youthful attachment had armed his heart against any marriage he should propose but he had so much pity for his present weak state to delay that farther inquiry which he had threatened before his sickness to a time when he should be wholly restored  it was the end of may before rushbrook was able to be present and partake in the usual routine of the day  the country was now prescribed him as the means of entire restoration and as lord elmwood designed to leave london some time in june he advised him to go to elmwood house a week or two before him  this advice was received with delight and a letter was sent to mr sandford to prepare for mr rushbrooks arrival  chapter xii during the illness of rushbrook news had been sent of his danger from the servants in town to those at elmwood house and lady matilda expressed compassion when she was told of it  she began to conceive the instant she thought he would soon die that his visit to her had some merit rather than impertinence in its design and that he might possibly be a more deserving man than she had supposed him to be even sandford and miss woodley began to recollect qualifications he possessed which they never had reflected on before and miss woodley in particular reproached herself that she had been so severe and inattentive to him  notwithstanding the prospects his death pointed out to her it was with infinite joy she heard he was recovered nor was sandford less satisfied for he had treated the young man too unkindly not to dread lest any ill should befall him  but although he was glad to hear of his restored health when he was informed he was coming down to elmwood house for a few weeks in the style of its master sandford with all his religious and humane principles could not help thinking that provided the lad had been properly prepared he had been as well out of the world as in it  he was still less his friend when he saw him arrive with his usual florid appearance had he come pale and sickly sandford had been kind to him but in apparent good health and spirits he could not form his mouth to tell him he was glad to see him  on his arrival matilda who for five months had been at large secluded herself as she would have done upon the arrival of lord elmwood but with far different sensations  notwithstanding her restriction on the latter occasion the residence of her father in that house had been a source of pleasure rather than of sorrow to her but from the abode of rushbrook she derived punishment alone  when from inquiries made to his own servant who inquired again rushbrook found that on his approach matilda had retired to her own confined apartments the thought was torture to him it was the hope of seeing and conversing with her of being admitted at all times to her society as the mistress of the house that had raised his spirits and effected his perfect cure beyond any other cause and he was hurt to the greatest degree at this respect or rather contempt shown to him by her retreat  it was nevertheless a subject too delicate to touch upon in any one sense  an invitation for her company on his part might carry the appearance of superior authority and an affected condescension which he justly considered as the worst of all insults  and yet how could he support the idea that his visit had placed the daughter of his benefactor as a dependant stranger in that house where in reality he was the dependant and she the lawful heir  for two or three days he suffered the torments of these reflections hoping to come to an explanation of all he felt by a fortunate meeting with miss woodley but when that meeting occurred although he observed she talked to him with less reserve than she had formerly done and even gave some proofs of the goodness of her disposition yet she scrupulously avoided naming lady matilda and when he diffidently enquired of her ladyships health a cold restraint spread over miss woodleys face and she left him instantly  to sandford it was still more difficult to apply for though they were frequently together they were never sociable and as sandford seldom disguised his feelings to rushbrook he was always extremley severe and sometimes unmannerly  in this perplexed situation the country air was rather of detriment than service to the invalid and had he not like a true lover held fast to hope while he could perceive nothing but despair he had returned to town rather than by his stay placed in a subordinate state the object of his adoration  but still persisting in his hopes he one morning met miss woodley in the garden and engaging her a longer time than usual in conversation at last obtained her promise she would that day dine with him and mr sandford  but no sooner had she parted from him than she repented of her consent and upon communicating it to matilda that young lady for the first time in her life darted upon her kind companion a look of the most cutting reproach and haughty resentment  miss woodleys own sentiments had upbraided her before but she was not prepared to receive so pointed a mark of disapprobation from her young friend till now duteous and humble to her as to a mother and not less affectionate her heart was too susceptible to bear this disrespectful and contumelious frown from the object of her longdevoted care and concern the tears instantly covered her face and she laid her hands upon her heart as if she thought it would break  matilda was moved but she possessed too much of the manly resentment of her father to discover what she felt for the first few minutes  miss woodley who had given so many tears to her sorrows but never till now one to her anger had a still deeper sense of this indifference than of the anger itself and to conceal what she suffered left the room  matilda who had been till this time working at her needle seemingly composed now let her work drop from her hand and sat for a little while in a deep reverie  at length she rose up and followed miss woodley to the other apartment  she entered grave majestical and apparently serene while her poor heart fluttered with a thousand distressing sensations  she approached miss woodley who was still in tears with a sullen silence and awed by her manners the faithful friend of her deceased mother exclaimed dear lady matilda think no more on what i have done  do not resent it any longer and on my knees i will beg your pardon miss woodley rose as she uttered these last words but matilda laid fast hold of her to prevent the posture she offered to take and instantly assumed it herself oh let this be my atonement she cried with the most earnest supplication  they interchanged forgiveness and as this reconciliation was sincere they each without reserve gave their opinion upon the subject that had caused the misunderstanding and it was agreed that an apology should be sent to mr rushbrook that miss woodley had been suddenly indisposed nor could this be said to differ from the truth for since what had passed she was unfit to pay a visit  rushbrook who had been all the morning elated with the advance he supposed he had made in that ladys favor was highly disappointed vexed and angry when this apology was delivered to him nor did he nor perhaps could he conceal what he felt although his severe observer mr sandford was present  i am a very unfortunate man said he as soon as the servant was gone who brought the message  sandford cast his eyes upon him with a look of surprise and contempt  a very unfortunate man indeed mr sandford repeated he although you treat my complaint contemptuously  sandford made no reply and seemed above making one  they sat down to dinner  rushbrook eat scarce any thing but drank frequently sandford took no notice of either but had a book which was his custom when he dined with persons whose conversation was not interesting to him laid by the side of his plate which he occasionally looked into as the dishes were removing or other opportunities served  rushbrook just now more hopeless than ever of forming an acquaintance with lady matilda began to give way to the symptoms of despair and they made their first attack by urging him to treat on the same level of familiarity that he himself was treated mr sandford to whom he had till now ever behaved with the most profound tokens of respect  come said he to him as soon as the dinner was removed lay aside your book and be good company  sandford lifted up his eyes upon him  stared in his face  and cast them on the book again  i say continued rushbrook i want a companion and as miss woodley has disappointed me i must have your company  sandford now laid down his book upon the table but still holding his fingers in the pages he was reading said and why are you disappointed of miss woodleys company  when people expect what they have no right to hope for they have yet the assurance to complain they are disappointed  i had a right to expect she would come answered rushbrook for she promised she would  but what right had you to ask her  the right every one has to make his time pass as agreeably as he can  but not at the expense of another  i believe mr sandford it would be a heavy expense to you to see me happy i believe it would cost you even your own happiness  that is a price i have not now to give replied sandford and he began reading again  what you have already paid it away no wonder that at your time of life it should be gone  but what do you think of my having already squandered mine  i dont think about you returned sandford without taking his eyes from the book  can you look me in the face and say that mr sandford  no you cannot  for you know you do think of me and you know you hate me  here he drank two glasses of wine one after another and i can tell you why you hate me continued he it is from a cause for which i often hate myself  sandford read on  it is on lady matildas account you hate me and use me thus  sandford put down his book hastily and put both his hands by his side  yes resumed rushbrook you think i am wronging her  i think you grossly insult her exclaimed sandford by this rude mention of her name and i command you at your peril to desist  at my peril mr sandford do you assume the authority of lord elmwood  i do on this occasion and if you dare to give your tongue a freedom   rushbrook interrupted him  why then i boldly say and as her friend you ought rather to applaud than resent it i boldly say my heart suffers so much for her situation i am regardless of my own  i love her father  i loved her mother more  but she herself beyond either  hold your licentious tongue cried sandford or quit the room  licentious oh the pure thoughts that dwell in her innocent mind are not less sensual than mine toward her  do you upbraid me with my respect my pity for her they are the sensations which impel me to speak thus undisguised even to you my open  no even worse  my secret enemy  insult me as you please mr rushbrook  but beware how you mention lord elmwoods daughter  can it be to her dishonor that i pity her that i would quit the house this moment never to return so she supplied the place i withhold from her  go then cried sandford  it would be of no use to her or i would  but come mr sandford i will dare do as much as you  only second me and i will entreat lord elmwood to be reconciled  to see and own her  your vanity would be equal to your rashness  you entreat  she must greatly esteem those parental favors which your entreaties gained her  do you forget young man how short a time it is since you were entreated for  i prove i do not while this anxiety for lady matilda arises from what i feel on that account  remove your anxiety then from her to yourself for were i to let lord elmwood know what has passed now   it is for your own sake not for mine if you dont  you shall not dare me to it mr rushbrook  and he rose from his seat you shall not dare me to do you an injury  but to avoid the temptation i will never again come into your company unless my friend lord elmwood is present to protect me and his child from your insults  rushbrook rose in yet more warmth than sandford have you the injustice to say i have insulted lady matilda  to speak of her at all is in you an insult  but you have done more  you have dared to visit her  to force into her presence and shock her with your offers of services which she scorns and of your compassion which she is far above  did she complain to you  she or her friend did  i rather suppose mr sandford you have bribed some of the servants to reveal this  the suspicion becomes lord elmwoods heir  it becomes the man who lives in a house with you  i thank you mr rushbrook for what has passed this day  it has taken a weight off my mind  i thought my disinclination to you might perhaps arise from prejudice  this conversation has relieved me from those fears and i thank you  saying this he calmly walked out of the room and left rushbrook to reflect on what he had been doing  heated with the wine he had drank and which sandford engaged on his book had not observed no sooner was he alone than he became at once cool and repentant  what had he done was the first question to himself  he had offended sandford  the man whom reason as well as prudence had ever taught him to treat with respect and even reverence  he had grossly offended the firm friend of lady matilda and even by the unreserved the wanton use of her name  all the retorts he had uttered came now to his memory with a total forgetfulness of all sandford had said to provoke them  he once thought to follow him and beg his pardon but the contempt with which he had been treated more than all the anger withheld him  as he sat forming plans how to retrieve the opinion ill as it was which sandford formerly entertained of him he received a letter from lord elmwood kindly enquiring after his health and saying he should be down early in the following week  never were the friendly expressions of his lordship half so welcome to him for they served to sooth his imagination racked with sandfords wrath and his own displeasure  chapter xiii when sandford acted deliberately he always acted up to his duty it was his duty to forgive rushbrook and he did so  but he had declared he would never be again in his company unless lord elmwood was present  and with all his forgiveness he found an unforgiving gratification in the duty of being obliged to keep his word  the next day rushbrook dined alone while sandford gave his company to the ladies  rushbrook was too proud to seek to sandford with abject concessions but he endeavored to meet him as by accident and try what in such a case a submissive apology might effect  for a day or two all the schemes he formed on that head proved fruitless he could never procure even a sight of him  but on the evening of the third day taking a lonely walk he turned the corner of a grove and saw in the very path he was going sandford accompanied by miss woodley and what agitated him much more lady matilda was with them  he knew not whether to proceed or to quit the path and palpably shun them  to one who seemed to put an unkind construction upon all he said and did he knew to do either would be to do wrong  in spite of the propensity he felt to pass so near to lady matilda could he have known what conduct would have been deemed the most respectful whatever painful denial it had cost him that he would have adopted  but undetermined whether to go forward or to cross to another path he still walked on till he came too nigh to recede he then with a diffidence not affected but felt in the most powerful degree pulled of his hat and without bowing stood silently while the company passed  sandford walked on some paces before and took no farther notice as he went by him than just touching the fore part of his hat with his finger  miss woodley curtsied as she followed  but lady matilda made a full stop and said in the gentlest accents i hope mr rushbrook you are perfectly recovered  it was the sweetest music he ever listened to and he returned with the most respectful bow i am better a great deal maam and pursued his way as if he did not dare to utter another syllable  sandford seldom found fault with lady matilda not because he loved her but because she seldom did wrong  upon this occasion however he was half inclined to reprimand her but yet he did not know what to say  the subsequent humility of rushbrook had taken from the indiscretion of her speaking to him and the event could by no means justify his censure  on hearing her begin to speak sandford had stopped and as rushbrook after replying walked away sandford called to her crossly come come along but at the same time he put out his elbow for her to take hold of his arm  she hastened her steps and did so  then turning to miss woodley she said i expected you would have spoken to mr rushbrook it might have prevented me  miss woodley replied i was at a loss what to do  when we met formerly he always spoke first  and ought now cried sandford angrily  and then added with a sarcastic smile it is certainly the duty of the superior to be the first who speaks  he did not look as if he thought himself our superior replied matilda  no returned sandford some people can put on what looks they please  then while he looks so pale replied matilda and so dejected i can never forbear speaking to him when we meet whatever he may think of it  and were he and i to meet a hundred nay a thousand times replied sandford i dont think i shall ever speak to him again  bless me what for mr sandford cried matilda  for sandford who was not a man that repeated little incidents had never mentioned the circumstance of their quarrel  i have taken such a resolution  answered he yet i bear him no enmity  as this short reply indicated he meant to say no more no more was asked and the subject dropped  in the mean time rushbrook happier than he had been for months intoxicated with joy at that voluntary mark of civilty he had received from lady matilda felt his heart so joyous so free from every particle of malice that he resolved in the humblest manner to make atonement for the breach of decorum he had lately been guilty of to mr sandford  too happy at this time to suffer a mortification from any treatment he might receive he sent his servant to him into his study as soon as he was returned home to beg to know if he might be permitted to wait upon him with a message he had to deliver from lord elmwood  the servant returned  mr sandford desired he would send the message by him or the house steward this was highly affronting but rushbrook was not in a humor to be offended and he sent again begging he would admit him  but the answer was he was busy  thus defeated in his hopes of reconciliation his new transports felt an allay and the few days that remained before lord elmwood came he passed in solitary musing and ineffectual walks and looks toward that path where he had met matilda  she came that way no more  nor indeed scarce quitted her apartment in the practice of that confinement she had to experience on the arrival of her father  all her former agitations now returned  on the day he arrived she wept  all the night she did not sleep  and the name of rushbrook again became hateful to her  his lordship came in extreme good health and spirits but appeared concerned to find rushbrook less well than when he went from town  sandford was now under the necessity of being in rushbrooks company yet he took care never to speak to him but when he was obliged or to look at him but when he could not help it  lord elmwood observed this conduct yet he neither wondered or was offended at it  he had always perceived what little esteem sandford showed his nephew from his first return but he forgave in sandfords humor a thousand faults he would forgive in no other nor did he deem this one of his greatest faults knowing the claim to his partiality from another object  miss woodley waited on lord elmwood as formerly dined with him and as heretofore related to the attentive matilda all that passed  about this time lord margrave deprived by the season of all the sports of the field felt his love for matilda which had been extreme while divided with the love of hunting too violent to be subdued and he resolved though reluctantly to apply to her father for his consent to their union  but writing to sandford this resolution he was once more repulsed and charged as a man of honor to forbear to disturb the tranquillity of the family by any application of the kind  to this sandford received no answer for his lordship highly incensed at his mistresss repugnance to him determined more firmly than ever to consult his own happiness alone and as that depended merely upon his obtaining her he cared not by what method it was effected  about a fortnight after lord elmwood came into the country as he was riding one morning his horse fell with him and crushed his leg in so unfortunate a manner as to be pronounced of dangerous consequence  he was brought home in a post chaise and matilda heard of the accident with more grief than would on such an occasion appertain to the most fondled child  in consequence of the pain he suffered his fever was one night very high and sandford who seldom quitted his apartment went frequently to his bed side every time with the secret hope he should hear him ask to see his daughter  he was every time disappointed  yet he saw him shake with a cordial friendship the hand of rushbrook as if he delighted in seeing those he loved  the danger in which lord elmwood was supposed to be was but of short duration and his sudden recovery succeeded  matida who had wept moaned and watched during the crisis of his illness when she heard he was amending exclaimed with a kind of surprise at the novelty of the sensation and this is joy that i feel  oh i never till now knew what those persons felt that experienced joy  nor did she repine like mr sandford and miss woodley at her fathers inattention to her during his malady for she did not hope like them  she did not hope he would behold her even in dying  but notwithstanding his lordships seeming indifference while his indisposition continued no sooner was he recovered so as to receive the congratulations of his friends than there was no one person he evidently showed so much satisfaction at seeing as miss woodley  she waited upon him timorously and with more than ordinary distaste at his late conduct when he put out his hand with the utmost warmth to receive her drew her to him saluted her an honor he had never in his life conferred before and all with signs of the sincerest friendship and affection  sandford was present and ever associating the idea of matilda with miss woodley felt his heart bound with a triumph it had not enjoyed for many a day  matilda listened with delight to the recital miss woodley gave on her return and many times while it lasted exclaimed she was happy but poor matildas sudden transports of joy which she termed happiness were not made for long continuance and if she ever found cause for gladness she far oftener had motives for grief  as mr sandford was sitting with her and miss woodley one evening about a week after a person rung at the bell and enquired for him on being told of it by the servant he went to the door of the apartment and cried oh is it you come in  an elderly man entered who had been for many years the head gardener at elmwood house a man of honesty and sobriety and with a large indigent family of aged parents children and other relatives who subsisted wholly on the income arising from his place  the ladies as well as sandford know him well and they all almost at once asked what was the matter for his looks told them something distressful had befallen him  oh sir said he to sandford i come to entreat your interest  in what edwards said sandford with a mild voice for when his assistance was supplicated in distress his rough tones always took a plaintive key  my lord has discharged me from his service  returned edwards trembling and the tears starting in his eyes i am undone mr sandford unless you plead for me  i will said sandford i will  and yet i am almost afraid of your success replied the man for my lord has ordered me out of his house this moment and though i knelt down to him to be heard he had no pity  matilda sighed from the bottom of her heart and yet she envied this poor man who had been kneeling to her father  what was your offense cried sandford  the man hesitated then looking at matilda said i will tell you sir some other time  did you name me before lord elmwood cried she eagerly and terrified  no madam replied he but i unthinkingly spoke of my poor lady that is dead and gone  matilda burst into tears  how came you to do so mad a thing cried sandford with the encouragement his looks had once given him now fled from his face  it was unthinkingly repeated edwards i was showing my lord some plans for the new walks and told him among other things that her ladyship had many years ago approved of them  who cried he  still i did not call to mind but repeated lady elmwood sir while you were abroad  as soon as these words were delivered i saw my doom in his looks and he commanded me to quit his house and service that instant  i am afraid said sandford sitting down i can do nothing for you  yes sir you know you have more power over my lord than any body  and perhaps you may be able to save me and all mine from misery  i would if i could replied sandford quickly  you can but try sir  matilda was all this while drowned in tears nor miss woodley much less affected  lady elmwood was before their eyes  matilda beheld her in her dying moments miss woodley saw her as the gay ward of dorriforth  ask mr rushbrook said sandford prevail on him to speak he has more power than i have  he has not enough then replied edwards for he was in the room with my lord when what i have told you happened  and did he say nothing asked sandford  yes sir he offered to speak in my behalf but my lord interrupted him and ordered him out of the room  he instantly went  sandford now observing the effect which this narration had on the two ladies led the man to his own apartments and there assured him he durst not undertake his cause but that if time or chance should happily make an alteration in his lordships diposition he would be the first to try to replace him  edwards was obliged to submit and before the next day at noon his pleasant house by the side of the park his garden and his orchard which he had occupied above twenty years were cleared of their old inhabitant and all his wretched family  chapter xiv this melancholy incident perhaps affected matilda and all the friends of the deceased lady elmwood beyond any other that had occurred since her death  a few days after this circumstance miss woodley in order to divert the disconsolate mind of lady matilda and perhaps bring her some little anecdotes to console her for that which had given her so much pain waited upon lord elmwood in his library and borrowed some books out of it  he was now perfectly well from his fall and received her with the same politeness as usual but of course not with that particular warmth he had received her just after his illness  rushbrook was in the library at the same time he showed to her several beautiful prints which his lordship had just received from london and appeared anxious to entertain and give tokens of his esteem and respect for her  but what gave her pleasure beyond any other attention was that after she had taken by the aid of rushbrook about a dozen volumes from different shelves and had laid them together saying she would send her servant to fetch them lord elmwood went eagerly to the place where they were and taking up each book examined attentively what it was  one author he complained was too light another too depressing and put them on the shelves again another was erroneous and he changed it for a better and thus he warned her against some and selected other authors as the most cautious preceptor culls for his pupil or a fond father for his darling child  she thanked him for his attention to her but her heart thanked him for his attention to his daughter  for as she herself had never received such a proof of his care since all their long acquaintance she reasonably supposed matildas reading and not hers was the object of his solicitude  having in these books store of comfort for poor matilda she eagerly returned with them and in reciting every particular circumstance made her consider the volumes almost like presents from her father  the month of september was now arrived and lord elmwood accompanied by rushbrook went to a small shooting seat about twenty miles distant from elmwood castle for a weeks particular sport  matilda was once more at large and one beautiful forenoon about eleven oclock seeing miss woodley walking on the lawn before the house she hastily took her hat to join her and not waiting to put it on went nimbly down the great staircase with it hanging on her arm  when she had descended a few stairs she heard a footstep walking slowly up and from what emotion she could not tell she stopped short half resolved to return back  she hesitated a single instant which to do  then went a few steps farther till she came to the second landing place when by the sudden winding of the staircase  lord elmwood was immediately before her  she had felt something like affright before she saw him  but her reason told her she had nothing to fear as he was far away  but now the appearance of a stranger whom she had never before seen an air of authority in his looks as well as in the sound of his steps a resemblance to the portrait she had seen of him a start of astonishment which he gave on beholding her but above all  her fears confirmed her it was him  she gave a scream of terror  put out her trembling hands to catch the balustrades on the stairs for support  missed them  and fell motionless into her fathers arms  he caught her as by that impulse he would have caught any other person falling for want of aid  yet when he found her in his arms he still held her there  gazed on her attentively  and once pressed her to his bosom  at length trying to escape the snare into which he had been led he was going to leave her on the spot where she fell when her eyes opened and she uttered save me  her voice unmanned him  his longrestrained tears now burst forth  and seeing her relapsing into the swoon again he cried out eagerly to recall her  her name did not however come to his recollection  nor any name but this  miss milner  dear miss milner  that sound did not awake her and now again he wished to leave her in this senseless state that not remembering what had passed she might escape the punishment  but at this instant giffard with another servant passed by the foot of the stairs on which lord elmwood called to them  and into giffards hands delivered his apparently dead child without one command respecting her or one word of any kind while his face was agitated with shame with pity with anger with paternal tenderness  as giffard stood trembling while he relieved his lord from this hapless burden his lordship had to unloose her hand from the side of his coat which she had caught fast hold of as she fell and grasped so closely it was with difficulty released  on taking the hand away his lordship trembled  faltered  then bade giffard do it  who i my lord i separate you cried he  but recollecting himself my lord i will obey your commands whatever they are and seizing her hand pulled it with violence  it fell  and her father went away  matilda was carried to her own apartments laid upon the bed and miss woodley called to attend her after listening to the recital of what had passed  when lady elmwoods old and affectionate friend entered the room and saw her youthful charge lying pale and speechless yet no father by to comfort or sooth her she lifted up her hands to heaven exclaiming with a flood of tears and is this the end of thee my poor child  is this the end of all our hopes  of thy own fearful hopes  and of thy mothers supplications  oh lord elmwood lord elmwood  at that name matilda started and cried where is he  is it a dream or have i seen him  it is all a dream my dear said miss woodley  and yet i thought he held me in his arms she replied  i thought i felt his hands press mine  let me sleep and dream it again  now thinking it best to undeceive her it is no dream my dear returned miss woodley  is it not cried she starting up and leaning on her elbow  then i suppose i must go away  go for ever away   sandford now entered  having been told the news he came to condole  but at the sight of him matilda was terrified and cried do not reproach me do not upbraid me  i know i have done wrong  i know i had but one command from my father and that i have disobeyed  sandford could not reproach her for he could not speak  he therefore only walked to the window and concealed his tears  that whole day and night was passed in sympathetic grief in alarm at every sound lest it should be a messenger to pronounce matildas destiny  lord elmwood did not stay upon this visit above three hours at elmwood house he then set off again for the seat he had left where rushbrook still remained and from whence his lordship had merely come by accident to look over some writings he wanted dispatched to town  during his short continuance here sandford cautiously avoided his presence for he thought in a case like this what nature would not of herself do no art no arguments of his could effect  and to nature and to providence he left the whole  what these two powerful principles brought about the reader must judge on perusing the following letter received early the next morning by miss woodley  end of the third volume errata page    line   after lord elmwood insert here          for depending read impending         for majestical read majestic         for that read which         for they read these
