dearest friend it is a very surprising and a cruel thing that you will not suppose me to have been out of order after such a neglect of writing as can hardly be excused on any other score i cannot indeed lay claim to what the doctors call an acute disease but dizziness of head and depression of spirits are at best no trivial maladies and great discouragements to writing there is a lethargic state of mind that deserves your pity not your anger though it may require the hellebore of sharp reproof why then did you not apply this pungent remedy before the disease was gone so far but seriously i pass too much of that sort of time wherein i am neither well nor ill and being unable to express myself at large am averse to do so by halves from the strange laconicism of your letter i am really in doubt whether you are not angry at me and yet had rather this were owing to anger that may subside than to any persevering fondness you may have for such unusual brevity should the latter become habitual i shall see the letters of a genius dwindle to  per first will advise the needful god forbid such a transformation  your former letter to my great confusion was dated sept    let me speak first to some few parts of it  the lampreys arrived safe and were as good as i ever tasted but every time i tasted them i wanted you and you are mistaken if you imagine i can half relish such cates alone however i return you thanks  you gave me no account how far the bath waters etc were judged expedient for you a charitable action called you up to town and you in the benevolence of your heart presume that this accounts for the neglect of every advantage that concerned yourself pray let me know whether the bath was proper for you at the same time inform me whether you were able to serve mrs h  i shall be sorry for you as well as her if you should miss the gratification you would derive from the success of such an endeavor  were i rich i would erect a temple to simplicity and grace or as the latter word would be equivocal to simplicity and elegance i am glad to hear that mr w  has undertaken to deify the former as he will produce better grounds for such a consecration than was ever done by pagans or by papists on any such occasion by the way i take that goddess to be a remarkable friend to ease and indolence there is another welldeserving personage delicacy whose cause has been strangely deserted by either mr melmoth or dr lancaster  will it make better for me or worse to say i have not yet written to mr graves but i will positively write within this week if it cost me a dose of salts to clear my brain as to what he says about my printing immediately he may be right and i am sure he is friendly but more of this in a little time  since the receipt of your last letter mr percy and his wife came and spent a good part of the week here and he also would needs write a description of the leasowes during the latter part of his circuit my friend jago and i accompanied him and what was produced on that occasion you will go near to know in a little time mean while i am more and more convinced that no description of this place can make any figure in print unless some strictures upon gardening and other embellishments be superadded  mr jago has been with me twice having written a poem in blank verse which he leaves here for my revisal it is a descriptive poem called edgehill and admits an account of the battle fought there together with many legendary tales and episodes  about a week ago i paid a visit of two or three days which i had long promised to lord foley his table for a constancy is the most magnificent of any i ever saw eighteen or twenty elegant dishes a continual succession of company his behavior perfectly hospitable and his conversation really entertaining i most readily own myself to have been under a mistake with regard to his companionable character my reception was as agreeable as it could possibly be as to the rest he has a most admirable house and furniture but without any room or utensil that would stand the test of modern criticism the views around him wild and great and the park capable of being rendered fine twice as striking as it is at present if he would fell some oaks under the value of a crown and some hawthorns under the value of a halfpenny but it is possible at his time of life etc nothing of this sort will be undertaken the two things at present remarkable are his lodge and his chapel the portico of the former designed by fleetcroft affords three different and striking prospects the chapel is so very superb and elegant that mrs gataker has nothing to do but send you and me thither to say our prayers in it in reality it is perfect luxury as i truly thought it last sunday seennight his pew is a room with an handsome fireplace the ceiling carved painted in compartments and the remainder enriched with gilt stuccoornaments the walls enriched in the same manner the best painted windows i ever saw the monument to his father mother and brothers cost he said  000 l the middle aisle rendered comfortable by iron stoves in the shape of urns the organ perfectly neat and good in proportion to its size and to this chapel you are led through a gallery of paintings seventy feet long  and what would you more you will say a good sermon  i really think his parson is able to preach one  and now i come lastly to speak of your letter i received on monday what an uncommon man you are to take so much thought for those who never took any for themselves  i have enquired after mr wedderburne and it seems he is a very clever and a very rising lawyer to whom i am the more obliged for mentioning me as i fear i have not the honor of being the least known to him  pray write to me as soon as possible and i will make you amends if writing will make amends for the scandalous omissions of which i have been guilty i have somewhat to tell you of lord l  s usual great kindness when the lords d  and w  were last at hagley but i have not time and must conclude my dearest worthiest friend  your ever obliged w shenstone  letter ii w shenstone esquire to mr g  dear sir i did indeed give you up for lost as a correspondent and find by your letter that i am to expect very few future ones i will endeavor all i can to avoid any suspicion of your indifference for my own satisfaction but i dont know for certain that i shall be able unless you assist my endeavors like my good genius by a course of suitable epistles at certain distances i myself correspond but very little now so you will meet with the more indulgence i dont find by your letter that you have much more philosophy than me i cannot tell indeed what the situation of your house is i own mine gives me offense on no other consideration than that it does not receive a sufficient number of polite friends or that it is not fit to receive them were they so disposed i would else cultivate an acquaintance with about three or four in my neighborhood that are of a degree of elegance and station superior to the common run but i make it a certain rule  arcere profanum vulgus to banish the profane vulgar  persons who will despise you for the want of a good set of chairs or an uncouth fireshovel at the same time that they cannot taste any excellence in a mind that overlooks those things or to make a conceit of this sentiment with whom it is in vain that your mind is furnished if the walls are naked indeed one loses much of ones acquisitions in virtue by an hours converse with such as judge of merit by money etc yet i am now and then impelled by the social passion to sit half an hour in my kitchen  i was all along an admirer of sir thomas heads humor and wit and i beg you will represent me in that light if occasion happens it is not impossible that i may penetrate this winter as far as your neighborhood connecting a set of visits which i have in my eye tell mr whistler when you see him that if he must have some distemper i cannot but be pleased that it is one which is the forerunner of longevity  dont tell him so neither for the compliment is trite from the birmingham gazette we hear that on thursday last was married at hales owen in shropshire mr j  an eminent gunsmith of this town to a sister of the right hon f  lord d  i was yesterday at the grange where his old father with a number of people were celebrating the nuptials of his son when in the midst of his feastings high jollity and grand alliance the old fellow bethought him of a piece of timber in the neighborhood that was convertible into good gunstocks and had some of it sent for into the room by way of specimen  animae nil magnae laudis egentes souls that are desirous of little praise   pray is your sister at smelkwick for i have not heard you said you would give me your picture which i long earnestly for could not you contrive to have it sent me directly i am quite in your debt with regard to downright goods and movables and what is the proper subject of an inventory i will however endeavor to be more upon a par with you with regard to presents though i never can with regard to the pleasures i have received from your conversation  i make people wonder at my exploits in pulling down walls hovels cowhouses etc and my place is not the same i am that is with regard to you  a faithful friend and humble servant w shenstone mr whistler and you and i and sir t head whom i should name first speaking after the manner of men have just variety enough and not too much in our characters to make an interview whenever it happens entertaining  i mean though we were not old friends and acquaintance    letter iii w shenstone esquire to mr jago dear mr jago though i have not yet troubled you with a letter i have not been void of all enquiry or information concerning your situation and mr hardys health indeed it is now many weeks since i collected some particulars from your brother and i am now impatient for some further intelligence as to the particulars of our friendly reception at wroxhall mr john jago has very probably acquainted you he would however persuade me to give you a distinct account being assured he says it must be a good subject for drollery i dont know how far this would be proper but i think when i write again to my friend w  to give him a sketch of his own character just as it appeared during the time of our visit i do not mean to give offense so i shall intermix many good parts of his character together with his oddities i believe the whole will take up a sheet of paper for i have already considered it he has goodsense and goodnature at the bottom pity he should disguise the former by one continued air of buffoonry and the latter by a total neglect of common decorum  since i came home i have done little else but plant bushes hazel hawthorn crabtree elder etc together with some few flowering shrubs that i have had given me i think nothing remarkable has occurred only one miserable tempestuous day i had the earl of stamford called to see my walks together with mr dovey of birmingham and two other gentlemen my lord promised to come again in summer and invited me to enville by the way he is now building a gothic greenhouse by mr m  s direction and by all accounts the place is worth your seeing when you come into this country it is but about six miles distant from hence pray do not you embroil me with mr m  in regard to the observations i made in his walks remember there were not a few things with which i was greatly delighted and if there were a few that i less appeared to admire it was owing to a consciousness that i was amongst friends only and that i thought it foolish to regulate my expressions by the same rules of complaisance which i ought to observe in different places i say ought for he has been exceeding favorable to me in his representations of the leasowes i hope to see mr fancourt with you here this spring and why not your brother he can spend half a week now and then at wroxall the duke of s  was treated with cruelty by his father till he was sixtyfive and afterward scarce survived him to enjoy one years profit of the estate such is the tenure by which we hold our earthly tenements  letter iv w shenstone esquire to mr whistler dear mr whistler this is the first evening i have had to myself since i left cheltenham and as one wants some very favorite subject to engross ones thoughts a little after a long dissipation i could think of nothing more effectual than a letter to one who has so large a share in them beside they have given me your letter from bradfield and i am in pain till i have acknowledged so affectionate and polite a present people whose very foibles are so many elegancies can scarce write any thing more agreeable than a plain unaffected account of them i remember i used to think this a kind of distinction between mr graves and you that the one had the knack of making his virtues unenvied and the other of rendering what i perhaps unjustly termed his weaknesses enviable i am almost afraid of inserting this lest it should seem to injure the superlative esteem i have of you but i must add that i consider a mixture of weaknesses and an ingenuous confession of them as the most engaging and sociable part of any character if i did not i could not allot them you whose manner is so distinguishedly amiable  since i left cheltenham i have been at mr b  s in bishopscastle i rode one morning with him about three miles that i might say i had been in wales and seen brecon caderidis and plinlimmon with an extensive chain of other mountains i called at a small alehouse where the people lived all the winter without any glass in their windows i was wondering how they could live so in a more cold country than you have perhaps experienced the wife said true it was she could like glass very well yes says the husband glass is very genteel that it is nay says the wife not for the gentleelness neither though it is very genteel that is the truth on it this circumstance struck me a good deal that they should discover the genteelness of glazing and never once think of its expediency mr b  is a man you would like upon acquaintance though as i remember you had some objection to the superfluity of his wit we shall in all probability have frequent interviews with him at bath london etc he would fain have seduced me to have traveled into portugal etc with himself and one mr moore his neighbor an agreeable modest man and late member for bishopscastle i declined it for two reasons first on account of the expense and secondly that i could not think of spending two years in this part of my life abroad dead to ones own country and procuring at best very perishable and useless friendships in another if i could have staid i was to have gone with him to a welsh sessions fraught with irascibility he is a justice of peace there  as to good acquaintance though i much desire it i have as literally a genius for avoiding as any one ever had for procuring it i cannot approach within fifty yards of servility for fear of it  i want sadly to talk to you about a thousand things i have some notion of spending a week at mr d  s act sublimely and give me the meeting then notwithstanding  though i was enamoured with the politeness of mr w  s conversation i should not perhaps have been very forward to express my sentiments if you had not intimated that he made favorable mention of me i begin to grow a little pleased with prudence and i think it a debt one owes her to reserve ones encomiums till one knows any ones mutual sentiments for certainly he that happens to commend an enemy happens to condemn himself i beg my compliments  i believe poor j d  is alive  farther i cnnot learn  i did not think it possible i could have  so much engaged by love as i have been  ate  poor miss c   it must necessarily be an honor to a girl to have pleased a man of sense i know not but i am vain in supposing myself of that number let his station be how low soever now it must be a disgraee to captivate a fool however high it be the former is the strongest evidence of merit the latter of the want of it  now i talk of vanity i beseech you never check yourself in your letters  i dont purpose it and i think it makes as pretty a figure in the letters of a man of taste as it does in the embroidery of a beau i am as much yours as human nature will admit of  adieu w shenstone  letter v w shenstone esquire to  dear sir when i promised you some poetry for mr s  i am afraid that through my desire of recommending myself to his family my tongue outrun my wit if i laid any sort of stress upon what i was to send i am very sure it did so and when you have read the trifles enclosed you will be of the same opinion  it is probable however that i had an eye to a larger ode of mine upon the subject of rural elegance which i have not now time either to correct or to transcribe but which i will not fail to communicate to them upon some future occasion  or if my promise regarded a translation of the mottos here i shall have the best opportunity of performing it when i take the freedoms you have allowed me with your polite description of my farm  am i wrong in detaining that paper  for positively these last few days i have found myself a good deal feverish and my head has been so much confused that i was almost tempted to omit this message in this case i think your goodnature would have acquitted me of disrespect but i could not suffer you to leave the country with so bad an opinion of my punctuality  it remains that i present my best respects to dr turton and his lady and that i wish you an agreeable journey to oxford i purpose in a few weeks that you shall be enabled to say something more particular in regard to m  s poetry in the mean time i desire that he would accept my compliments and my thanks for the pleasure his verses have afforded me above all things assure mr arnold of my most unfeigned esteem and if he discovers any partiality for my place or me encourage it that it may induce him on a proper occasion to favor me once more with his company you see i am availing myself of your interest to make all your friends my own and to atone for this piece of selfishness it shall not be my fault if every friend i have be not yours at least with some share of that regard with which i am  dear sir your most faithful humble servant w shenstone  letter vi mr whistler to w shenstone esquire dear sir i received your agreeable letter read all the fine things your i fear prejudiced goodnature made you say at first distrusted them but when i reflected on the person who said them i found a strong inclination rise in me to believe them but how to be convinced i was still at a loss for i know it is in your power either to make flattery pass for sincerity or sincerity so justly dreaded from the unskilful pleasing but be it as it will i shall be a gainer by it for if it is flattery it will give me a fair reputation though undeserved with all who hear it but if it is true it will assure me i deserve one from all who can like you bestow one  you enquired after mr d  he and his lady and miss b  s have drank tea with me twice within this fortnight we went to christchurch prayers together from thence arrayed in gold and silver we rushed into st johnschapel where we stood knelt and sat i will not say prayed the whole servicetime for you know it is usual there for strangers to sit in the choir which we did to the great advantage both of the fan and the snuff box which were neither of them long unemployed during divine service you know they are great helps to devotion snuff certainly composes and a fan may waft a soul to heaven before it is aware  mrs l  still perseveres she gave it out before she had seen her that miss b  was like a cat which when she found miss b  had heard she wrote a letter to excuse herself and concluded most emphatically with these words no madam i am not quite so unbred it was not i but commonfame said you were like a cat i really think here that mrs l  topt mrs l  s part mr g  is still a prude i see him sometimes but should be glad to see him oftener i know no one circumstance but breach of sincerity that can ever be a reason with me to slight my friends if a friend of mine had broke all laws both human and divine yet had conspicuously preserved his integrity to me i should only think myself the more obliged to him and though i pitied him would never forsake him first i should think he had a higher notion of friendship and that that was the only tie which he dared not violate for which reason i would not dare to be a greater villain than he i dont know how this thought came into my head but you see i was willing to spin it to its full length if i have gone too far you must impute it to that rapture of friendship with which i am yours eternally  a whistler oxford do write    letter vii mr whistler to w shenstone esquire dear sir i have waited thus long upon a dilatory lawyer called i suppose in hebrew beelzebub at least i am confident lawyer is but a synonimous term for the devil i have stayed and must stay to sign some parchments which cannot be done without me and his delay has caused mine in not answering your kind letter before i must likewise go to winchester on the same business so that to put you out of a disagreeable expectation i pluck up resolution to tell you i am afraid i cannot wait upon you this summer at once to resist your kindness and my own inclination in my opinion is a great act of resolution at least would be so if i had any degree of choice left me but as it is i think the enduring my disappointment a great trial of my patience mr graves will witness the truth of my misfortune who has been at whitchurch lately and who intended to see you soon i suppose he told you his errand into these parts a providential thing for me and one of the happiest revolutions in my life if it succeed as i hope it will my spirits are quite grown rusty with long and fruitless expectations of happiness and no tools are fine enough to polish or as the artists say to touch them but yourself or mr graves i knew nothing of his coming till i saw him for which reason i looked upon him as miraculous manna or food from heaven  i lament very much that you dont design to be in london next winter i shall be there for about six weeks toward the middle of it the winter we met there i thought a pleasant one and enough to encourage a second meeting in the same place  the only place for whims practicable there without reproach or falling from that dignity which it is necessary for a gentleman to maintain in the country i should like mightily to indulge my fancy in some innocent private romantic expeditions i know not what  but all things as i said are possible there  mr graves tells me you are a great oeconomist if so i hope london will be the richer for it and you the finer as luxury is the daughter of industry and industry again the mother of luxury each reigning by turns and so the world goes on if you should go to london this winter you will call at whitchurch by the way and well go together which will prevent any disappointment you will always be received here with acknowledgment of the favor you do us so say we all and present our compliments in one garland to you which i beg you will accept though it is but coarsely put together and you will oblige  your sincere friend and most obedient servant a whistler whitchurch sept   letter viii mr whistler to w shenstone esquire dear sir i received your kind letter and in spite of all you have said i must still think that the obligation is entirely on my side and you have only in my opinion laid a greater stress upon it by so generously disclaiming it i am resolved to be pleased with every thing you say or do and if i were not you are resolved i shall i am very glad you intend me a visit but am likewise very sorry i must beg you to defer it for some time our family talk of going to bristol very soon and as i have no where else to go must go with them if it was in my power to defer the journey i would gladly do it to wait on mr shenstone at whitchurch or if i could command the house in their absence their absence and his presence would be to me a double happiness but as it is i must at present be without a pleasure which i hope will not always thus fly from me i hope the latend of this summer and mr shenstone will be both more favorable to me and if so i shall reckon that the spring of the year is yet to come i who place the seasons entirely in my own fancy  i forgot to tell you in my last that the princess amelia did us the honor of a visit at whitchurch though we were obliged to the stag for it who seemed to fly from the honor she designed him and had not ambition enough as lee says to meet the blow half way or be pleased with death though in the royal presence it was a terrible day and the princess was wet through she had rode thirty miles when i saw her and she rode thirty miles after that which was six oclock at night in her wet clothes and appeared at the drawing room at st jamess the next day which was a birthday  the princess with submission be it spoke gave me no satisfaction not through any deficiency in her demeanor  but from the dissatisfied state of mind i could be contented with nothing less than you and i hope you will be so good as not to let this disappointment which i assure you is a great disappointment to me be any objection to my having the pleasure of your company another time with my service which waits on you i am yours as much as i hope you would have me viz  your sincere friend and humble servant a whistler excuse me if i desire to be remembered to good mrs arnold whom i look upon to be an example of the simple force of moral beauty  sept     letter ix mr whistler to w shenstone esquire dear sir i have not received your letter above a week ago being but lately come to town which is the true reason why i have not answered it few reasons and none but good ones shall ever prevent me from presenting my heart to you but my journey hither has been prevented partly by ill health and partly by little illnatured impertinent accidents  this suspense had had an equal effect on my writing to you i here end my most sincere apology  now for news  i am in london for which reason i suppose i must not be excused though i hate it remember very little and am most likely to blunder in the recital of that little the house of commons have addressed the king to try matthews and lestock and six captains by a court martial and it is thought some of them will be condemned  poor garrick has been dangerously ill of a fever this week but now to my great satisfaction there are hopes of his recovery nay it is noticed in the daily advertiser that he will perform a part next wednesday night  i have been to wait on lord d  he was very civil and would fain have kept me till he had opened his heart with a bottle of wine at least i imagined his forwarding the bottle was with that design but i was engaged i am to call upon him to go to ranelagh  a lord would be a pretty nosegay in ones hand if he had the least variety of colors nay if he resembled any one flower of a single color except the fustus mr f  i see sometimes but he is not very attractive i always did envy you the power of laughing at a fool by yourself but you are a world within yourself mr p  k i spent an evening with lately very agreeably but he lives so far off at the courtend of the town as separates us very much mr p  n i often see and find him a very useful person but if you were here both agreeable and useful would vanish and a far superior enjoyment take place mr graves promised to be in london for a week but his little politics are you know very uncertain i have struck a bold stroke since i have been in town i mean a laced coat for really waistcoats cost as much and are no mark of distinction after all sir t head comes to town this week but i believe i shall not stay above a week longer so would have you direct to me at whitchurch i design to go to court one night i must as you see write short my paper drawing to an end it is with pleasure i hear that old people confess a play is now worth seeing and that garrick excels betterton etc in the diversity of his genius he must far exceed him when we see him alternately in a richard and scrub in a lear and abel drugger he is truly astonishing this excellence of our dramatic representations is another reason to wish you here campioni is a charming new dancer the messiah was performed last night but i could not go  but i must write no more tattle i have just been with mr shugborough and gave him your orders about the pamphlets and have picked out some myself viz the odes the new play and the poem on sickness  i wish there had been any better prints to have enclosed in this letter i should have been glad to have sent them the pamphlets i have ordered to be sent immediately directed to be left at mr audleys in birmingham the regret i always feel for your absence will ever instruct me how to value you that is beyond what the elaborate conclusion of a letter can express therefore i will not endeavor to say how much but in an unlimited manner be fond to remain  yours a whistler april    georges coffeehouse i have no gilt paper at hand which is a fault pray excuse it mr pemberton is with me and begs his service    letter x mr whistler to w shenstone esquire dear mr shenstone i generally write to you because i want to hear from you but having lately wrote to you i now write because i want to see you in short the case is this i shall be at oxford in about three weeks time or sooner and i have reason to think it will be the last time i shall be there i mean in my gown now as i am willing still to retain an agreeable image of the place where i have spent so many happy hours i make this request that you would stamp the last impression upon my mind i beg you would meet me there and give me the confirmation of your friendship which i shall esteem a greater honor than all the degrees the formal convocation can bestow and i think of you as juba does of cato and declare i would rather have your praise than worlds for my admirers i have forgot the measure but this is directly my sentiment  i lately wrote you a long letter as you were so kind to desire and in so very lazy unintellectual a manner that i am sure half the mortals who only understand with their eyes and by the grammar could never have comprehended but i would converse with you soul to soul have a hint understood by you and not be obliged to a tedious period to communicate a thought to you i would have my soul stand naked before you and shiver at the least breath of kindness your most distant meaning shall breathe on it  oh happy state when souls each other draw etc mr pope this i am sure your quick apprehension is capable of and by a desire of the strictest union with you i am fond to believe as well of myself you see i am proposing every scheme which may unite you more closely to me therefore i beg you will not refuse me the request i made at the beginning of my letter i will say no more now but when i am with you design to talk away as you shall inspire in the mean time i boast that it is the most sagacious instinct which pushes me on to subscribe myself  your most affectionate friend and humble servant a whistler  letter xi mr whistler to w shenstone esquire dear sir as hope is the chief spring of all our actions and as pleasure is the sole object of that hope you must not wonder if the style of this letter appears more languid than usual how quickly is the transition often made from hope to despair but a little while and i thought i already saw you and now i am presently fallen into the desperation of i know not when the smallpox which generally frightens away every thing that is agreeable has made it impossible for me to see you as yet  the last sentence seems a compliment to myself but as i am too lazy to alter it i beg you would think with me and interpret every thing i say in your own favor but thus the devil will have it the smallpox is all over oxford in every part of the town in most of the colleges to my knowledge and is lately broke out in pembroke if it had not been for this last article i could gladly have confined myself within the compass of those walls with you but as it is i am forced like good men to submit for a while to human miseries and comfort myself with the thought of my heaven though at a distance like them too i have this satisfaction that in the mean time neither the base moth or rust of the world can corrupt that part of you in which my pleasure is situated  i have a very bad piece of news to tell you mr g  lies dangerously ill at london of a fever i am informed his life is despaired of  i am now in the utmost concern at it this letter is a mere medley disagreeable to myself i dont propose it to be agreeable to you i only wrote it to tell you what you must know and if you can understand it it is very well i am not only in the lowest spirits but they are also very much confused i will not now moralize but this i am sure we shall both dearly miss mr g  when i hear more you shall know more it is now one oclock in the morning and as i told you i wrote this out of necessity i cannot be in oxford though i long to see you if poor mr g  should die pray be still more kind to me i am sure i shall then find a vacancy in my breast which you alone can fill up to my satisfaction  adieu dear mr shenstone a whistler pray write  i received a letter from you just after i sent you my last and my thoughs are at present too confused to answer your last particularly nor indeed will my time allow it only i heartily thank you for it  whitchurch near reading berks   letter xii mr whistler to w shenstone esquire august   dear sir your last kind letter has for a long time upbraided me with negligence ingratitude and stupidity to the last part of the accusation i plead guilty for i think i never found myself more stupid than i have been for this month past and what i write now proceeds not from any flow of fancy but merely from respect and esteem i have been very much taken up of late by our family being at home but that excuse i lay no stress upon for i shall never let any either business or pleasure hurry you from my thoughts ill health can be my only just apology and though i cannot say i have been sick i can assure you i have not been well for some time past put my condition in the best light i am very much in the vapors and so much as that you or mr graves alone can cure me a letter from you will go a great deal toward it though i long for one i can hardly go on with this letter which is the means to procure it like one sinking into a fainting fit who cannot collect strength of mind or body to reach so much as the hartshorn to his nose which stands at his elbow i shall be at oxford in a short time and spend as many days there as i can pass agreeably and then take my leave of it if the town be healthy i shall go to london the beginning of the winter and stay there just as long as it smiles on me but all things seem to frown in the absence of my friends and i wish i dont think the smiles of the town impertinent without them i wish i could be sometimes pleased with less than you without i could have you always pray write soon and raise my spirits for i really am forced now to conclude for want of them  dear sir yours etc etc a whistler service to mr d  i sincerely hope he is well    letter xiii mr whistler to w shenstone esquire dear sir if you remember in your last letter but one you advised me to read history accordingly as i am always proud to follow your advice i pitched upon burnets history of his own times i was over head and ears engaged in the disputes between cavaliers protesters resolutioners and god knows who when i received your last though burnet values himself particularly on private intelligence i had a greater curiosity and entertained far greater hopes of pleasure in breaking open your letter nor was i at all deceived i think you wrote if possible more agreeably than usual it raised my spirits and at the same time did more than all king charless statesmen could do set up an absolute monarchy in my breast in a moment and made you sovereign there  mr powys had a child christened yesterday it was attended to church by half a dozen coaches the great mr pointz was one of the godfathers and mrs townshend now an inhabitant of your parts the godmother by proxy mrs powys went out on pleasure to the last and if her horses had not been good and her coachman dexterous to ply them with the whip she had been brought to bed in her coach as once before she had like to have been at the playhouse alas for our poor friend cob who shall now sit with countenance serene the inoffensive judge of sacred song at once becalmed with port and poetry while the great somerville attunes his lays   as to what you mentioned about your poem you cannot think me such a barbarian as that i should expect you should follow my advice in every particular i rather think you did me an honor in doing it at all i know the great critics have been long endeavoring to be absolute but i think it very unreasonable even in them  and i believe you as well as myself have too much spirit to submit to it if i can any ways assist you by any little observations you shall have my thoughts and make use of them at your pleasure for i am very fond of that rule of doing as one would be done by  little miss l  outdoes tom tinsells widow  if the town is not vastly unhealthy indeed for i must not regard little discouragements as my affairs are at present i shall spend most part of the next winter at london you are very friendly to propose to me the most agreeable scheme in the world but i cannot possibly see the leasowes this summer i believe it is you not mrs arnold who have all the wit of your country and if all things naturally attract there alike in that respect you will prove a very dangerous neighbor i long to see you as much as you can do to see me but all i can do now is to tell you so and that i am by honor friendship and every other obligation  yours sincerely a whistler sept   letter xiv mr whistler to w shenstone esquire whitchurch nov   dear sir i received you packet fraught with every thing that could delight me i believe more wit was never conveyed under the title of a peer before not even excepting your own which indeed you generally export by wholesale in the same method your letter led me through an elysian scene which delighted me so that i must beg leave to take another turn with you at present therein there is no subject i can treat of with so much pleasure and of consequence with so much advantage to myself in the first place dick j  in the point of light you set him diverts me yet humanity teaches me to feel a kind of pity as for an animal that sings and hops about the cage that has just deprived him of his liberty lady luxborough i have seen but not in her sanctuary where she delivers her oracles and displays her eloquence and elegancies at full this is what my soul is athirst after the holy land of a future pilgrimage you have raised a devotion in me toward her for we always judge of the divinity by the merits of the priest by your description of mr thomson i admire him and rejoice in your acquaintance with him i beg you would cultivate it for it seems like the dawning of your fame whose merit the stupid world only wants to be awakened to see if ever you get your due share of fame i insist that you be not a niggard of it as many are but do your utmost endeavor to communicate it to your friends  you see i speak in time  as for mr l  ns civility i have no great faith in it i fear he has only some private end to serve as an election or so but however i would have you nourish it for it may breed something by chance  it will be a credit to you at worst  chance often promotes lingerers at court who have otherwise very little hope it may fall out that by serving you he may serve himself i should like to have seen signor outing poor man  i think the leasowes a charming place in itself but not knowing how in my imagination at any time to separate the work from the architect i believe i give the former infinitely more adoration than its due even with all its improvements you would often see me gliding across the glades if the soul was visible you indeed have contrived to make your soul as it were visible and a very beautiful soul it is particularly in its last dress which became it exceedingly i mean elegy  it was mighty well fancied and diffused a tender languishing air its highest character i am much indebted to it for this splendid visit spendid i mean in beauty the two old songs likewise were very agreeable to me but chiefly giles collins as for the song of the cat i am much obliged to you for it but i think the author sunk quite beneath himself toward the end the conclusion was too sudden and not worked up enough and besides was exceeding dirty however it was improved by your alterations upon the whole i like it and out of my devotion for the five first stanzas i have added six more which i submit to your judgment whether i have supported the true spirit of the fragment pray excuse that i have presumed to omit any of your alterations because i thought in this new scheme the context required it  i live in hopes of seeing you at whitchurch this winter and of hearing the happy tidings when i beg you will let me know some time before you come that i may get your bed in order i have but one it was given me and is none of the largest indeed small which at present i lament otherwise i should now give more invitations i can entertain but one friend at a time but all my friends will be sincerely welcome severally again i say i lament the unsociableness of this scheme but it is not in my power to alter it mr g  s affair goes on i am afraid unhappily as for my own situation i shall say little but leave you to take a survey of it which i hope you will do soon i think it is calculated for happiness if a person of the least delicatesse can be so i rejoice in all you have rejoiced in and pray for all you pray for as becomes  your most affectionate friend and humble servant a whistler pray write  my idea of miss fletchers is that they are easy without impertinence a high idea in my opinion pray give my compliments to lord d  if in the country    letter xv mr whistler to w shenstone esquire whitchurch nov    dear sir i am very much obliged to you for your last kind letter and received your absolution with a very contrite heart though i assure you my sin was not wilful however it was such as i sincerely lamented even in the commission i should rather say omission i am exceeding sorry to find you have so great a quarrel with london i speak sincerely when i say i propose little pleasure there without you i said in my last letter we might contrive to meet there as hitherto i think we have contrived not to do it and if we were to meet i cannot but fancy we might make it agreeable to each other i shall go thither immediately after christmas and should be glad to wait on you at whitchurch and from thence to london you certainly conclude me happy in having mr graves so near me and with reason i should think my scheme of friendship complete if you was as near but without that circumstance it is far from being so sir t head and mr graves spent three days with me last week to my great satisfaction  i have had a swelling in my foot which they tell me is the gout  god forbid  but it is certainly like it i intend to go into a milk diet immediately for i am terribly alarmed if it should prove so i shall think it a very hard fate having been no drinker and even multitudes of those escape it but fortune favors the brutes  it was not our mr powyss landau for he was at home and besides has never a one i believe mr graves and i shall return sir g  s favor soon and spend about a week with him how shall we all wish for you to be with us that i shall i can be upon my bible oath and for the rest i think i can answer in the affirmative my brother is at whitchurch at present who is a constant companion to me while he stays but i fear that will not be long but mr graves i design to see often both for health and pleasure  what with going to london this winter and bristol in the summer as i have laid my scheme for the future i shall make whitchurch not quite so tedious to me and above all the thought of waiting upon you both in oxfordshire and at the leasowes vastly brightens my future prospect my father and mother desire to join with me in all civilities to you  but i beg you would believe i surpass most people notwithstanding your apparent merit in the extreme regard i have for you when i subscribe myself  your most sincere friend and humble servant a whistler my duty to lord d  i wish his lordship would favor me with some franks i should look upon it as an honor and a piece of goodnature a frank you know would convey them    letter xvi mr whistler to w shenstone esquire dear sir i have been extremely busy of late in new modelling my little habitation and the more so to bring it to some kind of perfection in order to receive you i have been building up pulling down planting rooting up turning round to square and square to round in short i dont know but some prudent people would say i have been playing the devil indeed as in other things in life my fancy is so confined by the smallness of my possessions that my scheme is not very expensive it is all in the lilliputian style and must be so though i have tried to give it what air of magnificence it is capable of i suppose it will strut like many of those unfortunate heroes who happen not to be four feet and a half high  did lady luxborough approve my sentiment of enjoying things best by reflection i still maintain my opinion and endeavor to justify it thus what we enjoy by reflection we have pure nay heightened by our own fancy at the same time no inconvenience attends it on the contrary the pleasure is more poignant by the contrast the thought of an icehouse in the summer is refreshing and the imagination of july is a cordial in frost and snow besides you well know hope is the very hartshorn of life that enlivens every thing and particularly attends imaginary pleasures but vanishes whenever they become real  by reflection i mean imagination in general  i have sent you stanzas on flowers if lady luxborough likes them i shall be proud of hitting the palate of a lady of so high a taste i have likewise enclosed another copy of verses  though i am in doubt whether i did not send them to you last summer they were done then i know you dont love translations but i have nothing new besides i set about them merely as an exercise one night when i was dull and alone not intending any thing but tearing them afterward for i knew it was a wornout subject  but a fatherly affection took place and i did not care for murdering it though it was a bastard produced unawares  n b i beg that nothing of mine may appear in print  i admire those two lines of lady wortleys very much it is a natural yet uncommon and agreeable thought i am pleased with the compliment you make me in saying you always wish me with you to partake any pleasure and imagine how any thing extraordinary would strike me i like it because i know it is a natural and thereby a sincere thought by my own heart i am so far gone that way that i can hardly enjoy any thing extraordinary without my friends are with me especially those whom i know it would particularly strike but next to gratifying a friend is the observing how new and extraordinary objects work upon a natural genius i will suppose it a genius i think it is one of the highest entertainments in life when i can meet with such and have an opportunity i love to read a play to them though i know i run the hazard of being laughed at for my pains but i dont care the pleasure pays me for all the malicious foolish people can say and you know the natural criticisms of sir roger de coverley were not thought unworthy the notice of the british spectator for my part i have often thought that it is one of the amusements of the supreme being who planted first the passions in us to observe the workings and effects of them a public audience gives me pleasure upon trust for though i know no one there i always conclude there are some geniusses  i am of your opinion with regard to mrs  at present for i think if her heart be really engaged which i very much doubt dishonor in love is the blackest of all dishonest actions and of the worst consequence  but his precursive steps were the extremity of folly conducted with the extremity of folly but he may be happy and i wish he may be happy in any state of life i think our visits to dick j  are fatal his own mother lay a dying when we were at henley i am very glad to hear you have had so many amusements it is always agreeable to me whenever i hear you have met with a flowery meadow in your sublunary walk if i have any taste your hercules is an elegant and truly poetical poem and superior to l  s if it is not i resign my taste for i will pin it upon your poem i dont pretend to criticism but my passion for shakespeare milton pope etc has made me believe that i have some natural taste for beauty i am much obliged to you for the two genteel copies of verses they are very pretty and much to my fancy as for odes you have expressed my sense of them all on that of dr akenside they perplex and fret one more than they please and may be described by the title of one of shakespeares plays viz much ado about nothing  i have no news to send you from hence that will be in the least entertaining to you i am in hopes mr graves will settle at whitchurch about whitsuntide i have been much out of order for this week by a cold that i caught in attending my works and my foot gives me ugly apprehensions at present i continually please myself with the thoughts of seeing you at whitchurch but would never have you make an inconvenience of what i would have be a pleasure to you  i would have you choose your own time that you may be quite unembarrassed for my part i think the sooner the better only i would beg the favor of one line to prevent all ill accidents i think it is a method which should ever be used and i wonder at my own imprudence and my own good fortune last time i came to the leasowes i long to see you and shall be all this summer at whitchurch ready to receive you indeed if i should have the gout as i something fear it i would let you know for that would interrupt all our pleasure i beg my compliments to mr dolman you have likewise the compliments of this place with wishes to see you and compliments grounded upon the utmost sincerity i am  dear sir yours to an excess a whistler whitchurch april    letter xvii mr whistler to w shenstone esquire dear mr shenstone you see that i am as eager to answer your letter as you was to answer mine and if my letter gave you pain i assure you that yours has equally perplexed me i am in great hopes you have misinterpreted my sense in regard to mr g  and by as much as i can recollect i believe you have he always speaks of you with the utmost respect in your absence and is much less severe even upon what he calls your little faults than when you are present all that i hinted at was some little shyness he lately showed to me on the account which you and i have often mentioned i have heard you say you have experienced the same from him on the like score but you could not possibly be now included being absent no i assure you i only spoke of myself and his fault toward me would have been imperceptible but to the delicacy of friendship nor been have worth communicating but to one whom my love would animate against the like failing i declare to you the sentence which included mr g  s name was the only one which regarded him what followed though i confess that gave rise to it was only to show my different sentiments and i own my esteem for friendship carried me a great length i have been very particular to satisfy you as well as to justify mr g  and by that means to justify myself i should have never have forgiven myself if i had been the cause though inadvertently of dividing so much worth as i have always discovered in you both and which though separated it might still continue to bless me yet when united like most other things it has a more powerful effect i would not have mr g  know a word of this for the most trifling reflection when told again is offensive nor should i have said what i did but to a common friend in truth it is not everybody who possibly might feel it so acutely as myself but you know my disposition i have a sensibility in my friendships that arises even to a soreness and the slightest air of coolness makes me wince this though in its consequences sometimes it may render me unpleasing to my intimates certainly has its source in a merit namely in the ardour of my attachments and therefore i should hope is easily pardonable you remember the elegant line in cottons beautiful vision of friendship cold is the only ill they fear  after i had sealed my last i was afraid it had rather an air of compliment than sincerity if it had i assure you it was only the air and what the good humor i am always in when i write to you might inspire me with you see the esteem i have for you by turning critic on myself in your behalf i am now going to mention what there is no occasion at all to say but friendship is the most incontinent thing in the world i have long been sensible of your worth that is ever since i knew you but i must say i think it was our last meeting which entirely united me to you every letter of yours since has heightened my affection for you i look upon this as my first absence from you your letters are now necessary to supply your presence you yourself taught me this taste of luxury therefore it is but reasonable you should support the expense in short i beg you would write soon i am afraid i shall tire you by so frequent a correspondence but i particularly long to know the success of this letter  dear mr shenstone i am yours etc a whistler  letter xviii w shenstone esquire to miss low madam i fancy i have been condemned a thousand times on account of not sending the tunes one of them was lent out and i had not an opportunity of fetching it till last week i dont know whether this reason will prove sufficient but i assure you it was the real one i tore them out of my book and on that account you have some others with them i was willing you should have them in the best shape possible and dare say you will improve as much upon them as i have degenerated from them  i want exceedingly to hear from you but you will scarce think it consistent with a rural reputation to write yourself it is indeed scarce worth while to hazard it to give me ever so great a pleasure but i could wish you would here remember the character of a townlady  lord how does miss uty i did not wonder you should mutually envy each other since you are both so great objects of envy more particularly as modesty has taught you to think your own merit small in comparison with that of others voila la seule source de toute envy  i am surely vastly impertinent for i am not positive you understand french but i guessed that a lady so accomplished in all other particulars might i fancy you have enjoyed a vast deal of agreeable gaiety since i left you whilst i have been wandering about harboroughs gloomy walks and pools like a shepherd despairing beside a clear stream  oh i want to know whether or no for the common good of our society in particular as of our country in general it is and may be lawful to admit without the usual number of members being present at the solemnity for i judge it better to lay aside some part of the ceremony than that any one should die uninitiated  whether or no as in baptism  i was truly going too far  i am safe enough let me go what lengths i will in subscribing myself  the humblest of your humble servants w shenstone  letter xix w shenstone esquire to mrs a  dear madam i promised to give you some account what became of cheltenham after mr a  had pillaged it of all that was most valuable possibly before this time you may have forgot both my promise and me and it may not be extremely political to renew your remembrance of a person who has been so long seemingly neglectful the truth is i can no more bear to be forgot by those i esteem than i can be censured of forgetfulness with regard to them and i know no way but writing by which i can evade both  some sort of apology i ought to make that i did not write before you will therefore please to observe that i am but just arrived at home though i left cheltenham the day after you i stayed indeed to hear mr b  preach a morning sermon for which i find mrs c  has allotted him the hat preferably to mr c  perhaps you may not remember nor did i hear till very lately that there is a hat given annually at cheltenham for the use of the best foreign preacher of which the disposal is assigned to mrs c  to her and her heirs for ever i remember though i knew nothing of this whilst i was upon the place i used to be a little misdeemful that all who preached there had some such premium in their eye this hat it is true is not quite so valuable as that of a cardinal but while it is made a retribution for excellence in so if properly considered sublime a function it is an object for a preacher in any degree i am sorry at the same time to say that as a common hat merely for its uses it would be an object to too many country curates whose situations and slender incomes too often excite our blushes as well as compassion there should be no such thing as a journeyman parson it is beneath the dignity of the profession if we had fewer pluralities in the church this indecorum might in a great measure be abolished  mr n   squire n  i hear is fitting up his castle at l  for the reception of the little widow and the mercer at cheltenham has completed his grand arcade for the better disposition of his crapes and callimancos  i am an ill relater of matters of fact and as i said before did not continue above four and twenty hours and some odd minutes upon the place longer than you that enquire after it but i survived long enough to hear very frequent mention of mrs a  miss carter etc and such mention as has confirmed me in an opinion that persons of real merit without any expense of airs etc will by degrees engross the admiration of any place they come into but this is a kind of language you would never indulge me in you might very securely for i should never be able to express half the sincere esteem and respect with which i am  madam your most obedient humble servant w shenstone  letter xx w shenstone esquire to miss carter dear miss carter perhaps you may remember to have seen an odd kind of fellow when you were at cheltenham who threatened you with a letter and who is now endeavoring to be as bad as his word however he hopes for some little partiality on his behalf having delayed the execution of his menaces for a considerable time and even now promising to say as few things in your favor as the real sentiments of his heart will admit of  but peace to buffoonery  after i parted from you mr m  n with great simplicity endeavored to keep up my spirits by speaking in praise of the family we had left as though that was not the ready method to aggravate the sense of ones loss and yet to aggravate it was utterly impossible in the opinion of a person already so sensible of it but he mentioned one article which was more successful and that was a proposal to accompany me to stoke and to let me know when it suited his convenience  when i came to cheltenham i was not unmindful of that solemn vow that i had made not to survive your family there a single hour but i found it near five oclock and my conscience said that as i had made it so late by my attendance upon you though i did stay another night i hoped i might be excused  i have been since leaving this town at mr browns who lives upon the borders of wales  poor man he has been the most obliging person in the world to the most stupid of companions it is hardly possible to determine which was greater the zeal with which he showed me his fossils plants poetry etc or the stupid inattention with which i observed them he commends you and mrs aubrey highly so indeed do all i know or i would soon forget that i had ever seen their faces he had found out a method at last of seducing me to talk by frequent mention of your merits and it was a good while before i discovered his artifice and even when i had discovered it i was ill able to elude the force of it  i am now just returned home which is my apology for not writing to you about cheltenham as i promised i really scarce recollect any circumstance belonging to it except that you and mrs aubrey were there the most favorable agreeable and praiseworthy  what does mr m  boast of the glorious absurdity he committed at parting in mistaking my horse for his when i see him next i will produce a hundred i have been lately guilty of to no one of which his is able to compare his you know commenced in the very moment of parting and consequently was little wonderful in comparison of those i have since committed besides his horse had a spot or two of brown on him and was therefore easily mistaken at such a time for one that was sorrel all over  after all you are a very wicked lady  you defrauded me of the croslet you promised me putting me off with a single bead but it was yours and that is enough the most trivial donation from a person we esteem has a large value i acknowledge to have a great penchant for what the vulgar call keepsakes the french are notably practiced in these little elegancies we are not so much so as i think a polished people ought to be  i am dear miss carter your most sincere admirer and humble servant w shenstone dont expose the nonsenseverses i gave you i entreat you    letter xxi s d  esquire to w shenstone esquire dear sir i was some time since at mr whistlers chamber when he received a letter from you the sight of which revived in my mind the pleasing correspondence you once favored me with the loss of which i much regret  do you never think of returning to oxford have you left nothing there that may give us leave once more to expect you i will not be so poetically complaisant as to say every thing appears grieved at your absence but i assure you sir there are some that seem sincerely to lament it i cannot compare those little people that have sometimes censured you to any thing but ants who are generally most troublesome in the finest season i cannot hope that even a short stay at c  could be made agreeable but novelty is sometimes pleasing descend then and see the new acquaintance i have made which is like to prove a very lasting one may yours be no less so  mr graves is in gloucestershire and mr whistler god knows where and you unkindly conceal from me the place of your residence i shall direct this wandering epistle as usual but imagine if it is so fortunate as to find you it will be in your hermitage where i presume you are before this retired were i mr whistler with what pleasure should i leave the world and all its vanities for mr shenstone and a cell  though i must own your intention of making mr l  n immortal by a dedication and singing the praises and virtues of the court seem to cherish gayer thoughts than suit that peaceful station whether hermit or courtier be assured that whatever conduces to your happiness is sincerely wished by me  s d  c  january  0 letter xxii s d  esquire to w shenstone esquire dear sir i can omit no opportunity of showing my desire of continuing a correspondence that has always given me so much pleasure i wrote you a letter some time ago and should have used so little ceremony as to have troubled you with another had i known in what part of the world you was if you know any thing of mr g  i should be glad to hear something of him i am informed that he is a curate in some village very remote  it is a great pity so much merit should be no better rewarded we have been returned from london about three weeks if i had known you were in town i should have left it with much more reluctance if you come into oxfordshire this summer i hope you will favor me with a visit at c  which will be a very great pleasure to us all  you cannot imagine how happy you have made me in giving me hopes of enjoying a sight of your poems from which i am sure of reaping a pleasure which can admit of no addition but by receiving them from your own hands i am glad to hear that mr g  is settled so much to his satisfaction if he is at all souls i hope i shall see him before he leaves oxford  i have lately lost a very agreeable relation and sincere friend perhaps you have heard mr whistler mention miss b  she died at c  about three months since after a short illness of two days which added so much to the melancholy situation here that we were obliged to fly to town for amusements i came down ten days since and shall return again tomorrow for about a week longer may i hope dear sir to find a letter here from you i am sure the reading of it will give me more real pleasure than any company or diversion i can propose to find in london i am sorry to send you any news that will give you concern but cannot help telling you that i hear poor mr r g  is dangerously ill of a fever in town mr whistler has left oxford on account of the smallpox which is very much there and at present in pembroke college  notwithstanding this unseasonable weather i must beg leave to put you in mind of your promise and enquire when it is you design us the pleasure of your company in oxfordshire where you will meet with a great many who will rejoice much to see you and none more than your  affectionate friend and humble servant s d   letter xxiii a b esquire to w shenstone esquire for the souls

allow me to bestow more of my eloquence on you for it you must therefore be satisfied with the altar of gratitude i have it in my head hereafter to erect to your honor  we are invited to stay at hagley on monday next  dinner at two oclock  may i expect the pleasure of meeting you there if you have had a card let me know per bearer that i may not as i do now groan with apprehensions of the day his most excellent of excellencies the governor and mistress hester stay till the latter end of september so you will certainly be honored with them at the leasowes  my best and i think i may say my only dear lord lord d  was here on friday last with intent to dine and spend the day but as i was from home went to hagley and dined with the lord lyttelton at the worthy admiral smiths  oblige me with desiring dodsley to bid his brother send me the annual registers bound as we agreed on this morning and lettered when he sends me the world etc  did i not know you above even the least degree of policy to your friends i should suspect that you sent me lady luxboroughs letters to intimate to me what so dull a correspondent and insipid a friend as myself must expect when you could bear accusations of negligence in answering such agreeable and sprightly letters as those of her ladyship and i could almost wish though the perusal of them gave me the greatest pleasure that you had not favored me with a sight of them as i cannot help drawing omens from them to myself the most dreadful if you did not then mean me ill in your obliging compliment of the sight of them let me see or hear from you soon and tell me that though you have heretofore slighted a ladys favors you will not neglect a sincere friend who admires and esteems you more than from what i think i have heard you say of her ladyship she could but to wave this and leave you to your own generosity i must thank you for yours of march   th had i not depended on your promise in it i should have again troubled you ever this but i must now tell you that i hope the week after easter week for the pleasure of your company here and if convenient to take a bed with us in the holidays i apprehend we shall have holiday company which will be neither agreeable to you nor us as we shall not by such interruption be able to pay the attention we ought and are ever desirous of paying to so agreeable a friend as mr shenstone  i like the binding of your milton much but not to compliment dislike the cuts as much for i really think the engraver has made our first parents frightful figures and the angels and devils almost equally lovely  could you get mine bound as yours without the cuts should be much obliged to you  i have retired from company we have in the house to write this scrawl this i hope will be an excuse for it and convince you that i am resolved never to lose any opportunity of assuring dear mr shenstone that i am  most sincerely his affectionate friend a b  have taken the liberty of keeping lady luxboroughs letters some time longer for mrs b  s perusal who joins with all here in best compliments to the leasowes  wednesday evening i should be glad if you could procure me half a ream of mr baskervilles best plain thin writing paper i mean gilt but not bordered      letter xxiv mr j whistler to w shenstone esquire whitchurch may    sir i make no doubt but you will be much surprised at the receipt of this and like wise greatly concerned at the melancholy occasion of it as the friendship subsisting between you and my brother has been of so long standing i should be glad to communicate its contents to you more gently by some other hand but for want of a friend in your neighborhood who has the honor of your acquaintance must do it myself in the least affecting manner i am capable  the beginning of this month my brother was taken ill of a sore throat which continued for some days without any apparent symptoms of danger indeed toward the last it was judged the disorder was throwing itself off but to the great surprise of every one a mortification in his inside was then begun and came on so fast that it was out of the power of art to stop it of which he expired the  0th in april i had the pleasure of his company at bristol for a few days with my father when amongst other agreeable schemes for this summers amusement he proposed to himself very great pleasure from paying mr shenstone a visit  but man proposes and god disposes i have lost a very good kind brother therefore hope those who were his friends will continue their friendship to me for his sake which i shall always endeavor to deserve to give you this melancholy information is a painful duty but it is what i am compelled to pay i can in some measure conceive the many afflicting recollections which will arise in your humane mind on this event your friendship and correspondence subsisted a considerable time and with reciprocal satisfaction he was unquestionably endowed with natural good sense well improved by education and reading of a lively pleasing fancy and a benevolent heart he was in short what your pen might most exquisitely describe but what mine is unequal to  i beg your acceptance of a ring in remembrance of him which shall be conveyed to birmingham the first opportunity my father desires his service my wife likewise joins with me in compliments i am sir  your obedient humble servant j whistler the editor can give no precise account of the dates of mr whistlers letters this last however from his brother must have been written in the year      that being the year which deprived him of so valuable a brother and mr shenstone of such an amiable friend and correspondent according to this calculation these letters of mr whistler should have come earlier in this collection but they did not come time enough into the editors hands the same reason must also be advanced for some other letters being misplaced in point of time but as the several subjects are independent of each other it is an error the editor presumes which the reader will more readily excuse   letter xxv a b esquire to w shenstone esquire dear mr shenstone i should with pleasure have obeyed your kind command and troubled you with a letter before this but that i waited to give you some account of your friends here i saw mr dodsley soon after i came to town he seems a very good sort of man and i like him much i believe he is quite satisfied with the success of his play for he is in good health and spirits the tragedy of cleone produced at covent garden theater mr wren i could not meet with till friday last when i found him very busy with half a dozen young anatomists for such i presume they were and pen ink and a ream of paper before them had i been free enough with your friend i should certainly have enquired what weighty discoveries they had been engaged in for they all looked prodigious wise when i entered the room but i was soon left teteatete with mr w  and then subjects of still greater importance such as plays operas etc etc were to be discussed without a compliment i think our friend improves upon acquaintance much but i wish him as you tell him less volatile to say the truth when you brought him to w  with k  he was so very alert that i was not but that he came with you much prejudiced in his favor however i find he has more merit than those overlively young gentlemen generally have and i doubt not but when you have pruned the luxuriancy of his sprightliness he will make a very good figure  i am sincerely sorry my congratulations on your having a place under government were premature but i cannot say i wish you as your friend griffith terms it polaury though i know it could not have the effect on you it so evidently has had on  but what any one could think due to cibbers merit mr shenstone ought to think beneath him  i have not the book you enquired for in yours nor any one that i can recollect from you the letters you were so good as to send me are safe locked up in my bureau and shall be returned when we meet i took the liberty of keeping them as i had no opportunity of sending to the leasowes before i set out for london if you have any commands here i hope you will oblige me with them and when you are at leisure let me hear from you but dodsley tells me you are reperusing your elegies he hopes for the press and i would not interrupt you from such engagements for the world as you have too long deprived the learned and tasteful the pleasure of admiring them  adieu dear mr shenstone believe me yours most sincerely a b the hurry of london to a man who purposes spending but seven weeks in it will i hope plead excuse for this scrawl  sunday jan      letter xxvi a b  esquire to w shenstone esquire i cannot but think you wrong my dear shenstone though placed as you seem to think now far from all resort of mirth save the cricket on the hearth you who have in your mind such an inexhaustible fund of amusement refined amusement in envying so inferior an animal as your friend a b  whose chief happiness even in london ought i shrewdly suspect to be that he can call you and one more worthy man you know who i mean his friends the pleasures of london i think i may say the innocent ones lose much of their power to please unless participated with those who have refined sense enough to enjoy and partake those delicate feelings with a friend  few such are ever to be found here and without such where is the society dissipation my friend is the general or chief amusement of this town to the generality of people and though it abounds with amusements and pleasures truly rational yet by a too frequent if not corrupted use these very pleasures become irrational such they are to the generality of my acquaintance and though i hope i do not pretend to be wiser than they yet i cannot feel a pleasure in going with them to entertainments of the noblest kind where i must not attend but join with them in endeavoring to draw off the attention of others to my companion or self for this reason then i generally go to a play etc by myself and by this very means lose much of the pleasure i should otherwise receive from it i wish with all my heart as the true englishmans phrase is that you could with convenience to yourself come to town but i will not pity you who can so well divert yourself in any place because you cannot come let wretches unblessed with a mind rich as yours with a sensibility capable of receiving delight from every common occurrence be sincerely pitied pitied without the ungenerous contempt that you intimate is so generally its attendant but be you my friend the envy of all who are meanly capable of so low a passion and the admiration of every honestlydistinguishing heart your mind my friend is rightly formed for true happiness be yourself and be happy  but i grow impertinently officious could you look into my heart such officiousness would from your goodnature meet with the pardon i think i might say it deserves for that i am so is that i can with the greatest sincerity subscribe myself  your faithful and affectionate friend a b  saturday night feb   excuse this scrawl and if a great deal of nonsense excuse that too for i have not time to peruse it the postbell now ringing  i purpose leaving london monday seennight oblige me with a line in answer to this before i set out if you can conveniently    letter xxvii a b  esquire to w shenstone esquire dear mr shenstone to answer your kind letter as i wish is not in my power let it suffice then to remind you that where the heart really feels most silence is the only eloquence she can use  why will you not agree with me in the want i complained of had i not felt it i should not have troubled you with it what answer can you make when i tell you that my choicest friend lord d  from a tenderness of sentiment never frequents the amusements you and i admire and think innocent ones find me another friend like him capable of delicately feeling and participating every rational pleasure yourself excepted to be the companion i wished for and i will grant your plea of indecision till you can do that come over to my side of the question  as to affairs in town i will not utter a syllable concerning them till i see you here only i must tell you that london daily walks nearer marylebone than you or i could have believed so corpulent a lady able to do  the ramblers and world i read this last summer and was much entertained with both though i think the former greatly the superior and had i not thought it presumption in me to recommend any author to you i perhaps might in worse language have urged your reading them as you have so kindly mine  i have sent your pencils per bearer but must beg to keep la pompadour some time longer as i have not quite done with her nor indeed is it fit so great a lady should travel but in a carriage come and fetch her then in your chaise or we shall be reckoned greater boors by the polite countrymen than we already are  adieu be happiness ever yours  your affectionate friend a b  all here join in best compliments to the leasowes  march   p s the underwritten quotation from thomson struck mr b  so strongly as he passed by the leasowes some time ago that he hopes mr shenstone will excuse his troubling him with it as nearer to this farm you made approach he polished nature with a finer hand yet on her beauties durst not art encroach it is arts alone these beauties to expand in graceful dance immingled over the land pan pales flora and pomona played an happy place       letter xxviii a b  esquire to w shenstone esquire dear mr shenstone you make me very happy by the kind turn you give to the unfashionable reserve i told you in my last i labor under i am sincerely desirous of being dear to you and if the  eadem velle atque eadem nolle is a good omen of a lasting friendship i have good reasons to hope that the names of w shenstone and a b  will ever be mutually esteemed by each other for without meaning a compliment but to my own judgment i really think to know what you like or dislike some few persons excepted is sufficient to make me do the same but i beg for the future when you mention the valuables london robs the country of at this season you will not immediately add that lord p  is just set out from n  on his way here  apropos you tell me you are busy in regulating your library will not you laugh at me if i draw a comparison and tell you that i am engaged at present in a similar affair regulating the friends i henceforward design admitting into my hearts inmost recess you i dare say even in your library have admitted some rubbish you will now throw out how much then must i who from a very child have been a kind of enthusiast in friendship have to cleanse from my esteem indeed i find upon examination i have been much out in my collection and have ranked many fugacious pamphlets as johnson calls them as firstrate authors but i shall make a total rummage and hope for the future my taste will be more refined indeed i do not fear it for i have chosen your worship sole librarian of the place and to say the truth i find you so delicate a gentleman that you have routed every other living soul my own nearest relations excepted nor can i find that you will admit any one else to enter the poor cell you have the charge of but lord d  well well you are quite right i shall have enough to do to value you two as i ought you two shall be my study and if i dont improve enough from reading you it will be my fault for the pamphlets i shall dip into them occasionally at an idle hour unless a female one demands my closer application but i promise you i shall be very cautious in my choice of her  i am much obliged to you for offering to introduce me to the acquaintance of dr g  i should eagerly lay hold of the favor but that i purpose leaving london on monday the   th of this month and shall not have time to pay him the attention i owe every friend of mr shenstones  i have from your recommendation read the history of la pompadour and like it very well it seems authentic though not much to the honor of the dame or louis le grand  i shall expect two letters from your worship in answer to my last nonsense and this and pray good sir do be not so very concise mr shenstone believe me is worse company than any man when he is silent most people know how agreeable every word he says is and when he is pleased to be mute cannot but be uneasy according to this you will say your friend wishes you to kill yourself with talking not so  but he refers the whole to your better judgment who knows best when your modest humility does not too much interfere how to do every thing with the best grace  if you have by you your ode on autumn or damons bower and care to trust them by the bearer you will do me a great favor in sending them if you can venture out of your agreeable shell at the leasowes and provided you are preparing your elegies for the press will bring them with you not letting the favor you do us delay the pleasure you will give the polite world in publishing them we shall think ourselves happy in accommodating you with a warm room pen ink and paper in this part of the world  i return the duchess of somersets letters which i have perused with great pleasure particularly those which give the honor due to my friend mr shenstone  you have the joint good wishes of our present contracted fireside  believe me dear sir your very affectionate a b   letter xxix a b  esquire to w shenstone esquire dear sir the compliment you make me of desiring me to correct abridge etc etc the sheets you have so obligingly sent me puts me so much in mind of molieres reading his plays to his old woman before he produced them to the stage that i can hardly persuade myself though i am but just turned twentyseven and have a good pair of mr dehennics favorite lambskin breeches on that i am not of the other sex and at least seventy as such i have presumed to give you my opinion freely which you will find first interspersed on little bits of paper among your proofsheets and i desire you will not esteem it in any other light i am vain enough of the friendship you have distinguished me with and i desire you will not let your kind partiality make me more unworthy of it than i am by adding to my vanity as a poet i admire and as a friend i love you but you must not apply to me for what i am not able with any credit to myself to oblige you in i am glad you sent dodsleys fourth volume as i parted with my set of his poems this summer to a friend who begged them of me am much obliged to you for the print of your grove and though i think it makes not near the figure on paper so lovely a scene would be imagined to do shall value it much  i ought to make many apologies for keeping the books you were so kind as to lend me so long but in such estimation do i hold every thing that comes from the leasowes that a common attention to it will not satisfy me and i cannot readily part with it in haste this then must excuse me to you and i flatter myself it will as i know you are my friend  adieu dear mr shenstone the sooner you favor us with your company the more you will oblige us all  your very faithful and affectionate a b   letter xxx mr dodsley to w shenstone esquire dec  0 dear mr shenstone i am very sorry you have been so much indisposed since i left you bleeding vomiting purging the doctor and the disease are too many enemies for a man to struggle with at once and i heartily wish you joy of your victory against such apparent odds i am sure i have very little reason to suppose you make sickness a plea for laziness since you have taken infinitely more pains on my account than you seem disposed to take on your own pray think of this and learn to love yourself as well as you do your friends pay as much regard to your own fame as you do to theirs and the world will be obliged to you  i received a letter from mr eaves he tells me the fables are finished and that they will come up to town this week i shall be very glad of it for i find even then that i shall not be able to publish before february you tell me the portrait is only delayed till you can see alcock  can it be delayed to a more uncertain time you do not imagine how many friends are longing to see it and here the winter is passing away and i am losing the pleasure of obliging your friends as well as my own i hope i shall see mr h  when he comes to town i expect mr d  soon after new years day  would to god you would come with him now is your time to make interest for preferment as merit seems at present the best recommendation to favor come and give the ministry an opportunity of doing themselves credit with the compliments of the season and my best wishes in all seasons i conclude and am  dear sir ever affectionately yours r dodsley  letter xxxi mr dodsley to w shenstone esquire dear mr shenstone hoping by this time you are in a fair way of recovery i venture to write to you indeed i was extremely alarmed by the account dr ash gave me of you in his first letter and also by a line from miss h  but by a second letter from the doctor and by a note afterward from mr baskerville i received some hopes of your recovery though not enough to encourage me to write to yourself for fear of the worst i have been extremely uneasy indeed and still continue so pray let molly or somebody give me a line to satisfy me how you are dont offer to write yourself if it be the least uneasy to you i will be satisfied with hearing from any hand that you are better and when you are able to write yourself i shall be happy lord s  is come to town and in a day or two i purpose to wait on him i have not yet seen sir h e  i think i had better see lord s  first god preserve you and send you a speedy recovery  i am ever most affectionately yours r dodsley feb    letter xxxii mr dodsley to w shenstone esquire dear sir i am sorry i hurried my essay out of your hands before you had done with it but if i think of publishing my fables next october or november it is high time i should put both to press now that the printer may have good weather to print in and that the work may have time to dry after it is finished before the books are bound but as it happens i cannot begin till the latter end of this month as the printer is not at leisure however i have put my plates in hand and they are going on as fast as possible i never received mr alcocks drawings so i have got two others executed of somewhat a different design i will not put the essay in hand till the last which may perhaps be about july as i shall be very desirous of its having the advantage of your corrections but am i not to hope for a new fable or two from you you see how i dwindle in my expectations but pray dont let me be quite disappointed i propose if possible to finish the printing of my fables before i set out on my northern expedition mr m  and his lady will be at nottingham about the latter end of august they have wished i would meet them there and in their return to town bring them round by the leasowes mr burke author of the sublime and beautiful has also a strong inclination to meet us there so that possibly we may be happy enough to spend a day with you another must be spent at lord lytteltons as they are both acquainted with him and a third at birmingham i shall hate the name of d  as long as i live he is crooked in all his ways but the devil will set strait with him one day or other i have not seen a page of mr percys novel and therefore cannot at all explain it to you but i suppose he makes no secret of it i wish mr graves would finish his  and will you really consent to an exchange of pictures upon my word you make but a sorry bargain for yourself however to give you as little reason as may be to regret your compliance i will sit to one of our best artists and to supply the want of merit in the original will endeavor to give as much as i can to the copy if you have any thing to suggest on this subject as you seem to hint you will be so good as to let me have a line because as soon as i am able to get abroad which i hope will be in a few days i intend to consult with reynolds the present sir joshua reynolds about it ay i forgot to tell you that i have been confined this month with the gout every man has his d  n that is mine i am glad your likeness is a strong one and i think the attitude you are drawn in is a good one pray is that the picture you intend for me the writer of tristram shandy is a mr stern one of the prebendaries of york as to mr baskervilles bible he will easily be dissuaded from the marginal ornaments but the title page is a favorite and for my part i have not much objection to it mr webbs book on painting and painters is reckoned ingenious and if you like the subject will be worth your perusal ancient and modern rome i also think a good poem my compliments to mr hylton and all friends  i am ever dear sir most faithfully yours r dodsley  letter xxxiii mr dodsley to w shenstone esquire june    dear mr shenstone i was yesterday searching for figures for your two niches  i have found three pair the figures good that will do as to size viz the antinous i mentioned and the apollo with his arm over his head a flora and a ceres and a homer and virgil the antinous and apollo are two feet high flora and ceres twentythree inches and homer and virgil twentyone these last are each of them leaning upon a pedestal on one of which in basso relievo is troy in flames on the other romulus and remus sucking a wolf these are both pretty figures and dont you think them better ornaments for a library and more suitable companions for sappho than either of the others a line by the return of the post will just give me time to get which of them you choose finished and sent to you before i set off for nottingham for i find i must go thither before i come to the leasowes but i shall stay only a few days i had a letter from my friend mr m  by the last post who is at nottingham and i find him wavering in his resolutions about coming by the leasowes i am glad you like my design for the picture and how agreeably you have contrived to flatter me about it but say what you will i shall have a picture of mr shenstone you will have one only of dodsley and a shenstone by alcock will certainly be more valuable than a dodsley even by reynolds i read to him that part of your letter which related to him he desires his compliments and would be glad if you came to town that you sat to him i hope i shall be able to send the picture to you before i set out on my journey but it is not yet finished  i am affectionately yours r dodsley  letter xxxiv mr dodsley to w shenstone esquire june    dear mr shenstone how much am i obliged to you for the pains you have taken in translating la mottes discourse on fable and though i fancy you will find upon comparing the two that i have made a good deal of use of it i shall be very glad to have more of it interwoven if you shall think i have not sufficiently extracted the essence of it i must must own my pride or call it my folly if you please would rather choose to prefix somewhat of my own on that subject than servilely adopt the thoughts of a frenchman though i acknowledge them to be very ingenious besides i have had the hardiness to differ with him in some respects which makes it still more improper to take his whole discourse proceed therefore if you please in correcting my essay and interweave with it as much more of la motte as you may think proper if you defer this till i come down which i wish you would not pray in the mean time think of half a dozen new fables that we may not have too much to embarrass us when together my face is quite finished and i believe very like i fancy i shall send it together with the figures on monday seennight but i shall not be able to set out myself till monday fortnight and staying a week or ten days at nottingham and mansfield will detain me from the leasowes till the latter end of next month if the picture should be turned yellowish by being packed up mr reynolds advises that it be set in the sun for two hours which will quite recover it why did you leave the choice of your two figures to me how could you put me under such a difficulty if i have done wrong you will suffer for it and say what you will i have not sufficient firmness of taste to direct me right besides i do not exactly remember the niches it is therefore your fault to trust me and if i have erred your duty to forgive me i have ordered the homer and virgil to be bronzed they are very pretty figures and if you have as you say no other objection to them but the want of two or three inches more of height i hope some means may be found to obviate so small a deficiency i should not however have ventured to send them but that you seemed at last to acquiesce in their being sent i think however i have been somewhat happy in my urns and i am not without hopes that you will approve the whole cargo the foliovirgil will come in the same package i feel myself very happy in the thoughts of seeing you soon and will hasten the day as much as is in my power i hope mr baskerville will be quite ready for me i shall send him the paper in a fortnight i am  faithfully yours r dodsley  letter xxxv mr dodsley to w shenstone esquire june    dear sir your picture really affords me many pleasing reflections and i have ordered the frame to be full gilt whilst i am out of town that it may not give you any unpleasing ones i am going to derby and nottingham for three weeks or a month i cannot stay longer as i must attend to the press having put my fables in hand for a new edition i have last monday sent you percys novel i sent it unbound as we had not time to bind it it will not be published till the beginning of next winter i have sent you the fables bound in morocco and the common edition in boards for your future corrections but i would not have you begin till you see the next edition as i hope you will find it altered somewhat for the better i will send you one of them as soon as it is printed you will find likewise in the parcel soame jennynss works and a pamphlet or two also the fables with your drawings in them many of which i like extremely that at the head of the second i approve the least but those that are placed in the life i think should be transferred to the head and tailpieces of the fables  but there will be time enough to talk of this hereafter as to italics i believe i shall steer a middle course and make use only of a few i send you a list of some statues about the same size with that pair you have demosthenes and cicero lock and newton chaucer and spencer shakespeare and milton when you have fixed upon which pair you will have you will let me know whether you will have them white or bronzed and what kind of a bronze  i really dont know how to appease mr w  i told him i was very sorry i had pretended to meddle with his ode and begged his pardon he is still unappeased writes me another angry letter and desires me to give him my reasons for every alteration this it is impossible for me to do as i have forgot how it originally was and i really think it of very little consequence as no name appears to it  mr stuart is just now with me and desires his compliments he thinks of seeing your place the latter end of the summer and believes the attorney general mr pratt will be with him i have just been struck with the bad news that mr  has lost his wife you will perceive i write in a hurry mr stuart sits by me  i am ever affectionately yours r dodsley  letter xxxvi w shenstone esquire to mr hull at birmingham i desire my compliments to mr hull and miss morrison with many thanks for the pleasure i received from last nights play a hasty and imperfect compilation of some scenes on the subject of rosamond which however laid the groundwork of the present tragedy acted at covent garden theater the public may easily discern how fully the author has availed himself of the kind and judicious hints contained in the letter before us it was indeed acted with great spirit and as far as i could judge afforded the audience no small satisfaction  not perhaps equal to what they derived from the appearance of the dun cow etc introduced in a pantomime performed the same evening for that is hardly to be expected  i think the play has now so much good in it that it may be worth mr hulls while to give it a few more finishing touches suppose a confessor or friar either out of hatred to the queen view to his own advancement or any selfish motive which he might explain in a short soliloquy persuaded rosamond to aspire to the throne and to urge the king to a divorce that rosamond should avow her abhorrence of such injustice to the queen intimating that her love had no other object than the kings person and heroic virtues that this refusal should affront the friar who in revenge should inform the queen that rosamond actually had those very intentions with which he had been endeavoring to inspire her etc this would throw more plot into the play which it wants would more sufficiently account for the queens sudden change from a mild character to a revengeful one and as mr hull thinks the play too short would add two new scenes some further improvements i would recommend in the close and a few more places but mr hulls further attention to the play will render it needless to point them out to him  if you should ever complete this undertaking to your liking and produce the piece on a londonstage i would recommend that you should by all means give it a double title in the printed bills namely henry the second or the fall of rosamond  i should esteem it as a favor if mr hull would send me down a copy of the prologue and epilogue as they were spoken which i will not communicate without his permission either his or miss morrisons muse seems to favor them at a minutes warning  mr hodgetts with whom i am at present would be glad that mr hull would dine here about two and so should i if it be no way inconvenient to him  i had almost forgot to thank you for the stanzas you left at the leasowes when i was on a visit to hagley they are well constructed for the occasion and the idea seems to arise from humane sensibility warmed with honest indignation  i am very affectionately yours w shenstone

garden theater london the leasowes oct         dear mr hull if i recollect aright both you and ned alcock were here this last autumn on the evening when my fish ponds had been robbed and the fish destroyed you were an eyewitness of the circumstances therefore cannot but retain them in your memory i find i have been arraigned of lenity by several conscientiouslyupright neighbors  i have screened a robber from justice   i have given encouragement to future thefts etc such are the aspersions wherewith i have been loaded i make a material distinction between a robber and a pilferer nor can i assign the former appellation to a poor wretch who in his hunger has taken two or three fishes or as many loaves it is true i would rather have given more than the value of them to have prevented my finny friends being disturbed in or taken away from their elemental habitation it is also as true that in my first warmth on the report that the fellow had bruised the poor creatures to death against the stumps and roots of trees i could not only have delivered him over to justice but have been almost induced to become myself his punisher but when that warmth submitted to cool reflection i felt it impossible to resist his argument of having a wife with five children at home and not a doit to procure them a meal i verily believe too he spoke the truth poverty and affliction seemed to work and plead within him and his words were the words of nature  i cannot be so severe against these petty misdemeanors as many are nor can i though i revere the call of justice be a rigorous supporter of its claims except in atrocious cases beside what had it availed me to have consigned the offender to the power of a magistrate rather say what pain and inconvenience should i not have entailed on myself i should have had the trouble of attending the examination have had the fellow imprisoned many days and the additional mortification of traveling perhaps to warwick or worcester in order to convict him and after all no restitution is made for my loss though it were ten times more valuable than a whole draught of fishes there is surely something deficient in our laws concerning the meum and tuum the person robbed not only abides the loss without amends but is even put to expense as well as inconvenience to get the robber punished  then again the wife and five children  the poor fellow subsists chief part of the year only by carrying newspapers round the country had he been shut up what was to have supported the ragged family meanwhile i am beside inclined to think that half a crown and a little wholesome admonition that is if he be not a practiced and stubborn offender might go as far toward amending his morals as an acquaintance with the inside of a prison and the conversation of such associates as he might find there  i have suffered myself sometimes to doubt the excellence of our laws relative to life and death notwithstanding i know it has been asserted by many people that they are wiser than those of any other nation what then is the man who takes a few guineas from you on the highway on a level with him who commits a deliberate murder and is there no punishment to be found more adequate to the first transgression than taking away the life surely one example made by a visible brand a mark of disgrace which could never be washed away would more avail toward the prevention of future crimes than half the executions in the kingdom which have now from two great frequency lost the chief part of their purpose and terror the punishment which was inflicted by a regent in some part of the east i think the circumstance is related in the arabian nights entertainments on a judge who had been induced by gold to give an unjust decision is admirable the brand placed on his habitation in legible characters  here lives a corrupt judge was in the highest degree consonant to justice inasmuch as it made the crime its own punishment  i have been led into these reflections by finding how severely i have been arraigned only for having been an innocent defrauder of the law so have troubled you with them but here i come to a conclusion you are at liberty to draw what inferences you please from or make what objections you like to my opinion  i am now to thank you for the anecdotes you have given me as well as for the perusal of the

myself beholden to you for having made me acquainted with the reality of the two writers dr lancaster and henry i have admired them both in their pages but knew only their names in fact when i first read the essay on delicacy i imagined the name of lancaster to be fictitious and that the work might be the production of the author of sir thomas fitzoshornes letters there is great spirit fine sentiment and true elegance of style throughout and my friend dodsleys preserving it in his fugitive pieces is truly meritorious it well deserves to be rescued from oblivion but what a pity that your uncle does not make a more frequent use of his pen the world does not abound too much in such writers how much likewise is it to be lamented that a man of such abilities should lie concealed in an obscure part of essex he should have remained in the world  that is i mean for the sake of the world to his own happiness probably retirement was most conducive it is most certain that no men are fit for solitude but those who find the source of amusement and employment in themselves fancy reflection and a love of reading are indispensably necessary for such a situation it is downright lunacy for a man who has passed his life in a comptinghouse or a shop who possesses possibly but a moderate share of natural understanding that understanding too not cultivated by education and who has never known what it is was to look into a book  it is i repeat downright lunacy for such a man to think of retiring he knows not the fatigue he is going to encounter he will want employment for his hours most probably may shorten his existence and while he retains it it will be one continued state of apathy if not disorder  henry you say is a mr griffith of the county of kilkenny in ireland a friend brought me over the letters of henry and frances when they were first published in dublin they are most admirably clever and comprehensive i have enjoyed and reenjoyed them and while i have admired the writings have loved the writers in the private character you have given me of this amiable pair i feel as if i were acquainted with them before the information received from you i have sometimes suffered myself to think and even communicated to an intimate friend or two that there was a similitude of disposition between henry and myself but when i look on your description of him i entertain much doubt in the active parts of his philosophy his perseverance and resolution i fear i am far behind him he is a man qualified for any state or situation business or amusement solitude or a crowd  and you have spent months with him at kilkenny  i give you joy of such an happiness  again i thank you for the enclosures you are ever and anon sending and am  dear mr hull yours very affectionately w shenstone  letter xxxix w shenstone esquire to mr hull at covent garden theater sir i am greatly obliged both to you and miss morrison for the ballads you were so good as to enclose to me the speed you have used in sending them testifies the reality of that delight you seemed to express at the leasowes when i first communicated my friend dr percys design i sent them directly to him he has begun to print off his venerable collection ancient poetry now published in three volumes the universal estimation and encouragement of which work sufficiently testifies its excellence with an eye to the publication of it sometime next winter one of your ballads is truly beautily and extremely proper for his purpose it has that naivete which is so very essential in ballads of all kind and which requires no more than that sublime or elegant or tender sentiments be expressed in a simple and unaffected manner  sentimental language would be no ill term for it or perhaps the essay before dodsleys fables does not improperly style it the voice of sentiment in opposition to the language of reflection  as to the other miss m  well distinguishes that the merit of it is almost wholly confined to the sentiment at last this is both natural and tender and would she take the pains to newwrite the whole on this account for even this sentiment is not expressed so very simply as one could wish it i dare say it is in her power to render it very pleasing i know not how far i am singular but as i love to avail myself of different words to bundle up ideas in different parcels it is become habitual to me to call that a ballad which describes or implies some action on the other hand i term that a song which contains only an expression of sentiment according to this account i believe one of your pieces would appear a ballad and the other a song  the playhouse coronations answer the purpose of all those who choose to compound the matter betwixt indolence and curiosity mr garrick has given a very genteel turn to this taste among the citizens in his epilogue to the new play epilogue to the tragedy of hecuba produced that year at drury lane theater i have not yet seen this performance and should be glad if you would give me some account of its appearance on the stage why does not your dr lancaster the editors uncle complete his essay upon delicacy i read it since i wrote last in dodsleys fugitive pieces and think it mighty well deserves the labor necessary to its continuation  it is true that specimens of wit or humor have been dispensed this winter but sparingly from the press and even there in political pamphlets where i am least inclined to seek them but we must swim with the tide if we would collect the shells and corals that it leaves behind accordingly i have read two or three of these pamphlets which have answered my expectations should any other appear that strikes you be so good as to enclose it to me in a frank as to lavinia or other dramatic schemes i must defer them till i see you again at the leasowes which whenever it happens will afford me pleasure being very faithfully and affectionately  your most obedient servant w shenstone christmaseve      ballad i referred to in the above letter the bells they rang all in the morn and allen he rose full soon sad tidings were heard for allen to hear that mary would wed ere noon then allen he called on thomass name and thomas came at his call make ready a coffin and winding shroud for mary shall see my fall when last we parted with brimful eye rightloving she made a vow but richard has twice as many sheep and mary forgets me now then bear me to the greengrassbank where we did kiss and play and tell her the rain that made it so green has washed my kisses away the bridegroom led the bride so fair the priest he came anon but thomas he brought his dear friends corse or ere the wedding was done he laid him on the greengrassbank where they did kiss and play and told her the rain that made it so green had washed his kisses away when she beheld poor allens dead corse her maiden blush was lost she faded as though on april morn a primrose nipt by a frost then all beneath one fatal stone together they buried were false maidens who break your plighted vow take heed ye come not there ballad ii referred to in the foregoing letter one april evening when the sun had journeyd down the sky sad marian with looks of woe walked forth full heavily tears trickled down her faded cheek soft sighs her bosom heaved soft sighs revealed her inward woe alas she would been deceived oh what a wretch am i become a luckless lass said she the cowslip and the violet blue have now no charms for me the golden sun that daily shines and glittering decks the sky brings no relief to my distress or pleasure to my eye this little river when i dressed has served me for a glass but now it only shows how love has ruined this poor face what charms could happy lucy boast to fix thy wavering mind what charms in lucy more than me ungrateful could thou find have thou forgot the tender vows which at my feet were made yet i will not spend my dying hour thy falsehood to upbraid but what remaining breath i have shall intercede with heaven that all those broken vows to me at last may be forgiven yet one poor boon before i die i would of thee require and do not thou refuse to grant a wretchs last desire when you with lucy shall affix the happy marriageday oh do not over my greengrassgrave inhuman take thy way letter xl w shenstone esquire to miss m  the leasowes dec        dear miss m  i ought to have returned thanks for your agreeable account of the excursion to chepstow some time ago but these are duties which i do not always perform so soon as i ought  you know i dont  neither will i waste my time and paper in apologizing for a failing which you are so ready to forgive convinced that i am not less grateful on that account  i have great joy in reading these little pleasurable travels in a private letter related as yours are without formality describing with ease and simplicity every little occurrence as it falls out i can journey with you in imagination and partake every trivial difficulty and every delight you are fond of these little parties of pleasure as they are called and in you it is by no means reprovable but in general they are very dangerous to young folks you have means and time at your own disposal your party is small and select both in point of reputation and understanding you likewise turn your excursion to some advantage you make observations on all you see form nice distinctions between different places points and characters and draw just conclusions from them  but as i said before these parties too often are hazardous the mind once indulged in them is apt to covet them too often they are sometimes the means of drawing a female into improper company they encroach on means and time neither of which probably can with propriety be bestowed they have their source in dissipation are continually attended with hazard and too often end in the worst of mischiefs in short i would wish all young folks who have neither leisure nor money at command to shut their ears against the very name of a party of pleasure  more than once in my life i have been solicited by friends to visit foreign climes i had an invitation of this kind lately but it is now too late at least i think so  besides why should a man go so far for objects of curiosity who has seen too little of his own country many parts of england wales and scotland equally i should think deserve our admiration and we need not risque winds and waves to which i feel some objection numbers of our traveling gentry peregrinate too early in life before the mind is sufficiently formed to make proper observations on what they see and hear  a friend once related an anecdote which is apposite to my subject a very young man of good natural understanding and heir to an affluent fortune would needs be one of these inconsiderate travelers in the course of his adventures he fell into company in naples with some welltravelled and wellinformed foreigners they were conversing on what they had seen in england and some little difference in opinion arising about the architecture of windsorcastle they naturally referred themselves to the young englishman for decision with much confusion and hesitation he was compelled to confess he had never seen the building in question the company with true foreign politeness only testified their admiration in a silent smile  but the reflection instantly struck and pained the young gentleman the result was that he returned for england within two days rationally determined to instruct himself in the knowledge of his own country before he pryed into those afar off his reflection and determination did equal credit to his understanding  our friend hull has as usual been amusing us with as good a drama as our neighboring town can give encouragement to but says he returns no more i know many who will be sorry on this account he has not departed however without having excited curiosity in a very peculiar way on a small plan indeed but to a very commendable purpose he enticed with him his two principal actresses miss morrison and miss ibbot both possessed of great merit in their profession some few of his band two voices and gave an evenings entertainment of singing and reading at the little town of stourbridge some few miles off the profits devoted to the assistance of a tradesman who had suffered under repeated misfortunes the success i hear more than answered his expectations the little assemblyroom was crowded and with much good company a slight cold made me fearful of being out late but the particulars were given me by a neighboring clergyman who was present the pieces selected for reading were wellchosen i do not remember the whole number but i recollect that miss carter s ode to wisdom prior s henry and emma and grays elegy in a country churchyard were amongst them the latter gave particular satisfaction my friend told me to the gentlemen of the pulpit of whom he counted seven the whole was received with great approbation you are to observe that hull and his party so far from proposing any emolument to themselves declined even to be reimbursed the expenses they were at in going and the master of the assemblyroom gave the use of it from this confined instance of such a scheme i am apt to think an union of poetry and music executed on a larger plan would be an admirable twohoursentertainment either in a public room or private family  i enclose a piece of writing which a friend of mine sent me in a frank last week i think the subject calculated for your liking it was planned and partly written in mr hoares lovely grounds at stourton in wiltshire and the thought suggested by surveying from an eminence there a woody vale wherein alfred is reported to have once concealed himself from the danes send it back when you have done with it  adieu dear miss m  yours very faithfully w shenstone  cadwal a legendary tale in two parts part i dark december was the month the air was dank and chill when cadwals weary foot had reached the summit of the hill beneath whose ample verge he wont to labor at the plough and to relieve his fathers age bedew his infant brow when eighteen years had over him passed he left his rustic home soresmote with grief in distant grounds and strangerfields to roam twelve winters had his exile seen when lo his bosom burns again to clasp his fathers knees and homeward he returns and now descending to the vale with slow and trembling feet at this new sight his native soil the pulses fluttering beat and now with penetrating eye he pierces the close dell where in his thatchbeshelterd cot his sire did whilom dwell yet in his sad and troubled look such terror might ye see as when we almost wish to shun the thing we wish should be he pryed here he pryed there no cottage could he spy nor smallest trace of human tread appeared to his eye no monarch of the feathered brood was heard aloud to crow nor labored ox the vocal air awaken with his low in strange amazement and suspense awhile benumbed he stood then fell despairing on the earth and wept and waild aloud his bitter cries an hermit drew forth from his lonely cell whose plyant sense was quick to feel afflictions poignant yell compassion held him mute at first while as he pondered him with fixed eye where natures floods upswelled to the brim then thus  my son your plaints i heard they smote me to the heart to me without reserve or fear the weighty cause impart deepversd in sorrows heavy task full many a weary hour right well i know what aggravates and what abates its power closepent within restraining bounds the river foams and roars tumultuous boils with mighty heaves and wounds its kindred shores the load removed that choked its course the violence subsides the tumult lessens by degrees and smooth the current glides give then the struggling griefs to flow which thy clogged heart oppress each word will take a part away and make the burden less old cadwal here distraught i seek here cadwal dwelt of yore here here his quiet cottage rose but now is here no more old cadwal seekst thou hapless man new torments must thou have  beneath this venerable elm behold the rustics grave oh i wretch accursed i was the cause i reft him of his breath i robbed these fields of cadwal s worth i brought him to his death was he not to his various kin unworthy i alone was he not guardian comforter friend father all in one what honest hind that near him toiled but of his store partook was he not to the needy swain as to the mead the brook did he not deal to all around his smile as well as care not even the sparrow of the hedge but in his love had share and wretch accursed i was the cause i reft him of his breath i robbed these fields of cadwal s worth i brought him to his death too rigidly perchance my son thyself thou do accuse and heapest on thy burdened heart unnecessary woes ah how severe the punishment when we ourselves arraign and hatred often and malice self inflict a milder pain less harshly censure thy offense some youthful warmth i ween and give it to mine ears in terms soft candid and serene here on this bank repose awhile and bid these tumults cease with thine i will mix my social tears and sooth returning peace ah father this thine holy love embitters what i feel unwittingly thou addst a sting to sorrows thou would heal here on this bank what precious hours i have known in days of youth listening the precepts that he gave of wisdom and of truth here in the sweetlytranquil eve days rugged labor done he would tell how good and glorious men lifes arduous race had run what tides of blood had washed these lands which we in peace had tilled and how the faithful rustic once great alfred here concealed but oh my griefbewilderd mind from reason wanders far and with vague fancies idly mocks thy kind thy pious care heed not my son  use any means that may assuage thy pain it is the privilege of woe at random to complain and who of patient sympathy the liberal largess scant withold a bounty dear i ween as wealth can shower on want cadwal part ii old cadwal here distraught i seek  ah me this wayward heart that dared oppose a fathers power that dared his counsel thwart but emma s charms had won my love and made it all her own i sought not copious flocks and meads i sought content alone and oh so sweetly she conformed to all i wished or said you would have sworn our hearts as twins were for each other made and was it holy father say was it a crime to love or to my earlyplighted vows unchanged and steady prove matilda s lofty friends in store of fleeces did abound and ample sheaves enriched their fields and orchards rose around and these possessions every hour were poured into mine ear to count them over my father made his morn and evening care sure if he any failing had twas too fond love for me hence sprung the wish that of her flocks i might the master be and as he willed and as he bade oh that i could have done but emma s charms had won my love and made it all her own say father ought i at the church have joined matilda s hand when love and truth that should attend were not at my command her spacious granaries  to me they no allurement were my emma s lowroofd dairyhut to me was dearer far why after large possessions seek my father did not want of copious tributes from the field his barns were nothing scant but twas his will  and oh that i could have that will obeyed without the guilt of broken vows or emma s peace betrayed now that my frowardness of heart has brought him to his end for this before yon hallowed spot in duteous wise i will bend for this will daily wet the sod with my repentant eye nor ever from this solitude to fairer refuge hie son quoth the sire  and cast a look as chilled the youth all over  while minutes passed ere vital warmth his senses did restore  son quoth the sage thy doubts suspend their rising tumult check  it is thy father clasps thee close and weeps upon thy neck long have i held thee in discourse with pentup agony now let my gushing tears have way they are blessings showrd on thee charmed with thy duteous excellence thy strength of filial love my full forgiveness let these streams and warm embraces prove and oh might thou forgive the cause that drove thee from thy home soresmote with grief in distant grounds and strangerfields to roam might i forgive  oh father such unseemly terms restrain might i forgive  it is enough i see thee once again but said thou not beneath yon elm  my dearest son i did there have i marked the chosen spot there made my latest bed of thee bereft what booted it to feed the furrowed plain or what from autumns fruitful lap to heap the ripened grain whom had i then to cheer my steps in summers sultry rays for whom should then the social hearth in winterevning blaze my house my barns i left at large to moulder and decay yon humble tenement i raised my ages only stay enough for me who meant forlorn to pass lifes lagging eve my task to meditate and pray my punishment to grieve for oh my son too late i felt this truth within my heart that to compel the filial mind is not a parents part and hence this penitential garb and hence these silver hairs whose hoary length the sad recluse or pensive hermit wears dear honored father droop no more this on my bended knee i crave  i claim  resign thy griefs oh cast them all on me with unremitting love and care thy sorrows i will assuage and with obsequious duty tend the remnant of thy age arise my son and to my cell together let us wend let us beneath one roof embrace ere yet my days shall end and shall the thought of emmas love no more suffuse thine eye nor chide thy father for her loss  she is buried in that sigh what wondrous bliss to virtuous minds will heaven not deign to lend within my homely hut my son there all thy sorrows end there there once more still sweetlyfair thy emma shall thou see within my homely hut she dwells my ages comfort she her father dead i filled his place the guardian of her youth i now restore her to thy love thy constancy and truth young cadwal waited not for more but to his emma flew where locked awhile in close embrace each to the other grew from incoherent words and sighs such wondrous transports brake far more than honeyd eloquence with all her tongues could speak and now with strong enquiring look they search each others eye and ask if what they see be true and doubt the real joy and now the fathers quickened steps they greet with bended grace and with uplifted eyes adore and bless his reverend face now by this hallowed eve i vow probably christmaseve as december is mentioned in the opening of the tale  soon as the mass be done the next ensuing holy day the priest shall make ye one and ye shall live so heaven permit to cast one gleam of light athwart your fathers gathering eve or ere he sink in night or ere beneath yon aged elm he is numbered with the dead the chosen spot where his own hands have made his latest bed but while some hours of life are lent by gratitude and prayer and memory of my errors past those errors i will repair and often as i recount them over thy steady faith i will praise and for my dearest boy once more the social hearth shall blaze age even as youth thou see my son is liable to fall and selfreproof and penitence alike beseem us all letter xli mr m  g  to w shenstone esquire with fragments of ancient poetry printed at edinburgh in the year    0 edinburgh june       0 dear sir it gives me the greatest pleasure that i have an opportunity of conveying to a person of your taste the enclosed fragments of ancient caledonian poesy  full many a gem of purest ray serene the dark unfathomed caves of ocean bear full many a rose is born to blush unseen and waste its sweetness on the desert air see grays elegy in a country churchyard  but thanks to the taste and care of the ingenious translator that we have not to lament the utter loss of those pieces which reflect so much luster on the memory of the original bards here we see poets framed by the hand of nature their manners rude and uncultivated as the wilds they inhabited unacquainted with aristotle and horace but pouring the i had almost said involuntary effusions of minds filled with true poetic fire deeply interested in the themes they sung devoid of all rules they attach and warm the heart by an amazing though secret power the constant effect of copying nature but copying her justly to which the languid efforts of art bear scarce so interesting a proportion as the shadow to the substance  from the general structure of the poetry from the names of the persons celebrated in it and the hints of the costume scattered here and there it would appear that these poems were composed about the time that the ancient bards of iceland and the other northern countries made so great a figure in poetry or perhaps their date may reach back beyond the time of christianity being preached in our islands hence it will follow that our ancestors were rising by surprising efforts to catch the fairest flowers of parnassus while the polite regions of europe resounded with polemic theology and monkish nonsense this becomes the more probable when we reflect that scarce any trace of christianity is to be found in these pieces and no trace of the names that prevailed after the ninth century instead of which the names appear entirely pagan and numberless hints are taken from the predatory life our ancestors particularly those of the islands and northwest coasts of scotland led before and at the first preaching of the gospel among them a critical examination of the original language would help to throw some light on this conjecture as well as the publication of pieces of greater length which may follow these first specimens it is not however to be doubted that the many fragments still preserved amongst our highlanders of their ancient poetry may be of great use in settling the history and ascertaining the meaning of several antiquities dispersed over the mountainous parts of scotland while the man of taste must be agreeably surprised to find a beauty and force of diction a warmth of fancy a chaste and truly noble simplicy united where hitherto no person has ever looked for it if these specimens are well received by the public and if suitable encouragement were given to the ingenious translator he would oblige the world with the translation of the epic poem mentioned in the preface which consists of upwards of nine thousand lines but the dependant situation of a tutor cannot afford him leisure to undertake so great a work  your friends in this corner of the world were much disappointed in not having the happiness of seeing you last summer along with lord lyttelton and without flattery i can assure that the number of your friends in scotland is greater than perhaps you think of and every one of them would be happy to have an opportunity of seeing and obliging you lord alemoor dr roebuck and his spouse desire to be remembered and i shall take it as a particular favor that you would at a leisure hour write me your opinion of the enclosed specimens and allow me to be with esteem truly dear sir  your very obedient and most humble servant j m  g  two frankd covers will bring the two first divisions of the fragment please address for me at edingburgh    letter xlii extract from a letter of mr b  lord e  s brother to mr t  may    i know no way so good of making up for my long silence to you as sending you the enclosed poem which if it gives you as much pleasure as it did me you will give me no small thanks for it is translated from an old highland poem by one mr m pherson a minister in the highlands there are great numbers of these elegies all over the highlands which they sing to mournful tunes in the evening over their fires mr m pherson has i hear translated ten more of them which i fancy will soon be published if they are not i shall endeavor to get them and send them to you it will be needless to say any thing in praise of the poem as i think it can sufficiently recommend itself the translation has a great deal of merit i think it is one of the best i ever saw i fancy shenstone will be much pleased with the poem which i shall be obliged to you if you will present to him with my compliments  a fragment this exquisite little fragment is already published among the notes in the first volume of ossians works but as in mr shenstones manuscript the expression of many of the passages varied from the printed poem the editor of this work presumed an insertion of his copy might not be unwelcome to the curious  the following descriptive poem though very old is of much later date than the foregoing fragments  five bards who are the guests of a chief himself an excellent poet go severally out to make their observations on the night and return each with an extemporary description of it to which the chief adds one of his own the time is supposed to be in october the harvest month in the highlands when the face of nature is as various and its changes as sudden as they are here represented  first bard night is dull and dark the clouds rest on the hills no star with twinkling beam no moon looks from the skies i hear the blast in the wood but distant and dull i hear it the stream of the valley murmurs low is its murmur too from the tree at the grave of the dead the lonely screechowl groans i see a dim form on the plain it is a ghost it fades it flies some dead shall pass this way from the lowly hut of the hill the distant dog is howling the stag lies by the mountainwell the hind is at his side she hears the wind in his horns she starts but lies again the roe is in the cleft of the rock the heathcocks head beneath his wing no beast no bird is abroad but the owl and the howling fox she on the leafless tree he on the cloudy hill dark panting trembling sad the traveller has lost his way through shrubs through thorns he goes beside the gurgling rills he fears the rock and the pool he fears the ghost of the night the old tree groans to the blast the falling branch resounds the wind drives the clung thorn along the sighing grass he shakes amid the night dark dusky howling is night cloudy windy and full of ghosts the dead are abroad my friends receive me from the night second bard the wind is upon the mountain the shower of the hill descends woods groan and windows clap the growing river roars the traveller attempts the ford he falls he shrieks he dies the storm drives the horse from the hill the goat and the lowing cow they tremble as drives the shower and look for the shade of the stall the hunter starts from sleep in his lone hut and wakes the fire decayed his wet dogs smoke around him he stops the chink with heath loud roar two mountain streams which meet beside his booth sad on the side of the hill the wandering shepherd sits the tree resounds above him the stream roars down the rock he waits the rising moon to lead him to his home ghosts ride on the storm tonight sweet is their voice between the gusts of wind their songs are of other worlds the rain is past  the dry winds blow streams roar and windows clap cold drops fall from the roof i see the starry sky  but the shower gathers again dark dark is the western sky night is stormy dismal dark receive me my friends from the night third bard the winds still sound between the hills and groan on the riven rocks the firs fall from their place on high the turfy hut is torn the clouds divided fly over the sky and show the burning stars the meteor token of death flies sparkling through the gloom it rests on the hills it burns  i see the fern the dark rock and fallen oak what dead is that in his shroud  beneath the tree by the stream the waves dark tumble on the lake and lash the rocky sides the boat is brimfull in the cove the oars on the rocky tide sad sits a maid beneath a rock and eyes the rolling stream her lover promised to come she saw his boat when it was light on the lake is this his broken boat on the shore are these his groans in the wind hark the hail rattles around the flakes of snow descend  the tops of the hills are white the stormy winds abate various is night and cold receive me my friends from the night fourth bard night is calm and fair blue starry and settled is night the winds with the clouds are gone they descend behind the hill the moon is upon the mountains trees glister streams shine on the rocks bright rolls the settling lake bright the stream of the vale i see the trees oerturned the shocks of corn on the plain the wakeful peasant rebuilds the sheaves or drives the beasts of the hills away calm settled and fair is night who comes from the place of the dead that form in the robe of snow these white arms that hair of gold the daughter of the chief of the people she that lately fell come let us view thee maid thou that were the desire of heroes the blast drives the phantom away white and without form it ascends the hill the breezes drive the blue mist over the narrow vale gray on the hill it ascends and joins itself to the sky night is settled and calm blue starry bright with the moon receive me not my friends for lovely is the night fifth bard night is calm but dreary the moon in a cloud in the west slow moves that feeble beam along the shady hill the distant wave is heard the stream dull murmurs on the rock the cock is heard from the booth more than half the night is passed the housewife groping in the gloom rekindles the settled fire the hunter thinks it day and calls his nimble dog he ascends the hill and whistles the road away a blast removes the cloud he sees the starry plough of the north much of the night is to pass he nods by the mossy stone hark the whirlwind is in the wood low murmurs on the plain it is the army of the mighty dead returning from the air the moon rests behind the hill the beam is still on the lofty rock long are the shades of the trees but now it is dark over all nights dreary silent and dark receive me my friends from the night sixth bard the chief himself let clouds rest on the hill spirits fly and travelers fear let the winds of the wood arise the sounding storm descend roar streams and windows clap and greenwinged meteors fly rise the pale moon on the mountain or enclose her head in clouds night is alike to me blue gloomy or stormy the sky night flies and her goblin crew when morn is poured on the hills light returns from the gloom but we return no more where are our chiefs of old where our kings of modern name the fields whereon they fought are silent scarce their mossy tombs remain we too shall be forgot this lofty house shall fall our sons shall scarce see its ruins on the grass and shall ask where dwelt our fathers raise the song strike the harp send around the shell they drank out of a shell as great numbers do still of joy suspend a hundred tapers on high maids and youths begin the dance some greylockd bard be near and sing the deeds of other times of kings renowned in albion of chiefs we see no more thus pass the night till morn is gray in our hall then be the bow in hand the dogs and youth of the chase we ascend the hill with day and rouse the flying deer letter xliii r g  esquire to mr hull june    dear hull i safe arrived in somersetshire after two pleasant and easy days journey and am now set down to write to you according to my promise and to note what alterations or innovations i had observed upon in the modes and manners of london since i had not been there so long before  this chapter is reduced to so few heads from the several conversations we had together in town upon the taking down the signs the rooting up the posts the paving and lighting of oxfordroad holborn monmouthstreet and st giless the constructing of blackfriarsbridge etc that i cannot recollect any other remark i made worth mentioning at present except the introducing of asses in the city for the use of milkmen fruiterers hawkers etc  this i thought a great improvement as it serves to lessen the number of barrows that used to interrupt walkers on the broad pavements but this consideration was damped again at seeing the barbarous treatment these poor animals often suffer from their brutal guides or riders i often thought of stern upon these occasions see a passage about an ass in his sentimental journey an ass is a dull slow creature that will not mend its pace for whip or spur  this these wretches call obstinacy and so punish it for a defect of nature as they would for a moral vice for if they reason at all you may be sure they reason thus because it is wrong  this has renewed a reflection in my mind that has often occurred to me before upon the unaccountable disposition toward cruelty exercised against the brutecreation which is too frequently observed among the general classes of mankind who have not been restrained by natural sentiment or refined by a liberal education  if sympathy as modern philosophers assert be the ultimate cause of our being affected for others that of pain one would think should be the strongest all men do not feel misfortunes or suffer grief alike one person may resent a mortification or a loss to madness while his more temperate friend can afford his pity or compassion no higher or further than his own passions or sentiments would have extended in the same circumstances here sympathy is at an end but all persons and animals too are alike sensible of pain  ergo   we have from hence reason to conclude that it is more from want of thought than of humanity that the contrary is so apparent and this argument i think is fully proved by the observation that children and fools are the most guilty of it  besides which there is a great deal in custom that may take off from the natural feelings of compassion with regard to the brutecreation among numbers of people such as butchers surgeons soldiers etc a fishwoman being reprehended for the barbarity of fleaing eels alive answered that it was no cruelty as they were so much used to it which was plainly transferring the insensibility she had herself acquired through habit to the poor suffering reptile this puts me in mind of the blunder of an irish parliament once that framed an act to punish forgery with the loss of both ears and so toties quoties  there is also i apprehend a sort of notion resting in uninstructed minds that morality has nothing to do with our actions toward brutes any more than it has with regard to inanimate nature so that many folks from such a strange misconception torture an animal with as little remorse as they would lop off the branch of a tree such people must never have read the sentence of solomon that a good man is merciful to his beast nor that of shakespeare the poor beetle that we tread upon in corpral suffrance feels a pang as great as when a giant dies   i remember i was once sitting with a friend and seeing his son tormenting a poor dog by making him suffer great pain i spoke to the father to reprove him for it to which he coolly answered that as he designed the boy for the army he did not care to inspire him with too tender feelings your idea might not be much amiss i replied if you meant to breed him a butcher or a hangman what a gothic notion that bravery and humanity were incompatible  ovid seems to have been of my opinion in the above reproof by making priests who were the first butchers or sacrificers to have led the way to cruelty and slaughter  primoque a caede ferarum incaluisse putem maculatum sanguine ferrum i will not say however that this may be the reason why parsons and butchers are equally excluded from being on juries of life and death because there would be a sort of pert dullness in the remark  asking pardon for the tautology  no the true reason for these exclusions is that the latter are rendered callous from being too familiar with slaughter and with regard to the former that the ministers of peace should keep clear of blood  a thought has just occurred to me i have not leisure both to examine and to write it too so i shall only sport it for the present perhaps the injunction in the levitical law to abstain from blood might not have been meant in derogation of blackpuddings in the least but only as a figurative manner of repeating the sixth commandment thou shall do no murder  a comment upon the inhibition of pythagoras abstine a fabis abstain from beans has hinted this notion to me for the learned bacon which name you know accords very well with beans says that what the sage intended by the prohibition was to forbid meddling with the contentions and strife of electioneering where the votes or suffrages were given pro and con by black and white beans  and this interpretation ought certainly to appear the true sense of the precept from this consideration for as that philosopher had before restricted his disciples from the use of all animal food on account of the transmigratory notions he had picked up in india he could not possibly have been so unconscionable as to have laid any manner of restraint on the vegetable product of the earth  yours etc r g   letter xliv mrs  to mr hull of covent garden theater the great respect you sir have shown to mr shenstone in dedicating your tragedy of rosamond to his memory added to the pleasure i have received from some of your other publications will i trust plead an excuse for an intrusion from a stranger and especially as it is to beg your acceptance of the enclosed poem it was written by that friend whose death you so feelingly lament it has been in my possession ever since or before that period of its merits i am no judge but from its author should imagine it not destitute and have long regretted its remaining in hands so little capable of making it appear as it ought the sincere pleasure i received in seeing mr shenstones name so respectfully and publicly revived induced me to wish to make the author some acknowledgment and this appears to be the only way for should not the diamond have brilliancy enough for the public yet it may not be an unwelcome amusement to a private friend to remove the dimness  i should much sooner have made this acknowledgment but from a diffidence of its being accepted however i hope the best and that you will be kind enough to accept it as it is meant should it prove worthy of notice and acceptable to so partial a friend i shall hope as i have no copy to receive your opinion and must request it as a particular favor that to any friend you choose to show it my name may not be mentioned on that account i decline saying any thing of myself my address is etc  permit me to hope you will excuse the errors of a weak pen and believe me sir  your obliged humble servant m  dec         the diamond a poem canto i cupid over human breasts resistless reigns fierce in his joys unrivaled

and blessed by fortune much by nature more swift over the spinnetkeys his fingers flew and love except to quell each passion knew such human art with joy apollo viewed and with some graces from his own endud from him when lost adonis caused her grief even cytherea might have heard relief but ah to every charm to every grace that decked his words or sparkled in his face endeared his person or his thoughts refined the nymph alone he loved alone was blind each other belle the slighted charms admired each other belle the slighted heart desired with practiced airs they strove to please the swain with practiced airs they purchased fresh disdain no bright enamored fair could ever incline the heart lamira fired without design where could he fly from whence his anguish ease the play the park the ring no more could please each radiant beau with jealous fury fired and solitude and sounds with love conspired to cupid thus while musics tuneful aid saddend each note the boy in anguish prayed harmonious power accept these mournful strains reward my passion or remove my pains if ever thy praise with early care i sing if ever thy praise inspire my evening string oh grant the arts which make thy glory known may move lamiras breast or ease my own apollo heard and listening to his grief sent maias nimble son to bring relief his message known he cleaves the yielding skies and quick as lightning to the suppliant flies ruffled with winds he shakes his azure plumes and round the place diffused divine perfumes then thus begins  myrtillo cease to grieve and from the delphian power these notes receive think not by sounds thy passion to remove the breath of music fans the fires of love think not to music bends a female ear flattery the only sound the fair can hear with flattery charm her or with pomp assail those last dear arts with females to prevail nursed by apollo long with genial care this powerful present from the god i bear these he prescribes with these he bids pursue no mortal female these untouched shall view thus ends the god and in a moment flies whilst on the board a shagreen casket lies long fragrance fills the room the sable box the maid with pious trembling hand unlocks she opes out fly ten thousand glittering rays and hide the substance through a mingled blaze the radiance charms but when with raptured eyes and nearer view she pierced the bright disguise when the gay brilliants luster shone confessed she closed the box and joyous thought the rest a joy like this harmonious orpheus knew when wondrous husband to the shades he flew and wandering long the gloom with glad surprise perceived at last his consorts sparkling eyes ah dear brillante few thy story know whose beauties in this gem eternal glow yet shall the pious muse the tale relate and with her verse adorn brillantes fate of humble birth the bright enchanter came unequal to her beauty wit or fame deep in a lonely vale she shone retired few saw the maid but all who saw admired she shunned no virtue though she sought no praise and passed in quiet unexposd her days much had she heard the various toils that wait the pride of riches and the pomp of state much her fond mother taught with pious care and latest breath twas dangerous to be fair brilly she cried my tender child farewell shun the gay court and grace this humble cell there various arts for innocence are laid to ruin youth and trap the unwary maid charms in an humble state may prove a snare but placed on high they cheat the nicest care let every rule my living care supplied when i am unheard of be thy virtues

as more years she knew her fame extended as her beauties grew a rigid sternness all her beauties armed which every faint minute approach alarmed the opening rose shone in her cheeks refined and like its guardian thorn her virtue joined the wondering prince received at length her fame and to the court conveyed the unwilling dame the unwilling dame to please he vainly strove too soon she raised but never returned his love here long she shone untainted and the same and as her virtue spotless was her fame by arts unsoftend though by arts improved her charms moved all by charms herself unmoved

dissolved his shining frame contracting soon a glittering gem became charms not inferior still the stone retains and wounding all itself untouched remains these signal honors love indignant bore and vowed to raze them or his own restore if thus he cried brillante void of pain could all my arrows all my arts sustain yet shall her fate assist my slighted bow and raise those joys she never deserved

ii now sol to western climes directs his blaze and gilds lamiras couch with parting rays the hour when nymphs on airy substance prey and thinly feed on scandal and on tea the moment comes  the visitants are seen with tales replete and grossly filled with spleen the powdered valet trips in neat array bright on the teaboard shines the glittering clay there artful china pictured grots and bowers hills rivers valleys turrets meads and flowers bright azure pastures deep impervious shades deserving swains and not ungrateful maids beneath a clouded beach a shepherd lay and with blue fingers played or seemed to play the generous nymphs forsook the neighboring plains to court his passion or admire his strains the eager painter formed too quick the glance and thirst of gain had spoiled the mimic dance oh hateful avarice ever doomed to prove the bane of arts and much unkind to love the gazing flocks and softlytreading fawns with ears uplifted seem to skim the lawns full twice a day can this lamira view yet hear unmoved her swain his notes renew the impartial pot streams equal shares around scarce on the bench is greater justice found the sugar sinks like zemblas hills of snow whenever decending tides their tops overflow the soft imperial breaths a fragrant fume and from each check calls forth reviving bloom but chief lamira doubly formed to please shone beautys queen amidst her infant seas hail favorite plant whose fragrant scent inspires the statesmans projects and the poets fires hail everlovd and though sometimes you flow a friend to scandal never to wit a foe a beauteous nymph oh had she been but free from scandals taint eternal breathes in thee ah let the muse what female can contain a secret known poor theas fate explain thea a nymph whom envy wandering over this nether world to artful momus bore too soon she knew no scandal to conceal and learnt to raise it or when raised reveal her stammring tongue was framed to lisp disgrace but when she spoke all merit left the place her careful parents as she grew displayed each various branch of slanders mystic trade the look sincere the deep persuasive wile the frown tremendous and more dreadful smile the wink which more than real blame instills pity that murders and concern that kills malicious whisprings ever fatal found which like retiring parthians doubly wound wit to invent and malice to declare disgrace on all the witty chaste or fair all these they taught and what they taught enjoined and viewed themselves in thea more refined ah thoughtless pair your fatal kindness leave nor bless those arts for which you once must grieve the nymph with these and arts like these endud charms virtue wit with artful spite pursued from earths abodes at length exiled the fair to heaven confined and persecuted there there blending vice with virtue truth with lies left not one virgin to adorn the skies she told why deities admire perfumes and traced the heavenly rise of blacklead combs gave hints what stays mechanic pallas wore and why diana chased the sylvan boar what muse forgot her eyebrow box she showed and why auroras face with crimson glowed she knew that virgin vestal was no saint and junos toilette shone with floods of paint that venus sure from nature never would swerve but for ambrosia ivory teeth might serve revenge and rage the offended powers alarms for heavenly breasts terrestrial fury warms conscious of virtue some with rage oerflowd of guilt the most with deeper crimson glowed as once diana chased along the glade her usual prey she spied the illfated maid and take she cried from cynthias bow the fate which injured fame exacts alas too late she said  the javelin pierced her tender side and the moist turf with guilty crimson died quick on the turf a rising plant was seen which bears her name and blooms for ever green now tea and coffee spire in steams no more and cups inverted show the banquet over not so the slander  silvias hand sustains a cup enriched with nine important grains from hence the fair the fall of modes discerns and lifes events in typic visions learns the fairs important annals hence relates and with soft ruby lips unfolds the fates yet now her own for fortunes will displays and guides those laws which jove himself obeys for gay selinda visits journeys news and one poor lover at a distance views in chloes hapless dish more deeply brown the sable honors of a parsons gown livonias yields groves meadows fields and lawns and in her own a star obscurely dawns tell me she cries why that small meteor shines which with the dishes azure circle joins but ah what pen lamira shall explain thy anger scorn resentment and disdain when she too partial to the states decree consigned myrtillo hapless maid to thee revenge revenge she cries insulting dame shall charms like mine inferior votrys claim i too might boast  the vaunting females rise and each loud voice united rends the skies their victries spoils and triumphs each avers earnest in vain for none is heard or hears so in those days when jove in frantic mirth vouchsafed to comfort humble maids on earth if one ambitious made her conquest known each vaunting female bragged the case her own parting they vow revenge they vow in vain the fairs diversions soon unite again cupid mean time had from myrtillo flew and on the table drops a billetdoux thither to seek the glasss timely aid for ruffled features hyd the abandoned maid but soon her charms their usual force renewed when on the board the wellknown shape she viewed she eyes the wax adorned with rubric darts and in the opening breaks three flaming hearts a ticket  hum  the name concealed i find it is much in vain  his lordships wondrous kind dear music well  if bliss above be given and nymphs have souls  sure music is our heaven ah thoughtless maid to seek the fatal place so long decreed myrtillos power to raise there first thine eyes devoured the treacherous blaze there first thine eyes occurred with rival rays at every chord the fatal luster streams and the gay ring regilds unnumberd beams how killing every sound when splendor fires how powerful every ray when sound conspires no more frail nymph unmoved she sees or hears but drinks deep poison in at eyes and ears the diamond canto iii now from earths surface pearly spangles rise the morning star no more adorns the skies and phoebus issuing in unclouded bloom had woke a brighter to supply its room lamira rose  but different far her mien far changed her looks from what they late were seen uneasy thoughts each altered feature showed and her dear cheek with fevrish crimson glowed the looks of care yet lovely still she bore and grief but changed the charms revealed before doris she cried what anxious cares infest what doubts disquiet my illfated breast were not my pride superior to my pain i could not slight the boy with mere disdain with such high raptures every gesture fired such more than usual bliss his strains inspired some heavenly power  nor let vain tongues deny the serious truth  invests the favorite boy when soothing accents lulled the lovers pains and ariadne closed the dying strains the loves and graces joined in wanton play and with the softening thrills i died away how cursed this lingering livelong night has flown in sleepless hours or sleep to rest unknown perplexed awake in vain i sleep implored sleep to my eyes the fatal form restored through shapeless ways fatigued by fancy borne in frantic rage i cursed the loitring morn over pathless downs methought he wildly flew still as he ran my eager passion grew in vain with toil successless i pursued in vain with eager hope the chase renewed how wild are dreams  the brilliants silver ray seemed from his hand to point the wished for way still with repeated strife i seek the chase still the swift boy eludes my sought embrace sometimes i heard some faint imperfect strains divinely warble over the echoing plains moved by the winds his tresses sweetly flowed and more than mortal in each feature glowed tell me whence spring the tortures i endure if this be love or if it be to cure fate sure these charms for other flames designed for other flames the cyprian queen refined to shine the first at park at ring and ball to see laced valets wait in crowds ones call still to be envied to whom this is given  ye gods how nearly earth resembles heaven ah fickle females how shall i display the revolutions of one female day such numerous changes in one hour abound such the succession in a moment found when balanced passions their short reign divide and vanity and love by turns subside thus passed the doubtful day the faultring dame till in loves favorite hour myrtillo came his radiant buckles now their charms display and set in sable shine profusely gay but when he danced she gazed with raptured eyes and raptured love unreal charms supplies no longer now unmoved she slights his pains but every look her yielding soul explains each tender glance her fluttering heart alarms each action fires her and each motion charms this erring nymphs an air a grace may call  oh blind to truth  the brilliant forms it all this was written before the snuff box at the time i lived at harborough perhaps about the year      and has a more simple plan than the other but has little or nothing to recommend it besides w shenstone  letter xlv mrs w  to mr hull permit me sir to assure you that to me your manner of receiving what i thought only a due acknowledgment to your disinterested friendship more than even acquits a real obligation as well as gives me a sincere pleasure in reflecting that what i esteemed is at last in the hands of one who will equally value its intrinsic worth and is so much more capable of introducing it properly to the public inspection such i imagine is your intention and i most willingly receive the favor you offer of letting me know your determination for why may i not look upon the friend of a gentleman whose memory i esteem in the number of my own give me leave so to do and as such to present the compliments of the season to you and mrs hull with cordial wishes for your seeing many happy returns  the manner of the diamond is similar to the poem you mention popes rape of the lock but if i may without exposing my judgment speak the truth i give the former the preference even against pope and this because i think there is greater delicacy of sentiment but what else could be expected from a mind the characteristics of which were refined sensibility and unbounded benevolence though as i cannot express more than i believe you think i will stop my pen by saying that i trust you will allow your own wish relative to the snuff box as a plea for my so soon troubling you with another letter and that i remain with due respect  sir your obliged and obedient humble servant mrs w  monday night jan         p s i thank you for the two inscriptions to the memory of our amiable friend they would have been agreeable companions to some of the same turn already printed at the end of his works by mr dodsley that which was wrote by cunningham is possessed of genuine elegance and sensibility i dare say you think so those you have sent affect me in the same manner particularly the prosetribute which you tell me came from a female pen i think i can guess the writer and would when next i see her challenge a confession were i sure i could do it without wounding her delicacy of feeling  the elegy i also admire much the thoughts of the author are equally tender and benevolent with those of the friend whose memory he so pathetically laments the last lines of the second stanza particularly please me    inscription alluded to in the foregoing letter on the left side monument therebydignified owner  m m   elegy referred to in the foregoing postscript when music awakens the grove softbreathing the pastoral note ye shepherds who know how to love be corydon never forgot of swains the most tender and kind now low in the dust is he laid  ye who knew not his elegant mind ah me  what a loss have ye had his feelings were mild as the air that pants on the bosom of may his truth as the sunbeam was clear and his heart was as open as day when a neighboring swain was in grief his wants he would gladly supply if his acres denied the relief like him would he sadden and sigh his verse was the pride of the grove his song to the valley was dear and the shepherd who knows how to love still hallows his name with a tear when the village is folded in sleep and midnight invelopes the skies the muses still cluster still weep over the turf where our corydon lies letter lvi r g  esquire to mr hull dear etc i received your letter and it has astonished me that you can be in the least degree hurt by the opinion of narrow minds with regard to the grievance you complain of let it be always a matter of consolation to you that the illiberal treatment actors may sometimes meet with on account of their profession can never proceed from any but illiberal minds it is the censurers themselves who become objects of contempt when they would render you so from that consideration merely and this reflection ought therefore to make you as indifferent to such instances of ignorance and illbreeding as you would be to a billingsgate scold or a st giless abuse  an actor is a respectable character while he properly considers and endeavors to preserve the original design of his profession and i have ever been of opinion and am convinced of the truth of the maxim that acting should unquestionably be accepted among the liberal arts even with this advantage over poetry and painting that it superadds example to document and delight it is the living moral while the others are but the dead letter the stage is a school and may be an useful one too  as such it was patronized and cherished by the wisest and most virtuous states of greece and rome and it has been the fault of managers not of actors whenever theaters have ceased to afford either precept or example  there are so many requisites of talents assiduity and person to form a complete actor that even a moderate degree of excellence should be deemed sufficient merit to entitle a performer to the public favor and indulgence to which if an honest decent and unexceptionable repute be joined i can see no sort of reason in the nature or distinction of things why the sock and buskin should not be admitted ad eundem with the goif and cowl so that it must be the personal character and not the dramatis personae that can ever debase your profession in which predicament both the parson and the lawyer stand equally with you  but indeed the world that illiberal part of it which you hint at are apt to consider us authors also in the same inferior light they do actors i remember a friend of mine sometime ago was cast off by his father for having published a very ingenious poem while he was a student at the temple and another acquaintance was severely reproved by his relations for having married a lady every other way worthy of his choice because she had written a book  such curious censors i suppose would despise the meanness of my spirit now if i should declare to them that i would rather have been homer or virgil than alexander or augustus and roscius the actor than the tribune of the same name though the latter was a sort of manager as may be proved by his having framed the lex roscia for the regulation of the theater at rome but it might possibly reconcile them to me again if i should confess this common foible of human nature at the same time that fond as i am of fame i would yet rather be even what i am myself now than the best of them all then this is some sort of qualification to the former sentiment  i shall here conclude my letter to you with entreating that you will continue to defeat the malice of such ignorant censors by an uniform attention to the spirit and utility of that walk in life which either fortune or your own choice has led you into elevate your crest take  for your motto and study the following lines which this subject has just brought to my mind  pro libitu imponunt

your profession has to you answered the dearest and best purposes  you know whereto i allude  be grateful for the benefits and do not let fools put you out of conceit with it  yours affectionately r g   letter lvii this letter like some others in this collection is purposely misplaced in point of date in order to connect matter rather than periods  the ensuing being wholly from one correspondent and comprehending among them observations on the venetian republic miss n  to mr hull venice oct  0      dear sir when you undertook to be the amanuensis as well as the receivergeneral to the agreeable society i have left with so much regret i remember you charged me to write as soon as i should reach this place i accordingly begin my task and am very happy to have an opportunity of writing to you a good long letter without the expense of postage which i have not the vanity to suppose my epistles deserve i send this by a pretty sort of man whose name is  and who i should suppose has some strong attachment in your county which induces him to take so long a journey at this rude season of the year  we were very fortunate in weather and found the roads as good as the nature of the country will allow them to be some parts of savoy is frightfully wild and dreary other parts very romantic and beautiful i was vastly amused with the manner of crossing mount cenis the chair we are carried in or rather on resemble a good deal a chinese palanquin only they want a canopy over them the chairmen are certainly the best in the world or it would be both dangerous and frightful it seems to me that they have the strength of mules and the agility of goats for they run down the precipices and bound from rock to rock in a most astonishing manner the ascent of the mountain is three miles on the side of savoy the plain on the top six miles in length and the descent on the turin side six miles more we had four men to each of the ladies chairs and six to the gentlemens and after carrying us these fifteen dreadful miles they were quite delighted that our party took them on from novalese a small town at the foot of mount cenis to susa which is nine miles further and they carried us the last three leagues in an hour and a half laughing and jesting with each other all the way as if they had been doing a thing merely for sport and amusement so you see my dear sir how visible the goodness of providence is to all creatures these poor souls who spend all their lives in the utmost indigence and inhabit a country that seems only fit for savages if they are denied the luxuries of life are amply repaid in the enjoyment of a double portion of health and strength  we stopped a few days at lions turin milan and verona and saw every thing worthy a strangers curiosity in each of these fine cities nothing amused me more than seeing a parcel of angels walking about the streets of milan they were fine cherrycheekd boys ready dressed for a grand procession that was preparing for the day following in honor of the virgin marys birthday venice is a very magnificent place and possesses the charm of novelty in a much higher degree than any of the other places i have named it is impossible to give a stronger idea of it it is in a style so peculiar to itself the masking is begun which is extremely entertaining i should be excessively happy to pop in amongst your dear society some day when you are all assembled i assure you it would be no small surprise to see me in a venetian dress it consists of a long black silk cloak called here a tabora a baouta which is made of black lace three quarters of a yard long and five times as wide and hangs about the shoulders like a petticoat it has a hood to it which when you choose to be concealed covers the bottom part of the face to the upper lip the rest is hid by a white mask and the women wear on their heads a mans hat smartly cocked the venetian women who are rather masculine in their manner look still more so in this dress  we have had the prince of brunswick here for ten days which made the town all alive i will describe to you one of the entertainments made for him and that will serve as a specimen of all the rest our resident had not got then into his palace as it is justly called for it is indeed a noble one so that he could not make any entertainments for the prince but he gave him some excellent music one morning in a private manner which he seemed to enjoy the more for being so the night after his highnesss arrival count durazzo the imperial ambassador invited all the english the foreign nobility that dont belong to venice and all the foreign ministers to meet the prince at supper the ambassadress received her guests with mingled grace and dignity she is really a fine woman and her beauty was heightened by all the elegance of dress soon after the company were assembled a most delightful serenade began upon the water which was not only delightful to the ear but formed a very beautiful object to the sight for the musicians were placed in a large open barge finely illuminated the harmony drew around them an infinite number of gondolas belonging to the noble venetians who could no otherwise partake of this feast for by their laws they are secluded from all commerce with strangers that are in a public character at proper intervals of the music all sorts of refreshments of ices fruits sweatmeats lemonades etc etc were presented to the company who when they had listened to the serenade for some time changed the scene either sat down to cards or formed little chatting parties when the cardtables broke up a very elegant concert composed of a few choice pieces of music performed by the very best hands agreeably filled up time till a most magnificent supper was served when the company rose from table coffee was brought which is the custom here after supper as well as after dinner when this was over a superb barge attended in which the prince and all the ladies and a suitable number of gentlemen were placed and rowed to st marks which is the only public place here for walking followed by the music the rest of the company in their gondolas and those of the noble venetians which the harmony had attracted after walking for some time to enjoy the cool air the company retired to a very elegant apartment which the ambassadress has on the place of st mark where she receives her company when she chooses to be in private when we had chatted here for half an hour it was found to be a proper time to retire as it was three oclock in the morning and so ended this agreeable even every part of which was employed in some innocent amusement without any thing being hurried or confused i have been the more particular in this account that you may see my good friend that taste and elegance is no more wanting in venice than it is in the gay metropolis of britain  i hope you will soon indulge me with a letter and that it will bring me a good account of yourself and every worthy individual of our friends in friendship assembled send it in a frank to mr l  in  street london and he will put it in his excellencys packet it must be but a single letter but i hope it will contain a good deal i long to hear that your good mother is well reestablished in her health she is a worthy soul and one cannot help wishing such people to live for ever i hope my dear friend though such a cruel distance divides us that i am not esteemed the less a member of the friendly society than if i was with you i find the same warmth of affection toward the happy circle as if i was not an absentee therefore beg you will give my best affections to all the happy members  i went the other day to see the ceremony of a nun taking the last veil and it is very awful and melancholy and to speak honestly and unprudishly does not inspire me with the least desire to be a nun first the divine service is performed with very fine music both vocal and instrumental in the church of the convent then a little door is opened in the grate of the private chapel before which the nun is seated on a chair of state under a canopy with a prayer book in her hand till the service is finished she then comes forward and kneeling at the grate repeats to a priest the vows of the order and promises obedience to the abbess she then rises and the nuns take off her white veil and put on a black one after which she kneels and says some prayers then six of the sisters advance and hold over her a purple pall whilst part of the funeralservice is read during which time she is supposed to be dead they then take away the purple cloth and the abbess places on her head a crown richly ornamented with jewels to signify that she dies to the world and rises again to glory she then receives from the priest a tablet with the rules of the order which she reads over and kisses then with the tablet in one hand and a long wax taper ornamented with wreaths of flowers in the other she walks slowly round the chapel followed by the rest of the nuns and deposits the tablet on the altar thus ends the melancholy ceremony this young lady was very pretty and not above seventeen we all thought she had an appearance of great constraint in her cheerfulness but we were assured it was entirely her choice that she had a large fortune had buried her father and was mistress of herself perhaps it may be the taste of the family for another sister professed last year in the same convent  as we are but just got to our new habitation you will easily suppose nobody is idle the house however i was determined i would not lose so fair an opportunity of writing to you so hope you will excuse so vile a scrawl and believe me when i assure you there is nothing more true than that i am my good sir ever most sincerely and affectionately yours and the societys  s n   letter lviii miss n  to mr hull venice dec         may every blessing of this cheerful season await you and every individual of the happy family and friends you are with may your pleasures be unmixed with pain and your years numerous and happy  receive these fervent wishes of an exiled member of your worthy society and be assured that though you are all absent from my sight you are ever present to my mind i wrote you a long letter near three months ago by an irish gentleman who assured me he should be in your part of the world as soon as the post when lo and behold three weeks ago i heard of him at sienna where i suppose he will stay the winter therefore as i am quite in the dark in regard to the fate of my unfortunate epistle i could not be easy till i had again set pen to paper to request you will all continue to love me as i do you which i assure you my dear sir is with undiminished truth i believe i told you in my last how to forward a letter to me but for fear you have never received it i will repeat it if you can send it to any friend in london and get them to forward it by the penny post to mr l  in  street he will enclose it in the secretary of states packet by which means i shall be more certain of getting it safe than by the post as well as that i shall receive it free  i have a great favor my dear sir to beg of you which is that you will procure me a piece of information for the use of our resident in regard to a young gentleman who has been at venice for some time and seems in no hurry to leave it owing as we imagine to an attachment to a fair venetian lady his name is  his family he says is settled near f  in somersetshire he makes a genteel appearance in point of fortune and seems to be a modest pretty behaved young man upon which account his excellency wishes to show him any civility in his power but at the same time would be glad to be rightly informed as to his character and family before he receives him in an intimate manner i thought it was very probable mr d  might know his father i have some notion i have heard the name mentioned at mr b  s if my dear sir you can procure me a particular account of this young hero i shall esteem it as a great favor  i am become wonderfully fond of the masquing dress and am told i wear it just as well as a venetian it is the most comfortable warm walkingdress that can be conceived i have kept house these last nine days because it was prohibited but tomorrow masquing begins again and continues till lent i am told we had an earthquake but thank god i did not perceive it since that there had been very tempestuous weather and violent snow and rain which added to a high tide overflowed all the canals and i cannot but say at that time venice gave me a strong idea of the universal deluge  there have been five theaters open till within these nine days and i am told in the carnival there will be no less than seven the comic opera was very pleasing in point of music and always crowded but the serious opera nobody could bear though manzoli sung in it and tibaldi who is reckoned one of the best tenor voices if not the very best now living by this you will perceive how the english and italian taste for music differs though i must say i believe the greatest admirers of manzoli would allow he is much altered for the worse for my own part had i not remembered his person i should not have had the least recollection of him from his voice the theater he performed at was entirely fitted up with glass both the stage and all the boxes which when well lighted had a fine effect there was a change of the scenes for one of the dances that was i think one of the most beautiful things i ever beheld  the italian comedy does not delight me much for i do not understand the language well enough yet to be amused with the bonmots of harlequin and to laugh at him because he has a black face and at pantaloon merely for having a long beard it is not what i feel myself much disposed to do i understand the italian tragedies better than the comedies but i find the actors infinitely below ours i intend to be very studious and when all the family are gadding to the opera and the play i shall sit at home and drudge at the italian and this for many good reasons but chiefly to acquit myself of my chief promise to you  we have at present a second edition of the prince of brunswick who has been at venice a week but on monday next he leaves us entirely this time he has spent most of his leisure hours with our resident and expresses great pleasure in being received on an intimate and easy footing he is really a very sensible and agreeable man and as far as can be judged from outward appearance is very amiable he has with him two young german barons who are also very pretty kind of men and speak english so well that it is a comfort to hear them  my brother desires me to present his best respects to you and i hope my dear nominal uncle will always be mindful to say for me to the dear society every thing that is kind grateful and affectionate  my vanity will not suffer me to pass over in silence a conquest that i am told i have certainly made of an italian count who is here in a public character he is not quite sixty his figure and complexion exactly resembles a very bad long thin tallowcandle he is much bedaubed with spanish snuff and on meagre days so overcomes one with garlic that it is dreadful except these little accidents he is a most agreeable companion for he is very sensible very religious very philosophic extremely polite and his conversation is both instructive and amusing now my good friend from the picture i have drawn would you not think i was in some danger of losing my heart but that luckily my amiable count is a bigoted roman catholic and i an obstinate heretic  we may give ourselves what airs we please about our english liberty but for the ladies italy is undoubtedly the land of perfect freedom to all public places they constantly go in pairs with their cavalier serventes and put me much in mind of the clean and unclean beasts going into the ark what would become of the reputation of a miserable english woman if she was to go to the play with a man teteatete and yet that is constantly done here without imputation of wrong  in short if a woman has any mind to be wicked venice seems to be the last place in the world to give her better sentiments  how delighted should i be to surprise the dear society some night or other when you are over your sober game of quadrille in my white masque and mans hat you have no notion with what an air i have learnt to put it over my right eye i will not despair but that we may again meet happily under that hospitable roof where for some weeks in the enjoyment of such friendly conversation i tasted more real happiness and peace than i ever experienced before or since in my whole life i did not know before i had the melancholy experience of it how very irksome and painful a feel it is to be so very far from those we truly regard adieu my dear friends may heaven shower upon you all its choicest blessings is the sincere and constant prayer of your ever faithful and affectionate  s n   letter lix miss n  to mr hull venice april        the only task you enjoined me on leaving england is perhaps the most difficult you could have exacted from me nevertheless i am resolved to attempt it for however you may be disappointed in my performance i shall at least have the satisfaction of proving that i cheerfully obey any command of yours and though surrounded with difficulties i enter upon the performance of my promise with courage well knowing from the candor of your disposition that you will accept of an earnest desire on my part to gratify your laudable curiosity in lieu of greater abilities for such an undertaking  i am not surprised that a person of your speculative turn should feel an earnest desire to be made acquainted with some particulars relative to the wise and complicated government of the republic of venice it justly merits the attention of the sensible and curious part of mankind were it only to discover by what means it has been preserved nearly in the same state for such a number of ages but it is hardly possible to arrive with certainty at this knowledge for there is no subject the venetians are so tenacious of conversing upon as politics profound secrecy being the great engine on which this very singular government turns i find one must not depend too much on the accounts of those who have written upon the subject for after allowing the utmost to their integrity and industry they must have been often liable to misinformation besides the unavoidable change that time naturally produces in all sublunary things i have now lying before me a history of the republic by amelot de la houssai one by st disdier and another by the abbee langier of a much later date and i shall freely transcribe from these authors in as succinct a manner as possible all such passages as coincide with the present state of things but the most pleasing assistant i promise myself is mr smith who has been settled in this city a great number of years and was formerly the british consul he is now retired from business and devotes his time to the study and encouragement of the polite arts of which he is a liberal protector he is at present appointed charge daffaires by our court till the arrival of sir james wright who succeeds the present ambassador at constantinople in the residentship of venice i am sorry the new minister is not expected during my stay here for as i am told he has spent some time in this capital when upon his travels in a private character under his auspices i might perhaps with more ease have pursued my researches mr smith is an intelligent sensible man and preserves in a very advanced age a degree of politeness vivacity and good humor rarely to be met with which renders his conversation as pleasing as it is instructive this gentleman is married to the sister of mr murray the late resident a very amiable woman their house is open every evening to the english in the most easy agreeable manner where i have infinite pleasure in talking over in a polite cheerful circle the virtu that has engaged my attention in the morning but through this correspondence i shall not profane my favorite subject by introducing it with the dry one your curiosity has led me to  as st disdier is my favorite writer on the state of venice i shall begin with his account of the origin of this city but must first endeavor to make you acquainted with the lagunes or lakes which i look upon to be the great sources of health and pleasure to the venetians as well as the means by which all their wants are supplied nothing can be more delicious than the airings the nobility take on these lakes during the summer season sometimes attended with a barge filled with musicians and often teteatete with their cicisbeo in a gondola which is an easy and luxurious conveyance the lagunes are formed by a strong bank of sand at the entrance of the gulf which extends from south to west about thirtysix miles and is about six hundred feet in breadth the sea having broke through the bank in six different places has covered with water all the low land for seven or eight miles leaving a number of small islands upon which are built the towns of the lagunes the six passages abovementioned are the only ports by which vessels can approach to venice first that of brondolo to the south secondly chiosa an episcopal city thirdly malamocco fourthly lido opposite to the east point of venice fifthly st erasmus and sixthly the three ports by this last only the small fishing barks can pass  in the year  0  the goths under the command of radagaisus having broke like a torrent into italy put all the inhabitants to the sword who attempted to oppose their fury the people who were situated near the lagunes i have above described found no asylum so secure as those maritime isles the most part of which were only inhabited by fishermen here the fugitives remained in safety until the generals sent by the emperor honorius having defeated the barbarians left the affrighted wanderers at liberty to return to the terra firma in the year     the horrible ravages committed by the visigoths under alarick made the same people a second time seek their former retreat and as these invaders staid longer in italy than those led by radagaisus the fugitives began to build themselves comfortable habitations on these islands the paduans to whom these isles belonged had a port at that of rialto now called venice and the senate having resolved to make it a considerable place not only by way of asylum for their subjects but also to secure their trade by sea sent in the year     three consuls who proclaimed it a free port so that in a short time it was peopled not only by those who retired to the islands for safety but by many persons of all ranks who left the terra firma to settle there the third undertaking of the barbarians under attila king of the huns threatened italy with total desolation that scourge of the almighty as he was justly denominated having caused germany france and italy to be laid waste returned in the year     a second time into the lastnamed country and destroyed pavia milan padua aquilea and many other great towns the miserable remains of whose inhabitants finished the peopling not only of rialto but all the other isles of the lagunes and entertaining no hope of returning to their ruined cities they caused to be transported from the terra firma marble and other materials of their demolished palaces so that in the space of about fifty years not only the people of rank but even the artizans were conveniently lodged padua being at length reestablished and seeing rialto become considerable by the number of its inhabitants the senate thought proper to send consuls to govern the people with some appearance of authority but in time the richest and most powerful of the inhabitants of these isles got themselves declared protectors of the people with the title of tribunes in the year  0  the tribunes of the twelve most considerable islands of the lagunes judging it necessary to have a better form of government resolved to compose a republic and to elect a proper person from among themselves to be their chief or prince but as they knew they had no right to take this step against the will of the paduans to whom they were indebted for the place of their residence they sent an ambassy to the emperor leo who was sovereign of the whole country and to pope john the fifth to obtain their permission to elect a prince to whom they gave the title of doge paolo luce anafeste the first duke of venice was elected     years after rialto was proclaimed a free port by the paduans this election was made at ereclea a town of the lagunes in the year  0  at this place the first three doges resided these princes ruled with absolute power till      when upon the election of sebastian ziani the form of government became democratical and continued so till      when the doge pietro gradenigo found means to change it to an aristocracy this he effected by getting a decree passed in the quarantia criminale that all those who had composed the great council for four years should be ballotted for in that chamber of justice and such of them who had twelve balls in their favor and who attended the council on a certain day at an appointed hour should have their names written in a book called il libro doro and that they and their descendants should form the great council forever as this intrigue was managed with much secrecy none had notice to attend but those whom the doge and his party approved of or who had friends in the quarantia when this chosen number were assembled at the ringing of a bell the doors were locked and no more suffered to enter this the venetians call  il serrar del cansiglio and is one of the most remarkable epochas of their government though this step wrested all share of the administration out of the hands of the citizens and unjustly deprived some families of their title to nobility yet it was owing to this event that the republic established a more perfect form of government than she before enjoyed and which continues with very little change to this day bayamonte tiepoli the head of one of the most ancient families of the republic joined the quirini and some other illustrious persons in a conspiracy to sacrifice the doge to their resentment for this innovation but all the conspirators perished in the enterprise and this attempt only occasioned fresh regulations which more securely established the new form of government  accept of thus much by way of introduction to a sketch of the present state of the republic of venice and in my next i shall have the honor to introduce you to sua serenita the doge but at present the post will only allow me time to assure you how sincerely i am  yours etc etc  letter lx miss n  to mr hull april        i promised in my last to introduce you to the doge of venice and i think you will agree with me that his serenity is a very uncomfortable being since the period of il serrar del consiglio his power has gradually decreased a procurator of st mark is generally elected prince who has served the republic in expensive embassies or in the first offices of the state although he has the name of sovereign the power remains with the senate and having little influence in the affairs of the state great wisdom is by no means an essential recommendation to this high rank an advanced age an easy disposition and illustrious birth are the qualifications chiefly sought for in the doge his children grandchildren and brothers are disqualified from holding any considerable employment connected with government during his reign his wife was formerly treated en princess and crowned with great magnificence but that custom is now exploded however she still retains the title of dogeressa though the doge presides at all the councils he is only acknowledged head of the senate at the tribunals and in the palace of st mark he cannot leave the city without the previous leave of his counselors he is allowed no marks of distinction in his dress or equipage when he makes private visits or leaves the city except that his family are suffered to use gold or silver lace on their liveries and in the ornaments of their box at the theater and the ladies wear rich colored clothes at public festivals when the pragmatica obliges the other noble venetians to appear in black upon public occasions his serenity generally wears a vest and ducal mantle of brocade of gold or silver lined with ermine a cap of crimson velvet with a border of gold to represent the diadem and under it a short hood of gauze and shoes of crimson damask the sword of state is carried after the prince and at the head of the seignory to show where the real power is lodged a folding chair with a gilt frame and a seat of brocade with a stool of the same to set his foot on and a large parisole of gold stuff are carried with the doge in all public processions and they pretend that this regalia was presented to the famous sebastian ziani by pope alexander the third in acknowledgment of the protection he received from the republic when oppressed by the emperor frederick the second the doge has the title of serenity and serene prince but to show that they are not attached to his person alone ambassadors use them in his absence in addressing the college though all dispatches are written in the name of the prince and the answers addressed to him yet he cannot open them without the members of the college being present whereas they can open and even answer them without his being present and to show that his power and influence is merely imaginary the senate neither propose any question or take any resolution till he and his counselors are withdrawn they then examine the affairs under debate take the advice of the savi and prepare their deliberations in writing to be carried to the first meeting of the senate where the doge and his counselors are present who have a voice to approve or disapprove in common with the other senators the venetian money bears the name of the doge and was formerly stamped as his coin when the power of the prince was absolute at present is substituted the figure of a man in the ducal habit on his knees before st mark to show that the doge is subject to the republic of which st mark is the hieroglyphic the income of the prince is fourteen thousand ducats per annum which amounts to about two thousand pounds sterling to maintain his family and to defray the expense of treating the seignory four times a year the foreign ambassadors who have made their public entry have a right to be at these feasts the republic pay all the officers who attend the prince on public occasions he has the power of selling the different employments of the palace in which and collating the benefices of st mark consist the principal emoluments of his dignity  when the doge dies his body is embalmed and exposed for three days on a bed of state in an apartment of the palace destined for that purpose this exposition is not only to give the people an opportunity to pay the last honors to their prince but also to give the senate time to receive any complaints against his administration and to give his creditors leisure to make their demands on his heirs which if they refuse to satisfy he is deprived of funeral honors at the expense of the republic for this reason on the death of a doge three inquisitors are appointed to search into his past conduct to hear all complaints and to satisfy all demands at the expense of the succession the nobles who assist at the funeral are dressed in scarlet robes to show that it is not the government of the prince that causes the happiness of the state and that the republic being free ought not to show any marks of affliction at his death the obsequies are no sooner over than all the nobles who are more than thirty years of age assemble in the great council chamger and elect five correctors who inspect the book of statutes that the doge on his election swears to observe these five noblemen have a right to add to or to retrench from these statutes whatever they think necessary for the good of the state the ballotation upon this occasion is managed with so much caution that it is impossible for any thing but chance to decide which shall be the fortyone senators chose out of the whole number to elect a successor to the deceased prince when these electors have been approved by the general council they are shut up in the palace of st mark and not suffered to stir out until the election is over twentyfive of the fortyone voices must be in favor of the person that is chosen the first thing required of the doge is to swear to the observance of the book of statutes he then shows himself to the people and in going out of the palace for that purpose passes through the chamber in which his body is to be exposed after his death and there he receives from the grand chancellor the first compliments on his new dignity he then gets into a machine not unlike a great tub and two hundred men who belong to the arsenal carry him by turns round the place of st mark on their shoulders the doge thus seated one of his children or some near relation stands behind him holding two basins filled with money which he distributes among the populace  having killed one prince and proclaimed another i think i may decently take my leave for the present and should you be as tired with reading as i am with writing you will wish you had never heard of his serenity i hope you will think my next more interesting which will treat of the different councils of venice  addio sempre suo etc  letter lxi miss n  to mr hull venice april         having in my last dispatched his serenity the doge i now proceed with alacrity to give you an account of the councils of which according to amelot de la houssaie there are three principal the great one which comprehends all the nobility the college which gives audience to ambassadors and the pregadi which is the senate the greatcouncil meets every sunday and holiday to choose magistrates which is done by ballotation the nobles have no right to enter into it until they are twentyfive years old but the seignory dispense sometimes with their being under age this assembly has a right of confirming or annulling the decrees of the senate and to make or repeal laws the most remarkable standing laws are these viz that all ecclesiastics are excluded from every civil employment and public assembly the nobles cannot arrive at the principal offices but by gradation nor can they hold more than one office at once be it ever so small those who refuse any employment are fined two thousand ducats and banished for two years from the great council and broglio this name they give to an apartment under the procuratia nuova where the noblemen meet in a morning and those who are trying to attain any place in the government use this opportunity to solicit the votes of their friends for their ballotation in the great council no magistrate can resign or leave the city all the sons of the nobility have equal portions if a daughter has more than five thousand ducats about six hundred pounds sterling she receives the income of the overplus for her own separate use and if she dies without children it returns to her family all subjects of the republic the doge not excepted pay taxes in proportion to their fortune the magistrates in civil causes can receive no visits or recommendation of the parties but may in criminal ones if they are not state affairs no nobleman can enter into trade the great council corrects all public errors and redresses all grievances imposed by those who use their authority unlawfully so that this may be called the first tribunal and the basis as well as support of the republic  to gratify the young nobility they admit thirty by lot every year into the great council who are only twenty years of age and allow them the same privileges as those who are twentyfive these young ones are called barbarini because they are chosen on the day of st barbara this assembly sits from eight in the morning until noon it is held in the largest room of the palace at the upper end are raised seats on which the doge and his counselors are placed the chief of the council of ten the avogadores and the censors are seated round the hall upon raised benches the counselors of the doge can convoke at pleasure the great council and for this purpose they cause the bells of the principal churches in the six quarters of the town to be rung and at this signal the nobles attend the council without arms which they are forbid to carry there on pain of death  when amelot de la houssaie wrote his history of the republic of venice the nobles were computed at five and twenty hundred but they now fall very short of that calculation the great council usually consists of about eight hundred and nearly the same number is supposed to be employed in the provinces on embassies and other public services or for private reasons are not in a situation to attend in council  the college  the college is formed of twentysix members viz the doge and his six counselors three of the quarantia criminale who are changed every two months six savi grandi five of the savi of the terra firma and the five savi of order the college has the right of assembling the senate and proposing what is to be debated therein but yet they must obey its resolutions and act in concert with it at this tribunal the majesty of the prince may be said to reside for here the ambassadors have their audience all letters upon foreign affairs are read all memorials are presented and all privileges in regard to benefices prelates etc etc are pleaded in short this is the committee of ways and means where all business is first planned in order to be laid before the senate for their concurrence  the senate  the senate had formerly the name of pregadi given to it because it then never assembled but upon extraordinary occasions and the magistrates were obliged to request the attendance of the principal citizens when any important affair required their advice this assembly now meets every wednesday and friday and upon an emergency the savi for the week can call an extraordinary pregadi this tribunal possesses all the authority of the republic for here all resolutions concerning peace and war are taken all leagues and alliances are made ambassadors and also officers who have considerable rank in the army are nominated and all taxes are imposed according to the exigency of affairs the consultations of the college are here examined and determined by a plurality of voices this institution in its commencement was only composed of sixty senators called an ordinary pregadi but being often obliged in cases of importance to add to the number sixty more were created called the junto these hundred and twenty senators are always noblemen of advanced age and approved merit the members of the college the council of ten the quarantia criminale the procurators of st mark with most part of the magistrates enter also into the pregadi so that it now consists of near three hundred members one part whereof have a right to vote the rest can only hearken and learn the rules of government the doge and his counselors are the only persons whose advice can be ballotted to prevent the confusion that would probably arise from a diversity of opinions as half the votes must be in favor of the question before it can pass those who have no right to vote may harangue and contradict the opinions proposed the hundred and twenty who compose the ordinary pregadi and junto are ballotted every year in the great council to be changed or continued as shall be determined in the said council the senate is particularly attentive in maintaining harmony among the nobles well knowing that a contrary behavior might be productive of fatal consequences to the liberty of the country as was formerly the case with florence and verona  the counselors of the doge  the counselors of the doge or more properly of the signory are six in number they are chosen from amongst the oldest senators of the first rank though they are counselors for a year they only assist in the college eight months the other four months they preside in the quarantia criminale in the same manner as the chiefs of that chamber have places in the college during two months these six counselors have more power than the doge their employment is twofold first they are obliged to consult with the doge upon all matters that are to be proposed in the councils to open all letters directed to the signory to receive petitions and to appoint judges to settle any dispute which may arise about jurisdiction and secondly to preside at all councils and during an interregnum to dispatch orders to all the officers of the state when the doge is ill the most ancient of the counselors represent him in the college and at all public functions but he is neither allowed to sit in the ducal chair or wear the habit of the prince and is only distinguished by a cap which he never takes off no more than the doge does his ducal crown the counselors whilst in office wear scarlet gowns  as i shall in my next introduce you to a tribunal so awful that the bare name makes thousands tremble i shall allow myself some respite for the present and endeavor to lose the idea of these dry intricate subjects in the more pleasing ones of virtu  you will excuse my breaking off thus when i tell you that my gondola now waits to carry me to a dilletanti party with whom i am going to examine the famous marriage of paolo veronese at the convent of st george it so rarely happens that our pleasures in the enjoyment equal the vivacity of our expectation i almost fear i promise myself too much on this occasion but if this celebrated piece deserves half the encomiums that are bestowed upon it my delight will be exquisite i heartily wish you could be a partaker of it  farewell letter lxii miss n  to mr hull april         i promised in my last to introduce you to the most tremendous tribunal that perhaps ever poor culprits trembled before if we view it in its original state but i think all the sensible people i have conversed with in venice agree that it is somewhat relaxed from its primitive severity though still to be dreaded for the extent of power the inquisitors of state are entrusted with  the inquisition  this tribunal is composed of two of the council of ten and one of the counselors of the doge as the affairs that fall under the cognizance thereof are of the utmost consequence to the state depending chiefly upon certain intelligences collected by spies so all their proceedings are managed with the deepest secrecy and in some cases they are obliged to use severity and to punish offenders in a very exemplary manner the life of the doge the nobles and all the subjects of the state lie at the mercy of this tribunal provided the three inquisitors entirely concur in opinion and in this case they are not obliged to give an account of their actions to any one or even communicate them to the council of ten the execution of the sentences pronounced by these judges is not less secret than their judgments except when the crime is of a public nature in private cases to prevent exclamations against such seeming severity as often punishes with death an unguarded expression against so rigorous a government it is said they send in the night and have the offender seized and pronounce his doom without any other ceremony than confronting him with two witnesses if there are any or else on the bare report of spies as many inconveniences have arisen from this despotic method of proceeding a law has been provided that the inquisitors shall not put to death a noble venetian without first hearing his defense if a stranger of any consequence becomes suspected by this tribunal he must expect to lose his papers and receive an order signed by one of the inquisitors requiring him to leave the state within a limited time on pain of death as the venetian nobility of every class are forbid to hold any sort of correspondence with ambassadors or foreign ministers or even with the meanest person in their families it is for this intent that the spies of the inquisitors are particularly vigilant in collecting matter of complaint  harsh as the proceedings of this tribunal must appear to englishmen who are blessed with the happiest form of government the sensible and unprejudiced montesquieu asserts that it has often saved the republic of venice from total destruction  the council of ten  this was orignally a mere temporary chamber of justice appointed to enquire into the famous conspiracy of tiepoli but was soon after made perpetual and is now one of the most respectable tribunals of the republic it takes cognizance of all the criminal affairs among the nobility that happen in the city or state of venice and judges crimes of leze majeste and all other attrocious offenses this council has the care of the public tranquillity and their power is as much to be dreaded by the nobles as by the common people the doge and his counselors have a right to enter this chamber of justice but the ten senators of whom it is composed have not less power in the absence of the doge than when he is present they are chosen out of different families and are elected in the great council every year they then elect three among themselves to be the head of the councils these rule week about and are changed every three months the chief in office receives all informations from spies and reports them to his colleagues who upon the deposition of witnesses and the answers of the accused proceed against them before the council where the offender is not allowed to plead for himself personally or by lawyer the armed galley that always lies at st marks place and some cannon and galleys at the arsenal are under the command of the council of ten they meet only once a week unless some affair of importance calls them oftener together  the quarantia criminale  there are three courts of justice that consist each of forty judges the first of these is the most ancient tribunal of the republic but it has suffered a great diminution of power by the establishment of the council of ten the forty judges of the upper chamber have a right to vote in the senate and the three chiefs who are presidents have likewise seats in the college during the two last months they are in office and three of the counselors of the doge preside in the quarantia criminale the four last months of their year to show the connection there is between this chamber and the college this office is generally filled by noblemen who are not rich they receive thirty ducats per month by it and acquire consideration among the nobility to arrive at this chamber they must pass through the other quarantias first which are much inferior in authority besides these there are many other lower courts of justice that take cognizance of mercantile affairs bankruptcies etc etc it is worthy of observation in this wise and intricate government how all the superior tribunals are interwoven with and if i may use the expression germinate from each other  savi grandi  these magistrates are six in number they are chosen from among the wisest of the senators and during the time they are in office manage all political affairs of importance and are properly speaking prime ministers they are elected by the senate and changed every six months three at a time by which means there remain three old senators in office who are able to inform the new elected ones of what happened during their administration and serves as a model for the future conduct of the new ministers  savi of the terra firma  these five officers of the state have little less authority in the college than the savi grandi they are the same length of time in office are chosen of a less advanced age and are preferred according to their application and the abilities they have shown in the offices they must necessarily have passed through to arrive at this the first or savi cashier is play master the second savi degli scritura secretary at war and the third savi of the ordinance has the direction of the military of the terra firma the other two are only to assist the three first they are elected by the senate as the savi grandi and have a right to vote on every motion which may be proposed by them but to preserve a subordination between the two offices have no right to vote in the senate  savi of order  this magistracy is the same in number as the savi of the terra firma but is without jurisdiction and is only a school as it were wherein the young nobility may learn the art of government these noblemen during the six months they are in office assist at all the consultations of the college and consequently have a share in the secrets of state they have no right to vote either in the college or senate but may give their opinion at the consultations of the savi always speaking uncovered and standing they are allowed to see all the dispatches that are sent to ambassadors and the registers of the affairs of state this employment is looked upon by the republic as the touchstone of the character and genius of their young nobility  procurators of st mark  this honor is generally bestowed on such of the nobility who have been of essential service to their country in expensive embassies in a naval command or for having gone through the most important employments of the state with honor and integrity the procurators take place of all the other nobility they have the disposal of all pious legacies are the guardians of orphans and protectors of widows the number was formerly confined to nine but is now increased to eleven in pressing necessities of the republic this dignity has been sold for immense sums but except in cases of public distress it can only be disposed of by merit and those who purchase it never have any successors appointed when they die their dress is a purple robe the magnificent buildings on each side of st marks place were originally destined for the habitation of the procurators and from thence called procuratias but they are now chiefly rented to strangers and foreign ministers by way of casinos  the grand chancellor  this dignity can only be enjoyed by a person of the rank of citizen he takes place of all the other magistrates and wears a purple robe like the procurators of st mark all the councils are open to him he holds the seal of the republic and assists at reading and answering the dispatches from ambassadors and every thing else material that is treated of in the senate he has the title of excellenza and is the head of the people as the doge is of the nobility his income is about nine thousand ducats per annum he is buried with great pomp at the expense of the republic  the avogadores  this office resembles in part that of attorney general in england but is divided among three people the greatest instance of its power is being able for the space of three days to suspend the judgment of all the other courts of justice when the crime is not clearly proved upon the culprit in this particular the avogador resembles the roman tribunes of the people they are elected by the senate but the choice must be confirmed by the grand council where all proceedings would be null if one of the avogadores did not assist their dress when in office is a purple robe  the two censors  the jurisdiction of the censors extends principally to the manners of particular persons to the intrigues of the nobles in the broglio to the condemnation and fining of those who violate the statutes of the great council to the payment of wages pilfering of servants and correction of gondaliers they are sixteen months in office during which term they have a right to vote in the pregadi and wear purple gowns  i have extended this beyond the common bounds of a letter and find that by so doing i have lost half an hour of an agreeable conversation where i am engaged this evening so shall only add that i am sincerely  yours etc p s i am obliged to one of my gondaliers a clever intelligent fellow for reminding me that it is past the hour of my engagement and here let me do justice to this numerous body of people by saying they are one of the most respectable societies i have any where heard of for their honesty and fidelity to the master they engage themselves to    letter lxiii miss n  to mr hull venice april         with your leave my good friend i am going to engage you in a little trip to the terra firma in order to introduce you to the podestas and capitanios a set of gentlemen of no small consequence i assure you in their respective governments  to the greater towns of the terra firma the senate send two noblemen with the titles of podesta and capitanio these equally represent the republic the first in the administration of civil justice the second in the command of military affairs the podesta is the principal person as he takes cognizance of all that regards the police and the good order of the people the capitanio besides the command of the troops has power to punish the inhabitants for any crime committed in the streets during the course of the night he has also the care of the public money which is collected by receivers who are accountable to him for it the podestas and capitanios are obliged to report to the senate every measure they take to the capitals of provinces are generally sent both the abovementioned officers but in towns of small importance the two offices are united in the person of the podesta who holds his employment sixteen months the appointments allowed them by the republic are very small in comparison to what they are obliged to spend in the capitals therefore to them the senate generally sends rich noblemen and poor ones to the small towns where not being obliged to make an expensive appearance they may if they please gain a comfortable subsistence by their post during the time they are employed in it  a nobleman of the first rank is always sent into the frioul with the title of proveditoregeneral of palma nova this place is of great consequence to the venetians as it serves for a frontier to the emperors dominions and is a strong barrier against the incursions of the turks at udeney where the patriarch of aquilia resides the republic employs only a lieutenant and some subalterns in istria are four episcopal towns with five others not so considerable each of them governed by a podesta the commandingofficers of these places as well as those of the levant and dalmatia are changed only once in two years the senate gives the title of counts governors and captains to the noblemen who are sent into dalmatia to administer justice the magistrates of the principal towns for example the counts of spalatro and gara who are likewise archbishops have appointed to them a council of three noble venetians without whom they cannot determine on any thing but all these officers are subject to the proveditoregeneral who has full authority in all affairs civil and military the isles of corfuzant and cephalonia are each governed by a proveditore assisted by a council of three noble venetians corfu is a place of great importance as it commands the entrance of the gulf and is the repository of the venetian merchandise brought from the levant this place is regarded by the turks with a jealous eye there is also a general of these three isles to whom the particular proveditores render obedience as the magistrates of the towns in dalmatia do to the proveditoregeneral  inquisitors of the terra firma  every five years inquisitors are sent to hold courts in the several provinces of the terra firma their business is to inspect into the conduct of podestas and capitanios and to receive all complaints of maladministration of justice their censures are seldom severe but when there are proofs of embezzlement of the public money and in that case their office obliges them to act with the utmost rigor they are attended by a company of cavalry and an executioner that they may punish on the spot all offenses that are clearly proved this gives the provincials a very high idea of the justice of the venetian government  the magistrates of pomp  gli sopre proveditore all pomp are senators who by strict ordinances suppress all outward marks of luxury and preserve an exact equality in the exterior appearance of the nobility at public feasts the dress of the ladies is always black except on some occasions when they are allowed to wear a rich gold or silver stuff petticoat with their black gowns the noble venetians are not suffered to use gold or silver lace on their boatmens liveries or in their boxes at the theaters except the doges family and the grand chancellors in maskingtime the ladies may wear rich colored clothes which is about six months in the year and when they are at their estates on the terra firma they may give as rich liveries as they choose but the servants who wear them never attend them at venice but in their own houses  revenues and expenses of the state  the settled revenue of the republic is supposed at present according to the best calculation to amount to about a million and a half sterling per annum this is raised by imports and exports and taxes upon all the provisions consumed in the city of venice and upon all sorts of merchandises and by other duties raised in the isles of the lagunes and upon all the estates situated near venice called the dogado or duchy another part of the revenue is raised in the same manner from the towns and provinces of the terra firma and also from istria dalmatia and the isles of corfu zant and cephalonia a large portion likewise arises from the salt made at corfu and chiosa and to this may be added twenty thousand ducats per month that are paid into the coffers of the republic from a lottery on the same plan as those of rome and naples which has been established within these thirty years in time of war the senate finds great resources by ennobling rich families making supernumerary procurators of st mark by renewing old taxes and imposing new ones the yearly expenses of government do not require above half the income of the state so that in time of peace the republic can lay up vast sums by which means the venetians are enabled to negotiate all their affairs with foreign powers by the force of money instead of arms  the forces of the republic  in time of peace the venetians are supposed to pay about twentyfive thousand men but there is strong reason to believe that not above one third of them are effective owing to the abuses of the proveditores in dalmatia the infantry are chiefly sclavonians morlaques and albanians they are esteemed brave soldiers and are firmly attached to the venetians from an inveterate hatred to the turks who are their natural enemies the cavalry are partly composed of the same nations and partly of ultramontanes the general in chief must always be a foreigner and his power is so overruled by the proveditoregeneral that he has only the name of commander of the forces the chief attention of the senate is paid to the marine they have no regular naval force in time of peace but upon an emergency can arm thirty galleys able to act against their enemies in a very expeditious manner they always keep some galleys in the levant with other vessels to guard the provinces situated near the sea these are under the command of the proveditoregeneral a squadron of six galleys and several other vessels are likewise employed to cruize about the mouth of the gulf to secure the traders from the corsairs and to make the merchants pay their proper duties the nobleman who commands this squadron has the title of general of the gulf his command continues for three years the republic in peace as well as in war creates a proveditore general who commands both the fleet and army he has an absolute power to punish with death all officers soldiers and sailors and to dispose of all posts in the army and navy he resides at corfu the first three years he is in office and when that time is expired he is obliged to render an account of his administration to the senate  spies and informers  spies have ever been looked upon as infamous ministers of tyranny but the senate of venice have found means to conceal the shame of such miscreants by making mouths of stone speak for them for in many parts of the palace of st mark and in all the parts of the city near the public tribunals heads are cut in the walls with gaping mouths into which they cast the notes of information if the informer has no scruple to declare himself he goes in person to receive the reward allowed by law on this occasion if he does not choose to be known he sends a friend with a piece of paper that has been torn from that on which the information was written and the money is paid without any other formality than comparing the two pieces of paper together as the great maxim of the venetians is that the safety of the state depends upon their having exact intelligence of every thing that passes especially in the families of ambassadors and foreign ministers it is incredible what a number of spies of all ranks they keep in constant pay that the venetians are often branded with the ridiculous epithet of pantaloons for this apparent mysteriousness in their system of politics we very well know but how far they are right or wrong in it i leave to better judgments than mine to determine this however we must allow that their government has subsisted under a republican form without any material alteration for a much longer period of time than any other republic that history furnishes us with an account of at least that i can recollect i had a great curiosity when i came to venice to learn the etymology of the name of pantaloon and why it is so particularly applied to the venetians i am told it comes from pianta leone and was first appropriated to them for their great eagerness to plant the standard of venice which you know is a lion wherever they could by force or fraud obtain a bit of ground large enough to contain it how far this etymological account of honest pantaloon may satisfy you i know not but remember i do not vouch for the reality of it i only offer it to you as i have received it i propose by the next post to send you a succinct account of the method of proceeding at venice in criminal cases and am in the mean time  faithfully yours etc  letter lxiv miss n  to mr hull venice may        an agreeable excursion for a few days into the country has prevented my being so punctual in my literary engagement as i have hitherto been but i make no aplogy for i know you never meant it should interfere with my amusements now to proceed with my historical anecdotes  proceedings in criminal cases at venice  when a crime is supposed to have been committed at venice the courts of justice are more solicitous to be ascertained of the fact than to secure the offender and when they have obtained the necessary proofs they send an officer to enter publicly the house of the criminal and on the report of this officer that he is not be found which is generally the case they summon him to appear in a longer or shorter space of time according to the enormity of the crime committed to answer for the offense and till that period is elapsed the offender is safe from any molestation provided he does not appear on the place of st mark or on the rialto and he may also demand three delays and if he thinks he cannot find means to prevent the affair coming to a fatal issue he may avoid a trial by getting a noblemans boat to convey him to some part of the terra firma from whence he may easily escape out of the state hence it proceeds that most criminals at venice are judged by contumacy which they call bandire but this judgment is always accompanied with conditions proportionable to the crime for example that the condemned person shall never be able to purchase his pardon that whoever kills him in the venetian state shall receive a considerable reward and double the sum if they kill him in any other territory if the crime sensibly touches the republic they add to the reward the liberty of delivering a stateprisoner but notwithstanding this apparent great rigor there have been instances of noblemen who have been guilty of atrocious crimes making their peace by means of great interest when the criminal is secured and the process formed the avogador names his own day and conducting the culprit before his judges pleads strongly against him exaggerates every particular of his crime and concludes with advising a severe punishment the advocate of the party accused answers all the chief points of the accusation and when he has performed his part the auditors retire and the opinion of the avogador is balloted against that of the chiefs of the quarantia which is always the most gentle and the plurality of balls determine the fate of the offender by this means the judges decide without giving the reason of their opinion and it is consequently unknown who is for and who is against the criminal the lawyers are obliged to plead in the venetian dialect that the most ignorant auditor may understand what passes as well as the more learned part of the assembly the severest hardship in the course of justice at venice is the length of time it takes to terminate an affair owing to the courts of justice being so closely connected and if i may be allowed the expression playing into each others hands so that a poor wretch is often suffered to lie in gaol for two or three years before he can obtain an hearing to expiate as they pretend by this punishment part of his crime the frequent sentences that are passed upon criminals condemning them to an horrid obscure prison for eight or ten years and often for life where in winter they suffer all the rigor of extreme cold and in summer of excessive heat are certainly more cruel punishments than death at once  now in my usual abrupt manner i shall conduct you at one step from temporal to spiritual affairs and say a few words of the church whose power is very limited in this republic  the state of the church  the republic of venice has ever been careful to exclude the clergy from their councils and from all political employments even those who are noble venetians the head of the church is styled patriarch of venice and primate of dalmatia he is always a nobleman enjoys a good revenue makes a respectable appearance in public processions but has no power even in ecclesiastical affairs at all religious functions where the popes nuncio is present the patriarch is obliged to send the master of the ceremonies to ask his permission to give the blessing an office of inquisition is allowed at venice but under such restrictions as render it as dependent on the political government as any of the secular tribunals are the holyoffice is composed of the patriarch the nuncio and a friar who has the title of father inquisitor and two experienced senators without whose presence and consent all proceedings are null by this means and under this pretext that matters brought before the inquisition are contrary to the laws and interest of the republic the greatest affairs of this tribunal are reduced to a mere trifle the convents in venice were formerly so ill regulated that it occasioned much scandal but at present they are under better discipline for three magistrates are appointed by the senate with an extensive authority to take cognizance of all that passes in the female monasteries and though the patriarch himself allows a priest to say mass in one of their churches he is obliged to obtain a permission from one of these magistrates besides who limits this license to what time he thinks proper all the women likewise who perform any commissions for the nuns are obliged under penalty of corporal punishment to have leave in writing to execute them signed by one of the aforesaid magistrates the senate has within these few years made many wise and useful reformations in the regular convents of friars also and have transferred from the superiors of those houses to the senate the power of inflicting capital punishments and imprisonment upon the monks and only allow them for the future to impose penances of fasting prayers and such like conventual exercises  now we must return from spiritual to temporal affairs again that i may have the honor to introduce you to the venetian noblesse who are not a little vain of the great antiquity of their nobility which they can certainly many of them at least authenticate for several ages past better than any other nation we are acquainted with  nobility of the first class  the noble venetians who compose the first class comprehend the families of the twelve tribunes who elected the first doge in  0  the contarini morosini poli badovari tiepoli michele sanudi gradenigo memo falier dondolo and barozzi the four families next to these in point of antiquity date their nobility from the year  00 when they signed the contract for the abbey of st george the great these are the justiniani cornaro bragadini and bembo the first are popularly called the twelve apostles and the last the four evangelists to this class may be added also eight families who look upon themselves as equal to the first because long before il serral del consiglio which happened in      they were very considerable these are the delphini quirini soranzo zorzi and marcello the other three by reason of extreme poverty are fallen into total obscurity or perhaps are extinct in this class too may be placed some illustrious families who retired to venice from the town of acre in syria when it was destroyed by the venetian general tiepoli for having revolted from its obedience to the republic after the first conquest of it the greatest advantage these families derive from their antiquity is being more considered in the disposal of public employments that reflect honor on the possessors in point of precedence all the nobility of venice rank alike  nobility of the second class  this class is composed of those who can produce no authentic proof of their nobility earlier than      when their names were written in the libro doro which now contains more than five hundred families it was at that memorable event il serrar del consiglio that this list of the nobles was first made out and a law enacted that if the names of their children were not written in this book within a certain time after their birth they should forfeit their title to nobility and this also happens if the contract of their parents marriage does not legally pass the senate which it cannot do if a noble venetian marries a public performer either in the drama or music one who has been in a state of servitude or one whose father is of any profession or trade excepting a physician a manufacturer of gold or silver silks or a maker of glass as it is now upwards of four hundred years since il serrar del consiglio this class of nobles is highly esteemed the most considerable of these families that still exist are the moncenigo the capello foscarini foscari grimani gritti garzoni lovedan dona nani malipiero pesoro pisani priuli ruzzini sagredo valier venier bassadona etc etc most of these have given doges to the republic and the reigning one at present is a moncenigo in this rank are also placed thirty families that were ennobled ninetyone years later on the termination of the genoese war as a reward for assisting the state with vast sums of momey the most considerable of these that are remaining are the trevisan vendramin renier justi and pasqualighi  after having introduced you to so much good company i think you will not be sorry if i take my leave for the present but i cannot do that without first assuring you that i am with truth etc etc  letter lxv miss n  to mr hull venice may        to proceed with my subject where i left it in my last letter i must now talk to you a little of a younger branch of the venetian nobility whom i shall style the third class and even these are respectable for their antiquity  nobility of the third class  in this class are comprehended about eighty families who purchased their nobility for an hundred thousand ducats each during the last war of candia some of these have remained poor and distressed ever since by that instance of their vanity the following are still considerable for their wealth and alliances the videman labia zenobia fini manini gambara etc etc the savorgnan gave to the republic some fortresses of great importance for guarding the venetitian territories from the encroachments of the turks and the benzoni made the state a present of the province of crema of which they possessed the seignory and for these free gifts the two families received the honor of being ennobled though the noble venetians can authenicate the antiquity of their nobility better than any people perhaps in europe yet not content with this advantage they are fond of deriving their families from fabulous originals thus the contarini from a similitude of name pretend to be descended from ancient german princes who were styled counts of the rhine the justiniani who give for their arms a spread eagle from thence claim their descent from an emperor of the east of their name i have been told a curious anecdote of this noble family that i will relate for your amusement some centuries past they fitted out a vessel under the doge vital michele to fight against the emperor emanuel who had ill treated the venetians in the levant the justiniani were all cut to pieces and the only surviving male was a benedictine friar for whom the doge obtained a dispensation of his vows from the pope and married him to his daughter and from this couple are descended the present family according to this legend which whether true or false i shall not take upon me to determine one branch of the cornaro family style themselves cornaro della regina from one of their house having been queen of candia but this alliance is rather a blot in their escutcheon if a certain evil fame may be relied on who says that the husband of this lady was an usurper whom she poisoned and treacherously betrayed the candians to the venetians a gentleman has promised to introduce me to a lady of this name who is a very agreeable sensible woman and who he says will show me the complete ornaments of the toilette of the queen abovementioned which is still in the possession of the family and valued by them at many thousand ducats  the citizens or order of secretaries  the citizens had formerly a large share in the government and venice would probably have always remained in a state of democracy had not the resentment of pietro gradenigo against many of the class who opposed his being chosen doge determined him to transfer the power entirely from the people into the hands of the nobility which he fully effected by means of the serrar del consiglio at which period several of the nobles lost their rank by not being admitted into the secret and at present by the word citizen at venice is meant the families thus excluded from the grand council many of whom bear the same name and arms of the old nobility and to these may be added many who by merit or money have obtained the same privileges in the republic they rank with the nobility of the terra firma and one at least of every family wears the vest the same as the noble venetians it has been thought this is allowed them to prevent the people from observing how small a number of men they are governed by though by a standing law every noble venetian is forbid to enter into trade yet they often join privately in commerce with the wealthy citizens which the senate winks at because when they are become opulent they can make it turn to the advantage of the state by employing them in expensive embassies from among the citizens are chosen the secretaries of the senate secretaries of embassies and also residents at foreign courts for a noble venetian can accept of no employment of that kind but with the title of ambassador and for the same reason the republic receives no foreign minister in any intermediate character between a resident and an ambassador the dignity of grand chancellor is always conferred on one of this class and as it is the highest honor that can be attained by a person who is not noble it is generally given as a reward to one who has served the republic well in expensive residencies the subjects of the venetian state are by some rated at present at about         but those who have made very accurate enquiries upon this head affirm that they are overrated by one million  thus my friend i have obeyed your commands and in as concise a manner as i possibly could have endeavored to give you a just idea of the very extraordinary government of the republic of venice i flatter myself that by offering you this at one view i have saved you the trouble of turning over some books which besides being very dry reading you might not easily have met with but was this little extract or whatever you are pleased to call it to fall under the observation of a less indulgent judgment than yours i should with great reason fear being charged with having given it in a slovenly incorrect manner i shall only advance in my defense that you well know how limited my time is at venice and how strongly my natural inclination leads me to a much more entertaining study than that of history but to such a friend as yourself i could not refuse a gratification that it was in my power to procure you at the trifling expense of putting myself for a few hours out of my way i only wish you may find my attempt satisfactory however before i entirely quit this subject i cannot forbear communicating to you a few reflections into which it has naturally led me it is melancholy to observe that in a government so wise in many of its parts such gross errors should be suffered to pass uncorrected as must in time most certainly destroy the whole system a total neglect evidently appears in the education of the young nobility which gives them an ignorance i had almost said brutality that renders them very disagreeable in civil society and must prove an obstacle to their becoming wise and prudent magistrates and added to this the licentiousness not only permitted but even encouraged among the clergy has produced such a shameful neglect in matters of true religion that vice and immorality seem to prevail among all ranks of people which must in time infallibly bring to a final dissolution this once flourishing and powerful republic how amazingly must the manners of the venetians have been corrupted since their first establishment if the abbate langier has drawn a true character of them in his storia veneta p   0 libro   he says esigevansi costumi puri condotta semplice una vita laboriosia per ottenere da lei la qualita di cittadino the same author quotes a letter written by cassiodorus who was minister from king theodorick to the tribunes of the maritime isles which contains these words piu di sussante piccole isole essendo state abitate successivamente intorno rialto per componere al fire questa cita prodigiosa p   0 libro   i have transcribed this only by way of observing how very early rialto now called venice became a considerable place langier places the election of paolo lucio anafeste the first doge in     which is twelve years earlier than st disdiers account who says this prince was elected in  0  amelot de la houssai in his history of the republic of venice says the government of venice by consuls and tribunes which lasted   0 years may be called her infancy the despotic reign of the doges from paolo lucio anafeste to sebastian riani which comprehends     years her childhood the democracy which lasted above a century her youth which says he was robust and vigorous but as it often happens in similar cases it was disturbed and agitated by dangerous paroxisms of wars and revolts her virility he adds began with il serrar del consiglio and lasted till the war of the league of cambray in   0  which may be called the beginning of her old age  the republic liberally rewarded sanazar for the following very flattering epigram viderat adriacis venetum neptunus in undis stare urbem and toto dicere jura mari i nunc tarpeias quantum vis jupiter arces objice and illa tui maenia martis ait si tiberim pelago confers urbem aspice utramque illam homines dices hanc possuisse deos   thus hastily translated by a gentleman of my acquaintance neptune within the adriatic seas beheld fair venice her rich turrets raise and seem over all the main to issue her decrees  jove quoth the god on all thy power i call to equal this  bring thine own marss wall  tarpeian cliffs  immortal tybers waves where mighty rome her deep foundations laves compare the cities and reluctant own thy proudest toils by what i guard outdone works but of human skill thy bulwarks stand mine boast the touch of an immortal hand   as i am very partial to this famous republic even in her present faulty state i cannot do better than to take my leave of her after paying her so high a compliment and at the same time shall bid you my dear friend adieu for some time as i propose leaving venice in a few days and from what place i shall next write to you i cannot at present foresee farewell believe me etc etc  letter lxvi miss n  to mr hull palluello june  0 my dearest friend the kind expressions in your welcome epistle and superabundant thanks for my venetian extract were i assure you a cordial to my heart i am rejoiced that our worthy patroness has passed so good a winter and hope the summer will be still more propitious to her  you will see by the date of this letter we have changed our situation and are got to a sweet retirement on the banks of the brenta the house is large convenient clean and cheerful the gardens spacious and in good order and the whole atmosphere perfumed with roses jasmines and orange flowers which we have in great profusion the river which is in the front of the house affords a continual moving picture of large barges passing to and fro from venice to padua from either of which places we can have any thing brought by water to the very door the north side of the river is planted with forest trees and the south side with vines that hang in beautiful festoons supported by other trees in short we want nothing but a few liberal souls such as distinguish the party you are with in this neighborhood to render this delicious spot an absolute terrestrial paradise yet i am sure whilst you have the advantage of such a society you would not exchange your retired spot for all i have been describing and in this preference i join with you most cordially and beg my best love to all the dear members that are so happy to be collected within the magic circle  a hasty summons on account of the departure of the packet that contains this trifle obliges me to use more brevity than i am either accustomed or inclined to i cannot however send it off without enclosing a piece of news that i flatter myself is not quite indifferent to you namely that please god no unforeseen accident intervenes in a twelvemonths time at farthest i may probably be so happy as to salute you all in your usual dear assemblyroom be persuaded however of this simple truth that whether the time i am absent from you all is long or short or the distance great or small i am ever and shall always remain with the same affection and sincerity  your ever faithful and obliged s n  pray let me have the pleasure to hear from you soon  p s by the bye i have a favor in the transcriptway to entreat of you you do not forget i am sure that previous to my setting off for venice i was hurried about my usual fate from spot to spot and sent you occasional accounts of such places and events as i thought best worth your notice a dear friend here wishes to see them now as some time is elapsed it would save my head as well as hand much trouble if you would oblige me with copies of those letters provided you have thought them worth preserving i mean only as you may imagine the descriptive parts of them    letter lxvii this and the ensuing letters are the transcripts desired in the foregoing which the editor presumes are not an unwelcome addition miss n  to mr hull bridgenorth july   dear sir i think myself so much obliged to you for you taking so much notice of my insignificant scrawl that i am not the least inclined to find fault with the length of time you have taken in answering my last and to show my sincerity in this particular i am sat down to acknowledge your favor though i have not had it in my possession longer than this afternoon for it has lain some time in london i have been on a visit to a worthy friend of ours at this place for a month past and i assure you i have all the reason in the world to be satisfied with my journey pray good sir did you ever see bridgenorth i believe not  very well then i must give you some little description of this place as i am habituated to do of every new spot i tread upon whether large or small for i think bridgenorth is in point of situation by much the prettiest i ever saw it is divided into two parishes distinguished by the names of the upper and lower town i was the other day on a visit to the rector of the upper parish the parsonagehouse is a truly gothic structure which overlooks the churchyard and though i cannot say this is the most pleasant yet it certainly is not the least useful prospect in the world to a speculative mind the upper town is situated on a cliff which renders it very wholesome both from its height and the clearness of the air the view from our back windows is more beautiful than any thing you can imagine at the foot of the hill the severn rolls its crystal waves in a charming serpentine stream down to the banks whereof is a succession of sloping gardens that vie with each other in beauty fragrance and order on the opposite side in a vale lies the lower town and above that are delightful fields and meadows interspersed with fine plantations of trees of a long growth the grounds by an easy ascent terminate at last in a common fifteen miles long on which is a very good horsecourse to the left the prospect is bounded by a very high rock and on the right as far as the eye can stretch is a fine open fertile country this strong contrast has a most happy effect a noble object in this inimitable landscape is the ruin of an old castle which from the position wherein it has been left by a cannonball is perhaps one of the greatest curiosities in europe it strikes us with admiration and awe while we contemplate its nodding towers which look as if they meant to overwhelm the heedless passenger in sudden destruction yet the mathematicians affirm that nothing less than an earthquake can move this immense pile of building round it is a delightful walk where we often repair when the weather is inviting but when this happens not to be the case we have for our amusement in the house a microscope a reflecting tellescope and a camera obscura the first of these is my favorite mr l  by the help of it the other day detected a beau of an humble be in the very act of scratching a louse oh shameful truth off the downy part of his neck and this little animal though scarcely perceptible to the naked eye is a most tremendous figure much resembling a hog in the glass for my part though i am not apt to be attracted by gaudy colors i am absolutely in love with the radiant armor of a green beetle richly gilded with a sunbeam i own to you my good friend i have a hearty contempt for the coxcombs of the human race who place all their happiness in dress when i consider that an humble moth in the simple habit which nature has given it far outshines them in all the glitter of lace and embroidery  whenever we amuse ourselves with these sort of contemplations our worthy neighbor the pastor never fails to make improvement go hand in hand with amusement by taking occasion to expatiate on the wisdom and bounteous goodness of our great creator exemplified in the most minute as well as in the greatest objects of nature this excellent man edifies his parishioners as much by the exemplary life he leads as by the sound and orthodox doctrine he delivers from the pulpit and he does this with the most cheerful disposition that can be and totally free from the least shadow of ostentation we attend him every morning to public prayers in the church  now my good friend i have given you a very particular account of my present situation and leave it to you to judge if it is not very agreeable i must add to this that i got here time enough for the races where there was a great appearance of company for such a place though men were scarce i got a partner each night lord stamfords family were the first in rank lady mary gray opened the ball and i had the honor to dance a minuet with mr gray the first night indeed i have met with so much politeness and goodness from every body in this part of the world that i am sure i shall be grieved to leave bridgenorth my first setting out from london was not so lucky for i was robbed and terrified almost to death but thank god my loss was but small and i have entirely recovered my spirits  i desire my love and best respects to the worthy family you are with and am  your very faithful friend s n   letter lxviii miss n  to mr hull dunkeld july    i have been some time without hearing from you i hope the excellent president of our society is not laid up with her old plague the gout if social worth could ward off malady she would never be ill perhaps you have not been in the writingvein such a fit attacks us all at times and you know it is our rule reciprocally to allow for it if that is the case do but subscribe the initials of your name to a good though short account of yourselves and i will rest contented  i know not what i said in my last but to the best of my rememberance i gave you no account of this terestrial paradise but now i am more acquainted with its beauties i will make an attempt of that sort  the  sweet winding tay which runs at the bottom of our garden for upwards of six miles forms the most beautiful canal you can imagine on the one side of it for the same extent are delightful walks rising one above another no less than five stages all amply shaded with stately trees from around whose trunks the twining woodbine and sweetbriar pours forth a profusion of sweets the sloping sides of the walks are also planted with variety of sweet smelling shrubs which being fanned by the fresh breezes off the river scatter perfumes in a plenteous and grateful return along the verdant banks at judicious distances are placed grassy seats mossgrown cells and flowery arbours all which in their several turns would invite us to sit down and indulge contemplation but that the unwearied mind enraptured with these enchanting objects urges us to proceed in search of new beauties and in that pursuit it cannot here meet with the slightest disappointment the opposite side of the river is a deep bank finely fringed with wood of a younger growth at different points of view we see the brawn another beautiful river and a foaming cascade each paying the tribute of their lucid stores into the crystal bosom of the tay who as if conscious of superior merit trips nimbly along in murmurs of selfapplause this charming prospect is at last closed with views of distant ruins hills covered with trees fertile vales and mountains of a most venerable appearance covered with a heath so beautiful that it may vie with the glowing amaranthus the gardens are very extensive and laid out in the finest taste that is to say with grandeur and simplicity united nature appears here in her loveliest attire and art is contented to act in her proper sphere as handmaid to the goddess we seldom drink tea in the house sometimes an elegant tent and marquis is pitched at some fine point of view sometimes we resort to a fine banqueting room and often the shade of a large spreading oak has the preference upon these occasions the duke always reads and we work what most attracts my admiration here is to perceive that in every surrounding object utility adds merit to beauty the farmhouses on this estate are neat as the hand of industry can make them and cheerful as the smiles of content and every creature that breathes upon this spot seems to participate in the unfeigned happiness of the excellent possessors whose goodness adds the highest luster to wealth and title that they are capable of receiving it was well said whoever made the observation that a good action never loses its reward here was i sat down full of love and respect to write my dearest friends a dutiful and loving letter when lo and behold i was made happy by the receipt of yours and truly rejoiced i am to find that my fears are groundless however i dont feel happy at the thought of our societys meeting with any interruption to its pleasures believe my assurance sincere when i affirm that i think the content which reigns therein far excels in value the highest gratifications that show and grandeur can bestow on its restless votaries pray have you ever read de touches comedies i am positive such excellent subjects modelled for our stage would be of public emolument and i should hope would be productive of both honor and profit to the undertaker i am afraid by what you say of dunkeld i gave you an account of its beauties in my last if so this will be a horrid stupid repetition in that case commit me to the flames without the least remorse of conscience i hope the sight of a letter directed by the pen of a fine young gentleman will not give you any alarm i confess it has done so by me since this new fashioned way of franking adieu in more haste than can be expressed believe me ever  your very sincere friend s n   letter lxix miss n  to mr hull dunkeld sept  0      how strong and wonderful my good friend is the force of habit i remember near upon my departure from the dear society in somersetshire i felt an awkward kind of  i dont know what  when it was proposed that i should maintain a continual correspondence with one of the other sex during my absence i felt this even in spite of the conviction that writing to you was in fact but writing to the whole circle how idle  now that i have done so for some time i have taught myself to address you with as little reserve as if you were my real instead of my nominal uncle so much the better  reserve was not made for true friendship and liberal minds and with none but such do i correspond  so much by way of digression now to return to my little travels  we have been these six weeks past at atholl house a very magnificent seat of the dukes twenty miles higher up in the highlands than this place is though it far exceeds dunkeld in grandeur yet i own the rural beauties of the latter have more charms for my humble disposition providence having no doubt designed me to tread the cool sequestered vale of life has bounded my ideas accordingly and i look upon this as one of the numberless instances i have experienced of the divine bounty the country about atholl is very romantic and beautiful in some places rather wild in others very fertile which forms a fine contrast the house is immensely large the rooms are infinite in number finely proportioned and elegantly furnished throughout it is situated in a very extensive vale amply wooded and ornamented with four beautiful rivers all of which at different places lose themselves in the tay some of them from the tops of very high mountains receive a prodigious increase from the finest natural cascades you can imagine which is a sight extremely beautiful and at the same time very tremendous the kitchengarden is the finest thing of the kind that in my life i ever saw elegant summerhouses alcoves octagons etc etc often tempted us to drink tea abroad and enjoy the fine extensive views at leisure i should have told you that the vale is surrounded with hills and mountains at such a distance that instead of confining the prospect they add greatly to the grandeur of it  i must not omit to mention a natural curiosity i here met with of a very extraordinary kind m pherson lord of foignes two years before the peace raised eight and twenty men to serve in america who unanimously declared when they came to embark that they would not have enlisted had they not thought they should have served under him the generous lord was so struck with this proof of their attachment that he declared they should not be disappointed and at the age of seventytwo asked leave to serve as a volunteer during the remainder of the campaign he was present in every action was always ready to expose his person and never was a single day prevented by illness from doing his duty the government has rewarded his spirited generosity with a lieutenancy and leave to retire upon full pay so that now like the patriarchs of old he wages more harmless wars with the feathered race and swiftfooted stag now at near fourscore years of age he is able to walk and scramble amongst the mountains the whole day in pursuit of game how few my good friend of our degenerate countrymen are at such an age able to serve their king and country enervated by sloth and luxury long before that period of life they become a burden to themselves and a torment to all about them when i looked at the military garb and venerable silver locks of this northern hero i fancied i saw in his single person an epitome of all the illustrious greeks that served in the siege of troy and if my heart had been inclined to change its present situation i verily believe i should without hesitation have bestowed it upon this warlike mountaineer  i fear the season is now approaching when our friendly association must lose some of its agreeable ornaments i feel for the mortification a sensible mind must suffer at being obliged to quit the society of a favorite few to mix with the unthinking many but hope that the kind genius of friendship will interpose a gleam of pleasure at the prospect of a future meeting  my love to all you know is a constant commission and i am sure you will never forget to discharge it how is that best of good beings our president our patroness our life our spirit our all is she not the worthiest of heavens worthies was there ever acquaintance who did not esteem her friend who did not love her domestic who did not bless her or indigent who came to her door that did not pray for her long may she remain with us and whenever it pleases providence to remove her from earth may she receive blessings in a future state in as ample portions as she through life has ever wished and endeavored to dispense them to her fellow creatures  s n   letter lxx miss n  to mr hull kimboltoncastle nov    did you ever expect to hear of or from me again ever since i received your last i have lived the ife of a whirlagig but be assured that i had not a moment to tell you so the dear spot i left was always in my thoughts and indeed as yet my poor brain is far from being in a composed state a scribbling moment too is the only good thing that is scarce here a few days after i received yours we left the calm sweets of dunkeld and went to pay a second visit at lord breadalbanes where all was mirth music masquerades etc etc from thence we set forth on our return toward a southern sun and gentler breezes and stopped for a few days at the elegant and superb seat of lord bingley near york there we found a brilliant assembly of ladies and gentlemen who had met to dine and play cards however most of them went away in the evening and we remained a decent party for the rest of the time from thence we bent our course to this magnificent castle hoping wishing and expecting to find a quiet peaceable family till christmas when we knew a delicious riot was always intended but lo and behold here we found his highness of york lord and lady charles spencer lady chatherine and mr beauclerk lord and lady ludlow and a world more of fine folks the very first night we were forced to join in a ball and every day whilst his highness stayed we had music in the mornings and cards or dancing at night i believe every creature was fatigued with pleasures and i can answer for one who was glad when it was over the duke of york was so pleased with his entertainment that it is not impossible but he may return at christmas we are now a sober decent party of ten or twelve and like rational beings read and work in the evenings and to show you that all this dissipation does not totally banish serious thoughts we have prayers constantly every morning in a beautiful chapel in the castle i take it for granted that you know all this time that the owner of this palace is the duke of manchester who is a very amiable young nobleman his brother lord charles montagu is no less so the duchess is beautiful polite and a very good young woman but the character that i could dwell upon with delight for ages is lady caroline montagu the dukes sister if ever perfect goodness chose to dwell with mere mortality one may imagine it inhabits her breast and i flatter myself that you will not conceive the worse idea of her ladyship when i tell you that she honors me with a very particular friendship unworthy as i am of such a valuable distinction dont think i flatter for i am perfectly sincere when i assure you that i often think amidst this perpetual round of gay amusements with infinite regret of the dear social party wherewith i have spent some of the happiest and most rational moments of my life i gave such a picture of it to a young man of great quality and good sense a little while ago that he made me pass my word if ever we met at  to introduce him to the lady patroness of the agreeable society i beg my best affections to all the dear associates i rejoice without the least mixture of envy at my worthy namesakes happy prospects and sincerely wish she may enjoy every felicity the holy estate can possibly produce i hope i need not say that a letter from you always gives me pleasure you will i am sure indulge me between this and christmas pray tell me in your next if mr quin is not alive besides the concern i should feel for his death i am engaged in a wager about it  i am become such a wandering vagabond over the face of the earth that i should not be a bit surprised to find myself conveyed suddenly to the utmost extent of the habitable globe i fear i shall be less fortunate than noahs dove she at last found rest for the sole of her foot but i doubt i shall not till my soul has taken its flight to some more happy region i assure you i meant no pun but i see one has fallen from my pen of its own accord i heard from our friends in  since i got here and have the satisfaction to find they are all well  i would attempt to give you some idea of this place but there is a magnificence and extensiveness in it that goes far beyond the capacity of my pen the castle is a very large and regular building the connoisseurs say the architecture is very just it is expensively furnished though not in the modern taste there are many good paintings that this duke bought in italy the parks lawns etc etc are judiciously planted and laid out in a good taste i find the present possessor has made many improvements and is making still more the plate and apparatus for the table is more superb than any thing of the kind that i have ever seen and the table is always elegantly covered but i must confess this is the kind of luxury that pleases me the least and i often think how much more healthy and consequently happier our forefathers were than their degenerate progeny who live upon ragouts fricasses and highseasoned meats  adieu if you are tired with my moralizing you will not be sorry that both my time and paper obliges me to assure you that i am with the sincerest truth your ever obliged  s n   letter lxxi this and the following are evidently written on a second trip to venice miss n  to mr hull paris july    dear sir i now write to you from this metropolis of dirt and gentility which owing to the narrowness of the streets and height of the houses puts me more in mind of the capital of north than of south britain but then the grands hotels are more noble and in greater abundance than our noblemens houses and the environs of paris are in my opinion finer than those of london which place we left on thursday the   th of this month and arrived here on tuesday the   d without meeting any disagreeable accident during the journey we have got a very elegant apartment in one of the best parts of paris and you may be sure have lost no time since our arrival in seeing every thing that is worthy a strangers curiosity the thuilleries of which french novellists make such frequent mention is a pleasant place for the people of fashion to take the air in the louvre which in outward show far exceeds any palace we have runs along one end of it and on the opposite side a fine square is building called the place de louis quinze there are noble shady walks and a charming terrass that commands a fine view of paris but the old taste in which the center of the garden is laid out is frightful and exactly resembles the ornaments of a mincedpye there is another fashionable rendezvous for the evening airings about a mile out of paris that i confess pleases me still more called the bois de bullogne where instead of a sharp gravel and crowded walks like our park you may wander about at full liberty and tread upon a verdant carpet all the time which to tenderfooted folks makes a great difference we have seen several private collections of paintings and other curiosities that do great honor to the taste and judgment of the possessors but nothing charms me so much as a noble collection of pictures at the palais royale which belongs to the duke of orleans first prince of the blood and were chiefly purchased by the famous regent the grand opera here is the finest thing to see one can possibly imagine the scenes are splendid the dresses rich and elegant the dances composed with infinite taste and finely executed and the stage much better filled than ours but the music is truly detestable it is all french and from the beginning to the end like a solemn dirge as for the voices if you will imagine a concert composed of cats owls and monkeys it will give you a tolerable idea of the harmony and whoever assassinates your ears with the greatest violence is most applauded the french comic opera is as agreeable as the serious one is the reverse the songs are all sprightly italian airs the scenery and dresses as at the other excel ours and to my fancy this is the most agreeable amusement paris affords their manner of acting plays i own does not charm me after being used to the genteel familiar dialogue of our english comedies and even in tragedy i think they have too much energy both of voice and action i should not thus familiarly play the critic were i not perfectly well acquainted with your candor and goodnature for after all i am talking of what i dont understand and am as likely to be wrong as right so much by way of digression a liberty all modern novellists allow themselves and now my narrative proceeds to the chapter of fashions for the sake of the female members of your party the ladies in general would i believe be handsome but for two shocking dabs of crimson or scarlet which some prefer in a circular form directly under each eye which makes them look just like so many furies the hair dressed out of all proportion for often the height of the hair is more a great deal than the length of the whole face even i who am quite moderate am at least three inches of toupee taller than i was when i left england the hoops are very small the ruffles very moderate and the necks more covered than in england the gowns are made very high behind and pin pretty close before and almost as wide at bottom as at top the pleats of the sacks behind are made narrower than ours the married ladies indeed we never see any other in public all wear very small caps the court being in mourning prevents our seeing any other finery than diamonds in which the ladies seem to abound in general more than in england not a head of any sort have i yet seen that is not absolutely plaistered with pomatum and powder those of the poor as well as the rich i wonder the consumption of flower in this metropolis of welldressed dirty people does not breed a famine the streets are always so crowded with them that you would swear paris was the most populous place and the parisians the most idle set of people in the whole world a fashionable custom here is when the comedy is finished to drive to what is called the grande boule vert one side of which is shaded with trees and the other filled with large coffeehouses finely illuminated where you see all manner of sport going forward as eating dancing music puppetshows conjurers fireworks fireeaters giants lilliputians etc etc in short you may be amused in about the length of the mall from eight in the evening till three in the morning but the genteel way is only to drive up and down the walk without getting out of your carriage i am afraid that my description of paris and its amusements will tire both your eyes and your patience at least it has done so by me and i have scribbled in such a hurry that it is not fit to send but i flatter myself you would rather have a letter ill written than none i am mortified though that it will cost you a great deal more postage than it is worth and by the time it reaches you we shall probably be pursuing our journey so that i cannot hope to hear a word of or from our dear society till i get to venice in the mean time i beg to be remembered in the kindest manner to every member and that you will believe me to be as i ever am with truth and sincerity yours and the societys truly affectionate and obliged  s n  i hope you are able to enjoy this charming weather for i hope it is such with you as well as with us by taking many agreeable walks in your delightful meads i assure you the seine is nothing comparable to the avon and the pont neuf so much extolled by fame and frenchmen is a paltry affair in comparison of westminsterbridge now i must have done and i am sure you will be glad of it  i was so charmed and so moved last night at the tragedy of zayre that i am almost tempted to recant what i have said against the french tragedians but i still feel a partiality for our own actors i will not be so unreasonable to teize you any longer with my scrawl once more adieu    letter lxxii miss n  to mr hull venice oct         my dear friend the greatest pleasure i can feel during my exile is to hear good accounts frequently of those friends in england that are most dear to me i hope you will answer this very soon and be so good as to direct your letter to me as usual under cover to mr  who has the care of sending our letters to the secretary of states office by which means i receive my letters much safer than when they are not put in the packet it is not yet quite three months since i left england and i declare it appears to me three years already we were so fortunate as to perform our journey without one unlucky accident on the twentieth of july of all days in the year we began our peregrinations and arrived here on the twentieth of august after stopping about five days on the road to see different places that were worthy of observation we made no small figure i assure you at setting out our train consisting of two postcoaches and two postchaises to our no small amusement we were mistaken for foreigners all the way to dover which i suppose was owing to our wearing large french caps without hats and our gentlemen being dressed in loose french coats which are the most convenient kind of dress for traveling we were not quite three hours crossing the water the quickness of the passage scarcely made up for the roughness of it which was really frightful even to me who am no despicable sailor for a female in short i was the only person well enough to nurse which was very necessary for the other females in our party at calais we found two excellent berlins waiting to conduct us to strasbourg in which we proceeded with our two english chaises our route was quite different from that by which we once went from strasbourg to paris to my no small joy for i think a twicegone road almost as bad as a twicetold tale i had an opportunity by this means of seeing beauties in champaigne which till then i had no idea of for many miles the road formed an actual terrass bounded on one side by little hills interspersed with vineyards and corn fields and on the other side the eye is led by a gentle descent down to the most fertile vales the verdure of which could scarcely be conceived from the painting of pastoral poetry through these for an immense way meanders a most beautiful serpentine river whose banks are adorned with innumerable droves of cattle of every sort which puts one in mind of the peaceful reign of the patriarchs since being undivided they appear to be the property of one master you will scarcely think my good friend that these smiling scenes could raise melancholy ideas and yet they had that effect upon my mind in almost every village we passed through which had looked beautiful at a distance we found all the appearance of wretchedness and want that you see in the most dreary parts of savoy for what the extravagance and luxury of the prince of conde part of whose immense territory this is leaves to the peasants is wrecked from them by the lazy priests who like locusts seem to be sent only to eat up the riches of the land here you see no hospitable gentlemans seat no warm neat cottages those are comforts reserved only for the english who would perhaps be more grateful for the blessings they enjoy if they possessed fewer of them but to return to our journey the fine season of the year good roads and every where tolerable accommodations carried us in twelve days to strasbourg where we stopped for three days and where you may if you please suppose we shall remain till you hear from me next as i shall defer the rest of my account of our journey for a future letter  the masking is just begun and two comic operas and two play houses opened i have been once at the opera and caught such a cold partly i suppose a tribute to the season of the year and partly to change of climate that for fear of the like accident i shall frequent theaters very little unless i am tempted by a party  i fear my dear friends your patience will be quite tired out before you get to the conclusion of this very long letter but as i can only send a single letter i could not resist taking the largest paper and i cannot bear to send it you blank  i am just in the disagreeable situation i was this time two years when i was so happy to be with you almost all my worldly goods being at the mercy of the waves and the ship ought to have been here at least a month ago adieu my dearest friends may you enjoy every earthly good and may we be mutually happy in a joyful meeting is the earnest wish and prayer of  your sincerely affectionate s n   letter lxxiii miss n  to mr hull venice jan         i received with infinite pleasure my dear friends your very kind letter the good account you give of yourselves is really and truly a happiness to me and you have my sincere prayers and good wishes that your health and spirits may daily improve i make no doubt but your tour was a delightful one there is about you our sweet patroness a certain cheerfulness and good humor that proceeds immediately from the heart that not only illuminates her own disposition but inspires those about her with the most pleasing sensations the human mind is capable of feeling i beg of you to present my best affections to the doctor and mrs w  and assure them that i take the sincerest part in their affliction my good papas filial piety always appeared to me a shining part of his character  my love and sincere good wishes attend every member of the dear society would to god i could say i had any prospect of being soon reunited to that best of all possible societies but alas that is not to be hoped for what must be must be and i make no doubt it is right  now my dear friend i must beg of you to take a step back with me to strasbourg for there i think we parted last from thence we steered our course to ball or bazill as it is called in the maps in switzerland this change in our route delighted me we were induced to make this little round to avoid a great part of swabia where we heard the roads were almost impassable the water unwholesome a great scarcity of provisions and the measles raging every where ball is extremely well worth the observation of travelers the situation is on a very noble part of the rhine which runs through the town it also merits the attention of the lovers of virtu as the best relict of the famous holbens known by the name of deaths dance is preserved in the public library from ball we proceeded to schafhausen another of the protestant swiss cantons about three miles hence is the cataract of the rhine an object which i contemplated with a mixture of horror and pleasure easier to be felt than described which i beg you will tell my papa conveyed to me a clearer idea of the sublime and beautiful than i could ever gather even from mr burke we next traveled a very pleasant road and caught many fine views of the famous lake de constance but upon the whole though i like swisserland well enough enpassant there is an unpolished melancholy air even in the greatest towns that is disgusting when we got into the tyrrol every thing lost the charm of novelty to me and i had only the mortifying reflection to make that when i last passed those rugged paths i was going toward england and now alas was going from it as we met with no adventures new or surprising i will trouble you with no further particulars of our journey save that we arrived at venice the twentieth of august after being exactly a month on the road without meeting with one overturn broken axeltree or other sinister accident whatever  and now let me say a few words for myself independent of company since the twenty sixth of december every creature here that has spirits enough to be so has appeared quite mad indeed venice in carnivaltime especially is only fit for those who can place their happiness in vice folly and dissipation indeed i am not only a professed but a sincere enemy to these three you will believe me when i tell you that i am horridly out of my element here and i feel the greatest conviction that i shall never taste a hearty satisfaction till i again enjoy our rational dear friendly society but i fear the time is very far distant when i shall be allowed to partake of such enviable amusements you know i mean in this declaration only to refer to the customs of the place not to the party wherewith i came which is indisputably as rational and amiable as can be enjoyed uninterrupted with hurry of place and ceremonial visitors i believe you have often heard me mention a mrs s  a very particular friend of mine who has been settled here many years and now having lost a husband in his ninetyninth or hundredth year she is preparing to return to england we have talked so much and so often of you all that she is persuaded she is acquainted with you and begs me to give her compliments to you and i verily believe she will be tempted when she arrives to make you a friendly visit  i am ashamed to send you such a horrid scrawl but i have wrote it by snatches with most vile implements the date will faithfully show you it was begun on the twentysixth of january and now i am concluding it on the ninth of february so that you may be assured though i seem dilatory in writing i by no means intend to be so i was in hopes to have popped this into a dispatch but alas they are grown scarce commodities at our house  we have no less than three operas and four play houses open and would you believe it i am grown so old or so stupid that i prefer a book or a pen by the fireside to any of them i am much abused for this want of taste but so hardened a sinner am i that it grows every day stronger on me adieu my dear good
