the french text presented in this volume is taken from that of a leyden edition of      in other words from that of an edition published in the year and in the place of issue of the first edition the title page of this edition is reproduced in the present volume the original was evidently the work of a dutch compositor unschooled in the french language and is full of imperfections inconsistencies and grammatical blunders by the direction of the publishers these obviously typographical blunders have been corrected by m lucien arréat of paris the translation is the work of several hands it is founded on a version made by miss gertrude c bussey from the french text in the edition of j assezat and has been revised by professor m w calkins who is responsible for it in its present form mademoiselle m carret of the wellesley college department of french and professor george santayana of harvard university have given valued assistance and this opportunity is taken to acknowledge their kindness in solving the problems of interpretation which have been submitted to them it should be added that the translation sometimes subordinates the claims of english structure and style in the effort to render la mettries meaning exactly the paragraphing of the french is usually followed but the italics and the capitals are not reproduced the pageheadings of the translation refer back to the pages of the french text and a few words inserted by the translators are enclosed in brackets the philosophical and historical notes are condensed and adapted from a masters thesis on la mettrie presented by miss bussey to the faculty of wellesley college   contents frederic the greats eulogy on julien offray de la mettrie   julien offray de la mettrie was born in saint malo on the twentyfifth of december   0  to julien offray de la mettrie and marie gaudron who were living by a trade large enough to provide a good education for their son they sent him to the college of coutance to study the humanities he went from there to paris to the college of plessis he studied his rhetoric at caen and since he had much genius and imagination he won all the prizes for eloquence he was a born orator and was passionately fond of poetry and belleslettres but his father thought that he would earn more as an ecclesiastic than as a poet and destined him for the church he sent him the following year to the college of plessis where he studied logic under m cordier who was more a jansenist than a logician it is characteristic of an ardent imagination to seize forcefully the objects presented to it as it is characteristic of youth to be prejudiced in favor of the first opinions that are inculcated any other scholar would have adopted the opinions of his teacher but that was not enough for young la mettrie he became a jansenist and wrote a work which had great vogue in that party   in      he studied natural philosophy at the college of harcourt and made great progress there on his return to brittany m hunault a doctor of saint malo had advised him to adopt the medical profession they had persuaded his father assuring him that a mediocre physician would be better paid for his remedies than a good priest for absolutions at first young la mettrie had applied himself to the study of anatomy for two years he had worked at the dissectingtable after this in      he took the degree of doctor at rheims and was there received as a physician in      he went to leyden to study under the famous boerhaave the master was worthy of the scholar and the scholar soon made himself worthy of the master m la mettrie devoted all the acuteness of his mind to the knowledge and to the healing of human infirmities and he soon became a great physician in the year      during his leisure moments he translated a treatise of the late m boerhaave his aphrodisiacus and joined to it a dissertation on venereal maladies of which he himself was the author the old physicians in france rose up against a scholar who affronted them by knowing as much as they one of the most celebrated doctors of paris did him the honor of criticizing his work a sure proof that it was good la mettrie replied and to confound his adversary still more he composed in      a treatise on vertigo esteemed by all impartial physicians by an unfortunate effect of human imperfection a certain base jealousy has come to be one of the characteristics of men of letters this feeling incites    those who have reputations to oppose the progress of budding geniuses this blight often fastens on talents without destroying them but it sometimes injures them m la mettrie who was advancing in the career of science at a giants pace suffered from this jealousy and his quick temper made him too susceptible to it in saint malo he translated the aphorisms of boerhaave the materia medica the chemical proceedings the chemical theory and the institutions by this same author about the same time he published an abstract of sydenham the young doctor had learned by premature experience that if he wished to live in peace it was better to translate than to compose but it is characteristic of genius to escape from reflection counting on himself alone if i may speak thus and filled with the knowledge he had gained from his infinitely skilful researches into nature he wished to communicate to the public the useful discoveries he had made he published his treatise on smallpox his practical medicine and six volumes of commentary on the physiology of boerhaave all these works appeared at paris although the author had written them at saint malo he joined to the theory of his art an always successful practice which is no small recommendation for a physician in      la mettrie came to paris led there by the death of m hunault his old teacher morand and sidobre introduced him to the duke of gramont who a few days after obtained for him the commission of physician of the guards he accompanied the duke to war and was with him at the battle of dettingen at the siege of freiburg and at    the battle of fontenoy where he lost his patron who was killed by a cannon shot la mettrie felt this loss all the more keenly because it was at the same time the reef on which his fortune was wrecked this is what happened during the campaign of freiburg la mettrie had an attack of violent fever for a philosopher an illness is a school of physiology he believed that he could clearly see that thought is but a consequence of the organization of the machine and that the disturbance of the springs has considerable influence on that part of us which the metaphysicians call soul filled with these ideas during his convalescence he boldly bore the torch of experience into the night of metaphysics he tried to explain by the aid of anatomy the thin texture of understanding and he found only mechanism where others had supposed an essence superior to matter he had his philosophic conjectures printed under the title of the natural history of the soul the chaplain of the regiment sounded the tocsin against him and at first sight all the devotees cried out against him the common ecclesiastic is like don quixote who found marvelous adventures in commonplace events or like the famous soldier so engrossed with his system that he found columns in all the books he read the majority of priests examine all works of literature as if they were treatises on theology and filled with this one aim they discover heresies everywhere to this fact are due very many false judgments and very many accusations for the most part unfair against the authors a book of physics should be read in the spirit of a    physicist nature the truth is its sole judge and should absolve or condemn it a book of astronomy should be read in the same manner if a poor physician proves that the blow of a stick smartly rapped on the skull disturbs the mind or that at a certain degree of heat reason wanders one must either prove the contrary or keep quiet if a skilful astronomer proves in spite of joshua that the earth and all the celestial globes revolve around the sun one must either calculate better than he or admit that the earth revolves but the theologians who by their continual apprehension might make the weak believe that their cause is bad are not troubled by such a small matter they insisted on finding seeds of heresy in a work dealing with physics the author underwent a frightful persecution and the priests claimed that a doctor accused of heresy could not cure the french guards to the hatred of the devotees was joined that of his rivals for glory this was rekindled by a work of la mettries entitled the politics of physicians a man full of cunning and carried away by ambition aspired to the place then vacant of first physician to the king of france he thought that he could gain it by heaping ridicule upon those of his contemporaries who might lay claim to this position he wrote a libel against them and abusing the easy friendship of la mettrie he enticed him to lend to it the volubility of his pen and the richness of his imagination nothing more was needed to complete the downfall of a man little known against whom were all appearances and whose only protection was his merit for having been too sincere as a philosopher and    too obliging as a friend la mettrie was compelled to leave his country the duke of duras and the viscount of chaila advised him to flee from the hatred of the priests and the revenge of the physicians therefore in      he left the hospitals of the army where he had been placed by m sechelles and came to leyden to philosophize in peace he there composed his penelope a polemical work against the physicians in which after the fashion of democritus he made fun of the vanity of his profession the curious result was that the doctors themselves though their quackery was painted in true colors could not help laughing when they read it and that is a sure sign that they had found more wit than malice in it m la mettrie after losing sight of his hospitals and his patients gave himself up completely to speculative philosophy he wrote his man a machine or rather he put on paper some vigorous thoughts about materialism which he doubtless planned to rewrite this work which was bound to displease men who by their position are declared enemies of the progress of human reason roused all the priests of leyden against its author calvinists catholics and lutherans forgot for the time that consubstantiation free will mass for the dead and the infallibility of the pope divided them they all united again to persecute a philosopher who had the additional misfortune of being french at a time when that monarchy was waging a successful war against their high powers the title of philosopher and the reputation of being unfortunate were enough to procure for la mettrie a refuge in prussia with a pension from    the king he came to berlin in the month of february in the year      he was there received as a member of the royal academy of science medicine reclaimed him from metaphysics and he wrote a treatise on dysentery another on asthma the best that had then been written on these cruel diseases he sketched works on certain philosophical subjects which he had proposed to look into by a sequence of accidents which befell him these works were stolen but he demanded their suppression as soon as they appeared la mettrie died in the house of milord tirconnel minister plenipotentiary of france whose life he had saved it seems that the disease knowing with whom it had to deal was clever enough to attack his brain first so that it would more surely confound him he had a burning fever and was violently delirious the invalid was obliged to depend upon the science of his colleagues and he did not find there the resources which he had so often found in his own both for himself and for the public he died on the eleventh of november      at the age of fortythree years he had married louise charlotte dréano by whom he left only a daughter five years and a few months old la mettrie was born with a fund of natural and inexhaustible gaiety he had a quick mind and such a fertile imagination that it made flowers grow in the field of medicine nature had made him an orator and a philosopher but a yet more precious gift which he received from her was a pure soul and an obliging heart all those who are not imposed upon by the pious insults of the theologians mourn in la mettrie a good man and a wise physician

nature et la vérité il doit oser la dire en faveur du petit nombre de ceux qui veulent et peuvent penser car pour les autres qui sont volontairement esclaves des préjugés il ne leur est pas plus possible datteindre la vérité quaux grenouilles de voler it is not enough for a wise man to study nature and truth he should dare state truth for the benefit of the few who are willing and able to think as for the rest who are voluntarily slaves of prejudice they can no more attain truth than frogs can fly je réduis à deux les systèmes des philosophes sur lâme de lhomme le premier et le plus ancien est le système du matérialisme le second est celui du spiritualisme i reduce to two the systems of philosophy which deal with mans soul the first and older system is materialism the second is spiritualism les métaphysiciens qui ont insinué que la matière pourrait bien avoir la faculté de penser nont pas déshonoré leur raison pourquoi cest quils ont cet avantage car ici cen est un de sêtre mal exprimés en effet demander si la matière peut penser sans la considérer autrement quen ellemême cest demander si la matière peut marquer les heures on voit davance que nous éviterons cet écueil où mr locke a eu le malheur déchouer the metaphysicians who have hinted that matter may well be endowed with the faculty of thought  have perhaps not reasoned ill for there is in this case a certain advantage in their inadequate way of expressing their meaning in truth to ask whether matter can think without considering it otherwise than in itself is like asking whether matter can tell time it may be foreseen that we shall avoid this reef upon which locke had the bad luck to make shipwreck les leibniziens avec leurs monades ont élevé une hypothèse inintelligible ils ont plutôt spiritualisé la matière que matérialisé lâme comment peuton définir un être dont la nature nous est absolument inconnue the leibnizians with their monads have set up an unintelligible hypothesis they have rather spiritualized matter than materialized the soul how can we define a being whose nature is absolutely unknown to us  descartes et tous les cartésiens parmi lesquels il y a longtemps quon a compté les malebranchistes     ont fait la même faute ils ont admis deux substances distinctes dans lhomme comme sils les avaient vues et bien comptées descartes and all the cartesians among whom the followers of malebranche have long been numbered     have made the same mistake they have taken for granted two distinct substances in man as if they had seen them and positively counted them les plus sages ont dit que lâme ne pouvait se connaître que par les seules lumières de la foi cependant en qualité dêtres raisonnables ils ont cru pouvoir se réserver le droit dexaminer ce que lecriture a voulu dire par le mot esprit dont elle se sert en parlant de lâme humaine et dans leurs recherches sils ne sont pas daccord sur ce point avec les théologiens ceuxci le sontils davantage entreux sur tous les autres the wisest men have declared that the soul can not know itself save by the light of faith however as reasonable beings they have thought that they could reserve for themselves the right of examining what the bible means by the word spirit which it uses in speaking of the human soul and if in their investigation they do not agree with the theologians on this point are the theologians more in agreement among themselves on all other points voici en peu de mots le résultat de toutes leurs réflexions sil y a un dieu il est auteur de la nature comme de la révélation il nous a donné lune pour expliquer lautre et la raison pour les accorder ensemble se défier des connaissances quon peut puiser dans les corps animés cest regarder la nature et la révélation comme deux contraires qui se détruisent et par conséquent cest oser soutenir cette absurdité que dieu se contredit dans ses divers ouvrages et nous trompe here is the result in a few words of all their reflections if there is a god he is the author of nature as well as of revelation he has given us the one to explain the other and reason to make them agree to distrust the knowledge that can be drawn from the study of animated bodies is to regard nature and revelation as two contraries which destroy each the other and consequently to dare uphold the absurd doctrine that god contradicts himself in his various works and deceives us sil y a une révélation elle ne peut donc démentir la nature par la nature seule on peut découvrir le sens des paroles de levangile dont lexpérience seule est la véritable interprète en effet les autres commentateurs jusquici nont fait quembrouiller la vérité nous allons en juger par lauteur du spectacle de la nature il est étonnant ditil au sujet de mr locke quun homme qui dégrade notre âme jusquà la croire une âme de boue ose établir la raison pour juge et souverain arbitre     des mystères de la foi car ajoutetil quelle idée étonnante auraiton du christianisme si lon voulait suivre la raison if there is a revelation it can not then contradict nature by nature only can we understand the meaning of the words of the gospel of which experience is the only true interpreter in fact the commentators before our time have only obscured the truth we can judge of this by the author of the spectacle of nature  it is astonishing he says concerning locke that a man who degrades our soul far enough to consider it a soul of clay should dare set up reason as judge and sovereign     arbiter of the mysteries of faith for he adds what an astonishing idea of christianity one would have if one were to follow reason outre que ces réflexions néclaircissent rien par rapport à la foi elles forment de si frivoles objections contre la méthode de ceux qui croient pouvoir interpréter les livres saints que jai presque honte de perdre le temps à les réfuter not only do these reflections fail to elucidate faith but they also constitute such frivolous objections to the method of those who undertake to interpret the scripture that i am almost ashamed to waste time in refuting them  º lexcellence de la raison ne dépend pas dun grand mot vide de sens limmatérialité mais de sa force de son étendue ou de sa clairvoyance ainsi une âme de boue qui découvrirait comme dun coup dœil les rapports et les suites dune infinité didées difficiles à saisir serait évidemment préférable à une âme sotte et stupide qui serait faite des éléments les plus précieux ce nest pas être philosophe que de rougir avec pline de la misère de notre origine ce qui parait vil est ici la chose la plus précieuse et pour laquelle la nature semble avoir mis le plus dart et le plus dappareil mais comme lhomme quand même il viendrait dune source encore plus vile en apparence nen serait pas moins le plus parfait de tous les êtres quelle que soit lorigine de son âme si elle est pure noble sublime cest une belle âme qui rend respectable quiconque en est doué the excellence of reason does not depend on a big word devoid of meaning immateriality but on the force extent and perspicuity of reason itself thus a soul of clay which should discover at one glance as it were the relations and the consequences of an infinite number of ideas hard to understand would evidently be preferable to a foolish and stupid soul though that were composed of the most precious elements a man is not a philosopher because with pliny he blushes over the wretchedness of our origin what seems vile is here the most precious of things and seems to be the object of natures highest art and most elaborate care but as man even though he should come from an apparently still more lowly source would yet be the most perfect of all beings so whatever the origin of his soul if it is pure noble and lofty it is a beautiful soul which dignifies the man endowed with it la seconde manière de raisonner de mr pluche me parait vicieuse même dans son système qui tient un peu du fanatisme car si nous avons une idée de la foi qui soit contraire aux principes les plus clairs aux vérités les plus incontestables il faut croire pour lhonneur de la révélation et de son auteur que cette idée est fausse et que nous ne     connaissons point encore les sens des paroles de levangile pluches second way of reasoning seems vicious to me even in his system which smacks a little of fanaticism for on his view if we have an idea of faith as being contrary to the clearest principles to the most incontestable truths we must yet conclude out of respect for revelation and its author     that this conception is false and that we do not yet understand the meaning of the words of the gospel de deux choses lune ou tout est illusion tant la nature même que la révélation ou lexpérience seule peut rendre raison de la foi mais quel plus grand ridicule que celui de notre auteur je mimagine entendre un péripatéticien qui dirait il ne faut pas croire lexpérience de toricelli car si nous la croyions si nous allions bannir lhorreur du vide quelle étonnante philosophie aurionsnous of the two alternatives only one is possible either everything is illusion nature as well as revelation or experience alone can explain faith but what can be more ridiculous than the position of our author can one imagine hearing a peripatetic say we ought not to accept the experiments of torricelli  for if we should accept them if we should rid ourselves of the horror of the void what an astonishing philosophy we should have jai fait voir combien le raisonnement de mr pluche est vicieux  afin de prouver premièrement que sil y a une révélation elle nest point suffisamment démontrée par la seule autorité de leglise et sans aucun examen de la raison comme le prétendent tous ceux qui la craignent secondement pour mettre à labri de toute attaque la méthode de ceux qui voudraient suivre la voie que je leur ouvre dinterpréter les choses surnaturelles incompréhensibles en soi par les lumières que chacun a reçues de la nature lexpérience et lobservation doivent donc seules nous guider ici elles se trouvent sans nombre dans les fastes des médecins qui ont été philosophes et non dans les philosophes qui nont pas été médecins ceuxci ont parcouru ont éclairé le labyrinthe de lhomme ils nous ont seuls dévoilé ces ressorts cachés sous des enveloppes qui dérobent à nos yeux tant de merveilles eux seuls contemplant tranquillement notre âme lont mille fois surprise et dans sa misère et dans sa grandeur sans plus la mépriser dans lun de ces états que ladmirer dans lautre encore une fois voilà les seuls physiciens     qui aient droit de parler ici que nous diraient les autres et surtout les théologiens nestil pas ridicule de les entendre décider sans pudeur sur un sujet quils nont point été à portée de connaître dont ils ont été au contraire entièrement détournés par des études obscures qui les ont conduits à mille préjugés et pour tout dire en un mot au fanatisme qui ajoute encore à leur ignorance dans le mécanisme des corps i have shown how vicious the reasoning of pluche is  in order to prove in the first place that if there is a revelation it is not sufficiently demonstrated by the mere authority of the church and without any appeal to reason as all those who fear reason claim and in the second place to protect against all assault the method of those who would wish to follow the path that i open to them of interpreting supernatural things incomprehensible in themselves in the light of those ideas with which nature has endowed us experience and observation should therefore be our only guides here both are to be found throughout the records of the physicians who were philosophers and not in the works of the philosophers who were not physicians the former have traveled through and illuminated the labyrinth of man they alone have laid bare to us those springs of life hidden under the external integument which conceals so many wonders from our eyes they alone tranquilly contemplating our soul have surprised it a thousand times both in its wretchedness and in its glory and they have no more despised     it in the first estate than they have admired it in the second thus to repeat only the physicians have a right to speak on this subject  what could the others especially the theologians have to say is it not ridiculous to hear them shamelessly coming to conclusions about a subject concerning which they have had no means of knowing anything and from which on the contrary they have been completely turned aside by obscure studies that have led them to a thousand prejudiced opinions—in a word to fanaticism which adds yet more to their ignorance of the mechanism of the body mais quoique nous ayons choisi les meilleurs guides nous trouverons encore beaucoup dépines et dobstacles dans cette carrière but even though we have chosen the best guides we shall still find many thorns and stumbling blocks in the way lhomme est une machine si composée quil est impossible de sen faire dabord une idée claire et conséquemment de la définir cest pourquoi toutes les recherches que les plus grands philosophes ont faites à priori cest à dire en voulant se servir en quelque sorte des ailes de lesprit ont été vaines ainsi ce nest quà posteriori ou en cherchant à demêler lâme comme au travers les organes du corps quon peut je ne dis pas découvrir avec évidence la nature même de lhomme mais atteindre le plus grand degré de probabilité possible sur ce sujet man is so complicated a machine  that it is impossible to get a clear idea of the machine beforehand and hence impossible to define it for this reason all the investigations have been vain which the greatest philosophers have made à priori that is to say in so far as they use as it were the wings of the spirit thus it is only à posteriori or by trying to disentangle the soul from the organs of the body so to speak that one can reach the highest probability concerning mans own nature even though one can not discover with certainty what his nature is prenons donc le bâton de lexpérience et laissons là lhistoire de toutes les vaines opinions des philosophes etre aveugle et croire pouvoir se passer de ce bâton cest le comble de laveuglement quun moderne a bien raison de dire quil ny a que la vanité seule qui ne tire pas des causes secondes le même parti que des premières on peut et on doit même admirer tous ces beaux génies dans leurs travaux les plus inutiles les descartes les malebranche les leibnitz les wolf etc mais quel fruit     je vous prie aton retiré de leurs profondes méditations et de tous leurs ouvrages commençons donc et voyons non ce quon a pensé mais ce quil faut penser pour le repos de la vie let us then take in our hands the staff of experience  paying no heed to the accounts of all the idle theories of philosophers to be blind and to think that one can do without this staff is the worst kind of blindness how truly a contemporary writer says that only vanity fails to gather from secondary causes the same lessons as from primary   0 causes one can and one even ought to admire all these fine geniuses in their most useless works such men as descartes malebranche leibniz wolff and the rest but what profit i ask has any one gained from their profound meditations and from all their works let us start out then to discover not what has been thought but what must be thought for the sake of repose in life autant de tempéraments autant desprits de caractères et de mœurs différentes galien même a connu cette vérité que descartes et non hippocrate comme le dit lauteur de lhistoire de lame a poussée loin jusquà dire que la médecine seule pouvait changer les esprits et les mœurs avec le corps il est vrai la mélancolie la bile le phlegme le sang etc suivant la nature labondance et la diverse combinaison de ces humeurs de chaque homme font un homme différent there are as many different minds different characters and different customs as there are different temperaments even galen  knew this truth which descartes carried so far as to claim that medicine alone can change minds and morals along with bodies by the writer of lhistoire de lâme  this teaching is incorrectly attributed to hippocrates 0 it is true that melancholy bile phlegm blood etc—according to the nature the abundance and the different combination of these humors—make each man different from another   dans les maladies tantôt lâme séclipse et ne montre aucun signe dellemême tantôt on dirait quelle est double tant la fureur la transporte tantôt limbécilité se dissipe et la convalescence dun sot fait un homme desprit tantôt le plus beau génie devenu stupide ne se reconnait plus adieu toutes ces belles connaissances acquises à si grands frais et avec tant de peine ici cest un paralytique qui demande si sa jambe est dans son lit là cest un soldat qui croit avoir le bras quon lui a coupé la mémoire de ses anciennes sensations et du lieu où son âme les rapportait fait son illusion et son espèce de délire il suffit de lui parler de cette partie qui lui manque pour lui en rappeller et faire sentir tous les mouvements ce qui se fait avec je ne sais quel déplaisir dimagination quon ne peut exprimer celuici pleure comme un enfant aux approches de la mort que celuilà badine que fallaitil à caius julius à sénèque à pétrone pour changer     leur intrépidité en pusillanimité ou en poltronnerie une obstruction dans la rate dans le foie un embarras dans la veine porte pourquoi parceque limagination se bouche avec les viscères et de là naissent tous ces singuliers phénomènes de laffection hystérique et hypocondriaque in disease the soul is sometimes hidden showing no sign of life sometimes it is so inflamed by fury that it seems to be doubled sometimes imbecility vanishes and the convalescence of an idiot produces a wise man sometimes again the greatest genius becomes imbecile and loses the sense of self adieu then to all that fine knowledge acquired at so high a price and with so much trouble here is a paralytic who asks if his leg is in bed with him there is a soldier who thinks that he still has the arm which has been cut off the memory of his old sensations and of the place to which they were referred by his soul is the cause of his illusion and of this kind of delirium the mere mention of the member which he has lost is enough to recall it to his mind and     to make him feel all its motions and this causes him an indefinable and inexpressible kind of imaginary suffering this man cries like a child at deaths approach while this other jests what was needed to change the bravery of caius julius seneca or petronius into cowardice or faintheartedness merely an obstruction in the spleen in the liver an impediment in the portal vein why because the imagination is obstructed along with the viscera and this gives rise to all the singular phenomena of hysteria and hypochondria que diraisje de nouveau sur ceux qui simaginent être transformés en loupsgarous en coqs en vampires qui croient que les morts les sucent pourquoi marrêteraisje à ceux qui voient leur nez ou autres membres de verre et à qui il faut conseiller de coucher sur la paille de peur quils ne se cassent afin quils en retrouvent lusage et la véritable chair lorsque mettant le feu à la paille on leur fait craindre dêtre brûlés frayeur qui a quelquefois guéri la paralysie je dois légèrement passer sur des choses connues de tout le monde what can i add to the stories already told of those who imagine themselves transformed into wolfmen cocks or vampires or of those who think that the dead feed upon them why should i stop to speak of the man who imagines that his nose or some other member is of glass the way to help this man regain his faculties and his own fleshandblood nose is to advise him to sleep on hay lest he break the fragile organ and then to set fire to the hay that he may be afraid of being burned—a fear which has sometimes cured paralysis but i must touch lightly on facts which everybody knows je ne serai pas plus long sur le détail des effets du sommeil voyez ce soldat fatigué il ronfle dans la tranchée au bruit de cent pièces de canons son âme nentend rien son sommeil est une parfaite apoplexie une bombe va lécraser il sentira peutêtre moins ce coup quun insecte qui se trouve sous le pied neither shall i dwell long on the details of the effects of sleep here a tired soldier snores in a trench in the middle of the thunder of hundreds of cannon his soul hears nothing his sleep is as deep as apoplexy a bomb is on the point of crushing him he will feel this less perhaps than he feels an insect which is under his foot dun autre côté cet homme que la jalousie la haine lavarice ou lambition dévore ne peut trouver aucun repos le lieu le plus tranquille les boissons les plus fraîches et les plus calmantes tout est inutile à qui na pas délivré son cœur du tourment des passions on the other hand this man who is devoured by jealousy hatred avarice or ambition can never find any rest the most peaceful spot the freshest and most calming drinks are alike useless to one     who has not freed his heart from the torment of passion lâme et le corps sendorment ensemble a mesure que le mouvement du sang se calme un doux sentiment de paix et de tranquillité se répand dans toute la machine lâme se sent mollement   0 sappesantir avec les paupières et saffaisser avec les fibres du cerveau elle devient ainsi peu à peu comme paralytique avec tous les muscles du corps ceuxci ne peuvent plus porter le poids de la tête celle là ne peut plus soutenir le fardeau de la pensée elle est dans le sommeil comme nétant point the soul and the body fall asleep together as the motion of the blood is calmed a sweet feeling of peace and quiet spreads through the whole mechanism the soul feels itself little by little growing heavy as the eyelids droop and loses its tenseness as the fibres of the brain relax thus little by little it becomes as if paralyzed and with it all the muscles of the body these can no longer sustain the weight of the head and the soul can no longer bear the burden of thought it is in sleep as if it were not la circulation se faitelle avec trop de vitesse lâme ne peut dormir lâme estelle trop agitée le sang ne peut se calmer il galope dans les veines avec un bruit quon entend telles sont les deux causes réciproques de linsomnie une seule frayeur dans les songes fait battre le cœur à coups redoublés et nous arrache à la nécessité ou à la douceur du repos comme feraient une vive douleur ou des besoins urgents enfin comme la seule cessation des fonctions de lâme procure le sommeil il est même pendant la veille qui nest alors quune demiveille des sortes de petits sommeils dâme très fréquents des rêves à la suisse qui prouvent que lâme nattend pas toujours le corps pour dormir car si elle ne dort pas toutàfait combien peu sen fautil puisquil lui est impossible dassigner un seul objet auquel elle ait prêté quelque attention parmi cette foule innombrable didées confuses qui comme autant de nuages remplissent pour ainsi dire latmosphère de notre cerveau is the circulation too quick the soul can not sleep is the soul too much excited the blood can not be quieted it gallops through the veins with an audible murmur such are the two opposite causes of insomnia a single fright in the midst of our dreams makes the heart beat at double speed and snatches us from needed and delicious repose as a real grief or an urgent need would do lastly as the mere cessation of the functions of the soul produces sleep there are even when we are awake or at least when we are half awake kinds of very frequent short naps of the mind vergers dreams which show that the soul does not always wait for the body to sleep for if the soul is not fast asleep it surely is not far from sleep since it can not point out a single object to which it has attended among the uncounted number of confused ideas which so to speak fill the atmosphere of our brains like clouds lopium a trop de rapport avec le sommeil quil procure pour ne pas le placer ici ce remède enivre ainsi que le vin le café et chacun à sa manière et suivant sa dose il rend lhomme heureux dans un état qui semblerait devoir être le tombeau du sentiment comme il est limage de la mort quelle douce léthargie lâme nen voudrait jamais sortir elle était en proie aux plus grandes     douleurs elle ne sent plus que le seul plaisir de ne plus suffrir et de jouir de la plus charmante tranquillité lopium change jusquà la volonté il force lâme qui voulait veiller et se divertir daller se mettre au lit malgré elle je passe sous silence lhistoire des poisons opium is too closely related to the sleep it produces to be left out of consideration here this drug intoxicates like wine coffee etc each in     its own measure and according to the dose   it makes a man happy in a state which would seemingly be the tomb of feeling as it is the image of death how sweet is this lethargy the soul would long never to emerge from it for the soul has been a prey to the most intense sorrow but now feels only the joy of suffering past and of sweetest peace opium even alters the will forcing the soul which wished to wake and to enjoy life to sleep in spite of itself i shall omit any reference to the effect of poisons cest en fouettant limagination que le café cet antidote du vin dissipe nos maux de tête et nos chagrins sans nous en ménager comme cette liqueur pour le lendemain contemplons lâme dans ses autres besoins coffee the wellknown antidote for wine by scourging the imagination cures our headaches and scatters our cares without laying up for us as wine does other headaches for the morrow but let us contemplate the soul in its other needs le corps humain est une machine qui monte ellemême ses ressorts vivante image du mouvement perpétuel les aliments entretiennent ce que la fièvre excite sans eux lâme languit entre en fureur et meurt abattue cest une bougie dont la lumière se ranime au moment de séteindre mais nourrissez le corps versez dans ses tuyaux des sucs vigoureux des liqueurs fortes alors lâme généreuse comme elles sarme dun fier courage et le soldat que leau eut fait fuir devenu féroce court gaiement à la mort au bruit des tambours cest ainsi que leau chaude agite un sang que leau froide eut calmé the human body is a machine which winds its own springs it is the living image of perpetual movement nourishment keeps up the movements which fever excites without food the soul pines away goes mad and dies exhausted the soul is a taper whose light flares up the moment before it goes out but nourish the body pour into its veins lifegiving juices and strong liquors and then the soul grows strong like them as if arming itself with a proud courage and the soldier whom water would have made flee grows bold and runs joyously to death to the sound of drums thus a hot drink sets into stormy movement the blood which a cold drink would have calmed quelle puissance dun repas la joie renaît dans un cœur triste elle passe dans lâme des convives qui lexpriment par daimables chansons où les français excellent le mélancolique seul est accablé et lhomme détude ny est plus propre what power there is in a meal joy revives in a sad heart and infects the souls of comrades who express their delight in the friendly songs in which the frenchman excels the melancholy man alone     is dejected and the studious man is equally out of place in such company la viande crue rend les animaux féroces les hommes le deviendraient par la même nourriture cela est si vrai que la nation anglaise qui ne mange pas la chair si cuite que nous mais rouge et sanglante parait participer de cette férocité plus ou     moins grande qui vient en partie de tels aliments et dautres causes que léducation peut seule rendre impuissantes cette férocité produit dans lâme lorgueil la haine le mépris des autres nations lindocilité et autres sentiments qui dépravent le caractère comme des aliments grossiers font un esprit lourd épais dont la paresse et lindolence sont les attributs favoris raw meat makes animals fierce and it would have the same effect on man this is so true that the english who eat meat red and bloody and not as well done as ours seem to share more or less in the savagery due to this kind of food and to other causes which can be rendered ineffective by education only this savagery creates in the soul pride hatred scorn of other nations indocility and other sentiments which degrade the character just as heavy food makes a dull and heavy mind whose usual traits are laziness and indolence mr pope a bien connu tout lempire de la gourmandise lorsquil dit le grave catius parle toujours de vertu et croit que qui souffre les vicieux est vicieux luimême ces beaux sentiments durent jusquà lheure du diner alors il préfère un scélérat qui a une table délicate à un saint frugal pope understood well the full power of greediness when he said   catius is ever moral ever grave thinks who endures a knave is next a knave save just at dinner—then prefers no doubt a rogue with venson to a saint without considérez ditil ailleurs le même homme en santé ou en maladie possédant une belle charge ou layant perdue vous le verrez chérir la vie ou la détester fou à la chasse ivrogne dans une assemblée de province poli au bal bon ami en ville sans foi à la cour elsewhere he says see the same man in vigor in the gout alone in company in place or out early at business and at hazard late mad at a fox chase wise at a debate drunk at a borough civil at a ball friendly at hackney faithless at white hall nous avons eu en suisse un bailli nommé steiguer de wittighofen il était à jeûn le plus intègre et même le plus indulgent des juges mais malheur au misérable qui se trouvait sur la sellette lorsquil avait fait un grand diner il était homme à faire pendre linnocent comme le coupable in switzerland we had a bailiff by the name of m steigner de wittighofen when he fasted he was a most upright and even a most indulgent judge but woe to the unfortunate man whom he found on the culprits bench after he had had a large dinner he was capable of sending the innocent like the guilty to the gallows nous pensons et même nous ne sommes honnêtes gens que comme nous sommes gais ou braves tout dépend de la manière dont notre machine est montée on dirait en certains moments que lâme habite dans lestomac et que van helmont en mettant son siège dans le pylore ne se serait trompé quen prenant la partie pour le tout we think we are and in fact we are good men     only as we are gay or brave everything depends on the way our machine is running one is sometimes inclined to say that the soul is situated in the stomach and that van helmont   who said that the seat of the soul was in the pylorus made only the mistake of taking the part for the whole a quels excès la faim cruelle peut nous porter     plus de respect pour les entrailles auxquelles on doit ou on a donné la vie on les déchire à belles dents on sen fait dhorribles festins et dans la fureur dont on est transporté le plus faible est toujours la proie du plus fort la grossesse cette émule désirée des pâles couleurs ne se contente pas damener le plus souvent à sa suite les goûts dépravés qui accompagnent ces deux états elle a quelquefois fait exécuter à lâme les plus affreux complots effets dune manie subite qui étouffe jusquà la loi naturelle cest ainsi que le cerveau cette matrice de lesprit se pervertit à sa manière avec celle du corps quelle autre fureur dhomme ou de femme dans ceux que la continence et la santé poursuivent cest peu pour cette fille timide et modeste davoir perdu toute honte et toute pudeur elle ne regarde plus linceste que comme une femme galante regarde ladultère si ses besoins ne trouvent pas de prompts soulagements ils ne se borneront point aux simples accidents dune passion utérine à la manie etc cette malheureuse mourra dun mal dont il y a tant de médecins to what excesses cruel hunger can bring us we no longer regard even our own parents and children we tear them to pieces eagerly and make horrible banquets of them and in the fury with which we are carried away the weakest is always the prey of the strongest il ne faut que des yeux pour voir linfluence nécessaire de lâge sur la raison lâme suit les progrès du corps comme ceux de léducation dans le beau sexe lâme suit encore la délicatesse du tempérament de là cette tendresse cette affection ces sentiments vifs plutôt fondés sur la passion que sur la raison ces préjugés ces superstitions dont la forte empreinte peut à peine seffacer etc lhomme au contraire dont le cerveau et les nerfs participent de la fermeté de tous les solides a lesprit ainsi que les traits du visage plus nerveux     léducation dont manquent les femmes ajoute encore de nouveaux degrés de force à son âme avec de tels secours de la nature et de lart comment ne seraitil pas plus reconnaissant plus généreux plus constant en amitié plus ferme dans ladversité etc mais suivant à peu près la pensée de lauteur des lettres sur les physionomies qui joint les grâces de lesprit et du corps à presque tous les sentiments du cœur les plus tendres et les plus délicats ne doit point nous envier une double force qui ne semble avoir été donnée à lhomme lune que pour se mieux pénétrer des attraits de la beauté lautre que pour mieux servir à ses plaisirs one needs only eyes to see the necessary influence of old age on reason the soul follows the progress of the body as it does the progress of education in the weaker sex the soul accords also with delicacy of temperament and from this delicacy follow tenderness affection quick feelings due more to passion than to reason prejudices and superstitions whose strong impress can hardly be effaced man on the other hand whose brain and nerves partake of the firmness of all solids has not only stronger features but also a more vigorous mind education which women lack strengthens his mind still more thus with such help of nature and art why should not a man be more grateful more generous more constant in friendship stronger in adversity but to follow almost exactly the thought of the author of the lettres sur la physiognomie   the sex which unites the charms of the mind and of the body with almost all the tenderest and most delicate feelings of the heart should not envy us the two capacities which seem to have been given to man the one merely to enable him better     to fathom the allurements of beauty and the other merely to enable him to minister better to its pleasures il nest pas plus nécessaire dêtre aussi grand physionomiste que cet auteur pour deviner la qualité de lesprit par la figure ou la forme des traits lorsquils sont marqués jusquà un certain point quil ne lest dêtre grand médecin pour connaître un mal accompagné de tous ses symptomes évidents examinez les portraits de locke de steele de boerhaave de maupertuis etc vous ne serez point surpris de leur trouver des physionomies fortes des yeux daigle parcourezen une infinité dautres vous distinguerez toujours le beau du grand génie et même souvent lhonnête homme du fripon on a remarqué par exemple quun poète célèbre réunit dans son portrait lair dun filou avec le feu de prométhée it is no more necessary to be just as great a physiognomist as this author in order to guess the quality of the mind from the countenance or the shape of the features provided these are sufficiently marked than it is necessary to be a great doctor to recognize a disease accompanied by all its marked symptoms look at the portraits of locke of steele of boerhaave   of maupertuis   and the rest and you will not be surprised to find strong faces and eagle eyes look over a multitude of others and you can always distinguish the man of talent from the man of genius and often even an honest man from a scoundrel for example it has been noticed that a celebrated poet combines in his portrait the look of a pickpocket with the fire of prometheus lhistoire nous offre un mémorable exemple de la puissance de lair le fameux duc de guise était si fort convaincu que henri iii qui lavait eu tant de fois en son pouvoir noserait jamais lassassiner quil partit pour blois le chancelier chyverni apprenant son départ sécria voilà un homme perdu     lorsque sa fatale prédiction fut justifiée par lévénement on lui en demanda la raison il y a vingt ans ditil que je connais le roi il est naturellement bon et même faible mais jai observé quun rien limpatiente et le met en fureur lorsquil fait froid history provides us with a noteworthy example of the power of temperature the famous duke of guise was so strongly convinced that henry the third in whose power he had so often been would never dare assassinate him that he went to blois when the chancelor chiverny learned of the dukes departure he cried he is lost after this fatal prediction had been fulfilled by the event chiverny was asked why he made it i have known the king for twenty years said he he is naturally kind and even weakly indulgent but i have noticed that when it is cold it takes nothing at all to provoke him and send him into a passion tel peuple a lesprit lourd et stupide tel autre la vif léger pénétrant doù cela vientil si ce nest en partie et de la nourriture quil prend et de la semence de ses pères  et de ce chaos de divers éléments qui nagent dans limmensité de lair lesprit a comme le corps ses maladies épidémiques et son scorbut one nation is of heavy and stupid wit and another quick light and penetrating whence comes this difference if not in part from the difference     in foods and difference in inheritance  and in part from the mixture of the diverse elements which float around in the immensity of the void the mind like the body has its contagious diseases and its scurvy tel est lempire du climat quun homme qui en change se ressent malgré lui de ce changement cest une plante ambulante qui sest ellemême transplantée si le climat nest plus le même il est juste quelle dégénère ou saméliore such is the influence of climate that a man who goes from one climate to another feels the change in spite of himself he is a walking plant which has transplanted itself if the climate is not the same it will surely either degenerate or improve on prend tout encore de ceux avec qui lon vit leurs gestes leurs accents etc comme la paupière se baisse à la menace du coup dont on est prévenu ou par la même raison que le corps du spectateur imite machinalement et malgré lui tous les mouvements dun bon pantomime furthermore we catch everything from those with whom we come in contact their gestures their accent etc just as the eyelid is instinctively lowered when a blow is foreseen or as for the same reason the body of the spectator mechanically imitates in spite of himself all the motions of a good mimic   ce que je viens de dire prouve que la meilleure compagnie pour un homme desprit est la sienne sil nen trouve une semblable lesprit se rouille avec ceux qui nen ont point faute dêtre exercé à la paume on renvoie mal la balle à qui la sert mal jaimerais mieux un homme intelligent qui naurait eu aucune éducation que sil en eût eu une mauvaise pourvu quil fût encore assez jeune un     esprit mal conduit est un acteur que la province a gâté from what i have just said it follows that a brilliant man is his own best company unless he can find other company of the same sort in the society of the unintelligent the mind grows rusty for lack of exercise as at tennis a ball that is served badly is badly returned i should prefer an intelligent man without an education if he were still young enough to a man badly educated a badly trained mind is like an actor whom the provinces have spoiled les divers états de lâme sont donc toujours corrélatifs à ceux du corps mais pour mieux démontrer toute cette dépendance et ses causes servonsnous ici de lanatomie comparée ouvrons les entrailles de lhomme et des animaux le moyen de connaître la nature humaine si lon nest éclairé par un juste parallèle de la structure des uns et des autres thus the diverse states of the soul are always correlative with those of the body   but the better to show this dependence in its completeness and its causes let us here make use of comparative anatomy let us lay bare the organs of man and     of animals how can human nature be known if we may not derive any light from an exact comparison of the structure of man and of animals en général la forme et la composition du cerveau des quadrupèdes est à peu près la même que dans lhomme même figure même disposition partout avec cette différence essentielle que lhomme est de tous les animaux celui qui a le plus de cerveau et le cerveau le plus tortueux en raison de la masse de son corps ensuite le singe le castor léléphant le chien le renard le chat etc voilà les animaux qui ressemblent le plus à lhomme car on remarque aussi chez eux la même analogie graduée par rapport au corps calleux dans lequel lancisi avait établi le siège de lâme avant feu mr de la peyronnie qui cependant a illustré cette opinion par une foule dexpériences après tous les quadrupèdes ce sont les oiseaux qui ont le plus de cerveau les poissons ont la tête grosse mais elle est vide de sens comme celle de bien des hommes ils nont point de corps calleux et fort peu de cerveau lequel manque aux insectes in general the form and the structure of the brains of quadrupeds are almost the same as those of the brain of man the same shape the same arrangement everywhere with this essential difference that of all the animals man is the one whose brain is largest and in proportion to its mass more convoluted than the brain of any other animal then come the monkey the beaver the elephant the dog the fox the cat these animals are most like man for among them too one notes the same progressive analogy in relation to the corpus callosum in which lancisi—anticipating the late m de la peyronie 0—established the seat of the soul the latter however illustrated the theory by innumerable experiments next after all the quadrupeds birds have the largest brains fish have large heads but these are void of sense like the heads of many men fish have no corpus callosum and very little brain while insects entirely lack brain je ne me répandrai point en un plus long détail des variétés de la nature ni en conjectures car les unes et les autres sont infinies comme on en     peut juger en lisant les seuls traités de willis de cerebro et de anima brutorum i shall not launch out into any more detail about the varieties of nature nor into conjectures concerning them for there is an infinite number of both as any one can see by reading no further than the treatises of willis de cerebro and de anima brutorum   je conclûrai seulement ce qui sen suit clairement de ces incontestables observations  o que plus les animaux sont farouches moins ils ont de cerveau  o que ce viscère semble sagrandir en quelque sorte à proportion de leur docilité  o quil y a ici une singulière condition imposée éternellement par la nature qui est que plus on gagnera du côté de lesprit plus on perdra du côté de linstinct lequel lemporte de la perte ou du gain i shall draw the conclusions which follow clearly from these incontestable observations  st that the fiercer animals are the less brain they have  d that this organ seems to increase in size in proportion to the gentleness of the animal  d that nature seems here eternally to impose a singular condition     that the more one gains in intelligence the more one loses in instinct does this bring gain or loss ne croyez pas au reste que je veuille prétendre par là que le seul volume du cerveau suffise pour faire juger du degré de docilité des animaux il faut que la qualité réponde encore à la quantité et que les solides et les fluides soient dans cet équilibre convenable qui fait la santé do not think however that i wish to infer by that that the size alone of the brain is enough to indicate the degree of tameness in animals the quality must correspond to the quantity and the solids and liquids must be in that due equilibrium which constitutes health si limbécile ne manque pas de cerveau comme on le remarque ordinairement ce viscère péchera par une mauvaise consistance par trop de mollesse par exemple il en est de même des fous les vices de leur cerveau ne se dérobent pas toujours à nos recherches mais si les causes de limbécilité de la folie etc ne sont pas sensibles où aller chercher celles de la variété de tous les esprits elles échapperaient aux yeux des lynx et des argus un rien une petite fibre quelque chose que la plus subtile anatomie ne peut découvrir eut fait deux sots derasme et de fontenelle qui le remarque lui même dans un de ses meilleurs dialogues outre la mollesse de la moëlle du cerveau dans les enfants dans les petits chiens et dans les oiseaux willis a remarqué que les corps cannelés sont effacés et comme décolorés dans tous ces animaux     et que leurs stries sont aussi imparfaitement formées que dans les paralytiques il ajoute ce qui est vrai que lhomme a la protubérance annulaire fort grosse et ensuite toujours diminutivement par dégrés le singe et les autres animaux nommés cidevant tandis que le veau le bœuf le loup la brebis le cochon etc qui ont cette partie dun très petit volume ont les nattes et testes fort gros if as is ordinarily observed the imbecile does not lack brain his brain will be deficient in its consistency—for instance in being too soft the same thing is true of the insane and the defects of their brains do not always escape our investigation but if the causes of imbecility insanity etc are not obvious where shall we look for the causes of the diversity of all minds they would escape the eyes of a lynx and of an argus a mere nothing a tiny fibre something that could never be found by the most delicate anatomy would have made of erasmus and fontenelle   two idiots and fontenelle himself speaks of this very fact in one of his best dialogues willis has noticed in addition to the softness of the brainsubstance in children puppies and birds that the corpora striata are obliterated and discolored in all these animals and that the striations are as imperfectly formed as in paralytics on a beau être discret et réservé sur les conséquences quon peut tirer de ces observations et de tant dautres sur lespèce dinconstance des vaisseaux et des nerfs etc tant de variétés ne peuvent être des jeux gratuits de la nature elles prouvent du moins la nécessité dune bonne et abondante organisation puisque dans tout le règne animal lâme se raffermissant avec le corps acquiert de la sagacité à mesure quil prend des forces however cautious and reserved one may be about the consequences that can be deduced from these observations and from many others concerning the kind of variation in the organs nerves etc one must admit that so many different varieties can not be the gratuitous play of nature they prove at least the necessity for a good and vigorous physical   00 organization since throughout the animal kingdom the soul gains force with the body and acquires keenness as the body gains strength arrêtonsnous à contempler la différente docilité des animaux sans doute lanalogie la mieux entendue conduit lesprit à croire que les causes dont nous avons fait mention produisent toute la diversité qui se trouve entreux et nous quoiquil faille avouer que notre faible entendement borné aux observations les plus grossières ne puisse voir les liens qui règnent entre la cause et les effets cest une espèce dharmonie que les philosophes ne connaîtront jamais let us pause to contemplate the varying capacity of animals to learn doubtless the analogy best framed leads the mind to think that the causes we have mentioned produce all the difference that is found between animals and men although we must confess that our weak understanding limited to the coarsest observations can not see the bonds that exist between cause and effects this is a kind of harmony that philosophers will never know parmi les animaux les uns apprennent à parler et à chanter ils retiennent des airs et prennent tous les tons aussi exactement quun musicien les autres qui montrent cependant plus desprit tels que le singe nen peuvent venir à bout pourquoi cela si ce nest par un vice des organes de la parole mais ce vice estil tellement de conformation     quon ny puisse apporter aucun remède en un mot seraitil absolument impossible dapprendre une langue à cet animal je ne le crois pas among animals some learn to speak and sing they remember tunes and strike the notes as exactly as a musician others for instance the ape show more intelligence and yet can not learn music what is the reason for this except some defect in the organs of speech but is this defect so essential to the structure that it could never be remedied in a word would it be absolutely impossible to teach the ape a language   i do not think so je prendrais le grand singe préférablement à tout autre jusquà ce que le hasard nous eût fait découvrir quelque autre espèce plus semblable à la nôtre car rien ne répugne quil y en ait dans des régions qui nous sont inconnues cet animal nous ressemble si fort que les naturalistes lont appelé homme sauvage ou homme des bois je le prendrais aux mêmes conditions des écoliers damman cestàdire que je voudrais quil ne fût ni trop jeune ni trop vieux car ceux quon nous apporte en europe sont communément trop âgés je choisirais celui qui aurait la physionomie la plus spirituelle et qui tiendrait le mieux dans mille petites opérations ce quelle maurait promis enfin ne me trouvant pas digne dêtre son gouverneur je le mettrais à lécole de lexcellent maître que je viens de nommer ou dun autre aussi habile sil en est i should choose a large ape in preference to any other until by some good fortune another kind should be discovered more like us for nothing prevents there being such an one in regions unknown to us the ape resembles us so strongly that naturalists have called it wild man or man of the woods i should take it in the condition of the pupils of amman   that is to say i should not want it to be too young or too old for apes that are brought to europe are usually too old i would choose the one with the most intelligent face and the one which in a thousand little ways best lived up to its look of intelligence finally   0  not considering myself worthy to be his master i should put him in the school of that excellent teacher whom i have just named or with another teacher equally skilful if there is one vous savez par le livre damman et par tous ceux  qui ont traduit sa méthode tous les prodiges quil a su opérer sur les sourds de naissance dans les yeux desquels il a comme il le fait entendre luimême trouvé des oreilles et en combien peu de temps enfin il leur a appris à entendre parler lire et écrire je veux que les yeux dun sourd voient plus clair et soient plus intelligents que sil ne létait pas par la raison que la perte dun membre ou dun sens peut augmenter la force ou la pénétration dun autre mais le singe voit et entend il comprend ce quil entend et ce quil voit il conçoit si parfaitement les signes quon lui fait quà tout autre jeu   0 ou tout autre exercice je ne doute point quil ne lemportât sur les disciples damman pourquoi donc léducation des singes seraitelle impossible pourquoi ne pourraitil enfin à force de soins imiter à lexemple des sourds les mouvemens nécessaires pour prononcer je nose décider si les organes de la parole du singe ne peuvent quoiquon fasse rien articuler mais cette impossibilité absolue me surprendrait à cause de la grande analogie du singe et de lhomme et quil nest point danimal connu jusquà présent dont le dedans et le dehors lui ressemblent dune manière si frappante mr locke qui certainement na jamais été suspect de crédulité na pas fait difficulté de croire lhistoire que le chevalier temple fait dans ses mémoires dun perroquet qui répondait à propos et avait appris comme nous à avoir une espèce de conversation suivie je sais quon sest moqué  de ce grand métaphysicien mais qui aurait annoncé à lunivers quil y a des générations qui se font sans œufs et sans femmes auraitil trouvé beaucoup de partisans cependant mr trembley en a découvert qui se font sans accouplement et par la seule section amman neûtil pas aussi passé pour un fou sil se fût vanté avant que den faire lheureuse expérience dinstruire et en aussi peu de temps des écoliers tels que les siens cependant ses succès ont étonné lunivers et comme lauteur de lhistoire des polypes il a passé de plein vol à limmortalité qui doit à son génie les miracles quil opère lemporte à mon gré sur qui doit les siens au hasard qui a trouvé lart dembellir le plus beau des règnes et de lui donner des perfections quil navait     pas doit être mis audessus dun faiseur oisif de systèmes frivoles ou dun auteur laborieux de stériles découvertes celles damman sont bien dun autre prix il a tiré les hommes de linstinct auquel ils semblaient condamnés il leur a donné les idées de lesprit une âme en un mot quils neûssent jamais eue quel plus grand pouvoir you know by ammans work and by all those  who have interpreted his method all the wonders he has been able to accomplish for those born deaf in their eyes he discovered ears as he himself explains and in how short a time in short he taught them to hear speak read and write i grant that a deaf persons eyes see more clearly and are keener than if he were not deaf for the loss of one member or sense can increase the strength or acuteness of another but apes see and hear they understand what they hear and see and grasp so perfectly the signs that are made to them that i doubt not that they would surpass the pupils of amman in any other game or exercise why then should the education of monkeys be impossible why might not the monkey by dint of great pains at last imitate after the manner of deaf mutes the motions necessary for pronunciation i do not dare decide whether the monkeys organs of speech however trained would be incapable of articulation but because of the great analogy between ape and man   and because there is no known animal whose external and internal organs so strikingly resemble mans it would surprise me if speech were absolutely impossible to the ape locke who was certainly never suspected of credulity found no difficulty in believing the story told by sir william temple   in his memoirs about a parrot which could answer rationally and which had learned to carry   0  on a kind of connected conversation as we do i know that people have ridiculed  this great metaphysician but suppose some one should have announced that reproduction sometimes takes place without eggs or a female would he have found many partisans yet m trembley   has found cases where reproduction takes place without copulation and by fission would not amman too have passed for mad if he had boasted that he could instruct scholars like his in so short a time before he had happily accomplished the feat his successes have however astonished the world and he like the author of the history of polyps has risen to immortality at one bound whoever owes the miracles that he works to his own genius surpasses in my opinion the man who owes his to chance he who has discovered the art of adorning the most beautiful of the kingdoms of nature and of giving it perfections that it did not have should be rated above an idle creator of frivolous systems or a painstaking author of sterile discoveries ammans discoveries are certainly of a much greater value he has freed men from the instinct to which they seemed to be condemned and has given them ideas intelligence or in a word a soul which they would never have had what greater power than this ne bornons point les ressources de la nature elles sont infinies surtout aidées dun grand art let us not limit the resources of nature they are infinite especially when reinforced by great art la même mécanique qui ouvre le canal deustachi dans les sourds ne pourraitil le déboucher dans les singes une heureuse envie dimiter la prononciation du maître ne pourraitelle mettre en liberté les organes de la parole dans les animaux qui imitent tant dautres signes avec tant dadresse et dintelligence non seulement je défie quon me cite aucune expérience vraiment concluante qui décide mon projet impossible et ridicule mais la similitude de la structure et des opérations du singe est telle que je ne doute presque point si on exerçait parfaitement cet animal quon ne vînt enfin à bout de lui apprendre à prononcer et par conséquent à savoir une langue alors ce ne serait plus ni un homme sauvage ni un homme manqué ce serait un homme parfait un petit homme de ville avec autant détoffe ou de muscles que nousmêmes pour penser et profiter de son éducation could not the device which opens the eustachian canal of the deaf open that of apes might not a happy desire to imitate the masters pronunciation liberate the organs of speech in animals that imitate so many other signs with such skill and intelligence   0  not only do i defy any one to name any really conclusive experiment which proves my view impossible and absurd but such is the likeness of the structure and functions of the ape to ours that i have very little doubt that if this animal were properly trained he might at last be taught to pronounce and consequently to know a language then he would no longer be a wild man nor a defective man but he would be a perfect man a little gentleman with as much matter or muscle as we have for thinking and profiting by his education des animaux à lhomme la transition nest pas violente les vrais philosophes en conviendront quétait lhomme avant linvention des mots et la connaissance des langues un animal de son espèce qui avec beaucoup moins dinstinct naturel que les autres dont alors il ne se croyait pas roi nétait distingué du singe et des autres animaux     que comme le singe lest luimême je veux dire par une physionomie qui annonçait plus de discernement réduit à la seule connaissance intuitive des leibniziens il ne voyait que des figures et des couleurs sans pouvoir rien distinguer entrelles vieux comme jeune enfant à tout âge il bégayait ses sensations et ses besoins comme un chien affamé ou ennuyé de repos demande à manger ou à se promener the transition from animals to man is not violent as true philosophers will admit what was man before the invention of words and the knowledge of language   an animal of his own species with much less instinct than the others in those days he did not consider himself king over the other animals nor was he distinguished from the ape and from the rest except as the ape itself differs from the other animals i e by a more intelligent face reduced to the bare intuitive knowledge of the leibnizians he saw only shapes and colors without being able to distinguish between them the same old as young child at all ages he lisped out his sensations and his needs as a dog that is hungry or tired of sleeping asks for something to eat or for a walk les mots les langues les lois les sciences les beauxarts sont venus et par eux enfin le diamant brut de notre esprit a été poli on a dressé un homme comme un animal on est devenu auteur comme portefaix un géomètre a appris à faire les démonstrations et les calculs les plus difficiles comme un singe à ôter ou mettre son petit chapeau et à monter sur son chien docile tout sest fait par les signes chaque espèce a compris ce quelle a pu comprendre et cest de cette manière que les hommes ont acquis la connaissance symbolique ainsi nommée encore par nos philosophes dallemagne words languages laws sciences and the fine arts have come and by them finally the rough diamond of our mind has been polished man has been trained in the same way as animals he has become an author as they became beasts of burden a geometrician has learned to perform the most difficult demonstrations and calculations as a monkey   0  has learned to take his little hat off and on and to mount his tame dog all has been accomplished through signs every species has learned what it could understand and in this way men have acquired symbolic knowledge still so called by our german philosophers rien de si simple comme on voit que la mécanique de notre éducation tout se réduit à des sons ou à des mots qui de la bouche de lun passent par loreille de lautre dans le cerveau qui reçoit en même temps par les yeux la figure des corps dont ces mots sont les signes arbitraires nothing as any one can see is so simple as the mechanism of our education everything may be reduced to sounds or words that pass from the mouth of one through the ears of another into his brain at the same moment he perceives through his eyes the shape of the bodies of which these words are the arbitrary signs mais qui a parlé le premier qui a été le premier précepteur du genre human qui a inventé les moyens de mettre à profit la docilité de notre organisation je nen sais rien le nom de ces heureux et premiers génies a été perdu dans la nuit des temps mais lart est le fils de la nature elle a dû longtemps le précéder    but who was the first to speak who was the first teacher of the human race who invented the means of utilizing the plasticity of our organism i can not answer the names of these first splendid geniuses have been lost in the night of time but art is the child of nature so nature must have long preceded it on doit croire que les hommes les mieux organisés ceux pour qui la nature aura épuisé ses bienfaits auront instruit les autres ils nauront pu entendre un bruit nouveau par exemple éprouver de nouvelles sensations être frappé de tous ces beaux objets divers qui forment le ravissant spectacle de la nature sans se trouver dans le cas de ce sourd de chartres dont le grand fontenelle nous a le premier donné lhistoire lorsquil entendit pour la première fois à quarante ans le bruit étonnant des cloches we must think that the men who were the most highly organized those on whom nature had lavished her richest gifts taught the others they could not have heard a new sound for instance nor experienced new sensations nor been struck by all the varied and beautiful objects that compose the ravishing spectacle of nature without finding themselves in the state of mind of the deaf man of chartres whose experience was first related by the great fontenelle   when at forty years he heard for the first time the astonishing sound of bells de là seraitil absurde de croire que ces premiers mortels essayèrent à la manière de ce sourd ou à celle des animaux et des muets autre espèce danimaux dexprimer leurs nouveaux sentiments par des mouvements dépendants de léconomie de leur imagination et conséquemment ensuite par des sons spontanés propres à chaque animal expression naturelle de leur surprise de leur joie de leurs transports ou de leurs besoins car sans doute ceux que la nature a doués dun sentiment plus exquis ont eu aussi plus de facilité pour lexprimer would it be absurd to conclude from this that the first mortals tried after the manner of this deaf man or like animals and like mutes another kind   0  of animals to express their new feelings by motions depending on the nature of their imagination and therefore afterwards by spontaneous sounds distinctive of each animal as the natural expression of their surprise their joy their ecstasies and their needs for doubtless those whom nature endowed with finer feeling had also greater facility in expression voilà comme je conçois que les hommes ont employé leur sentiment ou leur instinct pour avoir de lesprit et enfin leur esprit pour avoir des connaissances voilà par quels moyens autant que je puis les saisir on sest rempli le cerveau des idées pour le réception desquelles la nature lavait formé on sest aidé lun par lautre et les plus petits commencements sagrandissant peu à peu toutes les choses de lunivers ont été aussi facilement distinguées quun cercle that is the way in which i think men have used their feeling and their instinct to gain intelligence and then have employed their intelligence to gain knowledge those are the ways so far as i can understand them in which men have filled the brain with the ideas for the reception of which nature made it nature and man have helped each other and the smallest beginnings have little by little increased until everything in the universe could be as easily described as a circle comme une corde de violon ou une touche de clavecin frémit et rend un son les cordes du cerveau     frappées par les rayons sonores ont été excitées à rendre ou à redire les mots qui les touchaient mais comme telle est la construction de ce viscère que dès quune fois les yeux bien formés pour loptique ont reçu la peinture des objets le cerveau ne peut pas ne pas voir leurs images et leurs différences de même lorsque les signes de ces différences ont été marqués ou gravés dans le cerveau lâme en a nécessairement examiné les rapports examen qui lui était impossible sans la découverte des signes ou linvention des langues dans ces temps où lunivers était presque muet lâme était à légard de tous les objets comme un homme qui sans avoir aucune idée des proportions regarderait un tableau ou une pièce de sculpture il ny pourrait rien distinguer ou comme un petit enfant car alors lâme était dans son enfance qui tenant dans sa main un certain nombre de petits brins de paille ou de bois les voit en général dune vue vague et superficielle sans pouvoir les compter ni les distinguer mais quon mette une espèce de pavillon ou détendard à cette pièce de bois par exemple quon appelle mât quon en mette un autre à un autre pareil corps que le premier venu se nombre par le signe   et le second par le signe ou chiffre   alors cet enfant pourra les compter et ainsi de suite il apprendra toute larithmétique dès quune figure lui paraîtra égale à une autre par son signe numératif il conclûra sans peine que ce sont deux corps différents que   et   font deux que   et   font    etc as a violin string or a harpsichord key vibrates and gives forth sound so the cerebral fibres struck by waves of sound are stimulated to render or repeat the words that strike them and as the structure of the brain is such that when eyes well formed for seeing have once perceived the image of objects the brain can not help seeing their images and their differences so when the signs of these differences have been traced or imprinted in the brain the soul necessarily examines their relations—an examination that would have been impossible without the discovery of signs or the invention of language at the time when the universe was almost dumb the souls attitude toward all objects was that of a man without any idea of proportion toward a picture or a piece of sculpture   0  in which he could distinguish nothing or the soul was like a little child for the soul was then in its infancy who holding in his hand small bits of straw or wood sees them in a vague and superficial way without being able to count or distinguish them but let some one attach a kind of banner or standard to this bit of wood which perhaps is called a mast and another banner to another similar object let the first be known by the symbol   and the second by the symbol or number   then the child will be able to count the objects and in this way he will learn all of arithmetic as soon as one figure seems equal to another in its numerical sign he will decide without difficulty that they are two different bodies that      make   and      make    etc cest cette similitude réelle ou apparente des     figures qui est la base fondamentale de toutes les vérités et de toutes nos connaissances parmi lesquelles il est évident que celles dont les signes sont moins simples et moins sensibles sont plus difficiles à apprendre que les autres en ce quelles demandent plus de génie pour embrasser et combiner cette immense quantité de mots par lesquels les sciences dont je parle expriment les vérités de leur ressort tandis que les sciences qui sannoncent par des chiffres ou autres petits signes sapprennent facilement et cest sans doute cette facilité qui a fait la fortune des calculs algébriques plus encore que leur évidence this real or apparent likeness of figures is the fundamental basis of all truths and of all we know among these sciences evidently those whose signs are less simple and less sensible are harder to understand than the others because more talent is required to comprehend and combine the immense number of words by which such sciences express the truths in their province on the other hand the sciences that are expressed by numbers or by other small signs are easily learned and without doubt this facility rather than its demonstrability is what has made the fortune of algebra tout ce savoir dont le vent enfle le ballon du cerveau de nos pédants orgueilleux nest donc quun vaste amas de mots et de figures qui forment dans la tête toutes les traces par lesquelles nous distinguons et nous nous rappellons les objets toutes nos idées se réveillent comme un jardinier qui connaît les plantes se souvient de toutes leurs phases à leur aspect ces mots et ces figures qui sont désignés par eux sont tellements liés ensemble dans le cerveau quil est assez rare quon imagine une chose sans le nom ou le signe qui lui est attaché all this knowledge with which vanity fills the balloonlike brains of our proud pedants is therefore but a huge mass of words and figures which form in the brain all the marks by which we distinguish   0  and recall objects all our ideas are awakened after the fashion in which the gardener who knows plants recalls all stages of their growth at sight of them these words and the objects designated by them are so connected in the brain that it is comparatively rare to imagine a thing without the name or sign that is attached to it je me sers toujours du mot imaginer parceque je crois que tout simagine et que toutes les parties de lâme peuvent être justement réduites à la seule imagination qui les forme toutes et quainsi le jugement le raisonnement la mémoire ne sont que des parties de lâme nullement absolues mais de véritables modifications de cette espèce de toile médullaire sur laquelle les objets peints dans lœil sont renvoyés comme dune lanterne magique    i always use the word imagine because i think that everything is the work of imagination and that all the faculties of the soul can be correctly reduced to pure imagination in which they all consist 0 thus judgment reason and memory are not absolute parts of the soul but merely modifications of this kind of medullary screen upon which images of the objects painted in the eye are projected as by a magic lantern mais si tel est ce merveilleux et incompréhensible résultat de lorganisation du cerveau si tout se conçoit par limagination si tout sexplique par elle pourquoi diviser le principe sensitif qui pense dans lhomme nestce pas une contradiction manifeste dans les partisans de la simplicité de lesprit car une chose quon divise ne peut plus être sans absurdité regardée comme indivisible voilà où conduit labus des langues et lusage de ces grands mots spiritualité immatérialité etc placés à tout hasard sans être entendus même par des gens desprit but if such is the marvelous and incomprehensible result of the structure of the brain if everything is perceived and explained by imagination why should we divide the sensitive principle which thinks in man is not this a clear inconsistency in the partisans of the simplicity of the mind for a thing that is divided can no longer without absurdity be regarded as indivisible see to what one is brought by the abuse of language and by those fine words spirituality immateriality etc used haphazard and not understood even by the most brilliant   rien de plus facile que de prouver un système fondé comme celuici sur le sentiment intime et lexpérience propre de chaque individu limagination ou cette partie fantastique du cerveau dont la nature nous est aussi inconnue que sa manière dagir estelle naturellement petite ou faible elle aura à peine la force de comparer lanalogie ou la ressemblance de ses idées elle ne pourra voir que ce qui sera visàvis delle ou ce qui laffectera le plus vivement et encore de quelle manière mais toujours estil vrai que limagination seule aperçoit que cest elle qui se représente tous les objets avec les mots et les figures qui les caractérisent et quainsi cest elle encore une fois qui est lâme puisquelle en fait tous les rôles par elle par son pinceau flatteur le froid squelette de la raison prend des chairs vives et vermeilles par elle les sciences fleurissent les arts sembellissent les bois parlent les échos soupirent les rochers pleurent le marbre respire tout prend vie parmi les corps inanimés cest elle encore qui ajoute à la tendresse dun cœur amoureux le piquant attrait de la volupté elle la fait germer     dans le cabinet du philosophe et du pédant poudreux elle forme enfin les savants comme les orateurs et les poëtes sottement décriée par les uns vainement distinguée par les autres qui tous lont mal connue elle ne marche pas seulement à la suite des grâces et des beauxart elle ne peint pas seulement la nature elle peut aussi la mesurer elle raisonne juge pénètre compare approfondit pourraitelle si bien sentir les beautées des tableaux qui lui sont tracés sans en découvrir les rapports non comme elle ne peut se replier sur les plaisirs des sens sans en goûter toute la perfection ou la volupté elle ne peut réfléchir sur ce quelle a mécaniquement conçu sans être alors le jugement même nothing is easier than to prove a system based as this one is on the intimate feeling and personal experience of each individual if the imagination or let us say that fantastic part of the brain whose nature is as unknown to us as its way of acting be naturally small or weak it will hardly be able to   0  compare the analogy or the resemblance of its ideas it will be able to see only what is face to face with it or what affects it very strongly and how will it see all this yet it is always imagination which apperceives and imagination which represents to itself all objects along with their names and symbols and thus once again imagination is the soul since it plays all the rôles of the soul by the imagination by its flattering brush the cold skeleton of reason takes on living and ruddy flesh by the imagination the sciences flourish the arts are adorned the wood speaks the echoes sigh the rocks weep marble breathes and all inanimate objects gain life it is imagination again which adds the piquant charm of voluptuousness to the tenderness of an amorous heart which makes tenderness bud in the study of the philosopher and of the dusty pedant which in a word creates scholars as well as orators and poets foolishly decried by some vainly praised by others and misunderstood by all it follows not only in the train of the graces and of the fine arts it not only describes but can also measure nature it reasons judges analyzes compares and investigates could it feel so keenly the beauties of the pictures drawn for it unless it discovered their relations no just as it can not turn its thoughts on the pleasures of the senses without enjoying their perfection or their voluptuousness it can not reflect on what it has mechanically conceived without thus being judgment itself plus on exerce limagination ou le plus maigre génie plus il prend pour ainsi dire dembonpoint plus il sagrandit devient nerveux robuste vaste et capable de penser la meilleure organisation a besoin de cet exercice the more the imagination or the poorest talent is exercised the more it gains in embonpoint so to speak and the larger it grows it becomes sensitive   0  robust broad and capable of thinking the best of organisms has need of this exercise lorganisation est le premier mérite de lhomme cest en vain que tous les auteurs de morale ne mettent point au rang des qualités estimables celles quon tient de la nature mais seulement les talents qui sacquièrent à force de réflexions et dindustrie car doù nous vient je vous prie lhabileté la science et la vertu si ce nest dune disposition qui nous rend propres à devenir habiles savants et vertueux et doù nous vient encore cette disposition si ce nest de la nature nous navons de qualités estimables que par elle nous lui devons tout ce que nous sommes pourquoi donc nestimeraisje pas autant ceux qui ont des qualités naturelles que ceux qui brillent par des vertus acquises et comme demprunt quel que soit le mérite de quelque endroit     quil naisse il est digne destime il ne sagit que de savoir le mesurer lesprit la beauté les richesses la noblesse quoiquenfants du hasard ont tous leur prix comme ladresse le savoir la vertu etc ceux que la nature a comblés de ses dons les plus précieux doivent plaindre ceux à qui ils ont été refusés mais ils peuvent sentir leur supériorité sans orgueil et en connaisseurs une belle femme serait aussi ridicule de se trouver laide quun homme desprit de se croire un sot une modestie outrée défaut rare à la vérité est une sorte dingratitude envers la nature une honnête fierté au contraire est la marque dune âme belle et grande que décèlent des traits mâles moulés comme par le sentiment mans preeminent advantage is his organism   in vain all writers of books on morals fail to regard as praiseworthy those qualities that come by nature esteeming only the talents gained by dint of reflection and industry for whence come i ask skill learning and virtue if not from a disposition that makes us fit to become skilful wise and virtuous and whence again comes this disposition if not from nature only through nature do we have any good qualities to her we owe all that we are why then should i not esteem men with good natural qualities as much as men who shine by acquired and as it were borrowed virtues whatever the virtue may be from whatever source it may come it is worthy of esteem the only question is how to estimate it mind beauty wealth nobility although the children of chance all have their own value as skill learning and virtue have theirs those upon whom nature has heaped her most costly gifts should pity those to whom these gifts have been refused but in their character of experts they may feel their superiority without pride a beautiful woman would be as foolish to think herself ugly as an intelligent man to think himself a fool an exaggerated modesty a rare fault to be sure is a kind of ingratitude towards nature an honest pride on the contrary is the mark of a strong and beautiful soul revealed by manly features moulded by feeling si lorganisation est un mérite et le premier mérite et la source de tous les autres linstruction est le second le cerveau le mieux construit sans elle le serait en pure perte comme sans lusage du monde lhomme le mieux fait ne serait quun paysan grossier mais aussi quel serait le fruit de la plus excellente école sans une matrice parfaitement ouverte à lentrée ou à la conception des idées il est aussi impossible de donner une seule idée à un homme privé de tous les sens que de faire un enfant à une femme à laquelle la nature aurait poussé la distraction jusquà oublier de faire une vulve comme je lai vu dans une qui navait ni fente ni vagin ni matrice et qui pour cette raison fut démariée après dix ans de mariage if ones organism is an advantage and the preeminent advantage and the source of all others education is the second the best made brain would    0 be a total loss without it just as the best constituted man would be but a common peasant without knowledge of the ways of the world but on the other hand what would be the use of the most excellent school without a matrix perfectly open to the entrance and conception of ideas it is  impossible to impart a single idea to a man deprived of all his senses mais si le cerveau est à la fois bien organisé et bien instruit cest une terre féconde parfaitement ensemencée qui produit le centuple de ce quelle a reçu ou pour quitter le style figuré souvent nécessaire     pour mieux exprimer ce quon sent et donner des grâces à la vérité même limagination élevée par lart à la belle et rare dignité de génie saisit exactement tous les rapports des idées quelle a conçues embrasse avec facilité une foule étonnante dobjets pour en tirer enfin une longue chaîne de conséquences lesquelles ne sont encore que de nouveaux rapports enfantés par la comparaison des premiers auxquels lâme trouve une parfaite ressemblance telle est selon moi la génération de lesprit je dis trouve comme jai donné cidevant lépithète dapparente à la similitude des objets non que je pense que nos sens soient toujours trompeurs comme la prétendu le père malebranche ou que nos yeux naturellement un peu ivres ne voient pas les objets tels quils sont en eux mêmes quoique les microscopes nous le prouvent tous les jours mais pour navoir aucune dispute avec les pyrrhoniens parmi lesquels bayle sest distingué but if the brain is at the same time well organized and well educated it is a fertile soil well sown that brings forth a hundredfold what it has received or to leave the figures of speech often needed to express what one means and to add grace to truth itself the imagination raised by art to the rare and beautiful dignity of genius apprehends exactly all the relations of the ideas it has conceived and takes in easily an astounding number of objects in order to deduce from them a long chain of consequences which are again but new relations produced by a comparison with the first to which the soul finds a perfect resemblance such is i think the generation of intelligence   i say finds as i before gave the epithet apparent to the likeness of objects not because i think that our senses are always deceivers as father malebranche has claimed or that our eyes naturally a little unsteady fail to see objects as they are in themselves though microscopes prove this to us every day but in order to avoid any dispute with the pyrrhonians   among whom bayle   is well known je dis de la vérité en général ce que mr de fontenelle dit de certaines en particulier quil faut la sacrifier aux agréments de la société il est de la douceur de mon caractère dobvier à toute dispute lorsquil ne sagit pas daiguiser la conversation les cartésiens viendraient ici vainement à la charge avec leur idées innées je ne me donnerais certainement pas le quart de la peine qua prise mr locke pour attaquer de telles chimères quelle utilité en effet de faire un gros livre pour prouver une doctrine qui était érigée en axiome il y a trois mille ans i say of truth in general what m de fontenelle says of certain truths in particular that we must sacrifice it in order to remain on good terms with society and it accords with the gentleness of my      character to avoid all disputes unless to whet conversation the cartesians would here in vain make an onset upon me with their innate ideas i certainly would not give myself a quarter of the trouble that m locke took to attack such chimeras in truth what is the use of writing a ponderous volume to prove a doctrine which became an axiom three thousand years ago suivant les principes que nous avons posés et que nous croyons vrais celui qui a le plus dimagination   0 doit être regardé comme ayant le plus desprit ou de génie car tous ces mots sont synonymes et encore une fois cest par un abus honteux quon croit dire des choses différentes lorsquon ne dit que différents mots ou différents sons auxquels on na attaché aucune idée ou distinction réelle according to the principles which we have laid down and which we consider true he who has the most imagination should be regarded as having the most intelligence or genius for all these words are synonymous and again only by a shameful abuse of terms do we think that we are saying different things when we are merely using different words different sounds to which no idea or real distinction is attached la plus belle la plus grande ou la plus forte imagination est donc la plus propre aux sciences comme aux arts je ne décide point sil faut plus desprit pour exceller dans lart des aristotes ou des descartes que dans celui des euripides ou des sophocles et si la nature sest mise en plus grands frais pour faire newton que pour former corneille ce dont je doute fort mais il est certain que cest la seule imagination diversement appliquée qui a fait leur différent triomphe et leur gloire immortelle the finest greatest or strongest imagination is then the one most suited to the sciences as well as to the arts i do not pretend to say whether more intellect is necessary to excel in the art of aristotle or of descartes than to excel in that of euripides or of sophocles and whether nature has taken more trouble to make newton than to make corneille though i doubt this but it is certain that imagination alone differently applied has produced their diverse triumphs and their immortal glory si quelquun passe pour avoir peu de jugement avec beaucoup dimagination cela veut dire que limagination trop abandonnée à elle même presque toujours comme occupée à se regarder dans le miroir de ses sensations na pas assez contracté lhabitude de les examiner ellesmêmes avec attention plus profondément pénétrée des traces ou des images que de leur vérité ou de leur ressemblance if one is known as having little judgment and much imagination this means that the imagination has been left too much alone has as it were occupied most of the time in looking at itself in the mirror of its sensations has not sufficiently formed the habit of examining the sensations themselves      attentively it means that the imagination has been more impressed by images than by their truth or their likeness il est vrai que telle est la vivacité des ressorts de limagination que si lattention cette clé ou mère des sciences ne sen mêle il ne lui est guères permis que de parcourir et deffleurer les objets truly so quick are the responses of the imagination that if attention that key or mother of the sciences does not do its part imagination can do little more than run over and skim its objects voyez cet oiseau sur la branche il semble toujours prêt à senvoler limagination est de même toujours emportée par le tourbillon du sang et des esprits une onde fait une trace effacée par celle qui suit lâme court après souvent en vain il faut     quelle sattende à regretter ce quelle na pas assez vite saisi et fixé et cest ainsi que limagination véritable image du temps se détruit et se renouvelle sans cesse see that bird on the bough it seems always ready to fly away imagination is like the bird always carried onward by the turmoil of the blood and the animal spirits one wave leaves a mark effaced by the one that follows the soul pursues it often in vain it must expect to regret the loss of that which it has not quickly enough seized and fixed thus imagination the true image of time is being ceaselessly destroyed and renewed tel est le chaos et la succession continuelle et rapide de nos idées elles se chassent comme un flot pousse lautre de sorte que si limagination nemploie pour ainsi dire une partie de ses muscles pour être comme en équilibre sur les cordes du cerveau pour se soutenir quelque temps sur un objet qui va fuir et sempêcher de tomber sur un autre quil nest pas encore temps de contempler jamais elle ne sera digne du beau nom de jugement elle exprimera vivement ce quelle aura senti de même elle formera des orateurs des musiciens des peintres des poètes et jamais un seul philosophe au contraire si dès lenfance on accoutume limagination à se brider ellemême à ne point se laisser emporter à sa propre impétuosité qui ne fait que de brillants enthousiastes à arrêter contenir ses idées à les retourner dans tous les sens pour voir toutes les faces dun objet alors limagination prompte à juger embrassera par le raisonnement la plus grande sphère dobjets et sa vivacité toujours de si bon augure dans les enfants et quil ne sagit que de régler par létude et lexercice ne sera plus quune pénétration clairvoyante sans laquelle on fait peu de progrès dans les sciences such is the chaos and the continuous quick succession of our ideas they drive each other away even as one wave yields to another therefore if imagination does not as it were use one set of its muscles to maintain a kind of equilibrium with the fibres of the brain to keep its attention for a while upon an object that is on the point of disappearing and to prevent itself from contemplating prematurely another object—unless the imagination does all this it will never be worthy of the fine name of judgment it will express vividly what it has perceived in the same fashion it will create orators musicians painters poets but never a single philosopher on the contrary if the imagination be trained from childhood to bridle itself and to keep from being carried away by its own impetuosity—an impetuosity which creates only brilliant enthusiasts—and to check to restrain its ideas to examine      them in all their aspects in order to see all sides of an object then the imagination ready in judgment will comprehend the greatest possible sphere of objects through reasoning and its vivacity always so good a sign in children and only needing to be regulated by study and training will be only a farseeing insight without which little progress can be made in the sciences tels sont les simples fondements sur lesquels a été bati lédifice de la logique la nature les avait jetés pour tout le genre humain mais les uns en ont profité les autres en ont abusé such are the simple foundations upon which the edifice of logic has been reared nature has built these foundations for the whole human race but some have used them while others have abused them malgré toutes ces prérogatives de lhomme sur les animaux cest lui faire honneur que de le ranger     dans la même classe il est vrai que jusquà un certain âge il est plus animal queux parce quil apporte moins dinstinct en naissant quel est lanimal qui mourrait de faim au milieu dune rivière de lait lhomme seul semblable à ce vieux enfant dont un moderne parle daprès arnobe il ne connait ni les aliments qui lui sont propres ni leau qui peut le noyer ni le feu qui peut le réduire en poudre faites briller pour la première fois la lumière dune bougie aux yeux dun enfant il y portera machinalement le doigt comme pour savoir quel est le nouveau phénomène quil aperçoit cest à ses dépens quil en connaîtra le danger mais il ny sera pas repris mettezle encore avec un animal sur le bord dun précipice lui seul y tombera il se noie où lautre se sauve à la nage a quatorze ou quinze ans il entrevoit à peine les grands plaisirs qui lattendent dans la reproduction de son espèce déjà adolescent il ne sait pas trop comment sy prendre dans un jeu que la nature apprend si vite aux animaux il se cache comme sil était honteux davoir du plaisir et dêtre fait pour être heureux tandis que les animaux se font gloire dêtre cyniques sans éducation ils sont sans préjugés mais voyons encore ce chien et cet enfant qui ont tous deux perdu leur maître dans un grand chemin lenfant pleure il ne sait à quel saint se vouer le chien mieux servi par son odorat que lautre par sa raison laura bientôt trouvé in spite of all these advantages of man over animals it is doing him honor to place him in the same class for truly up to a certain age he is more of an animal than they since at birth he has less instinct what animal would die of hunger in the midst of a river of milk man alone like that child of olden time to whom a modern writer refers following arnobius   he knows neither the foods suitable for him nor the water that can drown him nor the fire that can reduce him to ashes light a wax candle for the first time under a childs eyes and he will mechanically put his fingers in the flame as if to find out what is the new thing that he sees it is at his own cost that he will learn of the danger but he will not be caught again or put the child with an animal on a precipice the child alone falls off he drowns where the animal would save itself by swimming at fourteen or fifteen years the child knows hardly anything of the great pleasures in store for him in the reproduction of his species when he is a youth he      does not know exactly how to behave in a game which nature teaches animals so quickly he hides himself as if he were ashamed of taking pleasure and of having been made to be happy while animals frankly glory in being cynics without education they are without prejudices for one more example let us observe a dog and a child who have lost their master on a highway the child cries and does not know to what saint to pray while the dog better helped by his sense of smell than the child by his reason soon finds his master la nature nous avait donc faits pour être au dessous des animaux ou du moins pour faire par là même mieux éclater les prodiges de léducation qui seule nous tire du niveau et nous élève enfin audessus deux mais accorderaton la même distinction     aux sourds aux aveuglesnés aux imbéciles aux fous aux hommes sauvages ou qui ont été élevés dans les bois avec les bêtes à ceux dont laffection hypocondriaque a perdu limagination enfin à toutes ces bêtes à figure humaine qui ne montrent que linstinct le plus grossier non tous ces hommes de corps et non desprit ne méritent pas une classe particulière thus nature made us to be lower than animals or at least to exhibit all the more because of that native inferiority the wonderful efficacy of education which alone raises us from the level of the animals and lifts us above them but shall we grant this same distinction to the deaf and to the blind to imbeciles madmen or savages or to those who have been brought up in the woods with animals to those who have lost their imagination through melancholia or in short to all those animals in human form who give evidence of only the rudest instinct no all these men of body but not of mind do not deserve to be classed by themselves nous navons pas dessein de nous dissimuler les objections quon peut faire en faveur de la distinction primitive de lhomme et des animaux contre notre sentiment il y a diton dans lhomme une loi naturelle une connaissance du bien et du mal qui na pas été gravée dans le cœur des animaux we do not intend to hide from ourselves the arguments that can be brought forward against our belief and in favor of a primitive distinction between men and animals some say that there is in man a natural law a knowledge of good and evil which has never been imprinted on the heart of animals mais cette objection ou plutôt cette assertion estelle fondée sur lexpérience sans laquelle un philosophe peut tout rejeter en avonsnous quelquune qui nous convainque que lhomme seul a été éclairé dun rayon refusé à tous les autres animaux sil ny en a point nous ne pouvons pas plus connaître par elle ce qui se passe dans eux et même dans les hommes que ne pas sentir ce qui affecte lintérieur de notre être nous savons que nous pensons et que nous avons des remords un sentiment intime ne nous force que trop den convenir mais pour juger des remords dautrui ce sentiment qui est dans nous est insuffisant cest pourquoi il en faut croire les autres hommes sur leur parole ou sur les signes sensibles et extérieurs que nous avons remarqués en nousmêmes lorsque nous éprouvions la même conscience et les mêmes tourments but is this objection or rather this assertion based on observation any assertion unfounded on observation may be rejected by a philosopher have we ever had a single experience which convinces      us that man alone has been enlightened by a ray denied all other animals if there is no such experience we can no more know what goes on in animals minds or even in the minds of other men than we can help feeling what affects the inner part of our own being we know that we think and feel remorse—an intimate feeling forces us to recognize this only too well but this feeling in us is insufficient to enable us to judge the remorse of others that is why we have to take others at their word or judge them by the sensible and external signs we have noticed in ourselves when we experienced the same accusations of conscience and the same torments mais pour décider si les animaux qui ne parlent point ont reçu la loi naturelle il faut sen rapporter     conséquemment à ces signes dont je viens de parler supposé quils existent les faits semblent le prouver le chien qui a mordu son maître qui lagaçait a paru sen repentir le moment suivant on la vu triste fâché nosant se montrer et savouer coupable par un air rampant et humilié lhistoire nous offre un exemple célèbre dun lion qui ne voulut pas déchirer un homme abandonné à sa fureur parce quil le reconnut pour son bienfaiteur quil serait à souhaiter que lhomme même montrât toujours la même reconnaissance pour les bienfaits et le même respect pour lhumanité on naurait plus à craindre les ingrats ni ces guerres qui sont le fléau du genre humain et les vrais bourreaux de la loi naturelle in order to decide whether animals which do not talk have received the natural law we must therefore have recourse to those signs to which i have just referred if any such exist the facts seem to prove it a dog that bit the master who was teasing it seemed to repent a minute afterwards it looked sad ashamed afraid to show itself and seemed to confess its guilt by a crouching and downcast air history offers us a famous example of a lion which would not devour a man abandoned to its fury because it recognized him as its benefactor how much might it be wished that man himself always showed the same gratitude for kindnesses and the same respect for humanity then we should no longer fear either ungrateful wretches or wars which are the plague of the human race and the real executioners of the natural law mais un être à qui la nature a donné un instinct si précoce si éclairé qui juge combine raisonne et délibère autant que sétend et le lui permet la sphère de son activité un être qui sattache par les bienfaits qui se détache par les mauvais traitements et va essayer un meilleur maître un être dune structure semblable à la nôtre qui fait les mêmes opérations qui a les mêmes passions les mêmes douleurs les mêmes plaisirs plus ou moins vifs suivant lempire de limagination et la délicatesse des nerfs un tel être enfin ne montretil pas clairement quil sent ses torts et les nôtres quil connait le bien et le mal et en un mot a conscience de ce quil fait son âme qui marque comme la nôtre les mêmes joies les mêmes mortifications les mêmes déconcertements seraitelle sans aucune répugnance à la vue de son semblable déchiré ou après lavoir luimême impitoyablement mis en pièces cela posé le don précieux dont il sagit naurait point été     refusé aux animaux car puisquils nous offrent des signes évidents de leur repentir comme de leur intelligence quy atil dabsurde à penser que des êtres des machines presque aussi parfaites que nous soient comme nous faites pour penser et pour sentir la nature but a being to which nature has given such a precocious and enlightened instinct which judges combines reasons and deliberates as far as the      sphere of its activity extends and permits a being which feels attachment because of benefits received and which leaving a master who treats it badly goes to seek a better one a being with a structure like ours which performs the same acts has the same passions the same griefs the same pleasures more or less intense according to the sway of the imagination and the delicacy of the nervous organization—does not such a being show clearly that it knows its faults and ours understands good and evil and in a word has consciousness of what it does would its soul which feels the same joys the same mortification and the same discomfiture which we feel remain utterly unmoved by disgust when it saw a fellowcreature torn to bits or when it had itself pitilessly dismembered this fellowcreature if this be granted it follows that the precious gift now in question would not have been denied to animals for since they show us sure signs of repentance as well as of intelligence what is there absurd in thinking that beings almost as perfect machines as ourselves are like us made to understand and to feel nature quon ne mobjecte point que les animaux sont pour la plupart des êtres féroces qui ne sont pas capables de sentir les maux quils font car tous les hommes distinguentils mieux les vices et les vertus il est dans notre espèce de la férocité comme dans la leur les hommes qui sont dans la barbare habitude denfreindre la loi naturelle nen sont pas si tourmentés que ceux qui la transgressent pour la première fois et que la force de lexemple na point endurcis il en est de même des animaux comme des hommes les uns et les autres peuvent être plus ou moins féroces par tempérament et ils le deviennent encore plus avec ceux qui le sont mais un animal doux pacifique qui vit avec dautres animaux semblables et daliments doux sera ennemi du sang et du carnage il rougira intérieurement de lavoir versé avec cette différence peutêtre que comme chez eux tout est immolé aux besoins aux plaisirs et aux commodités de la vie dont ils jouissent plus que nous leurs remords ne semblent pas devoir être si vifs que les nôtres parceque nous ne sommes pas dans la même nécessité queux la coutume émousse et peutêtre étouffe les remords comme les plaisirs let no one object that animals for the most part are savage beasts incapable of realizing the evil that they do for do all men discriminate better between vice and virtue there is ferocity in our species as well as in theirs men who are in the barbarous habit of breaking the natural law are not tormented as much by it as those who transgress it for the first time and who have not been hardened by the force of habit the same thing is true of animals as of men—both may be more or less ferocious in temperament and both become      more so by living with others like themselves but a gentle and peaceful animal which lives among other animals of the same disposition and of gentle nurture will be an enemy of blood and carnage it will blush internally at having shed blood there is perhaps this difference that since among animals everything is sacrificed to their needs to their pleasures to the necessities of life which they enjoy more than we their remorse apparently should not be as keen as ours because we are not in the same state of necessity as they custom perhaps dulls and perhaps stifles remorse as well as pleasures mais je veux pour un moment supposer que je me trompe et quil nest pas juste que presque tout lunivers ait tort à ce sujet tandis que jaurais seul raison jaccorde que les animaux même les plus     excellents ne connaissent pas la distinction du bien et du mal moral quils nont aucune mémoire des attentions quon a eues pour eux du bien quon leur a fait aucun sentiment de leurs propres vertus que ce lion par exemple dont jai parlé après tant dautres ne se souvienne pas de navoir pas voulu ravir la vie à cet homme qui fut livré à sa furie dans un spectacle plus inhumain que tous les lions les tigres et les ours tandis que nos compatriotes se battent suisses contre suisses frères contre frères se reconnaissent senchaînent ou se tuent sans remords parce quun prince paie leurs meurtres je suppose enfin que la loi naturelle nait pas été donnée aux animaux quelles en seront les conséquences lhomme nest pas pétri dun limon plus précieux la nature na employé quune seule et même pâte dont elle a seulement varié les levains si donc lanimal ne se repent pas davoir violé le sentiment intérieur dont je parle ou plutôt sil en est absolument privé il faut nécessairement que lhomme soit dans le même cas moyennant quoi adieu la loi naturelle et tous ces beaux traités quon a publiés sur elle tout le règne animal en serait généralement dépourvû mais réciproquement si lhomme ne peut se dispenser de convenir quil distingue toujours lorsque la santé le laisse jouïr de luimême ceux qui ont de la probité de lhumanité de la vertu de ceux qui ne sont ni humains ni vertueux ni honnêtes gens quil est facile de distinguer ce qui est vice ou vertu par lunique plaisir ou la propre répugnance qui en sont comme les effets naturels il sensuit que les animaux formés de la même matière à laquelle il na peutêtre manqué quun degré de fermentation pour égaler les     hommes en tout doivent participer aux mêmes prérogatives de lanimalité et quainsi il nest point dâme ou de substance sensitive sans remords la réflexion suivante va fortifier cellesci but i will suppose for a moment that i am utterly mistaken in concluding that almost all the world holds a wrong opinion on this subject while i alone am right i will grant that animals even the best of them do not know the difference between moral good and evil that they have no recollection of the trouble taken for them of the kindness done them no realization of their own virtues i will suppose for instance that this lion to which i like so many others have referred does not remember at all that it refused to kill the man abandoned to its fury in a combat more inhuman than one could find among lions tigers and bears put together for our compatriots fight swiss against swiss brother against brother recognize each other and yet capture and kill each other without remorse because a prince pays for the murder i suppose in short that the natural law has not been given animals what will be the consequences of this supposition man is not moulded from a costlier clay nature has used but one dough and has merely varied the leaven therefore if animals do not repent for having violated      this inmost feeling which i am discussing or rather if they absolutely lack it man must necessarily be in the same condition farewell then to the natural law and all the fine treatises published about it the whole animal kingdom in general would be deprived of it but conversely if man can not dispense with the belief that when health permits him to be himself he always distinguishes the upright humane and virtuous from those who are not humane virtuous nor honorable that it is easy to tell vice from virtue by the unique pleasure and the peculiar repugnance that seem to be their natural effects it follows that animals composed of the same matter lacking perhaps only one degree of fermentation to make it exactly like mans must share the same prerogatives of animal nature and that thus there exists no soul or sensitive substance without remorse   the following consideration will reinforce these observations on ne peut détruire la loi naturelle lempreinte en est si forte dans tous les animaux que je ne doute nullement que les plus sauvages et les plus féroces naient quelques moments de repentir je crois que la fille sauvage de châlons en champagne aura porté la peine de son crime sil est vrai quelle ait mangé sa sœur je pense la même chose de tous ceux qui commettent des crimes même involontaires ou de tempérament de gaston dorléans qui ne pouvait sempêcher de voler de certaine femme qui fut sujette au même vice dans la grossesse et dont ses enfants héritèrent de celle qui dans le même état mangea son mari de cette autre qui égorgeait les enfants salait leurs corps et en mangeait tous les jours comme du petit salé de cette fille de voleur anthropophage qui la devint à    ans quoiquayant perdu père et mère à lâge dun an elle eût été élevée par dhonnêtes gens pour ne rien dire de tant dautres exemples dont nos observateurs sont remplis et qui prouvent tous quil est mille vices et vertus héréditaires qui passent des parents aux enfants comme ceux de la nourrice à ceux quelle allaite je dis donc et jaccorde que ces malheureux ne sentent pas pour la plupart sur le champ lénormité de leur action la boulimie par exemple ou la faim canine peut éteindre tout sentiment cest une manie destomac quon est forcé de satisfaire mais revenues à ellesmêmes et comme désenivrées quels remords pour ces femmes qui se rappellent le meurtre quelles ont     commis dans ce quelles avaient de plus cher quelle punition dun mal involontaire auquel elles nont pu résister dont elles nont eu aucune conscience cependant ce nest point assez apparemment pour les juges parmi les femmes dont je parle lune fut rouée et brûlée lautre enterrée vive je sens tout ce que demande lintérêt de la société mais il serait sans doute à souhaiter quil ny eût pour juges que dexcellents médecins eux seuls pourraient distinguer le criminel innocent du coupable si la raison est esclave dun sens dépravé ou en fureur comment peutelle le gouverner it is impossible to destroy the natural law the impress of it on all animals is so strong that i have no doubt that the wildest and most savage have some moments of repentance i believe that that cruel maid of chalons in champagne must have sorrowed for her crime if she really ate her sister i think that the same thing is true of all those who commit crimes even involuntary or temperamental crimes true of gaston of orleans who could not help stealing of a certain woman who was subject to the same crime when pregnant and whose children inherited it of the woman who in the same condition ate her husband of that other woman who killed her children salted their bodies and ate a piece of them every day as a little relish of that      daughter of a thief and cannibal who at twelve years followed in his steps although she had been orphaned when she was a year old and had been brought up by honest people to say nothing of many other examples of which the records of our observers are full all of them proving that there are a thousand hereditary vices and virtues which are transmitted from parents to children as those of the foster mother pass to the children she nurses now i believe and admit that these wretches do not for the most part feel at the time the enormity of their actions bulimia or canine hunger for example can stifle all feeling it is a mania of the stomach that one is compelled to satisfy but what remorse must be in store for those women when they come to themselves and grow sober and remember the crimes they have committed against those they held most dear what a punishment for an involuntary crime which they could not resist of which they had no consciousness whatever however this is apparently not enough for the judges for of these women of whom i tell one was cruelly beaten and burned and another was buried alive i realize all that is demanded by the interest of society but doubtless it is much to be wished that excellent physicians might be the only judges they alone could tell the innocent criminal from the guilty if reason is the slave of a depraved or mad desire how can it control the desire mais si le crime porte avec soi sa propre punition plus ou moins cruelle si la plus longue et la plus barbare habitude ne peut toutàfait arracher le repentir des cœurs les plus inhumains sils sont déchirés par la mémoire même de leurs actions pour quoi effrayer limagination des esprits faibles par un enfer par des spectres et des précipices de feu moins réels encore que ceux de pascal  questil besoin de recourir à des fables comme un pape de bonne foi la dit luimême pour tourmenter les malheureux mêmes quon fait périr parce quon ne les trouve pas assez punis par leur propre conscience qui est leur premier bourreau ce nest pas que je veuille dire que tous les criminels soient injustement     punis je prétends seulement que ceux dont la volonté est dépravée et la conscience éteinte le sont assez par leurs remords quand ils reviennent à euxmêmes remords jose encore le dire dont la nature aurait dû en ce cas ce me semble délivrer des malheureux entraînés par une fatale nécessité but if crime carries with it its own more or less cruel punishment if the most continued and most barbarous habit can not entirely blot out repentance in the crudest hearts if criminals are lacerated by the very memory of their deeds why should we    0 frighten the imagination of weak minds by a hell by specters and by precipices of fire even less real than those of pascal  why must we have recourse to fables as an honest pope once said himself to torment even the unhappy wretches who are executed because we do not think that they are sufficiently punished by their own conscience their first executioner i do not mean to say that all criminals are unjustly punished i only maintain that those whose will is depraved and whose conscience is extinguished are punished enough by their remorse when they come to themselves a remorse i venture to assert from which nature should in this case have delivered unhappy souls dragged on by a fatal necessity les criminels les méchants les ingrats ceux enfin que ne sentent pas la nature tyrans malheureux et indignes du jour ont beau se faire un cruel plaisir de leur barbarie il est des moments calmes et de réflexion où la conscience vengeresse sélève dépose contreux et les condamne à être presque sans cesse déchirés de ses propres mains qui tourmente les hommes est tourmenté par luimême et les maux quil sentira seront la juste mesure de ceux quil aura faits criminals scoundrels ingrates those in short without natural feelings unhappy tyrants who are unworthy of life in vain take a cruel pleasure in their barbarity for there are calm moments of reflection in which the avenging conscience arises testifies against them and condemns them to be almost ceaselessly torn to pieces at their own hands whoever torments men is tormented by himself and the sufferings that he will experience will be the just measure of those that he has inflicted dun autre côté il y a tant de plaisir à faire du bien à sentir à reconnaître celui quon reçoit tant de contentement à pratiquer la vertu à être doux humain tendre charitable compatissant et généreux ce seul mot renferme toutes les vertus que je tiens pour assez puni quiconque a le malheur de nêtre pas né vertueux on the other hand there is so much pleasure in      doing good in recognizing and appreciating what one receives so much satisfaction in practising virtue in being gentle humane kind charitable compassionate and generous for this one word includes all the virtues that i consider as sufficiently punished any one who is unfortunate enough not to have been born virtuous nous navons pas originairement été faits pour être savants cest peutêtre par une espèce dabus de nos facultés organiques que nous le sommes devenus et cela à la charge de letat qui nourrit une multitude de fainéants que la vanité a decorés du nom de philosophes la nature nous a tous créés uniquement pour être heureux oui tous depuis le ver qui rampe jusquà laigle qui se perd dans la nue cest pourquoi elle a donné à tous les animaux quelque portion de la loi naturelle portion plus   0 ou moins exquise selon que le comportent les organes bien conditionnés de chaque animal we were not originally made to be learned we have become so perhaps by a sort of abuse of our organic faculties and at the expense of the state which nourishes a host of sluggards whom vanity has adorned with the name of philosophers nature has created us all solely to be happy  —yes all of us from the crawling worm to the eagle lost in the clouds for this cause she has given all animals some share of natural law a share greater or less according to the needs of each animals organs when in normal condition a présent comment définironsnous la loi naturelle cest un sentiment qui nous apprend ce que nous ne devons pas faire parce que nous ne voudrions pas quon nous le fît oseraisje ajouter à cette idée commune quil me semble que ce sentiment nest quune espèce de crainte ou de frayeur aussi salutaire à lespèce qua lindividu car peutêtre ne respectonsnous la bourse et la vie des autres que pour nous conserver nos biens notre honneur et nousmêmes semblables à ces ixions du christianisme qui naiment dieu et nembrassent tant de chimériques vertus que parce quils craignent lenfer now how shall we define natural law it is a feeling that teaches us what we should not do because we would not wish it to be done to us should i dare add to this common idea that this feeling seems to me but a kind of fear or dread as salutary to the race as to the individual for may it not be true that we respect the purse and life of others only to save our own possessions our honor and ourselves like those ixions of christianity   who love god and embrace so many fantastic virtues merely because they are afraid of hell vous voyez que la loi naturelle nest quun sentiment intime qui appartient encore à limagination comme tous les autres parmi lesquels on compte la pensée par conséquent elle ne suppose évidemment ni éducation ni révélation ni législateur à moins quon ne veuille la confondre avec les lois civiles à la manière ridicule des théologiens you see that natural law is but an intimate feeling that like all other feelings thought included belongs also to imagination evidently therefore natural law does not presuppose education revelation nor legislator—provided one does not propose      to confuse natural law with civil laws in the ridiculous fashion of the theologians les armes du fanatisme peuvent détruire ceux qui soutiennent ces vérités mais elles ne détruiront jamais ces vérités mêmes the arms of fanaticism may destroy those who support these truths but they will never destroy the truths themselves ce nest pas que je révoque en doute lexistence dun etre suprême il me semble au contraire que le plus grand degré de probabilité est pour elle mais comme cette existence ne prouve pas plus la nécessité dun culte que toute autre cest une vérité théorique qui nest guère dusage dans la pratique de sorte que comme on peut dire daprès tant dexpériences que la religion ne suppose pas lexacte     probité les mêmes raisons autorisent à penser que lathéisme ne lexclut pas i do not mean to call in question the existence of a supreme being on the contrary it seems to me that the greatest degree of probability is in favor of this belief but since the existence of this being goes no further than that of any other toward proving the need of worship it is a theoretic truth with very little practical value therefore since we may say after such long experience that religion does not imply exact honesty we are authorized by the same reasons to think that atheism does not exclude it qui sait dailleurs si la raison de lexistence de lhomme ne serait pas dans son existence même peutêtre atil été jeté au hasard sur un point de la surface de la terre sans quon puisse savoir ni comment ni pourquoi mais seulement quil doit vivre et mourir semblable à ces champignons qui paraissent dun jour à lautre ou à ces fleurs qui bordent les fossés et couvrent les murailles furthermore who can be sure that the reason for mans existence is not simply the fact that he exists 0 perhaps he was thrown by chance on some spot on the earths surface nobody knows how nor why but simply that he must live and die like the mushrooms which appear from day to day or like those flowers which border the ditches and cover the walls ne nous perdons point dans linfini nous ne sommes pas faits pour en avoir la moindre idée il nous est absolument impossible de remonter à lorigine des choses il est égal dailleurs pour notre repos que la matière soit éternelle ou quelle ait été créée quil y ait un dieu ou quil ny en ait pas quelle folie de tant se tourmenter pour ce quil est impossible de connaître et ce qui ne nous rendrait pas plus heureux quand nous en viendrions à bout let us not lose ourselves in the infinite for we are not made to have the least idea thereof and are absolutely unable to get back to the origin of things besides it does not matter for our peace of mind whether matter be eternal or have been created whether there be or be not a god how foolish to torment ourselves so much about things which we can not know and which would not make us any happier even were we to gain knowledge about them     mais diton lisez tous les ouvrages des fénelon des nieuventit des abadie des derham des raï etc eh bien que mapprendrontils ou plutôt que montils appris ce ne sont que dennuyeuses répétitions décrivains zélés dont lun najoute à lautre quun verbiage plus propres à fortifier quà saper les fondements de lathéisme le volume des preuves quon tire du spectacle de la nature ne leur donne pas plus de force la structure seule dun doigt dune oreille dun œil une observation de malpighi prouve tout et sans doute beaucoup mieux que descartes et malebranche ou tout le reste ne prouve rien les déistes et les chrétiens mêmes devraient donc se contenter de faire observer     que dans tout le règne animal les mêmes vues sont exécutées par une infinité de divers moyens tous cependant exactement géométriques car de quelles plus fortes armes pourraiton terrasser les athées il est vrai que si ma raison ne me trompe pas lhomme et tout lunivers semblent avoir été destinés à cette unité de vues le soleil lair leau lorganisation la forme des corps tout est arrangé dans lœil comme dans un miroir qui présente fidèlement à limagination les objets qui y sont peints suivant les lois quexige cette infinie variété de corps qui servent à la vision dans loreille nous trouvons partout une diversité frappante sans que cette diverse fabrique de lhomme des animaux des oiseaux des poissons produise différents usages toutes les oreilles sont si mathématiquement faites quelles tendent également au seul et même but qui est dentendre le hasard demande le déiste seraitil donc assez grand géomètre pour varier ainsi à son gré les ouvrages dont on le suppose auteur sans que tant de diversité pût lempêcher datteindre la même fin il objecte encore ces parties évidemment contenues dans lanimal pour de futurs usages le papillon dans la chenille lhomme dans le ver spermatique un polype entier dans chacune de ses parties la valvule du trou ovale le poumon dans le fœtus les dents dans leurs alvéoles les os dans les fluides qui sen détachent et se durcissent dune manière incompréhensible et comme les partisans de ce système loin de rien négliger pour le faire valoir ne se lassent jamais daccumuler preuves sur preuves ils veulent profiter de tout et de la faiblesse même de lesprit en certain cas voyez disentils les spinoza les vanini     les desbarreaux les boindin apôtres qui font plus dhonneur que de tort au déisme la durée de la santé de ces derniers a été la mesure de leur incrédulité et il est rare en effet ajoutentils quon nabjure pas lathéisme dès que les passions se sont affaiblies avec le corps qui en est linstrument but some will say read all such works as those of fénelon   of nieuwentyt   of abadie   of derham   of rais   and the rest well what will they teach me or rather what have they taught me they are only tiresome repetitions of zealous writers one of whom adds to the other only verbiage more likely to strengthen than to undermine the foundations of atheism the number of the evidences drawn from the spectacle of nature does not give these evidences any more force either the mere structure of a finger of an ear of an eye a single observation of malpighi   proves all and doubtless much better than descartes and malebranche proved it or all the other evidences prove nothing deists   and even christians should therefore be content to point out that throughout the animal kingdom the same aims are pursued and accomplished by an infinite number of different mechanisms all of them however exactly geometrical for what stronger weapons could there be with which to overthrow atheists it is true that if my reason does not deceive me man and the whole universe seem to have been designed for this unity of aim the sun air water the organism the shape of bodies—everything is brought to a focus in the eye as in a mirror that faithfully presents to the imagination all the objects reflected in it in accordance with the laws required by the infinite variety of bodies which take part in vision in ears we find everywhere a striking variety and yet the difference of structure in men animals birds and fishes does not produce different uses all ears are so mathematically made that they tend equally to one and the same end namely hearing but would      chance the deist asks be a great enough geometrician to vary thus at pleasure the works of which she is supposed to be the author without being hindered by so great a diversity from gaining the same end again the deist will bring forward as a difficulty those parts of the animal that are clearly contained in it for future use the butterfly in the caterpillar man in the sperm a whole polyp in each of its parts the valvule in the oval orifice the lungs in the foetus the teeth in their sockets the bones in the fluid from which they detach themselves and in an incomprehensible manner harden and since the partisans of this theory far from neglecting anything that would strengthen it never tire of piling up proof upon proof they are willing to avail themselves of everything even of the weakness of the mind in certain cases look they say at men like spinoza vanini   desbarreau   and boindin 0 apostles who honor deism more than they harm it the duration of their health was the measure of their unbelief and one rarely fails they add to renounce atheism when the passions with their instrument the body have grown weak voilà certainement tout ce quon peut dire de plus favorable à lexistence dun dieu quoique le dernier argument soit frivole en ce que ces conversions sont courtes lesprit reprenant presque toujours ses anciennes opinions et se conduisant en conséquence dès quil a recouvré ou plutôt retrouvé ses forces dans celles du corps en voilà du moins beaucoup plus que nen dit le médecin diderot dans ses pensées philosophiques sublime ouvrage qui ne convaincra pas un athée que répondre en effet à un homme qui dit nous ne connaissons point la nature des causes cachées dans son sein pourraient avoir tout produit voyez à votre tour le polype de trembley ne contientil pas en soi les causes qui donnent lieu à sa régénération quelle absurdité y auraitil donc à penser quil est des causes physiques pour lesquelles tout a été fait et auxquelles toute la chaîne de ce vaste univers est si nécessairement liée et assujettie que rien de ce qui arrive ne pouvait pas ne pas arriver des causes dont lignorance absolument invincible nous a fait recourir à un dieu qui nest pas même un être de raison suivant certains ainsi détruire le hasard ce nest pas prouver lexistence dun etre supreme puisquil peut y avoir autre chose qui ne serait ni hasard ni dieu je veux dire la nature dont létude par conséquent ne peut faire que des     incrédules comme le prouve la façon de penser de tous ses plus heureux scrutateurs that is certainly the most that can be said in favor of the existence of god although the last argument is frivolous in that these conversions are short and the mind almost always regains its former opinions and acts accordingly as soon as it has regained or rather rediscovered its strength in that of the body that is at least much more than was said by the physician diderot   in his pensées philosophiques a sublime work that will not convince a single atheist what reply can in truth be      made to a man who says we do not know nature causes hidden in her breast might have produced everything in your turn observe the polyp of trembley   does it not contain in itself the causes which bring about regeneration why then would it be absurd to think that there are physical causes by reason of which everything has been made and to which the whole chain of this vast universe is so necessarily bound and held that nothing which happens could have failed to happen  —causes of which we are so invincibly ignorant that we have had recourse to a god who as some aver is not so much as a logical entity thus to destroy chance is not to prove the existence of a supreme being since there may be some other thing which is neither chance nor god—i mean nature it follows that the study of nature can make only unbelievers and the way of thinking of all its more successful investigators proves this le poids de lunivers nébranle donc pas un véritable athée loin de lécraser et tous ces indices mille et mille fois rebattus dun créateur indices quon met fort audessus de la façon de penser dans nos semblables ne sont évidents quelque loin quon pousse cet argument que pour les antipyrrhoniens ou pour ceux qui ont assez de confiance dans leur raison pour croire pouvoir juger sur certaines apparences auxquelles comme vous voyez les athées peuvent en opposer dautres peutêtre aussi fortes et absolument contraires car si nous écoutons encore les naturalistes ils nous diront que les mêmes causes qui dans les mains dun chimiste et par le hasard de divers mélanges ont fait le premier miroir dans celles de la nature ont fait leau pure qui en sert à la simple bergère que le mouvement qui conserve le monde a pu le créer que chaque corps a pris la place que sa nature lui a assignée que lair a dû entourer la terre par la même raison que le fer et les autres métaux sont louvrage de ses entrailles que le soleil est une production aussi naturelle que celle de lélectricité quil na pas plus été fait pour échauffer la terre et tous ses habitants quil brûle quelquefois que la pluie pour faire pousser les grains quelle gâte souvent que le miroir et leau nont pas plus été faits pour quon pût sy regarder que tous les corps polis qui ont la même propriété que lœil est à la vérité une espèce de trumeau dans lequel lâme peut contempler limage des objets tels quils lui sont représentés par ces corps mais quil nest pas démontré que cet organe ait été réellement fait exprès pour cette contemplation     ni exprès placé dans lorbite quenfin il se pourrait bien faire que lucrèce le médecin lamy et tous les epicuriens anciens et modernes eûssent raison lorsquils avancent que lœil ne voit que par ce quil se trouve organisé et placé comme il lest que posées une fois les mêmes règles de mouvement que suit la nature dans la génération et le développement des corps il nétait pas possible que ce merveilleux organe fût organisé et placé autrement the weight of the universe therefore far from crushing a real atheist does not even shake him all these evidences of a creator repeated thousands and thousands of times evidences that are placed far above the comprehension of men like us are selfevident however far one push the argument only to the antipyrrhonians   or to those who have enough confidence in their reason to believe themselves capable of judging on the basis of certain phenomena against which as you see the atheists can urge others perhaps equally strong and absolutely opposed for if we listen to the naturalists again they will tell us that the very causes which in a chemists hands by a chance combination made the first mirror in the hands of nature made the      pure water the mirror of the simple shepherdess that the motion which keeps the world going could have created it that each body has taken the place assigned to it by its own nature that the air must have surrounded the earth and that iron and the other metals are produced by internal motions of the earth for one and the same reason that the sun is as much a natural product as electricity that it was not made to warm the earth and its inhabitants whom it sometimes burns any more than the rain was made to make the seeds grow which it often spoils that the mirror and the water were no more made for people to see themselves in than were all other polished bodies with this same property that the eye is in truth a kind of glass in which the soul can contemplate the image of objects as they are presented to it by these bodies but that it is not proved that this organ was really made expressly for this contemplation nor purposely placed in its socket and in short that it may well be that lucretius   the physician lamy   and all epicureans both ancient and modern were right when they suggested that the eye sees only because it is formed and placed as it is   and that given once for all the same rules of motion followed by nature in the generation and development of bodies this marvelous organ could not have been formed and placed differently tel est le pour et le contre et labrégé des grandes raisons qui partageront éternellement les philosophes je ne prends aucun parti non nostrum inter vos tantas componere lites such is the pro and the con and the summary of those fine arguments that will eternally divide the philosophers i do not take either side non nostrum inter vos tantas componere lites   cest ce que je disais à un français de mes amis aussi franc pyrrhonien que moi homme de beaucoup de mérite et digne dun meilleur sort il me fit à ce sujet une réponse fort singulière il est vrai me ditil que le pour et le contre ne doit point inquiéter lâme dun philosophe qui voit que rien nest démontré avec assez de clarté pour forcer son consentement et même que les idées indicatives qui soffrent dun côté sont ausitôt détruites par celles qui se montrent de lautre cependant repritil lunivers ne sera jamais heureux à moins quil ne soit athée voici quelles étaient les raisons de cet abominable homme si lathéisme disaitil était généralement répandu toutes les branches de la religion seraient alors détruites et coupées par la racine plus de guerres théologiques plus de soldats de religion soldats terribles la nature infectée dun poison sacré reprendrait ses droits et sa pureté sourds à toute autre voix les mortels tranquilles ne suivraient que les conseils spontanés     de leur propre individu les seuls quon ne méprise point impunément et qui peuvent seuls nous conduire au bonheur par les agréables sentiers de la vertu this is what i said to one of my friends a frenchman      as frank a pyrronian as i a man of much merit and worthy of a better fate he gave me a very singular answer in regard to the matter it is true he told me that the pro and con should not disturb at all the soul of a philosopher who sees that nothing is proved with clearness enough to force his consent and that the arguments offered on one side are neutralized by those of the other however he continued the universe will never be happy unless it is atheistic   here are this wretchs reasons if atheism said he were generally accepted all the forms of religion would then be destroyed and cut off at the roots no more theological wars no more soldiers of religion—such terrible soldiers nature infected with a sacred poison would regain its rights and its purity deaf to all other voices tranquil mortals would follow only the spontaneous dictates of their own being the only commands which can never be despised with impunity and which alone can lead us to happiness through the pleasant paths of virtue telle est la loi naturelle quiconque en est rigide observateur est honnête homme et mérite la confiance de tout le genre humain quiconque ne la suit pas scrupuleusement a beau affecter les spécieux dehors dune autre religion est un fourbe ou un hypocrite dont je me défie such is natural law whoever rigidly observes it is a good man and deserves the confidence of all the human race whoever fails to follow it scrupulously affects in vain the specious exterior of another religion he is a scamp or a hypocrite whom i distrust après cela quun vain peuple pense différemment quil ose affirmer quil y va de la probité même à ne pas croire la révélation quil faut en un mot un autre religion que celle de la nature quelle quelle soit quelle misère quelle pitié et la bonne opinion que chacun nous donne de celle quil a embrassée nous ne briguons point ici le suffrage du vulgaire qui dresse dans son cœur des autels à la superstition est né pour adorer des idoles et non pour sentir la vertu after this let a vain people think otherwise let them dare affirm that even probity is at stake in not believing in revelation in a word that another religion than that of nature is necessary whatever it may be such an assertion is wretched and pitiable and so is the good opinion which each one gives us of the religion he has embraced we do      not seek here the votes of the crowd whoever raises in his heart altars to superstition is born to worship idols and not to thrill to virtue mais puisque toutes les facultés de lâme dépendent tellement de la propre organisation du cerveau et de tout le corps quelles ne sont visiblement que cette organisation même voilà une machine bien éclairée car enfin quand lhomme seul aurait reçu en partage la loi naturelle en seraitil moins une machine des roues quelques ressorts de plus que dans les animaux les plus parfaits le cerveau proportionnellement plus proche du cœur et recevant aussi plus de sang la même raison donnée que saisje enfin des causes inconnues produiraient toujours cette conscience délicate si facile à blesser ces remords qui ne sont pas plus étrangers à la matière que la pensée et en un mot toute la différence quon suppose ici lorganisation suffiraitelle donc     a tout oui encore une fois puisque la pensée se développe visiblement avec les organes pourquoi la matière dont ils sont faits ne seraitelle pas aussi susceptible de remords quand une fois elle a acquis avec le temps la faculté de sentir but since all the faculties of the soul depend to such a degree on the proper organization of the brain and of the whole body that apparently they are but this organization itself the soul is clearly an enlightened machine for finally even if man alone had received a share of natural law would he be any less a machine for that a few more wheels a few more springs than in the most perfect animals the brain proportionally nearer the heart and for this very reason receiving more blood—any one of a number of unknown causes might always produce this delicate conscience so easily wounded this remorse which is no more foreign to matter than to thought and in a word all the differences that are supposed to exist here could the organism then suffice for everything once more yes since thought visibly develops with our organs why should not the matter of which they are composed be susceptible of remorse also when once it has acquired with time the faculty of feeling lâme nest donc quun vain terme dont on na point didée et dont un bon esprit ne doit se servir que pour nommer la partie qui pense en nous posé le moindre principe de mouvement les corps animés auront tout ce quil leur faut pour se mouvoir sentir penser se repentir et se conduire en un mot dans le physique et dans le moral qui en dépend the soul is therefore but an empty word of which no one has any idea and which an enlightened man should use only to signify the part in us that thinks 0 given the least principle of motion animated bodies will have all that is necessary for moving feeling thinking repenting or in a word for conducting themselves in the physical realm and in the moral realm which depends upon it nous ne supposons rien ceux qui croiraient que toutes les difficultés ne seraient pas encore levées vont trouver des expériences qui achèveront de les satisfaire yet we take nothing for granted those who perhaps think that all the difficulties have not yet been      removed shall now read of experiments that will completely satisfy them   toutes les chairs des animaux palpitent après la mort dautant plus longtemps que lanimal est plus froid et transpire moins les tortues les lézards les serpents etc en font foi   the flesh of all animals palpitates after death this palpitation continues longer the more cold blooded the animal is and the less it perspires tortoises lizards serpents etc are evidence of this   les muscles séparés du corps se retirent lorsquon les pique   muscles separated from the body contract when they are stimulated   les entrailles conservent longtemps leur mouvement péristaltique ou vermiculaire   the intestines keep up their peristaltic or vermicular motion for a long time   une simple injection deau chaude ranime le cœur et les muscles suivant cowper   according to cowper   a simple injection of hot water reanimates the heart and the muscles   le cœur de la grenouille surtout exposé au soleil encore mieux sur une table ou une assiette chaude se remue pendant une heure et plus après avoir été arraché du corps le mouvement sembletil perdu sans ressource il ny a quà piquer le cœur et ce muscle creux bat encore harvey a fait la même observation sur les crapauds   a frogs heart moves for an hour or more after it has been removed from the body especially when exposed to the sun or better still when placed on a hot table or chair if this movement seems totally lost one has only to stimulate the heart and that hollow muscle beats again harvey   made this same observation on toads   bacon de verulam dans son traité sylvasylvarum     parle dun homme convaincu de trahison quon ouvrit vivant et dont le cœur jeté dans leau chaude sauta à plusieurs reprises toujours moins haut à la distance perpendiculaire de   pieds   bacon of verulam   in his treatise sylva sylvarum cites the case of a man convicted of treason who was opened alive and whose heart thrown into hot water leaped several times each time less high to the perpendicular height of two feet   prenez un petit poulet encore dans lœuf arrachez lui le cœur vous observerez les mêmes phénomènes avec à peu près les mêmes circonstances la seule chaleur de lhaleine ranime un animal prêt à périr dans la machine pneumatique   take a tiny chicken still in the egg cut out the heart and you will observe the same phenomena as before under almost the same conditions the warmth of the breath alone reanimates an animal about to perish in the air pump les mêmes expériences que nous devons à boyle et à sténon se font dans les pigeons dans les chiens dans les lapins dont les morceaux de cœur se remuent comme les cœurs entiers on voit le même mouvement dans les pattes de taupe arrachées the same experiments which we owe to boyle   and to sténon   are made on pigeons dogs and rabbits pieces of their hearts beat as their whole    0 hearts would the same movements can be seen in paws that have been cut off from moles   la chenille les vers laraignée la mouche languille offrent les mêmes choses à considérer et le mouvement des parties coupées augmente dans leau chaude à cause du feu quelle contient   the caterpillar the worm the spider the fly the eel—all exhibit the same phenomena and in hot water because of the fire it contains the movement of the detached parts increases   un soldat ivre emporta dun coup de sabre la tête dun coq dinde cet animal resta debout ensuite il marcha courut venant à rencontrer une muraille il se tourna battit des ailes en continuant de courir et tomba enfin etendu par terre tous les muscles de ce coq se remuaient encore voilà ce que jai vu et il est facile de voir à peu près ces phénomènes dans les petits chats ou chiens dont on a coupé la tête   a drunken soldier cut off with one stroke of his sabre an indian roosters head the animal remained standing then walked and ran happening to run against a wall it turned around beat its wings still running and finally fell down as it lay on the ground all the muscles of this rooster kept on moving that is what i saw myself and almost the same phenomena can easily be observed in kittens or puppies with their heads cut off  0 les polypes font plus que de se mouvoir après la section ils se reproduisent dans huit jours en autant danimaux quil y a de parties coupées jen suis fâché pour le système des naturalistes sur la génération ou plutôt jen suis bien aise car que cette découverte nous apprend bien à ne jamais rien     conclure de général même de toutes les expériences connues et les plus décisives  0 polyps do more than move after they have been cut in pieces in a week they regenerate to form as many animals as there are pieces i am sorry that these facts speak against the naturalists system of generation or rather i am very glad of it for let this discovery teach us never to reach a general conclusion even on the ground of all known and most decisive experiments voilà beaucoup plus de faits quil nen faut pour prouver dune manière incontestable que chaque petite fibre ou partie des corps organisés se meut par un principe qui lui est propre et dont laction ne dépend point des nerfs comme les mouvements volontaires puisque les mouvements en question sexercent sans que les parties qui les manifestent aient aucun commerce avec la circulation or si cette force se fait remarquer jusques dans des morceaux de fibres le cœur qui est un composé de fibres singulièrement entrelacées doit avoir la même propriété lhistoire de bacon nétait pas nécessaire pour me le persuader il métait facile den juger et par la parfaite analogie de la structure du cœur de lhomme et des animaux et par la masse même du premier dans laquelle ce mouvement ne se cache aux yeux que parce quil y est étouffé et enfin parce que tout est froid et affaissé dans les cadavres si les dissections se faisaient sur des criminels suppliciés dont les corps sont encore chauds on verrait dans leur cœur les mêmes mouvements quon observe dans les muscles du visage des gens décapités here we have many more facts than are needed to prove in an incontestable way that each tiny fibre or part of an organized body moves by a principle which belongs to it its activity unlike voluntary motions does not depend in any way on the nerves since the movements in question occur in parts of the body which have no connection with the circulation but if this force is manifested even in sections of fibres the heart which is a composite of peculiarly connected fibres must possess the same property i did not need bacons story to persuade      me of this it was easy for me to come to this conclusion both from the perfect analogy of the structure of the human heart with that of animals and also from the very bulk of the human heart in which this movement escapes our eyes only because it is smothered and finally because in corpses all the organs are cold and lifeless if executed criminals were dissected while their bodies are still warm we should probably see in their hearts the same movements that are observed in the facemuscles of those that have been beheaded tel est ce principe moteur des corps entiers ou des parties coupées en morceaux quil produit des mouvements non déréglés comme on la cru mais très réguliers et cela tant dans les animaux chauds et parfaits que dans ceux qui sont froids et imparfaits il ne reste donc aucune ressource à nos adversaires si ce nest que de nier mille et mille faits que chacun peut facilement vérifier the motive principle of the whole body and even of its parts cut in pieces is such that it produces not irregular movements as some have thought but very regular ones in warm blooded and perfect animals as well as in cold and imperfect ones no resource therefore remains open to our adversaries but to deny thousands and thousands of facts which every man can easily verify si on me demande à présent quel est le siège de   0 cette force innée dans nos corps je réponds quelle réside très clairement dans ce que les anciens ont appellé parenchyme cest à dire dans la substance propre des parties abstraction faite des veines des artères des nerfs en un mot de lorganisation de tout le corps et que par conséquent chaque partie contient en soi des ressorts plus ou moins vifs selon le besoin quelles en avaient if now any one ask me where is this innate force in our bodies i answer that it very clearly resides in what the ancients called the parenchyma that is to say in the very substance of the organs not including the veins the arteries the nerves in a word that it resides in the organization of the whole body and that consequently each organ contains within itself forces more or less active according to the need of them entrons dans quelque détail de ces ressorts de la machine humaine tous les mouvements vitaux animaux naturels et automatiques se font par leur action nestce pas machinalement que le corps se retire frappé de terreur à laspect dun précipice inattendu que les paupières se baissent à la menace dun coup comme on la dit que la pupille sétrécit au grand jour pour conserver la rétine et sélargit pour voir les objets dans lobscurité nestce pas machinalement que les pores de la peau se ferment en hiver pour que le froid ne pénètre pas lintérieur des vaisseaux que lestomac se soulève irrité par le poison par une certaine quantité dopium par tous les émétiques etc que le cœur les artères les muscles se contractent pendant le sommeil comme pendant la veille que le poumon fait loffice dun souflet continuellement exercé nestce pas machinalement quagissent tous les sphincters de la vessie du rectum etc que le cœur a une contraction plus forte que tout autre muscle que les muscles érecteurs font dresser la verge dans lhomme comme dans les animaux qui sen battent le ventre et même dans lenfant capable dérection pour peu que cette partie soit irritée ce qui prouve pour le dire en passant quil est un ressort singulier dans ce membre encore peu connu et qui produit     des effets quon na point encore bien expliqués malgré toutes les lumières de lanatomie let us now go into some detail concerning these springs of the human machine all the vital animal natural and automatic motions are carried on by their action is it not in a purely mechanical way that the body shrinks back when it is struck with terror at the sight of an unforeseen precipice      that the eyelids are lowered at the menace of a blow as some have remarked and that the pupil contracts in broad daylight to save the retina and dilates to see objects in darkness is it not by mechanical means that the pores of the skin close in winter so that the cold can not penetrate to the interior of the blood vessels and that the stomach vomits when it is irritated by poison by a certain quantity of opium and by all emetics etc that the heart the arteries and the muscles contract in sleep as well as in waking hours that the lungs serve as bellows continually in exercise  that the heart contracts more strongly than any other muscle   je ne métendrai pas davantage sur tous ces petits ressorts subalternes connus de tout le monde mais il en est un autre plus subtil et plus merveilleux qui les anime tous il est la source de tous nos sentiments de tous nos plaisirs de toutes nos passions de toutes nos pensées car le cerveau a ses muscles pour penser comme les jambes pour marcher je veux parler de ce principe incitant et impétueux quhippocrate appelle ενορμων lâme ce principe existe et il a son siège dans le cerveau à lorigine des nerfs par lesquels il exerce son empire sur tout le reste du corps par là sexplique tout ce qui peut sexpliquer jusquaux effets surprenants des maladies de limagination mais pour ne pas languir dans une richesse et une fécondité mal entendue il faut se borner à un petit nombre de questions et de réflexions pourquoi la vue ou la simple idée dune belle femme nous causetelle des mouvements et des désirs singuliers ce qui se passe alors dans certains organes vientil de la nature même de ces organes point du tout mais du commerce et de lespèce de sympathie de ces muscles avec limagination il ny a ici quun premier ressort excité par le bene placitum des anciens ou par limage de la beauté qui en excite un autre lequel était fort assoupi quand limagination la éveillé et comment cela si ce nest par le désordre et le tumulte du sang et des esprits qui galopent avec une promptitude extraordinaire et vont gonfler les corps caverneux puisquil est des communications évidentes entre     la mère et lenfant  et quil est dur de nier des faits rapportés par tulpius et par dautres écrivains aussi dignes de foi il ny en a point qui le soient plus nous croirons que cest par la même voie que le fœtus ressent limpétuosité de limagination maternelle comme une cire molle reçoit toutes sortes dimpressions et que les mêmes traces ou envies de la mère peuvent simprimer sur le fœtus sans que cela puisse se comprendre quoiquen disent blondel et tous ses adhérents ainsi nous faisons réparation dhonneur au p malebranche beaucoup trop raillé de sa crédulité par les auteurs qui nont point observé dassez près la nature et ont voulu lassujettir à leur idées i shall not go into any more detail concerning all these little subordinate forces well known to all but there is another more subtle and marvelous force which animates them all it is the source of all our feelings of all our pleasures of all our passions and of all our thoughts for the brain has its muscles for thinking as the legs have muscles for walking   i wish to speak of this impetuous principle that hippocrates calls ενορμων soul this principle exists and has its seat in the brain at the origin of the nerves by which it exercises its control over all the rest of the body by this fact is explained all that can be explained even to the surprising effects of maladies of the imagination voyez le portrait de ce fameux pope au moins le voltaire des anglais les efforts les nerfs de son génie sont peints sur sa physionomie elle est toute en convulsion ses yeux sortent de lorbite ses sourcils sélèvent avec les muscles du front pourquoi cest que lorigine des nerfs est en travail et que tout le corps doit se ressentir dune espèce daccouchement aussi laborieux sil ny avait une corde interne qui tirât ainsi celles du dehors doù viendraient tous ces phénomènes admettre une âme pour les expliquer cest être réduit à lopération du st esprit look at the portrait of the famous pope who is to say the least the voltaire of the english the effort the energy of his genius are imprinted upon his countenance it is convulsed his eyes protrude from their sockets the eyebrows are raised with the muscles of the forehead why because the brain is in travail and all the body must share      in such a laborious deliverance if there were not an internal cord which pulled the external ones whence would come all these phenomena to admit a soul as explanation of them is to be reduced to explaining phenomena by the operations of the holy spirit en effet si ce qui pense en mon cerveau nest pas une partie de ce viscère et conséquemment de tout le corps pourquoi lorsque tranquille dans mon lit je forme le plan dun ouvrage ou que je poursuis un raisonnement abstrait pourquoi mon sang séchauffetil pourquoi la fièvre de mon esprit     passetelle dans mes veines demandezle aux hommes dimagination aux grandes poètes à ceux quun sentiment bien rendu ravit quun goût exquis que les charmes de la nature de la vérité ou de la vertu transportent par leur enthousiasme par ce quils vous diront avoir éprouvé vous jugerez de la cause par les effets par cette harmonie que borelli quun seul anatomiste a mieux connue que tous les leibniziens vous connaîtrez lunité matérielle de lhomme car enfin si la tension des nerfs qui fait la douleur cause la fièvre par laquelle lesprit est troublé et na plus de volonté et que réciproquement lesprit trop exercé trouble le corps et allume ce feu de consomption qui a enlevé bayle dans un âge si peu avancé si telle titillation me fait vouloir me force de désirer ardemment ce dont je ne me souciais nullement le moment dauparavant si à leur tour certaines traces du cerveau excitent le même prurit et les mêmes désirs pourquoi faire double ce qui nest évidemment quun cest en vain quon se récrie sur lempire de la volonté pour un ordre quelle donne elle subit cent fois le joug et quelle merveille que le corps obéisse dan létat sain puisquun torrent de sang et desprits vient ly forcer la volonté ayant pour ministres une légion invisible de fluides plus vifs que léclair et toujours prêts a la servir mais comme cest par les nerfs que son pouvoir sexerce cest aussi par eux quil est arrêté la meilleure volonté dun amant épuisé les plus violents désirs lui rendrontils sa vigueur perdue hélas non et elle en sera la première punie parceque posées certaines circonstances il nest pas dans sa puissance de ne pas vouloir du plaisir ce que jai dit de la paralysie etc revient ici    in fact if what thinks in my brain is not a part of this organ and therefore of the whole body why does my blood boil and the fever of my mind pass into my veins when lying quietly in bed i am forming the plan of some work or carrying on an abstract calculation put this question to men of imagination to great poets to men who are enraptured by the felicitous expression of sentiment and transported by an exquisite fancy or by the charms of nature of truth or of virtue by their enthusiasm by what they will tell you they have experienced you will judge the cause by its effects by that harmony which borelli   a mere anatomist understood better than all the leibnizians you will comprehend the material unity of man in short if the nervetension which causes pain occasions also the fever by which the distracted mind loses its willpower and if conversely the mind too much excited disturbs the body and kindles that inner fire which killed bayle while he was still so young if an agitation rouses my desire and my ardent wish for what a moment ago i cared nothing about and if in their turn certain brain impressions excite the same longing and the same desires then why should we regard as double what is manifestly one being in vain you fall back on the power of the will since for one order that the will gives it bows a hundred times to the yoke   and what wonder that in      health the body obeys since a torrent of blood and of animal spirits 0 forces its obedience and since the will has as ministers an invisible legion of fluids swifter than lightning and ever ready to do its bidding but as the power of the will is exercised by means of the nerves it is likewise limited by them la jaunisse vous surprend ne savez vous pas que la couleur des corps dépend de celle des verres au travers desquels on les regarde ignorezvous que telle est la teinte des humeurs telle est celle des objets au moins par rapport à nous vains jouets de mille illusions mais ôtez cette teinte de lhumeur aqueuse de lœil faites couler la bile par son tamis naturel alors lâme ayant dautres yeux ne verra plus jaune nest ce pas encore ainsi quen abattant la cataracte ou en injectant le canal deustachi on rend la vue aux aveugles et louie aux sourds combien de gens qui nétaient peutêtre que dhabiles charlatans dans des siècles ignorants ont passé pour faire de grands miracles la belle âme et la puissante volonté qui ne peut agir quautant que les dispositions du corps le lui permettent et dont les goûts changent avec lâge et la fièvre fautil donc sétonner si les philosophes ont toujours eu en vue la santé du corps pour conserver celle de lâme si pythagore a aussi soigneusement ordonné la diète que platon a défendu le vin le régime qui convient au corps est toujours celui par lequel les médecins sensés prétendent quon doit préluder lorsquil sagit de former lesprit de lélever à la connaissance de la vérité et de la vertu vains sons dans le désordre des maladies et le tumulte des sens sans les préceptes de lhygiène epictète socrate platon etc prêchent en vain toute morale est infructueuse pour qui na pas la sobrieté en partage cest la source de toutes les vertus comme lintempérance est celle de tous les vices does the result of jaundice surprise you do you not know that the color of bodies depends on the color of the glasses through which we look at them   and that whatever is the color of the humors such is the color of objects at least for us vain playthings of a thousand illusions but remove this color from the aqueous humor of the eye let the bile flow through its natural filter then the soul having new eyes will no longer see yellow again is it not thus by removing cataract or by injecting the eustachian canal that sight is restored to the blind or hearing to the deaf how many people who were perhaps only clever charlatans passed for miracle workers in the dark ages beautiful the soul and powerful the will which can not act save by permission of the bodily conditions and whose tastes change with age and fever should we then be astonished that philosophers have always had in mind the health of the body to preserve the health of the soul that pythagoras   gave rules for the diet as carefully as plato forbade wine   the regime suited to the body is always the one with which sane physicians think they must begin when it is a question of forming the mind and of instructing it in the knowledge of truth and virtue but these are vain words in the disorder of illness and in the tumult of the senses without the precepts of hygiene      epictetus socrates plato and the rest preach in vain all ethics is fruitless for one who lacks his share of temperance it is the source of all virtues as intemperance is the source of all vices en fautil davantage et pourquoi iraisje me perdre dans lhistoire des passions qui toutes sexpliquent par lενορμων dhippocrate pour prouver     que lhomme nest quun animal ou un assemblage de ressorts qui tous se montent les uns par les autres sans quon puisse dire par quel point du cercle humain la nature a commencé si ces ressorts diffèrent entreux ce nest donc que par leur siège et par quelques degrés de force et jamais par leur nature et par conséquent lâme nest quun principe de mouvement ou une partie matérielle sensible du cerveau quon peut sans craindre lerreur regarder comme un ressort principal de toute la machine qui a une influence visible sur tous les autres et même parait avoir été fait le premier en sorte que tous les autres nen seraient quune émanation comme on le verra par quelques observations que je rapporterai et qui ont été faites sur divers embryons is more needed for why lose myself in discussion of the passions which are all explained by the term ενορμων of hippocrates to prove that man is but an animal or a collection of springs which wind each other up without our being able to tell at what point in this human circle nature has begun if these springs differ among themselves these differences consist only in their position and in their degrees of strength and never in their nature wherefore the soul is but a principle of motion or a material and sensible part of the brain which can be regarded without fear of error as the mainspring of the whole machine having a visible influence on all the parts the soul seems even to have been made for the brain so that all the other parts of the system are but a kind of emanation from the brain this will appear from certain observations made on different embryos which i shall now enumerate cette oscillation naturelle ou propre à notre machine et dont est douée chaque fibre et pour ainsi dire chaque élément fibreux semblable à celle dune pendule ne peut toujours sexercer il faut la renouveler à mesure quelle se perd lui donner des forces quand elle languit laffaiblir lorsquelle est opprimée par un excès de force et de vigueur cest en cela seul que la vraie médecine consiste this oscillation which is natural or suited to our machine and with which each fibre and even each fibrous element so to speak seems to be endowed like that of a pendulum can not keep up forever it must be renewed as it loses strength invigorated when it is tired and weakened when it is disturbed by excess of strength and vigor in this alone true medicine consists le corps nest quune horloge dont le nouveau chyle est lhorloger le premier soin de la nature quand il entre dans le sang cest dy exciter une sorte de fièvre que les chimistes qui ne rêvent que fourneaux ont dû prendre pour une fermentation cette fièvre procure une plus grande filtration desprits qui machinalement vont animer les muscles et le cœur comme sils y étaient envoyés par ordre de la volonté the body is but a watch whose watchmaker is the new chyle natures first care when the chyle      enters the blood is to excite in it a kind of fever   which the chemists who dream only of retorts must have taken for fermentation this fever produces a greater filtration of spirits which mechanically animate the muscles and the heart as if they had been sent there by order of the will ce sont donc les causes ou les forces de la vie qui entretiennent ainsi durant  00 ans le mouvement     perpétuel des solides et des fluides aussi nécessaire aux uns quaux autres mais qui peut dire si les solides contribuent à ce jeu plus que les fluides et vice versa tout ce quon sait cest que laction des premiers serait bientôt anéantie sans le secours des seconds ce sont les liqueurs qui par leur choc éveillent et conservent lélasticité des vaisseaux de laquelle dépend leur propre circulation de là vient quaprès la mort le ressort naturel de chaque substance est plus ou moins fort encore suivant les restes de la vie auxquels il survit pour expirer le dernier tant il est vrai que cette force des parties animales peut bien se conserver et saugmenter par celle de la circulation mais quelle nen dépend point puisquelle se passe même de lintégrité de chaque membre ou viscère comme on la vu these then are the causes or the forces of life which thus sustain for a hundred years that perpetual movement of the solids and the liquids which is as necessary to the first as to the second but who can say whether the solids contribute more than the fluids to this movement or vice versa all that we know is that the action of the former would soon cease without the help of the latter that is without the help of the fluids which by their onset rouse and maintain the elasticity of the blood vessels on which their own circulation depends from this it follows that after death the natural resilience of each substance is still more or less strong according to the remnants of life which it outlives being the last to perish so true is it that this force of the animal parts can be preserved and strengthened by that of the circulation but that it does not depend on the strength of the circulation since as we have seen it can dispense with even the integrity of each member or organ je nignore pas que cette opinion na pas été goûtée de tous les savants et que stahl surtout la fort dédaignée ce grand chimiste a voulu nous persuader que lâme était la seule cause de tous nos mouvements mais cest parler en fanatique et non en philosophe i am aware that this opinion has not been relished by all scholars and that stahl especially had much scorn for it this great chemist has wished to persuade us that the soul is the sole cause of all our movements but this is to speak as a fanatic and not as a philosopher pour détruire lhypothèse stahlienne il ne faut pas faire tant defforts que je vois quon en a faits avant moi il ny a quà jeter les yeux sur un joueur de violon quelle souplesse quelle agilité dans les doigts les mouvements sont si prompts quil ne paraît presque pas y avoir de succession or je prie ou plutôt je défie les stahliens de me dire eux qui connaissent si bien tout ce que peut notre âme comment il serait possible quelle exécutât si vite tant de mouvements des mouvements qui se passent si loin delle et en tant dendroits     divers cest supposer un joueur de flûte qui pourrait faire de brillantes cadences sur une infinité de trous quil ne connaitrait pas et auxquels il ne pourrait seulement pas appliquer le doigt to destroy the hypothesis of stahl   we need not make as great an effort as i find that others have      done before me we need only glance at a violinist what flexibility what lightness in his fingers the movements are so quick that it seems almost as if there were no succession but i pray or rather i challenge the followers of stahl who understand so perfectly all that our soul can do to tell me how it could possibly execute so many motions so quickly motions moreover which take place so far from the soul and in so many different places that is to suppose that a flute player could play brilliant cadences on an infinite number of holes that he could not know and on which he could not even put his finger mais disons avec mr hecquet quil nest pas permis à tout le monde daller à corinthe et pourquoi stahl nauraitil pas été encore plus favorisé de la nature en qualité dhomme quen qualité de chimiste et de praticien il fallait heureux mortel quil eût reçu une autre âme que le reste des hommes une âme souveraine qui non contente davoir quelque empire sur les muscles volontaires tenait sans peine les rênes de tous les mouvements du corps pouvait les suspendre les calmer ou les exciter à son gré avec une maîtresse aussi despotique dans les mains de laquelle étaient en quelque sorte les battements du cœur et les lois de la circulation point de fièvre sans doute point de douleur point de langueur ni honteuse impuissance ni facheux priapisme lâme veut et les ressorts jouent se dressent ou se débandent comment ceux de la machine de stahl se sontils sitôt détraqués qui a chez soi un si grand médecin devrait être immortel but let us say with m hecquet   that all men may not go to corinth   why should not stahl have been even more favored by nature as a man than as a chemist and a practitioner happy mortal he must have received a soul different from that of the rest of mankind—a sovereign soul which not content with having some control over the voluntary muscles easily held the reins of all the movements of the body and could suspend them calm them or excite them at its pleasure with so despotic a mistress in whose hands were in a sense the beating of the heart and the laws of circulation there could certainly be no fever no pain no weariness the soul wills and the springs play contract or relax but how did the springs of stahls machine get out of order so soon he who has in himself so great a doctor should be immortal stahl au reste nest pas le seul qui ait rejeté le principe doscillation des corps organisés de plus grands esprits ne lont pas employé lorsquils ont voulu expliquer laction du cœur lérection du penis etc il ny a quà lire les institutions de médecine de boerhaave pour voir quels laborieux et séduisants systèmes faute dadmettre une force aussi frappante dans tous les corps ce grand homme a été obligé denfanter à la sueur de son puissant génie    moreover stahl is not the only one who has rejected the principle of the vibration of organic bodies greater minds have not used the principle      when they wished to explain the action of the heart  etc one need only read the institutions of medicine by boerhaave   to see what laborious and enticing systems this great man was obliged to invent by the labor of his mighty genius through failure to admit that there is so wonderful a force in all bodies willis et perrault esprits dune plus faible trempe mais observateurs assidus de la nature que le fameux professeur de leyde na connue que par autrui et na eue pour ainsi dire que de la seconde main paraissent avoir mieux aimé supposer une âme généralement répandue par tout le corps que le principe dont nous parlons mais dans cette hypothèse qui fut celle de virgile et de tous les epicuriens hypothèse que lhistoire du polype semblerait favoriser à la première vue les mouvements qui survivent au sujet dans lequel ils sont inhérents viennent dun reste dâme que conservent encore les parties qui se contractent sans être désormais irritées par le sang et les esprits doù lon voit que ces écrivains dont les ouvrages solides éclipsent aisément toutes les fables philosophiques ne se sont trompés que sur le modèle de ceux qui ont donné à la matière la faculté de penser je veux dire pour sêtre mal exprimés en termes obscurs et qui ne signifient rien en effet quest ce que ce reste dâme si ce nest la force motrice des leibniziens mal rendue par une telle expression et que cependant perrault surtout a véritablement entrevue voy son traité de la mécanique des animaux willis   and perrault 0 minds of a more feeble stamp but careful observers of nature whereas nature was known to the famous leyden professor only through others and second hand so to speak seem to have preferred to suppose a soul generally extended over the whole body instead of the principle which we are describing but according to this hypothesis which was the hypothesis of vergil and of all epicureans an hypothesis which the history of the polyp might seem at first sight to favor the movements which go on after the death of the subject in which they inhere are due to a remnant of soul still maintained by the parts that contract though from the moment of death these are not excited by the blood and the spirits whence it may be seen that these writers whose solid works easily eclipse all philosophic fables are deceived only in the manner of those who have endowed matter with the faculty of thinking i mean to say by having expressed themselves badly in obscure and meaningless terms in truth what is this remnant of a soul if it is not the moving force of the leibnizians badly rendered by such an expression which however perrault in particular has really foreseen see his treatise on the mechanism of animals a présent quil est clairement démontré contre les cartésiens les stahliens les malebranchistes et les théologiens peu dignes dêtre ici placés que la matière se meut par ellemême non seulement lorsquelle est organisée comme dans un cœur entier par exemple mais lors même que cette organisation est détruite la curiosité de lhomme voudrait savoir comment un corps par cela même quil est originairement doué dun souffle de vie se trouve en conséquence orné de la faculté de sentir et enfin par     celleci de la pensée et pour en venir à bout ô bon dieu quels efforts nont pas faits certains philosophes et quel galimatias jai eu la patience de lire à ce sujet now that it is clearly proved against the cartesians      the followers of stahl the malebranchists and the theologians who little deserve to be mentioned here that matter is selfmoved   not only when organized as in a whole heart for example but even when this organization has been destroyed human curiosity would like to discover how a body by the fact that it is originally endowed with the breath of life finds itself adorned in consequence with the faculty of feeling and thus with that of thought and heavens what efforts have not been made by certain philosophers to manage to prove this and what nonsense on this subject i have had the patience to read tout ce que lexpérience nous apprend cest que tant que le mouvement subsiste si petit quil soit dans une ou plusieurs fibres il ny a quà les piquer pour réveiller animer ce mouvement presque éteint comme on la vu dans cette foule dexpériences dont jai voulu accabler les systèmes il est donc constant que le mouvement et le sentiment sexcitent tour à tour et dans les corps entiers et dans les mêmes corps dont la structure est détruite pour ne rien dire de certaines plantes qui semblent nous offrir les mêmes phénomènes de la réunion du sentiment et du mouvement all that experience teaches us is that while movement persists however slight it may be in one or more fibres we need only stimulate them to reexcite and animate this movement almost extinguished this has been shown in the host of experiments with which i have undertaken to crush the systems it is therefore certain that motion and feeling excite each other in turn both in a whole body and in the same body when its structure is destroyed to say nothing of certain plants which seem to exhibit the same phenomena of the union of feeling and motion mais de plus combien dexcellents philosophes ont démontré que la pensée nest quune faculté de sentir et que lâme raisonnable nest que lâme sensitive appliquée à contempler les idées et à raisonner ce qui serait prouvé par cela seul que lorsque le sentiment est éteint la pensée lest aussi comme dans lapoplexie la léthargie la catalepsie etc car ceux qui ont avancé que lâme navait pas moins pensé dans les maladies soporeuses quoiquelle ne se souvint pas des idées quelle avait eues ont soutenu une chose ridicule but furthermore how many excellent philosophers have shown that thought is but a faculty of feeling and that the reasonable soul is but the feeling soul engaged in contemplating its ideas and in reasoning this would be proved by the fact alone that when feeling is stifled thought also is checked for instance in apoplexy in lethargy in catalepsis etc for it is ridiculous to suggest that during these stupors the soul keeps on thinking    0 even though it does not remember the ideas that it has had pour ce qui est de ce développement cest une folie de perdre le temps à en rechercher le mécanisme la nature du mouvement nous est aussi inconnue que celle de la matière le moyen de découvrir comment il sy produit à moins que de ressusciter avec lauteur de lhistoire de lame lancienne et inintelligible doctrine des formes substantielles je suis   0 donc aussi consolé dignorer comment la matière dinerte et simple devient active et composée dorganes que de ne pouvoir regarder le soleil sans verre rouge et je suis daussi bonne composition sur les autres merveilles incompréhensibles de la nature sur la production du sentiment et de la pensée dans un être qui ne paraissait autrefois à nos yeux bornés quun peu de boue as to the development of feeling and motion it is absurd to waste time seeking for its mechanism the nature of motion is as unknown to us as that of matter   how can we discover how it is produced unless like the author of the history of the soul we resuscitate the old and unintelligible doctrine of substantial forms i am then quite as content not to know how inert and simple matter becomes active and highly organized as not to be able to look at the sun without red glasses and i am as little disquieted concerning the other incomprehensible wonders of nature the production of feeling and of thought in a being which earlier appeared to our limited eyes as a mere clod of clay quon maccorde seulement que la matière organisée est douée dun principe moteur qui seul la différencie de celle qui ne lest pas eh peuton rien refuser à lobservation la plus incontestable et que tout dépend dans les animaux de la diversité de cette organisation comme je lai assez prouvé cen est assez pour deviner lénigme des substances et celle de lhomme on voit quil ny en a quune dans lunivers et que lhomme est la plus parfaite il est au singe aux animaux les plus spirituels ce que le pendule planétaire de huygens est à une montre de julien le roi sil a fallu plus dinstruments plus de rouages plus de ressorts pour marquer les mouvements des planètes que pour marquer les heures ou les répéter sil a fallu plus dart à vaucanson pour faire son fluteur que pour son canard il eût dû en employer encore davantage pour faire un parleur machine qui ne peut plus être regardée comme impossible surtout entre les mains dun nouveau prométhée il était donc de même nécessaire que la nature employât plus dart et dappareil pour faire et entretenir une machine qui pendant un siècle entier pût marquer tous les battements du cœur et de lesprit car si on nen voit pas au pouls les heures cest du moins le baromètre de la chaleur et de la vivacité par laquelle on peut     juger de la nature de lâme je ne me trompe point le corps humain est une horloge mais immense et construite avec tant dartifice et dhabileté que si la roue qui sert à marquer les secondes vient à sarrêter celle des minutes tourne et va toujours son train comme la roue des quarts continue de se mouvoir et ainsi des autres quand les premières rouillées ou dérangées par quelque cause que ce soit ont interrompu leur marche car nestce pas ainsi que lobstruction de quelques vaisseaux ne suffit pas pour détruire ou suspendre le fort des mouvements qui est dans le cœur comme dans la pièce ouvrière de la machine puisquau contraire les fluides dont le volume est diminué ayant moins de chemin a faire le parcourent dautant plus vite emportés comme par un nouveau courant que la force du cœur saugmente en raison de la résistance quil trouve à lextrémité des vaisseaux lorsque le nerf optique seul comprimé ne laisse plus passer limage des objets nestce pas ainsi que la privation de la vue nempêche pas plus lusage de louïe que la privation de ce sens lorsque les fonctions de la portion molle sont interdites ne suppose celle de lautre nestce pas ainsi encore que lun entend sans pouvoir dire quil entend si ce nest après lattaque du mal et que lautre qui nentend rien mais dont les nerfs linguaux sont libres dans le cerveau dit machinalement tous les rêves qui lui passent par la tête phénomènes qui ne surprennent point les médecins éclairés ils savent à quoi sen tenir sur la nature de lhomme et pour le dire en passant de deux médecins le meilleur celui qui mérite le plus de confiance cest toujours à mon avis celui qui est le plus versé dans la physique     ou la mécanique du corps humain et qui laissant lâme et toutes les inquiétudes que cette chimère donne aux sots et aux ignorans nest occupé sérieusement que du pur naturalisme grant only that organized matter is endowed with a principle of motion which alone differentiates it from the inorganic and can one deny this in the face of the most incontestable observation and that among animals as i have sufficiently proved everything depends upon the diversity of this organization these admissions suffice for guessing the riddle of substances and of man it thus appears that there is but one type of organization in the universe and that man is the most perfect example he is to the ape and to the most intelligent animals as the planetary pendulum of huyghens   is to a watch of julien leroy   more instruments more wheels and more springs were necessary to mark the movements of the planets than to mark or strike the hours and vaucanson   who needed more skill for making his flute player      than for making his duck would have needed still more to make a talking man a mechanism no longer to be regarded as impossible especially in the hands of another prometheus in like fashion it was necessary that nature should use more elaborate art in making and sustaining a machine which for a whole century could mark all motions of the heart and of the mind for though one does not tell time by the pulse it is at least the barometer of the warmth and the vivacity by which one may estimate the nature of the soul i am right the human body is a watch a large watch constructed with such skill and ingenuity that if the wheel which marks the seconds happens to stop the minute wheel turns and keeps on going its round and in the same way the quarterhour wheel and all the others go on running when the first wheels have stopped because rusty or for any reason out of order is it not for a similar reason that the stoppage of a few blood vessels is not enough to destroy or suspend the strength of the movement which is in the heart as in the mainspring of the machine since on the contrary the fluids whose volume is diminished having a shorter road to travel cover the ground more quickly borne on as by a fresh current which the energy of the heart increases in proportion to the resistance it encounters at the ends of the bloodvessels and is not this the reason why the loss of sight caused by the compression of the optic nerve and by its ceasing to convey the images of objects no more hinders hearing than the loss of hearing caused by obstruction of the functions of the auditory nerve implies the loss of sight in the same way finally does not one man      hear except immediately after his attack without being able to say that he hears while another who hears nothing but whose lingual nerves are uninjured in the brain mechanically tells of all the dreams which pass through his mind these phenomena do not surprise enlightened physicians at all they know what to think about mans nature and more accurately to express myself in passing of two physicians the better one and the one who deserves more confidence is always in my opinion the one who is more versed in the physique or mechanism of the human body and who leaving aside the soul and all the anxieties which this chimera gives to fools and to ignorant men is seriously occupied only in pure naturalism laissons donc le prétendu mr charp se moquer des philosophes qui ont regardé les animaux comme des machines que je pense différemment je crois que descartes serait un homme respectable à tous égards si né dans un siècle quil neût pas dû éclairer il eût connu le prix de lexpérience et de lobservation et le danger de sen écarter mais il nest pas moins juste que je fasse ici une authentique réparation à ce grand homme pour tous ces petits philosophes mauvais plaisants et mauvais singes de locke qui au lieu de rire impudemment au nez de descartes feraient mieux de sentir que sans lui le champ de la philosophie comme celui du bon esprit sans newton serait peut être encore en friche therefore let the pretended m charp deride philosophers who have regarded animals as machines how different is my view i believe that descartes would be a man in every way worthy of respect if born in a century that he had not been obliged to enlighten he had known the value of experiment and observation and the danger of cutting loose from them but it is none the less just for me to make an authentic reparation to this great man for all the insignificant philosophers—poor jesters and poor imitators of locke—who instead of laughing impudently at descartes might better realize that without him the field of philosophy like the field of science without newton might perhaps be still uncultivated il est vrai que ce célèbre philosophe sest beaucoup trompé et personne nen disconvient mais enfin il a connu la nature animale il a le premier parfaitement démontré que les animaux étaient de pures machines or après une découverte de cette importance et qui suppose autant de sagacité le moyen sans ingratitude de ne pas faire grâce à toutes ses erreurs this celebrated philosopher it is true was much deceived and no one denies that but at any rate he understood animal nature he was the first to prove completely that animals are pure machines        and after a discovery of this importance demanding so much sagacity how can we without ingratitude fail to pardon all his errors elles sont à mes yeux toutes réparées par ce grand aveu car enfin quoiquil chante sur la distinction des deux substances il est visible que ce nest quun tour dadresse une ruse de style pour faire avaler aux théologiens un poison caché à lombre dune analogie qui frappe tout le monde et queux seuls ne voient pas car cest elle cest cette forte analogie qui force tous les savants et les vrais juges     davouer que ces êtres fiers et vains plus distingués par leur orgueil que par le nom dhommes quelque envie quils aient de sélever ne sont au fond que des animaux et des machines perpendiculairement rampantes elles ont toutes ce merveilleux instinct dont léducation fait de lesprit et qui a toujours son siège dans le cerveau et à son défaut comme lorsquil manque ou est ossifié dans la moëlle allongée et jamais dans le cervelet car je lai vu considérablement blessé dautres  lont trouvé squirreux sans que lâme cessât de faire ses fonctions in my eyes they are all atoned for by that great confession for after all although he extols the distinctness of the two substances this is plainly but a trick of skill a ruse of style to make theologians swallow a poison hidden in the shade of an analogy which strikes everybody else and which they alone fail to notice for it is this this strong analogy which forces all scholars and wise judges to confess that these proud and vain beings more distinguished by their pride than by the name of men however much they may wish to exalt themselves are at bottom only animals and machines which though upright go on all fours they all have this marvelous instinct which is developed by education into mind and which always has its seat in the brain or for want of that when it is lacking or hardened in the medulla oblongata and never in the cerebellum for i have often seen the cerebellum injured and other observers  have found it hardened when the soul has not ceased to fulfil its functions etre machine sentir penser savoir distinguer le bien du mal comme le bleu du jaune en un mot être né avec de lintelligence et un instinct sûr de morale et nêtre quun animal sont donc des choses qui ne sont pas plus contradictoires quêtre un singe ou un perroquet et savoir se donner du plaisir car puisque loccasion se présente de le dire qui eut jamais deviné à priori quune goutte de la liqueur qui se lance dans laccouplement fit ressentir des plaisirs divins et quil en naîtrait une petite créature qui pourrait un jour posées certaines lois jouir des mêmes délices je crois la pensée si peu incompatible avec la matière organisée quelle semble en être une propriété telle que lélectricité la faculté motrice limpénétrabilité létendue etc to be a machine to feel to think to know how to distinguish good from bad as well as blue from yellow in a word to be born with an intelligence and a sure moral instinct and to be but an animal are therefore characters which are no more contradictory than to be an ape or a parrot and to be able to give oneself pleasure i believe that thought is so little incompatible with organized matter that it seems to be one of its properties on      a par with electricity the faculty of motion impenetrability extension etc voulez vous de nouvelles observations en voici qui sont sans réplique et qui prouvent toutes que lhomme ressemble parfaitement aux animaux dans son origine comme dans tout ce que nous avons déjà cru essentiel de comparer jen appelle à la bonne foi de nos observateurs     quils nous disent sil nest pas vrai que lhomme dans son principe nest quun ver qui devient homme comme la chenille papillon les plus graves  auteurs nous ont appris comment il faut sy prendre pour voir cet animalcule tous les curieux lont vu comme hartsoeker dans la semence de lhomme et non dans celle de la femme il ny a que les sots qui sen soient fait scrupule comme chaque goutte de sperme contient une infinité de ces petits vers lorsquils sont lancés à lovaire il ny a que le plus adroit ou le plus vigoureux qui ait la force de sinsinuer et de simplanter dans lœuf que fournit la femme et qui lui donne sa première nourriture cet œuf quelquefois surpris dans les trompes de fallope est porté par ces canaux à la matrice où il prend racine comme un grain de blé dans la terre mais quoiquil y devienne monstrueux par sa croissance de   mois il ne diffère point des œufs des autres femelles si ce nest que sa peau lamnios ne se durcit jamais et se dilate prodigieusement comme on en peut juger en comparant les fœtus trouvés en situation et près déclore ce que jai eu le plaisir dobserver dans une femme morte un moment avant laccouchement avec dautres petits embryons très proches de leur origine car alors cest toujours lœuf dans sa coque et lanimal dans lœuf qui gêné dans ses mouvements cherche machinalement à voir le jour et pour y réussir il commence par rompre avec la tête cette membrane doû il sort comme le poulet loiseau etc de la leur jajouterai une observation que je ne trouve nulle part cest que lamnios nen est pas plus mince pour sêtre prodigieusement étendu     semblable en cela à la matrice dont la substance même se gonfle de sucs infiltrés indépendamment de la réplétion et du déploiement de tous ses coudes vasculeux do you ask for further observations here are some which are incontestable and which all prove that man resembles animals perfectly in his origin as well as in all the points in which we have thought it essential to make the comparison voyons lhomme dans et hors de sa coque examinons avec un microscope les plus jeunes embryons de   de   de   ou de    jours après ce temps les yeux suffisent que voiton la tête seule un petit œuf rond avec deux points noirs qui marquent les yeux avant ce temps tout étant plus informe on naperçoit quune pulpe médullaire qui est le cerveau dans lequel se forme dabord lorigine des nerfs ou le principe du sentiment et le cœur qui a déjà par luimême dans cette pulpe la faculté de battre cest le punctum saliens de malpighi qui doit peutêtre déjà une partie de sa vivacité à linfluence des nerfs ensuite peuàpeu on voit la tête allonger le col qui en se dilatant forme dabord le thorax où le cœur a déjà descendu pour sy fixer après quoi vient le bas ventre quune cloison le diaphragme sépare ces dilatations donnent lune les bras les mains les doigts les ongles et les poils lautre les cuisses les jambes les pieds etc avec la seule différence de situation quon leur connait qui fait lappui et le balancier du corps cest une végétation frappante ici ce sont des cheveux qui couvrent le sommet de nos têtes là ce sont des feuilles et des fleurs partout brille le même luxe de la nature et enfin lesprit recteur des plantes est placé où nous avons notre âme cette autre quintessence de lhomme let us observe man both in and out of his shell let us examine young embryos of four six eight or fifteen days with a microscope after that time our eyes are sufficient what do we see the head alone a little round egg with two black points which mark the eyes before that everything is formless and one sees only a medullary pulp which is the brain in which are formed first the roots of the nerves that is the principle of feeling and the heart which already within this substance has the power of beating of itself it is the punctum saliens of malpighi which perhaps already owes a part of its excitability to the influence of the nerves then little by little one sees the head lengthen from the neck which in dilating forms first the thorax inside which the heart has already sunk there to become stationary below that is the abdomen which is divided by a partition the diaphragm one of these enlargements of the body forms the arms the hands the fingers the nails and the hair the other forms the thighs the legs the feet etc which differ only in their observed situation and which constitute the support and the balancing pole of the body the whole process is a strange sort of growth like that of plants on the tops of our heads is hair in place of which the plants have leaves and flowers everywhere is shown the same      luxury of nature and finally the directing principle of plants is placed where we have our soul that other quintessence of man telle est luniformité de la nature quon commence à sentir et lanalogie du règne animal et végétal de lhomme à la plante peutêtre même     y atil des plantes animal cestàdire qui en végétant ou se battent comme les polypes ou font dautres fonctions propres aux animaux voilà à peu près tout ce quon sait de la génération que les parties qui sattirent qui sont faites pour sunir ensemble et pour occuper telle ou telle place se réunissent toutes suivant leur nature et quainsi se forment les yeux le cœur lestomac et enfin tout le corps comme de grands hommes lont écrit cela est possible mais comme lexpérience nous abandonne au milieu des ces subtilités je ne supposerai rien regardant tout ce qui ne frappe pas mes sens comme un mystère impénétrable il est si rare que les deux semences se rencontrent dans le congrès que je serais tenté de croire que la semence de la femme est inutile à la génération mais comment en expliquer les phénomènes sans ce commode rapport de parties qui rend si bien raison des ressemblances des enfants tantôt au père et tantôt à la mère dun autre côté lembarras dune explication doitelle contrebalancer un fait il me parait que cest le mâle qui fait tout dans une femme qui dort comme dans la plus lubrique larrangement des parties serait donc fait de toute éternité dans le germe ou dans le ver même de lhomme mais tout ceci est fort audessus de la portée des plus excellents observateurs comme ils ny peuvent rien saisir ils ne peuvent pas plus juger de la mécanique de la formation et du développement des corps quune taupe du chemin quun cerf peut parcourir such is the uniformity of nature which we are beginning to realize and the analogy of the animal with the vegetable kingdom of man with plant perhaps there even are animal plants which in vegetating either fight as polyps do or perform other functions characteristic of animals nous sommes de vraies taupes dans le champ de la nature nous ny faisons guères que le trajet de cet animal et cest notre orgueil qui donne des     bornes à ce qui nen a point nous sommes dans le cas dune montre qui dirait un fabuliste en ferait un personnage de conséquence dans un ouvrage frivole quoi cest ce sot ouvrier qui ma faite moi qui divise le temps moi qui marque si exactement le cours du soleil moi qui répète à haute voix les heures que jindique non cela ne se peut pas nous dédaignons de même ingrats que nous sommes cette mère commune de tous les règnes comme parlent les chimistes nous imaginons ou plutôt supposons une cause supérieure à celle à qui nous devons tout et qui a véritablement tout fait dune manière inconcevable non la matière na rien de vil quaux yeux grossiers qui la méconnaissent dans ses plus brillants ouvrages et la nature nest point une ouvrière bornée elle produit des millions dhommes avec plus de facilité et de plaisir quun horloger na de peine à faire la montre la plus composée sa puissance éclate également et dans la production du plus vil insecte et dans celle de lhomme le plus superbe le règne animal ne lui coûte pas plus que le végétal ni le plus beau génie quun épi de blé jugeons donc par ce que nous voyons de ce qui se dérobe à la curiosité de nos yeux et de nos recherches et nimaginons rien au delà suivons le singe le castor léléphant etc dans leurs opérations sil est évident quelles ne peuvent se faire sans intelligence pourquoi la refuser à ces animaux et si vous leur accordez une âme fanatiques vous êtes perdus vous aurez beau dire que vous ne décidez point sur sa nature tandis que vous lui ôtez limmortalité qui ne voit que cest une assertion gratuite qui ne voit quelle doit être ou mortelle ou immortelle     comme la nôtre dont elle doit subir le même sort quel quil soit et quainsi cest tomber dans scilla pour vouloir éviter caribde we are veritable moles in the field of nature we achieve little more than the moles journey and it is our pride which prescribes limits to the limitless we are in the position of a watch that should say a writer of fables would make the watch a hero in a silly tale i was never made by that fool of a workman i who divide time who mark so exactly the course of the sun who repeat aloud the hours which i mark no that is impossible in the same way we disdain ungrateful wretches that we are this common mother of all kingdoms as the chemists say we imagine or rather we infer a cause superior to that to which we owe all and which truly has wrought all things in an inconceivable fashion no matter contains nothing base except to the vulgar eyes which do not recognize her in her most splendid works and nature is no stupid workman she creates millions of men with a facility and a pleasure more intense than the effort of a watchmaker in making the most complicated watch her power shines forth equally in creating the lowliest insect and in creating the most highly developed man the animal kingdom costs her no more than the vegetable and the most splendid genius no more than a blade of wheat let us then judge by what we      see of that which is hidden from the curiosity of our eyes and of our investigations and let us not imagine anything beyond let us observe the ape the beaver the elephant etc in their operations if it is clear that these activities can not be performed without intelligence why refuse intelligence to these animals and if you grant them a soul you are lost you fanatics you will in vain say that you assert nothing about the nature of the animal soul and that you deny its immortality who does not see that this is a gratuitous assertion who does not see that the soul of an animal must be either mortal or immortal whichever ours is and that it must therefore undergo the same fate as ours whatever that may be and that thus in admitting that animals have souls you fall into scylla in the effort to avoid charybdis brisez la chaîne de vos préjugés armezvous du flambeau de lexpérience et vous ferez à la nature lhonneur quelle mérite au lieu de rien conclure à son désavantage de lignorance où elle vous a laissé ouvrez les yeux seulement et laissezlà ce que vous ne pouvez comprendre et vous verrez que ce laboureur dont lesprit et les lumières ne sétendent pas plus loin que les bords de son sillon ne diffère point essentiellement du plus grand génie comme leût prouvé la dissection des cerveaux de descartes et de newton vous serez persuadé que limbécile ou le stupide sont des bêtes à figure humaine comme le singe plein desprit est un petit homme sous une autre forme et quenfin tout dépendant absolument de la diversité de lorganisation un animal bien construit à qui on a appris lastronomie peut prédire une éclipse comme la guérison ou la mort lorsquil a porté quelque temps du génie et de bons yeux à lécole dhippocrate et au lit des malades cest par cette file dobservations et de vérités quon parvient à lier à la matière ladmirable propriété de penser sans quon en puisse voir les liens parce que le sujet de cet attribut nous est essentiellement inconnu break the chain of your prejudices arm yourselves with the torch of experience and you will render to nature the honor she deserves instead of inferring anything to her disadvantage from the ignorance in which she has left you only open wide your eyes only disregard what you can not understand and you will see that the ploughman whose intelligence and ideas extend no further than the bounds of his furrow does not differ essentially from the greatest genius—a truth which the dissection of descartess and of newtons brains would have proved you will be persuaded that the imbecile and the fool are animals with human faces as the intelligent ape is a little man in another shape in short you will learn that since everything depends absolutely on difference of organization a well constructed animal which has studied astronomy can      predict an eclipse as it can predict recovery or death when it has used its genius and its clearness of vision for a time in the school of hippocrates and at the bedside of the sick by this line of observations and truths we come to connect the admirable power of thought with matter without being able to see the links because the subject of this attribute is essentially unknown to us ne disons point que toute machine ou tout animal périt toutàfait ou prend une autre forme après la mort car nous nen savons absolument rien mais assurer quune machine immortelle est une chimère ou un être de raison cest faire un raisonnement aussi absurde que celui que feraient des chenilles qui voyant les dépouilles de leurs semblables     déploreraient amèrement le sort de leur espèce qui leur semblerait sanéantir lâme de ces insectes car chaque animal a la sienne est trop bornée pour comprendre les métamorphoses de la nature jamais un seul des plus rusés dentreux neût imaginé quil dût devenir papillon il en est de même de nous que savonsnous plus de notre destinée que de notre origine soumettonsnous donc à une ignorance invincible de laquelle notre bonheur dépend let us not say that every machine or every animal perishes altogether or assumes another form after death for we know absolutely nothing about the subject on the other hand to assert that an immortal machine is a chimera or a logical fiction is to reason as absurdly as caterpillars would reason if seeing the castoff skins of their fellowcaterpillars they should bitterly deplore the fate of their species which to them would seem to come to nothing the soul of these insects for each animal has his own is too limited to comprehend the metamorphoses of nature never one of the most skilful among them could have imagined that it was destined to become a butterfly it is the same with us what more do we know of our destiny than of our origin let us then submit to an invincible ignorance on which our happiness depends qui pensera ainsi sera sage juste tranquille sur son sort et par conséquent heureux il attendra la mort sans la craindre ni la désirer et chérissant la vie comprenant à peine comment le dégoût vient corrompre un cœur dans ce lieu plein de délices plein de respect pour la nature plein de reconnaissance dattachement et de tendresse à proportion du sentiment et des bienfaits quil en a reçus heureux enfin de la sentir et dêtre au charmant spectacle de lunivers il ne le détruira certainement jamais dans soi ni dans les autres que disje plein dhumanité il en aimera le caractère jusques dans ses ennemis jugez comme il traitera les autres il plaindra les vicieux sans les haïr ce ne seront à ses yeux que des hommes contrefaits mais en faisant grâce aux défauts de la conformation de lesprit et du corps il nen admirera pas moins leurs beautés et leurs vertus ceux que la nature aura favorisés lui paraîtront mériter plus dégards que ceux quelle aura traités en marâtre cest ainsi quon a vu que les dons naturels la source de tout ce qui sacquiert trouvent dans la bouche et le cœur du matérialiste des hommages que tout autre leur refuse injustement enfin le   0 matérialiste convaincu quoi que murmure sa propre vanité quil nest quune machine ou un animal ne maltraitera point ses semblables trop instruit sur la nature de ces actions dont linhumanité est toujours proportionnée au degré danalogie prouvée ci devant et ne voulant pas en un mot suivant la loi naturelle donnée à tous les animaux faire à autrui ce quil ne voudrait pas quil lui fît he who so thinks will be wise just tranquil about his fate and therefore happy he will await death without either fear or desire and will cherish life hardly understanding how disgust can corrupt a heart in this place of many delights he will be filled with reverence gratitude affection and tenderness for nature in proportion to his feeling of the benefits he has received from nature he will be happy in short in feeling nature and in being      present at the enchanting spectacle of the universe and he will surely never destroy nature either in himself or in others more than that full of humanity this man will love human character even in his enemies judge how he will treat others he will pity the wicked without hating them in his eyes they will be but mismade men but in pardoning the faults of the structure of mind and body he will none the less admire the beauties and the virtues of both those whom nature shall have favored will seem to him to deserve more respect than those whom she has treated in stepmotherly fashion thus as we have seen natural gifts the source of all acquirements gain from the lips and heart of the materialist the homage which every other thinker unjustly refuses them in short the materialist convinced in spite of the protests of his vanity that he is but a machine or an animal will not maltreat his kind for he will know too well the nature of those actions whose humanity is always in proportion to the degree of the analogy proved above between human beings and animals and following the natural law given to all animals he will not wish to do to others what he would not wish them to do to him concluons donc hardiment que lhomme est une machine et quil ny a dans tout lunivers quune seule substance diversement modifiée ce nest point ici une hypothèse élevée à force de demandes et de suppositions ce nest point louvrage du préjugé ni même de ma raison seule jeusse dédaigné un guide que je crois si peu sûr si mes sens portant pour ainsi dire le flambeau ne meûssent engagé à la suivre en léclairant lexpérience ma donc parlé pour la raison cest ainsi que je les ai jointes ensemble let us then conclude boldly that man is a machine and that in the whole universe there is but a single substance differently modified this is no hypothesis set forth by dint of a number of postulates and assumptions it is not the work of prejudice nor even of my reason alone i should have disdained a guide which i think to be so untrustworthy had not my senses bearing a torch so to speak induced me to follow reason by lighting the way themselves      experience has thus spoken to me in behalf of reason and in this way i have combined the two mais on a dû voir que je ne me suis permis le raisonnement le plus rigoureux et le plus immédiatement tiré quà la suite dune multitude dobservations physiques quaucun savant ne contestera et cest encore eux seuls que je reconnais pour juges des conséquences que jen tire récusant ici tout homme à préjugés et qui nest ni anatomiste ni au fait de la seule philosophie qui soit ici de mise celle du corps humain que pourraient contre un chêne aussi ferme et solide ces faibles roseaux de la théologie de la métaphysique et des écoles

ces raisonnements rebattus et pitoyables quon fera sur la prétendue incompatibilité de deux substances qui se touchent et se remuent sans cesse lune et lautre tant quil restera lombre du préjugé ou de la superstition sur la terre voilà mon système ou plutôt la vérité si je ne me trompe fort elle est courte et simple dispute à présent qui voudra    but it must have been noticed that i have not allowed myself even the most vigorous and immediately deduced reasoning except as a result of a multitude of observations which no scholar will contest and furthermore i recognize only scholars as judges of the conclusions which i draw from the observations and i hereby challenge every prejudiced man who is neither anatomist nor acquainted with the only philosophy which can here be considered that of the human body against so strong and solid an oak what could the weak reeds of theology of metaphysics and of the schools avail—childish arms like our parlor foils that may well afford the pleasure of fencing but can never wound an adversary need i say that i refer to the empty and trivial notions to the pitiable and trite arguments that will be urged as long as the shadow of prejudice or of superstition remains on earth for the supposed incompatibility of two substances which meet and move each other unceasingly such is my system or rather the truth unless i am much deceived it is

have examined attentively the nature of matter considered in itself independently of all the forms which constitute bodies have discovered in this substance diverse properties proceeding from an absolutely unknown essence such are   the capacity of taking on different forms which are produced in matter itself by which matter can acquire moving force and the faculty of feeling   actual extension which these philosophers have rightly recognized as an attribute but not as the essence of matter however there have been some among others descartes who have insisted on reducing the essence of matter to simple extension and on limiting all the properties of matter to those of extension but this opinion has been rejected by all other modern philosophers  so that the power of acquiring moving force and the faculty of feeling as well as that of extension have been from all time considered as essential properties   of matter all the diverse properties that are observed in this unknown principle demonstrate a being in which these same properties exist a being which must therefore exist through itself but we can not conceive or rather it seems impossible that a being      which exists through itself should be able neither to create nor to annihilate itself it is evident that only the forms to which its essential properties make it susceptible can be destroyed and reproduced in turn thus does experience force us to confess that nothing can come from nothing all philosophers who have not known the light of faith have thought that this substantial principle of bodies has existed and will exist forever and that the elements of matter have an indestructible solidity which forbids the fear that the world is going to fall to pieces the majority of christian philosophers also recognize that the substantial principle of bodies exists necessarily through itself and that the power of beginning or ending does not accord with its nature one finds that this view is upheld by an author of the last century who taught theology in paris contents chapter iii concerning the extension of matter although we have no idea of the essence of matter we can not refuse to admit the existence of the properties which our senses discover in it i open my eyes and i see around me only matter or the extended extension is then a property which always belongs to all matter which can belong to matter alone and which therefore is inseparable from the substance of matter this property presupposes three dimensions in the substance of bodies length width and depth truly if we consult our knowledge which is gained entirely from the senses we cannot conceive of matter or the substance of bodies without having      the idea of a being which is at the same time long broad and deep because the idea of these three dimensions is necessarily bound up with our idea of every magnitude or quantity those philosophers who have meditated most concerning matter do not understand by the extension of this substance a solid extension composed of distinct parts capable of resistance nothing is united nothing is divided in this extension for there must be a force which separates to divide and another force to unite the divided parts but in the opinion of these physical philosophers matter has no actually active force because every force can come only from movement or from some impulse or tendency toward movement and they recognize in matter stripped of all form by abstraction only a potential moving force this theory is hard to conceive but given its principles it is rigorously true in its consequences it is one of those algebraic truths which is more readily believed than conceived by the mind the extension of matter is then but a metaphysical extension which according to the idea of these very philosophers presents nothing to affect our senses they rightly think that only solid extension can make an impression on our senses it thus seems to us that extension is an attribute which constitutes part of the metaphysical form but we are far from thinking that extension constitutes its essence however before descartes some of the ancients made the essence of matter consist in solid extension but this opinion of which all the cartesians have made much has at all times been victoriously      combated by clear reasons which we will set forth later for order demands that we first examine to what the properties of extension can be reduced contents chapter v concerning the moving force of matter the ancients persuaded that there is no body without a moving force regarded the substance of bodies as composed of two primitive attributes it was held that through one of these attributes this substance has the capacity for moving and through the other the capacity for being moved   as a matter of fact it is impossible not to conceive these two attributes in every moving body namely the thing which moves and the same thing which is moved it has just been said that formerly the name matter was given to the substance of bodies in so far as it is susceptible of being moved when capable of moving this same matter was known by the name of active principle but these two attributes seem to depend so essentially on each other that cicero in order better to state this essential and primitive union of matter with its moving principle says that each is found in the other this expresses very well the idea of the ancients from this it is clear that modern writers have given us but an inexact idea of matter in attempting through a confusion ill understood to give this name to the substance of bodies for once more matter or the passive principle of the substance of bodies constitutes only one part of this substance thus it is not surprising that these modern      thinkers have not discovered in matter moving force and the faculty of feeling it should now be evident at the first glance it seems to me that if there is an active principle it must have in the unknown essence of matter another source than extension this proves that simple extension fails to give an adequate idea of the complete essence or metaphysical form of the substance of bodies and that this failure is due solely to the fact that extension excludes the idea of any activity in matter therefore if we demonstrate this moving principle if we show that matter far from being as indifferent as it is supposed to be to movement and to rest ought to be regarded as an active as well as a passive substance what resource can be left to those who have made its essence consist in extension the two principles of which we have just spoken extension and moving force are then but potentialities of the substance of bodies for in the same way in which this substance is susceptible of movement without actually being moved it also has always even when it is not moving itself the faculty of spontaneous motion the ancients have rightly noticed that this moving force acts in the substance of bodies only when the substance is manifested in certain forms they have also observed that the different motions which it produces are all subject to these different forms or regulated by them that is why the forms through which the substance of bodies can not only move but also move in different ways were called material forms once these early masters had cast their eyes on      all the phenomena of nature they discovered in the substance of bodies the power of selfmovement in fact this substance either moves itself or when it is in motion the motion is communicated to it by another substance but can anything be seen in this substance save the substance itself in action and if sometimes it seems to receive a motion that it has not does it receive that motion from any cause other than this same kind of substance whose parts act the one upon the other if then one infers another agent i ask what agent and i demand proofs of its existence but since no one has the least idea of such an agent it is not even a logical entity therefore it is clear that the ancients must have easily recognized an intrinsic force of motion within the substance of bodies since in fact it is impossible to prove or conceive any other substance acting upon it descartes a genius made to blaze new paths and to go astray in them supposed with some other philosophers that god is the only efficient cause of motion and that every instant he communicates motion to all bodies but this opinion is but an hypothesis which he tried to adjust to the light of faith and in so doing he was no longer attempting to speak as a philosopher or to philosophers above all he was not addressing those who can be convinced only by the force of evidence the christian scholastics of the last centuries have felt the full force of this reflection for this reason they have wisely limited themselves to purely philosophic knowledge concerning the motion of matter although they might have shown that god himself said that he had imprinted an active principle      in the elements of matter gen i is lxvi one might here make up a long list of authorities and take from the most celebrated professors the substance of the doctrine of all the rest but it is clear enough without a medley of citations that matter contains this moving force which animates it and which is the immediate cause of all the laws of motion contents chapter vi concerning the sensitive faculty of matter we have spoken of two essential attributes of matter upon which depend the greater number of its properties namely extension and moving force we have now but to prove a third attribute i mean the faculty of feeling which the philosophers of all centuries have found in this same substance i say all philosophers although i am not ignorant of all the efforts which the cartesians have made in vain to rob matter of this faculty but in order to avoid insurmountable difficulties they have flung themselves into a labyrinth from which they have thought to escape by this absurd system that animals are pure machines   an opinion so absurd has never gained admittance among philosophers except as the play of wit or as a philosophical pastime for this reason we shall not stop to refute it experience gives us no less proof of the faculty of feeling in animals than of feeling in men there comes up another difficulty which more nearly concerns our vanity namely the impossibility of our conceiving this property as a dependence or attribute of matter let it not be forgotten    0 that this substance reveals to us only ineffable characters do we understand better how extension is derived from its essence how it can be moved by a primitive force whose action is exerted without contact and a thousand other miracles so hidden from the gaze of the most penetrating eyes that to paraphrase the idea of an illustrious modern writer they reveal only the curtain which conceals them but might not one suppose as some have supposed that the feeling which is observed in animated bodies might belong to a being distinct from the matter of these bodies to a substance of a different nature united to them does the light of reason allow us in good faith to admit such conjectures we know in bodies only matter and we observe the faculty of feeling only in bodies on what foundation then can we erect an ideal being disowned by all our knowledge however we must admit with the same frankness that we are ignorant whether matter has in itself the faculty of feeling or only the power of acquiring it by those modifications or forms to which matter is susceptible for it is true that this faculty of feeling appears only in organic bodies this is then another new faculty which might exist only potentially in matter like all the others which have been mentioned and this was the hypothesis of the ancients whose philosophy full of insight and penetration deserves to be raised above the ruins of the philosophy of the moderns it is in vain that the latter disdain the sources too remote from them ancient philosophy will always hold its own among those who are worthy to judge      it because it forms at least in relation to the subject of which i am treating a system that is solid and well articulated like the body whereas all these scattered members of modern philosophy form no system
