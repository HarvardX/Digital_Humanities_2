code entitled defensive force for his approval criticism and correction bentham writes— jeremy bentham august         la fayette bentham to la fayette extract august         on this occasion my principal object has been to render the condition of the subject many among the military and under them that of the nonmilitary as comfortable and desirable as the nature of the case will admit with a view to late spanish america in which country so far as they go such of my works as have been edited in french by dumont are the only subjects of reference having all of them been translated into and published in spanish the one here in question is translating into that language and about half the quantity of the english impression is already in print with copies of it in mexico at different times my friends here have heard from the creole diplomatists here that a young man of the higher orders there is not regarded as having received a course of instruction suitable to his condition unless he has gone through those same works what the degree of sale of the spanish edition is may be learnt from bossange frères by whom they have been successively published these things i mention for the purpose of clearing myself as well as i am able from the imputation of unwarrantable presumption by endeavouring to waste such time as yours in an occupation not worthy of it as to myself i am somewhat younger than i was when as far as a troublesome complaint allowed you saw me happy at lagrange the gloom in which the complaint involved me has since been dissipated by cure felix bodin who for some weeks has been ocular witness of the difference will i should hope ere this if you have seen him have given this evidence in my favour the rose truniere alias rose de syrie about which i gave you so much trouble turns out to have been nothing but an accidental variety of our common english hollyoak which and in greater perfection i had already but it was to the sentimental association that the flower i saw there was indebted for the principal value it possessed in my eyes the race sprung from lagrange is accordingly distinguished and preserved distinct with religious care and shown with corresponding pride   and vanity to all visiters capable of appreciating it i shall not forget your picture of human felicity scene the united states—drawn first in english then in french for the edification of the jesuitbegotten imps to whom it was what a spout of holy water is to their best friend the devil whenever for the first time your name is mentioned here by a visiter out that same picture comes of course had the thing been possible i would give no small price for a copy of it taken in shorthand jeremy bentham august         la fayette august         now that i have pen in hand—a duty which unpleasant as it is i cannot shrink from—is to inform you of what the most intelligent friends of good government in general and in france in particular say here of the existing accusation of the french ministry what is said is that it amounts to nothing and forms not any substantial and warrantable grounds for punishment being composed exclusively of a tissue of vague generalities in a declamatory style unsupported by any specific article of charge that the only part which upon the face of it bears anything of this lastmentioned character is that which concerns the opening of letters at the postoffice and that in this case the charge is deficient in respect of the precision necessary to give support to conviction upon substantial and tenable grounds in this opinion it is proper that i should at the same time mention that nothing of mine is comprised my time not admitting of my obtaining any approach to an adequate conception of it i have kept my mind turned from the subject altogether in this respect our articles of charge as contained in the accusations called impeachments in and by which the functions of judge have been exercised by the house of lords and those of accuser by the house of commons might in the character of models or as the term is precedents afford some instruction i may perhaps before this letter is closed be able to procure a list of the most apposite and recent of these impeachments with references as to the publication in which they may respectively be seen with one observation more which is my own on hearing read for it is only by my ears that i can read any such small print as that in newspapers on hearing read a short paragraph relating to the mode of proceeding on this occasion it appeared to me that application made from the chamber of deputies for documents to serve as evidence preuves to ministerial offences had experienced refusal this same refusal presents itself to me as being a flagrant violation of the spirit of your constitution if the charter can be called a constitution and that constitution has any spirit in it—as flagrant a violation of that spirit as well as of one of the most incontestable principles of justice as can easily be conceived thus much as to the spirit as to the letter for the reason abovementioned i have refrained from taking cognizance of it in introducing colonel leicester stanhope to j b say bentham says— jeremy bentham  th september      j b say bentham to j b say extract  th september      well then now for his claims to such distinction though i have not time not to speak of yours for more than a small part of them the services rendered in british india to the east india company by the late marquis hastings in so far as conquests costing more than they produce are services—services more extensive than were ever rendered before by any one governor in that part of the world—are matter of notoriety marquis hastings was a lord like other lords two private secretaries he had one for military affairs colonel young—also an intimate friend of mine—a man of most transcendent worth in respect of morality intellectuality and active talent—uniting the accomplished utilitarian statesman with the man of letters the mathematician c c—and this stanhope in these two men those who were in the way to be informed have seen the real authors of the sobrilliant successes to which the marquis gave his name stanhope is   moreover a highly distinguished philhellene of his services in that cause in that unhappy country—services like all others that have been expended there unhappilyso unavailingly—his interesting work on greece among other things contains some particulars but here i must cut short he is one of the ten or eleven sons of the earl of harrington captain of the kings body guards governor of windsor castle c c of his three sisters one is married to the premier peer of ireland—the duke of leinster another to the heirapparent of the english duke of bedford abstractedly considered la fayette would not like him the better for this any more than you and i but considering that notwithstanding all this he is as thorough a radical as the best of us here you see is no small merit in a letter i gave him once to dumont i spoke of the disadvantage he labours under in respect of birth and parentage adding with equal candour and discernment the observation that this was no fault of his—he could not help it dumont received this tout bonnement he took my illustrious friend for a bastard or something of that sort and for aught i know received him accordingly know you anything of arthur oconnor—an irishman—lieutenantgeneral at any rate so he was in buonapartes time in the french service he was at the head of the irish rebellion anno      he has an estate of between £ 000 and £ 000 ayear in ireland retaining it still because lord castlereagh of blessed memory could not come at the evidence necessary to get it from him he is married to a daughter of the marquis de condorcet with whom he has a fortune of £ 000 ayear—the philosophic marquis who was a retainer of dalembert and had not a liard having married a rich wife anno     —oconnor though made a lieutenantgeneral by buonaparte had not seen him for some years on the commencement of buonapartes reverses oconnor called on him and said you are an emperor i as you well know am a republican i would not therefore seek to obtrude myself but now under existing circumstances i thought it might not be displeasing to you to hear from my own mouth that my fidelity respect and gratitude continue unimpaired buonaparte shed tears once in the course of his reign so you know did plato la fayette november  0      lagrange jeremy bentham la fayette to bentham lagrange november  0      my excellent and illustrious friend— since your last and muchvalued communication dated end of august has reached me i have received neither printed books manuscripts narrative or visit from monsieur rey or felix bodin it is true i have remained on my farm at lagrange and have devoted only a few say as many hours as were requisite to improve my mind by yourenlightened and philanthropic letters and to cheer my heart with the testimonies of your esteem and friendship not that i think my observations might be useful to you besides the weight of correspondence and a series of diversified duties which press upon me in a manner disproportioned with the length of the day i am too old and rusted a soldier to be so serviceable as any of your more recent military men excepting perhaps in those general ideas when the republican citizen takes the lead of tactics and at that more lofty point of view you have nobody to consult the baneful emulation for standing armies had from the reign of louis xiv prevailed in europe small powers striving like the frog in the fable to imitate their betters when the revolution of ′   roused and armed a great nation to the institution of the national guard of france upon which mr comte has lately published an interesting book were owing the first successes against the counterrevolutionary coalition and after the imperial despotism neglecting or rather fearing the principle of an armed organization of the people depended upon its own genius and the powers of a numerous and admirable regular army whose superiority was confessed by britain and attested by victories you have seen the almost invincible host and omnipotent napoleon repelled by a popular   insurrection of germans the fate of your gallant troops inured to the trials and dangers of the spanish war in their attack upon the hasty lines of new orleans defended by an american militia has been a matter of european wonder yet when in the chamber of deputies we ask not for the dissolution of the standing army but its reduction within proper bounds so as to form a regimental nucleus for larger importations in time of war when we insist upon limiting the conscription time to three years under the colours and a lancastrian primary education and three years on furlough—so that young men when they are taught the use of arms to repel an invasion do not lose the destination of their future life when we consider standing troops as the vanguard of an armed nation and call for a general system of national guards naming their own officers—which in countries where the government is not like in the united states the people itself appears to us a necessary condition even for the maintenance of discipline—we are opposed not only by the prejudices remembrances and counterrevolutionary hopes of the ancien régime but by imperialism militarism and wilful forgetfulness of men many of whom had they not found in the national guards a source of glory and advancement might have remained in the inferior ranks of society and regular armies to the federation of    0 fourteen thousand deputies duly elected were sent by upwards of  000000 of national guards the militia of the united states amounts to   00000 men equal to defend independence liberty equality territory and legal order against a coalition of the rest of the world i thank you my dear sir for your observations on the impeachment of ministers let me be allowed as a disciple of the american school to adopt the principles which limit the judgment of public men to dismissal from office and future incapacity leaving it with the courts of justice to try them as other offenders by common law in europe it is not the case on the greater part of the continent a minister is responsible to his own master and often to the master and mistress wherever there is what is called a constitution not a written constitutional act originating with the sovereignty of the people framed by their special representatives accepted by them as it is practised in the united states as we had introduced at the beginning of the french revolution but a series of precedents chartered grants the acknowledgment of rights made by royalty on the presentation of privilege as you have it in england or a written charter acknowledging some rights abridging others denying many among which the first of them the national right to make it under this mock constitution i say the mode of impeachment of ministers includes the whole proceeding of the law what is called popular representation accuses hereditary legislators become hereditary judges the french charter has specified two offences treason and concussion which indeed extends far if misadvising the king or oppressing the king is treason and the misappropriation of public money is concussion the sense of the chamber of deputies after better elections has secured their dismissal the object being less their being brought to punishment than of such men obtaining a farther removal of chances for the return to office it is wished to effect the dismissal of administrative agents still supported by the court which would be the result if a committee of inquiry were named by the house an advantage which your parliament has over our chambers this may in some measure explain the hesitation embroglio and minorities for energetic resolutions which you have justly remarked in the management of that affair your communications of english precedents cannot but be very welcome several packets have arrived since i last heard from the noble kindhearted friend of whom you have said she had the sweetest and strongest mind that ever was lodged in a female body miss f wright the singular part suited as you observed to her singular character may be misrepresented by people not well acquainted with the purity of her heart the candour of her   mind the enthusiasm of her philanthropy the disinterestedness of her views and the vivacity of her hopes her talents indeed part of which evaporate in theories of the certainty and utility of which she has not a doubt might have been i think more efficaciously employed even to promote her own humane purposes but to know to respect and to love her will ever be in my sense one and the same thing     i am much obliged for the preference you are pleased to preserve in behalf of my syrian rose although its intrinsic merit has not stood the proof of a more commercialhorticultural examination sentimental associations are not strange flowers on the soil where she originated there they tell love tales here it has been consecrated to friendship a friendship more cordially reciprocated—your affectionate friend bentham on occasion of henry hunts attack upon oconnell wrote to him this anonymous letter— jeremy bentham daniel oconnell i am not personally known either to yourself or to mr oconnell but i am and have long been a sincere and most zealous friend of radical reform—that cause which you and he espouse proportioned to my attachment to that cause is my regret at the thought of the damage which it stands exposed to sustain from this personal altercation between two so preëminently powerful supporters of it in his letter the vituperative matter i am persuaded cannot have damaged you in public opinion in any the smallest degree in your letter likewise the argumentative matter i am equally persuaded would have produced more good effect to the cause and raised you still higher in the esteem and admiration of the readers if it had been entirely divested of the matter of the same sort which though less in quantity and coarseness it nevertheless contains along with this letter i am writing one to him with the same object the proper subjectmatter of consideration with a view to present practice is not what he has been but what he is at present and that is—the only man perhaps in the world by whom for many many years to come radical reform or any approach to it can be brought upon the carpet with any the smallest chance of success his instruments are the vast majority of the people of ireland—his operations by means of those same instruments petitionings for reform for reform in whatever shape for a commencement may be deemed to afford the most promising prospect of success for the prayer of the petition what i should prefer is—the ballot in the first place alone without any other of the features why alone because in ireland the fortyshilling freeholders compose the main body of his strength and the ballot being their sole permanent security against the option between slavery and starvation the other features would in comparison be as nothing to them and because to my knowledge there are several in the house of commons who would vote for the ballot but would not vote for any adequate if any extension of the right of suffrage if that can not be carried still less would it be possible to carry radical reform in toto on the other hand suppose it carried we should then push on with increase of strength now then—suppose him to have got up a body of petitioners for the ballot a body strong enough for the purpose of appropriate and necessary intimidation think of the support it would give you on the occasion of a speech from you at a meeting of the livery in guildhall whereas without such a support the finest speech that ever was or could be uttered would be so much sound and nothing more and so again in meetings of the common council of which it is among my ardent wishes to see you a member he in his part of the field you in yours—could you but prevail upon yourselves or be prevailed upon to forget on both sides the irrelevant matter in question you might on his arrival in london act in concert and with greatly increased effect  no you may say—he is insincere or he is fickle and he will back out again as he has done already well then for the purpose of the argument—be it so still the further he has   carried matters on in our track before he has backed out so much the better for so much the better shall we be able to do without him when he is gone but my opinion of him is—that at present in his declared advocacy of radical reform even in its complete extent he is sincere i cannot stay to give all my reasons but some of them are these—   i remember when several years ago he brought upon the carpet radical reform in its whole extent making express reference to benthams parliamentary reform catechism or radical reform bill or both i forget which at that time he gave the matter up how could be do otherwise—no support could he find to have persevered would have been thenceforward to render it impossible to make any part of the great progress he has made in his place i remember well i should have done the same   next as to the matter which you have so powerfully brought in charge against him and in particular the giving up the fortyshilling freeholders at that time i was witness to great difference of opinion between a number of intelligent men all zealous radical wellwishers to reform—all of them completely—either unexposed to or superior to sinister interest in any shape if i misrecollect not i myself was for the giving up the votes of the men so circumstanced why because their condition considered i could not at that time see any the smallest probability of their doing as they have done nowhere but in ireland could any selfsacrifice in point of numbers so extensive or a thousandth part so extensive have been produced nor even there without a sort of miracle or even by miracles for more than a time of precarious duration—a time of preternatural excitation abominable as the other conditions are every one of them to my mind—considering him as an irish catholic i myself am neither irishman nor catholic i know not how to regard him i must confess as blameable either on the score of honesty or judgment for being desirous of making these concessions rather than lose emancipation altogether emancipation in the other remaining shapes now then with this opinion with what justice can i think ill of a man for taking the course which without any personal interest in the matter i myself took or should have taken now as to the late occasion—on that occasion he gave up the motion for radical reform and submitted to the substitution of the word constitutional which as you think and as i think means nothing at all this submission he made but why for the same irresistible reason for which he made the former one as above because either the motion of which the word radical stood part would have been carried against him or if carried by him would have produced such a schism as might have left him in a state of comparative impotence so much for the motion but as to his own opinion he then declared and has since repeatedly declared that by constitutional reform he meant radical—nothing short of it other passages in his political conduct there are for which i cannot find any such justification such was his adulation and prostration in regard to the king but the failing belongs partly to his nation and partly to his profession the irish are in extremes naturally and lawyers being paid for being so are so habitually but since that time he has had a most instructive course of political experience and according to my view of the matter he has profited by it he seems to me much improved as to you sir forgive the liberty implied in bestowing upon yourself that same commendation of late i have had the pleasure of hearing it bestowed upon you and without a dissenting voice by many flowers of our radical flock whose sentiments and opinions in relation to you were till of late very far from favourable and amongst them even rivals but such rivals whom no opposition on the ground either of interest or sentiment could ever draw aside out of the path of sincerity and justice   to you it is no unexampled course to unite with men with whom you have had differences witness mr cobbett i have never seen either yourself or mr oconnell he knows not of my writing this nor of my having any such thing in my thoughts he cannot for it has not been in them longer than this day or two but i have some reason for thinking that i have some influence with him and if by an answer to this you will express a disposition to come to an accommodation and enter into an union with him as above—whatsoever influence i may have with him shall for that purpose be employed if you lay on me your injunctions not to let him know that any such disposition on your part has been manifested those injunctions shall most punctually be complied with but it seems to me it would afford a better promise if you would not for at any rate it is not with you that the proposal for an accommodation would in this case have originated and here would be so much proof of sincere affection to the cause and of good temper of which you would have set the example to him all that would remain would be to follow it to follow the example set by you i forbear giving you my name it is not necessary to the production of the effect desired and it might have the effect of loading with irrelevant matter a business of such transcendent importance which is already but too much encumbered with it i flatter myself that without discovering the name of the individual your discernment will discover in the sort of person one in whom at any rate for a purpose such as the present the requisite confidence may be placed without any such risk as need oppose a bar to it a letter directed to a z at mr byfields stationer charing cross will come to hand ps—i dread the appearance of another hasty and hot letter from oconnell before that which i am writing can reach him suppose any such letter to arrive would it not be better to put it aside unread at any rate till you have seen what if anything the letter i am writing to him has produced colonel young september  0      calcutta jeremy bentham colonel young to bentham calcutta september  0      my dear and venerated friend— i failed not to send off to rammohun roy my excellent friend the brahmin his portion of the packages contents and your letter to him and he tells me in a note that he will endeavour to the utmost of his ability to write to you on the subject of your letter and thank you for your notice of him he is a very sincerely modest man—far too diffident indeed for the remarkable and unique station he fills among his benighted countrymen his whole time almost has been occupied for the last two years in defending himself and his son against a bitter and virulent persecution which has been got up against the latter nominally—but against himself and his abhorred free opinions in reality—by a conspiracy of his own bigoted countrymen protected and encouraged not to say instigated by some of ours—influential and official men who cannot endure that a presumptuous black man should tread so closely upon the heels of the dominant white class or rather should pass them in the march of mind rammohun roy after an arduous and prolonged battle through a gradation of tribunals has at length by dint of talent perseverance and right got the better in the last resort but the strife and the magnitude of the stake and the long despair of justice have shattered his nerves and impaired his digestion and bodily health and his energies of mind it is now over and i hope most fervently that he will recover himself again not only has he no equal here among his countrymen but he has none that at all approach to equality even among the little sacred squadron of disciples whom he is slowly and gradually gathering around him in despite of obstacles from his own and our people which no one can rightly appreciate who has not seen and felt the difficulties which the condition of society   here opposes to a reformer and above all to a native reformer but he perseveres and does make a distinct and visible progress slow as it is—very slow it must increase in a geometric ratio if he is only spared long enough to organize the elements he is gathering together of resistance to superstition and fanaticism religious and political his main efforts are directed and judiciously so to the primary step in the process of amelioration—of throwing off the yoke of priesthood and of caste the diabolical genius who devised the separation of hindoos into orders who are cut off from all social and intimate connexion of what may be called a domestic nature with each other set at work an instrument complete and effectual in its operation for the political as well as the religious prostration of mankind where men may not dwell with each other in domestic association—where they cannot eat or drink intermarry and intercommune together because of difference of tribe and privilege—where this evil has been fixed and imprinted by many centuries of habitual acquiescence and under horrible penalties of excommunication—where such is the frame of society how can men combine for any useful purpose of improvement or resistance no wonder that the hindoos have always been enslaved and oppressed when they are thus effectually divided till these barriers can be weakened or broken down nothing can be done by them or perhaps for them it is against this antisocial element of hindoo society that rammohun roy directs his quiet—his secret—but his persevering endeavours and by avoiding any public alarming of the brahminical and higher orders of his countrymen—and i may add of our own jealous aristocracy of colour and of place he is obtaining the slow but distinct progress to which i have adverted—he is gathering round him a secret society of hindoos of various castes whom he persuades by degrees to associate and even eat together at his house those who go beyond this awful line of demarcation can never recede that is the higher orders and he is himself of the very highest caste of brahmins and others who are committed by the act of degradation implied in domestic intercourse with inferior tribes i fear i may have failed in impressing you with the same notions which i entertain of the infinite importance of this line of conduct as i have said before one must have personal experience of the abominations of this sort of politicoreligious aristocratical frame of society to appreciate it without that it is natural that philanthropists at a distance should think rammohun roy wastes his time and expends his valuable life and labours in work of an inferior sort—and you may fancy that he moves too slowly and does not come forward with sufficient boldness to strike at greater evils and attack men and measures of a higher order but to what end should he labour at such works if the ground be not prepared to receive the seed as yet there are none or next to none fit to comprehend the more lofty imaginings which his mastermind can grasp and on which he loves to expatiate in the confidential society of some three or four heterodox europeans but he is ploughing and harrowing and planting and our aftercomers if he lives long enough will see the fruits it is strange you will think that such a man should be looked upon coldly not to say disliked by the mass of europeans—for he is greatly attached to us and our régime not that he loves our churches or priests or lawyers or politicians but because he considers the contact of our superior race with his degraded and inferior countrymen as the only means and chance they have of improving themselves in knowledge and energy but it is one of the thousand curses inflicted by the companys régime in india that nineteen in twenty or rather ninetynine in a hundred of the only europeans who are allowed to come to this country are employés civil or military who resort hither to scrape up and carry away all they can and as soon as they can without heed or care or concern in the prosperity of india a dominating race thus encamped in a conquered country and an infinitesimally and small minority in numbers   naturally looks with the extreme of jealousy on all improvements physical and mental of the indigines or even of their own mixed descendants nor will it ever be otherwise till resort is free to all who can bring with them or obtain the means of supporting themselves settling colonizing and amalgamating and identifying themselves and their posterity with the natives      to the evil of general jobbing and general distrust there is a remedy fully and universally applicable—public opinion if independent europeans were not kept out and being here if they could speak freely through the press and were not liable to deportation at will then there would be such a check on the proceeding of secretaries and boards and councils as would deter them from jobbery and injustice then the supreme authority might safely and satisfactorily leave ninetenths of its trumpery avocations to inferior functionaries then there would be time to legislate and improve and before all things to codify while our statutebook is yet manageably small and our corps of the law have not yet maintained a strong and separate interest powerful enough to put down all improvement publicity—a free press would thus prevent our minds from stagnating and our local government would gradually assume its proper functions and would take much of its tone from the opinions of those it ruled there would be time to do good lord william bentinck seems very frank and plain very inquisitive and endowed with considerable sagacity his temper is excellent i hear i think he will encourage the press because he is honest and diligent clean hands and clear head tis not such who fear publicity i think he will promote education and do away the murder of women and children i think he will admit natives to higher offices of trust and do away the exclusion of black and coloured men from the administration of justice he is the only man i have yet seen in power who seemed to think as if he thought patronage was not private property but a trust already he has delivered himself very considerably from the trammels of clique and the bureau here who usually possess themselves of a new comer and never leave him till they bring him down to their own level as opposers of all that is liberal these are no slight éloges but they are rather prognostics than predications all happiness attend you my venerable and dear master—yours affectionately and sincerely jeremy bentham

subduing the three kingdoms he attacked the army of lawyers they repulsed him they were too many for him about sixty years ago i deserted from it and have been carrying on against them a guerilla war ever since i have got together a body which is every day augmenting i am now on the point of attacking them in force the materiel of my army may be seen in the volume accompanying this intituled

despatch court bill which i have prepared for him under him will serve some stout fellows whom i am occupied in enlisting and training but a truce to allegory it is time to speak in plain language our whole judiciary establishment with the system of procedure selfstyled the regular by which it works is one entire mass of corruption fruits of it depredation and oppression—both  0 upon an allcomprehensive scale—its proceedings have from first to last had these for its objects and effects mere illusion the so indefatigably trumpeted purity of it in comparison of the plunderage made by it trifling is that made by the most corrupt whichever it is of those whose corruption is most notorious by the plunderage which they make they are always more or less exposed to punishment of that which our judges make the whole mass is intrenched in impunity and by parliament itself under their influence the fortress has recently been made impregnable i mean—by the statute of the   d july

will find a keepplace paper pinned a single glance will suffice to show you fourteen charges by the unreserved confession even of practising lawyers—lawyers high in practice—high even in mr peels confidence—these charges are incontestably every one of them proved the eyes of the people at large are fast opening not to say already opened opened to the slavery in which they have been so long held by lawyers soon will you hear the selfemancipated slaves chorus upon chorus in full cry for justice away say they away with the technical the unintelligible mode of procedure—the regular as the somonstrouslyirregular chaos so falsely calls itself give us the only plain—the only intelligible—the only honest—in a word the summary mode give us the only mode employed by those who wish sincerely seriously and steadily to give execution and effect to that rule of action for the effectuation of which this adjunct professes to be employed give us the mode employed in the small debt courts give us the mode employed in the courts composed of justices of the peace acting singly or in any numbers elsewhere than in quarter sessions give us the only mode employed where evidence is to be elicited—where information is to be obtained by either house of parliament—the only mode in a word which is employed where a real desire has place to bring out the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth thus say already in numbers and will say every day in greater and greater numbers the people at large but to crown all speaking as i do to the head of the army i say—give us the mode—the only mode—employed in and by courtsmartial yes give us the simplicity the honesty the straightforwardness of courtsmartial yes look here duke here you are at home had you a military offence to try—had you a dispute to settle between two officers—would you be satisfied to let five years pass before so much as the first question put received an answer would the sound of a word—the word equity or any other—suffice to reconcile you to an absurdity so palpable so abominable—to every mouth that can gulp it down so dishonourable but if not in what respect can such a delay with the expense and lawyersprofit for which it was created be more conducive and favourable to civil than to military justice no the head of the army—in so far as it depended upon him—as often as a military wrong took place one moment would not wait another moment before he applied the remedy there sits lord eldon for fiveandtwenty years and more to the ruin of so many thousands of families head of the law what says this or any other head of the law to the five years would he abate so much as a single moment of it ask him not he indeed think now of the difference and—the cause of it—what is the cause of it what but this—the head of the army would be a ruined man—his army a ruined army—were he mad enough to establish any such matchless absurdity or though it were but for a moment permit it to have place but the head of the law who not only permits it to    have place but would be ready to faint at the thought of its ceasing to have place—in what way is he a sufferer by it instead of being so he is and to a matchless amount a gainer by it his vast his needless his useless his most mischievous income so many times as great as that of the head of the army is mainly constituted by it theory speculation visionary enthusiast utopian of words such as these is composed the only sort of answer which the opposers of law reform—the defenders of established turpitude—are wont or can find to make to such damning truths head of the army i repeat the question in any courtmartial that ever sits would you have five years elapse before so much as the first question received an answer would you have

fabric of government would have been thrown had you been killed or had the trial of    you for the murder of another man been substituted in the house of lords to the passing of the emancipation bill i told you i was your wellwisher even in the common form of a letter i never speak unadvisedly i now prove myself so the circumstance that induces me thus to put myself forward is this—for the entire extinction of this most pestilential practice i have a plan of the success of which i have little more doubt than of my own existence it is grounded—partly on experience furnished by this country partly on experience furnished by another country partly on the attention i have for between sixty and seventy past years been paying to the springs of action in human nature partly on the acquaintance i have made with the penal code and the system of judicial procedure as they are and as they ought to be in all their details if there be that man upon the face of the earth in whom selfsacrifice and so much more than selfsacrifice to no imaginable good purpose are less excusable than in any other it is yourself in the first place in your case what symptom of deficiency in personal courage would be your utter refusal to engage with any man in any such contest yes if for the first time you had just been taking in hand a pair of colours in the next place even supposing it conclusive proof of such an infirmity would it have rendered you incompetent or any other man competent to conduct the business of government in what shape either to yourself or to your country would any evil be produced by an imputation of that sort comparable to that which would be produced by your sudden death tother day oconnell was with me amongst other things he gave me his history in relation to duelling about a dozen years ago it happened to him to kill his man† he declares himself in private as well as in public and strange as it may seem to many of us as far as i can judge with sincerity to be a believer in the religion he professes in public not without visible signs of emotion did he speak to me of the catastrophe the effect produced by it on his mind was he said such that he made a vow and that vow was—to make atonement for the transgression and that atonement consisted in the determination never to engage a second time in the like contest but to submit to any insult or indignity how atrocious soever rather than seek or accept of satisfaction in that shape yes and to make this determination matter of general notoriety and to this his determination he had hitherto maintained and ever resolved to maintain the most inviolable adherence not so much as five minutes had the report of the occurrence reached me in this my hermitage when i sat down to write the scribble which in the original would not have been legible to you in the meantime what i hear is—that instead of being the challengee which would have been too bad you were actually the challenger which is still worse friends forsooth—how narrow must have been the views and minds of friends by whom advice with such effects in the train of it could have been given these friends—in name profession and appearance to whom were they so in reality to yourself to the king to great britain to ireland to the human species at this present time to the same species at any future time—put to each of them these questions and take note of his answers in the united states i am neither unknown nor unheeded the president and the present finance secretary were my familiar friends propensity to duelling is in that country the cardinal vice in that country still more than in ireland the plague in that shape rages if i live two years or at the utmost three years longer i shall be in no small degree disappointed if i do not see the plague as the bible phrases it stayed    for my own part in former days i thought i saw some benefits from it to mankind and committed the mention of them to writing and if i misrecollect not to the press on further consideration i have arrived at the persuasion that they amount to little if anything and that at any rate they are in a prodigious degree outweighed by the mischievous effects of which i am prepared to give a list mere insensibility to danger of pain and death is a virtue which man possesses in jointtenancy with the bull the bear and their challenger—the dog now then if to personal and physical you add moral courage i will tell you what to do go to the house of lords stand up there in your place confess your error declare your repentance say you have violated your duty to your sovereign and your country and promise that on no future occasion whatsoever under no provocation whatsoever in either character—that of giver or that of accepter of a challenge will you repeat the offence here am i leader of the radicals in that character at least am i and i alone every now and then spoken of leader of the radicals more solicitous for the life of the leader of the absolutists than he himself is what paradoxes what prodigies has not the field of politics given birth to of late i am sorry that i cannot find the dukes answer to this letter but it was immediate for bentham sent a rejoinder on the following day jeremy bentham   d march      duke of wellington q s p   d march      monday evening my dear duke— opened this moment this note of yours i must at you once more i am an englishman more than that i have my designs upon you i want to make you do what cromwell tried at and found it was too much for him i cannot afford to lose you your country remains plunged by you into a danger you seem not to be aware of i am this moment you present yourself to my minds eye with a brace of bulletholes—not in the skirts of your coat but in your body dupe to some rascal who has looked to it as a ladder to his ambition or a feast for his vengeance if one is not enough others may follow this in any number think not this is mere fancy for in aid of imagination in comes memory three cases it presents at the same moment—oconnell once more colonel burrs and target martins first as to oconnells what i did not mention before is this oconnell was sure of his mark he had made himself so in an odd way in his part of the country reigns a commonwealth of dogs their practice was to attack men on horseback biting the horses heels think not this incredible a similar commonwealth had place years ago and probably has still at constantinople anno      it made war upon me there fortune saved me oconnell travelled with pistols and practised with them upon those dogs till he became expert as above hence the contrition spoken of in my last   colonel burrs case colonel hamilton stood in the way of his ambition burr determined to put him out of the way he too had made himself sure of his mark not confession this but boast i had it from himself anno   0  or thereabouts he was my guest for months†   target martins john wilkes got him christened by this name the import you see already in this martins case it was an affair of speculation how to use pistols he had learnt from his target whom to use them upon from the case of st becket in humes history george the third was his henry the second   another case comes in this moment adams—lord commissioner adams case shooting at a great man by his leave then figuring away and making a friend of him speculation this in another shape speculations such as they are i    have likewise—but so it is it has never happened to them to take exactly this turn should it ever you see already how i should proceed taking you to practise upon common law offers me as you will see her license when my target had holes enough through it i should look back into the newspapers and say to you or of you something in the style of what lord winchelsea said—a brace of balls you would put into the skirts of my coat another brace i should put into your body here am i then a great man you a dead one now then for this my greatness what should i have to pay at the outside the cost of a years lodging in a comfortable apartment in a handsome stone building called a prison with a pleasant garden to it this punishment is what as above i call a license with reminiscences such as these in his mind could a man do otherwise than i have done and am thus continuing to do had i not i should in case of your falling a victim as above to rage or speculation read my own condemnation in my own penal code in it stands a class of offences designated by the title of negative it runs through all the other classes omission to do something from the want of which comes an evil such as is produced by this or that written act in which way murder may be committed as surely as by sword or pistol by omitting to administer food a jailor for example has murdered his prisoner—a nurse her child  england expects every man to do his duty this done i have done mine whosesoever head any blood of yours may fall upon one there is upon which none of it shall fall—and whom it is you once more see ps—respect for your time has substituted to a lengthy letter this abridgment my social affections are warm the promptitude of your attention had called forth the garrulity of old age bentham had a box inscribed by him      laudatoria aut exhilarantia in which i find this letter from oconnell— daniel oconnell   th may      jeremy bentham   th may      my revered master has given me great satisfaction by his despatch court would it were instituted tomorrow i return the entire manuscript some portion i am unable to decipher but i have read the rest and derived great pleasure from the perusal it must be—there must be a despatch court there is a pressing and daily increasing necessity for such an experiment and the experiment once made every court will soon become a court of despatch we must not however lose sight of the right of appeal as a general rule it must be preserved though the experimental despatch court may be without appeal no page blank is left for the uses of appeal i have consumed some time struggling for my seat for clare i hope it is not time lost i am certain it has enabled me to be in disposition and from conviction more independent of party of every kind in the house i expect to be returned for clare again i expect it confidently now for utility—utility—law—church—finance—currency—monopoly—representation how many opportunities to be useful i leave this city for dublin on saturday morning let me have a line by the post to say whether you can allow me to go to you at a quarter before seven on friday the   th and to remain with you till eleven you must in that case give me some fish as i do not eat meat on friday any one kind of fish i am entirely careless which—i have a most orthodox dislike to every kind i do most fervently hope that you will live to see the british isles blessed with your code my humble efforts shall be most persevering to attain that most useful object i will not express—indeed i could not express—my affectionate veneration to you it increases as the period when i can start forward in the race of legal utility approaches and becomes more certain luckily the new chancery bill and justice of peace bill are postponed until next session much has been made of more untoward materials    with the greatest respect your tobeuseful disciple c general miller   th june      jeremy bentham general miller to bentham   th june      i shall give you my opinion as to the best form of government for the new states of america for the sake of obtaining in return the benefit of yours let us begin with buenos ayres or the united provinces of rio de la plata which i consider one of the most important points of south america on account of its position productions navigable rivers and commercial capabilities soon after rivadavia was appointed secretary of state in      i think it was he made the federal system the groundwork of his administration and the flourishing state of affairs which ensued goes to confirm my impression that federalism is of all forms the best adapted to the wants and genius of the natives of the provinces of the rio de la plata if not of the whole of south america the prosperity of buenos ayres excited the attention of the other provinces and i think proves the soundness of their judgment they successively sent in their voluntary adhesion and they were admitted into the federative union in      rivadavia was advanced to the presidency of the republic when most unfortunately he could not let well alone the system which had worked so well was discarded and the spirit of innovation substituted the one and indivisible or as they called it the central form of government but gaucho sense would not tolerate the measure which deprived them of a positive good nor gaucho pride brook the change which conferred on buenos ayres a palpable supremacy division arose and the provinces severally withdrew from the federation we have seen that fine portion of america retrograding from bad to worse until it has become a question whether a war of colour will be the fatal consequence of rivadavias grievous error where this horrid state of things is to end is difficult to foresee but it appears certain to my mind that buenos ayres might slowly restore the provinces to the federal bond by the reestablishment of a good government but that she will never be able to conquer them by force of arms nor indeed ought she to wish it for provincial jealousies and petty feuds cannot deprive her of the metropolitan precedency which geography assigns to her in the argentine territories and which might render her an emporium like what venice was in former days having said so much relative to buenos ayres it is unnecessary to add much with regard to peru or any other of the states for i have observed that a strong family likeness runs through the different spanishamerican nations as far as i have had an opportunity of observing them peru under a liberal steady honest economical administration would soon be possessed of the elements of wealth strength and happiness more than one palmyra would probably be seen to arise in the midst of her arid and now tenantless deserts and lima might become a second tyre if the mines of potosi could draw   0000 inhabitants to one of the most barren of regions can we doubt the power of the precious metals the staple produce of peru reperforming a similar miracle whenever human enterprise prompted by the love of gain shall be left uncramped by vexatious restrictions and oppressive misrule i have sometimes been asked if i thought monarchy suitable to the wants and wishes of the south americans to this question my answer has invariably been a negative in this i am borne out by the untimely fate of iturbide and by the failure of the president for life—that halfwayhouse sort of elective monarchy which was overturned in peru and bolivia and rejected in colombia i do not mean to say that no monarchies can be established in south america what i assert is that no king can be forced or force himself upon the south americans there is scarcely a fortified town throughout the continent and there is no aristocracy upon which to rely the only way in which a monarchical form of government will again be adopted in these states will be from some president—let us suppose in chili for the    sake of argument—rendering himself extremely beloved and popular the people might then elect him king of the democratic forms i give an unhesitating preference to the federal it is upon this point that i should feel most happy to be favoured with your friendly instructions let them be plain and suited to the capacity of an unlettered soldier of fortune who may perhaps be placed in circumstances where his opinion may be called for and where it may be listened to with some attention in taking into consideration any legitimate system as applicable to spanish america do not i beseech you lose sight of the facts that the people there must be counted as something that standing armies are there peculiarly incompatible with lasting tranquillity and that no government however strongly fenced round by bayonets can long stand its ground unless it be the peoples choice and upheld by that support which is to be permanently secured only by justice and integrity josé del valle   th may      guatemala jeremy bentham josé del valle the president of guatemala to bentham translation guatemala the   th may      sir— want of conveyance in consequence of the little intercourse between this country and england has been the cause of my silence during the preceding months i was not able to send my letters and i had not the honour to converse through them with mr bentham but your respected voice has reached me through the medium of the works which you have written for the universal good of mankind you sir have multiplied yourself in them you live in all civilized countries you will live in all ages a wise man is of all beings the one who most approaches the divinity which is omnipresent i avail myself of the opportunity now offering itself in mr t ackerman by whom to your metropolis i have the pleasure of sending you a collection of the gold and silver coins of this republic neither the coins of this country nor those of other nations of the ancient and new world are as i would wish them to be in monarchical countries they exhibit the effigy of the kings and their armorial bearings in the united states that of liberty and an eagle with the device of the federal system—e pluribus unum in the mexican republic the cap of liberty and an eagle perched on a nopal the cactus or cochineal feedingtree with a serpent in her beak in central america the tree of liberty and five volcanoes representatives of the five states which form the republic in the peruvian a female figure representing liberty and the armorial bearings of the city of lima in the united provinces of the river of plata the sun symbol of the union and the cap of liberty in chili a volcano emitting fire a column supporting a small globe above this a star and higher still the word liberty c the other symbols of american republics have the same defect for there are diverse nations which have eagles nopales c in the pictures of serpents suns eagles c i see a something like relics of ancient barbarism and the cap of liberty appears to me an affectation unnecessary where it liberty positively exists and ridiculous where it is only nominal in all nations which are not oppressed by tyrants or despots there ought to exist a legal liberty the symbol which represents it might in this case be put on the coins of all constitutional governments in which case the application made of it would be coextensive with the distinguishing character of the form of government which it is designed to present to view and in each political state to this generally applying should be added a specially applying symbol peculiar to itself i should like to see that in monarchies and in republics the coins bore on the obverse side an image representing congress parliament or cortes and on the reverse side the bust of the king or of the supreme chief of the republic that further on the first be expressed the name of the congress parliament or cortes and the number of    deputies and senators that form it and that on the second be shown the name of the monarch or respective chief of the nation the coins would then partake of the august character which distinguishes the high powers they would be precious monuments for the history of the constitutional epochs and eternal opprobrium to the tyrants who seek to annihilate constitutional government and to make themselves absolute another thought which strikes me at this moment might there not be on the reverse side an image representing the two highest powers—the legislative and the executive and on the other side the map of the kingdom or republic—upon a very diminutive scale the map of a nation would give to its coins the most unequivocal character of nationality they would be more conformable to the spirit of the age which is not like former ages—pleased with lions castles ladders and apes but on the contrary with everything that is positively useful and adapted to the existing civilisation it would inspire a taste for the study of the geography of the country even down to the lowest class of the people i do not know whether you mr bentham have everturned your thoughts to the subject of coins—those thoughts which have been applied with so much utility to legislative science if mine were worthy of your suffrage this would afford me real satisfaction if on the contrary i shall at least enjoy that of having endeavoured at the improvement of what appears to me to be in want of it the following are extracts from benthams answer— jeremy bentham september          josé del valle bentham to josé del valle september          coins— what you say on this subject shows the expandedness and expansiveness of your mind it would however have been still more gratifying to me to have seen it when applying itself to subjects on which its labours might have been employed in the production of effects in which contribution to public happiness had been more determinate and unquestionable first as to exhibiting the outline of the territory of the state this by wars and treaties would be constantly exposed to variation and in case of cession could be liable to excite painful comparisons and recollections—secondly as to numbers of the members of legislative assemblies these too whatsoever be the number of the assemblies of which the legislature is composed would be continually experiencing variations naturally and generally in the way of increase—such variations have been experienced in england in france and in the angloamerican united states c c i am inclined to think almost everywhere liberty of the press in the ordinary acceptation of the word—so far so good but in that sense it may have place and at the same time a state of things opposite to that looked for from it under every government and in particular a democratical one the principally effective literary instruments of good and evil are the periodical and amongst the periodical the most effective those of which the recurrence is most frequent the daily more than the everyotherday papers the everyotherday more than the weekly and so on suppose now one such paper in existence and no more here the liberty would be a mere illusion instead of useful that paper might be worse than useless first take that which is the most natural supposition—this one paper edited by government or under the influence of government all truths by which indication is given of imperfections in the system of government or misconduct on the part of the governors are suppressed all lies and bad arguments tending to produce on the part of the people approbation of those imperfections or that misconduct or disbelief of their existence are inserted and all contradictions to those lies and counterarguments against and refutations of those bad arguments are kept excluded even suppose that for a time the    newspaper editor—this master of public opinion—is honest and gives insertion to communications which on any of the above accounts are unpleasant to government of such a state of things the duration will always be precarious for the more active he is in this line of beneficence the more troublesome will he be to the constituted authorities and the stronger will be the interest by which they will be incited to gain him over at any price being thus gained over he will not only be useless to the cause of the subject many but worse than useless good in the shape of reward thus misapplied does double the mischief that could be done by evil thus misapplied in the shape of punishment all that the fear of punishment could do would be to restrain the man from serving the cause of the people while hope of reward besides producing that negative bad effect might in any degree be producive of the positive bad effect of causing him to do positive disservice to the interest of the people even suppose him still honest and honest to the end still by giving publicity to his own notions to the exclusion of all others he might lead public opinion astray to any degree and would be sure so to do to a more or less considerable degree though without intending it now then how to obviate this evil and reduce it to its lowest pitch in one of the new words of my coinage to minimize it this is matter of no small difficulty and as yet has never anywhere that i ever heard of been attempted as to what is written in the person of the editor there is no remedy of this part the tendency will be such as by whatsoever motives he is inclined to make it against this partiality the only remedy is that which can be applied by other persons in the character of his correspondents if matters can be so ordered that he shall stand bound to give place to observations in equal quantity made in opposition to his own or those of any other writer upon the side which he advocates this is as much as can be done when miranda son of the celebrated general miranda with whom i was on intimate terms went some years ago from this country in which he was born and bred to colombia i think it was—at that time venezuela—to set up a newspaper in the english style i drew up for his use a little plan having for its object this species of impartiality and independence as far as practicable at so short a warning i have not been able to lay my hands on it or i would have sent it to you or a copy of it—if i succeed you shall have a copy by the next conveyance in the meantime you will perhaps turn your thoughts to the consideration in what manner as matters stand in your country the problem may be accomplished the king of france is determined to endeavour to reëstablish despotism i have before me the words of a short but decisive conversation on the subject between him and the duke of orleans this from a man who had it from the duke the people are determined to resist the king in which case if they succeed the duke of orleans will succeed to the crown probably with an authority still more limited than at present here there will be a civil war unless the king grows frightened and yields which seems most likely a man is

homage is the more sincere for being capable of springing from one cause only namely—my conviction of your paramount utility to mankind an utility which could never have existed if to the most clear intellect in the world you had not added the perpetual and cheerful energy of continued perseverance i intend to get up a shorter codification petition—indeed several petitions for codification—that is for the draft of a code i think the honourable house as there is to be no expense but that of printing will yield to my reasoning or if not to my repetition—not to say my teazing and advertise on

revered master— to begin with the beginning—i did get your half letter as i was leaving the cork assizes and wrote a reply but an accident caused it not to be sent and then i had a thousand things to add—and then i determined to write fully when i was just about to open the winters campaign i give myself six or seven weeks here of comparative mental inexertion this is the wildest and most stupendous scenery in nature—and i enjoy my residence here with the most exquisite relish i have a pack of beagles with which i hunt on foot three days in the week they are of the very best and most sagacious quality i am in truth fascinated with this spot and did not duty call me elsewhere i should bury myself alive here as to the remainder the change of scene—of hours—of habits—of exercise—gives a new tone to my mind and i leave this place with a new impulse and with my mind new strung for reform and utility in every shape and form tomorrow i spend as my last day this season in hunting on monday i leave for dublin—all for work—incessant work i give you this sketch to show you why i have been less active in pursuit of useful change for the last six or seven weeks my winters campaign commences my first duty is to discharge my debt to you the history of the catholic association wyses omits that part of the struggle which is most interesting and is most instructive—i mean the working up of small means into mighty engines the progress from political infancy through political infantile squabbles into something of youthful strength and then into great manhood and vigour this session—now or never for law reform we must begin the first day of the session before the kings speech if possible no delay no vacation the lawdespatch court is independent of the code it is just what in my judgment ought to be brought on at once i will be in london please god a week or ten days before the honourable house sits i will take with me a great number of petitions for justice speedy inexpensive and real justice but it is not now practicable to send round in ireland lawpreachers—preachers of law reform you can form no adequate idea of the present state of the public mind in this island we are in the last stage of the politicoreligious fever i have been watching its symptoms and permitting nature to take its course believe me the patient will be soon well and strong soon and fit to teach a lesson to the nations on all    subjects of public amelioration the orange symptoms might easily be exasperated by irritation it is left to disappear of itself and is disappearing you shall—you will hear of ireland with pleasure before the traffickers meet again in st stephens chapel i am much deceived if law reform and parliamentary reform do not meet with powerful assistance from ireland shortly—very shortly i get the westminster review by post as soon as it is published the triumph over the edinburgh is complete that controversy is terminated unless the edinburgh renews it i am also an active agent for the circulation of the westminster not one of the mercenary agents can be more zealous simply because i feel the value to public opinion of that work i have no objection that you should show my letters to any person you please i give you the most unlimited discretion on that subject both for the past and future including the present i do this without any feeling of vanity because i know that a man ignorant as i am may possibly be the means of suggesting a train of thought which may lead superior minds to objects of great utility do with my letters just what you please i trust the american republics will at length settle into peace the number of selfish beings which their revolutions have produced desirous of converting the popular struggles into individual advantage is not creditable to them but their materials for change were of the worst description and to this i verily believe much of the conduct of bolivar which appears suspicious is to be attributed look back however at his career and behold what eminent services he has rendered to liberty it was his generous persevering ardour that in spite of every motive to despair enabled him at length to crush the spaniards in colombia and thereby to lay the foundation of freedom in other and even very distant provinces he first taught the natives that the spaniards were not invincible then he established the perfect equalisation of civil rights amongst all castes and colours do not i beg of you give him up without sifting the evidence against him closely his accusers amongst his countrymen are mean and selfish individuals who cannot submit to the superiority of talent and virtue society is in its most discordant elements around him and it may be difficult to confide power to an unformed ignorant scattered population if i must abandon my reliance on the purity of bolivar i will shed a tear for poor human nature but no i venture to prophesy that he will live to have his patriotism and disinterested virtue recognised all over the world i know general miller and think very highly indeed of him i read the historical part of his work and will seize the first leisure moment to read the remainder of it i do entirely agree with you that he is a very interesting and highlygifted man my accident was much less serious than as represented in the newspapers i was not for one moment insensible but having been dashed violently against the ground i was unable to rise for about one minute in ten minutes afterwards i was as competent to assist my brother who broke his arm as if i had not fallen at all the terrors of the place too are much exaggerated but why should i detain you respecting an incident which would be forgotten by myself but that the papers have fabricated an article on it and what is to me really precious that you have expressed so much of kind solicitude for me—believe me i am most cordially grateful i have read or rather am carefully reading your book on judicial evidence it affords me the greatest satisfaction but i must release you from this lengthened communication let me first call on you for suggestions—say commands as to my parliamentary career if you think it right i will begin with the despatch court—that is the first or second day of the session then the natural as opposed to technical procedure—at least a petition on this subject then an address to procure a    code every day i will have a petition on some one or more lawabuse it seems to me that it will be useful to have a talk on this subject almost every day so many people have to complain of the expense and delay of the law that thus stimulating the expression of public opinion cannot but be useful—i am with the sincerest respect your zealous disciple c edward livingston  0th august      new york jeremy bentham edward livingston to bentham new york  0th august      sir— i had intended to delay the request that you would do me the favour to accept and peruse the codes of criminal law which i am preparing for the state of louisiana until i could offer the whole system for your examination but a delay has taken place of which you are the cause in preparing the code of evidence and my impatience to have a direct communication with you has induced me perhaps indiscreetly to send you the parts of the system which have been printed for consideration together with the preliminary reports explanatory of their provisions the code of evidence which is wanting to complete the system was ready about two years since to be put to the press when i heard of the publication of your rationale of judicial proof evidence and i could not think of taking another step until i had received all the lights i was sure this work would throw on the course i was pursuing notwithstanding my endeavours to procure a copy from england i have by some unaccountable fatality been constantly disappointed but have lately been fortunate enough to procure the only set i believe in the united states i am now studying it closely and already find more than enough to make me rejoice that i was not more precipitate in my publication while at the same time i feel a pride in discovering that many of the provisions i had inserted have received the sanction of your judgment it is more than thirty years ago that then representing this city in the house of representation of the united states i made an ineffectual attempt to mitigate the severity of our penal laws the perusal of your works edited by dumont fortified me in a design to prosecute the subject whenever a fit occasion should offer it occurred about twenty years after by my election to the legislature of louisiana whither i had removed and i used the confidence of that state by offering them the system you will find in the accompanying package it is now under the consideration of a joint committee of both houses and its fate will be decided in the course of the winter session the favourable notice taken of the first report in england and elsewhere in europe has had a considerable effect in predisposing the public mind to receive it in laying before you this work i offer you little that you have not a legitimate title to for hereafter no one can in criminal jurisprudence propose any favourable change that you have not recommended or make any wise improvement that your superior sagacity has not suggested with the greatest veneration for your character and the highest admiration of your useful labours i am sir your most obedient servant dumont the most distinguished of benthams disciples preceded him by a few years to the grave the announcement of this event was communicated to him by dumonts nephew— m dumont  th october      geneva jeremy bentham translation geneva  th october      the friendship which you felt for our excellent uncle his attachment and admiration for you imposes on his family the painful duty of announcing the misfortune we have just experienced m dumont has been removed from us—removed most unexpectedly and what adds if it be possible to add to our grief far away from his family he left us a few weeks ago full of health for a journey in italy at venice a slight indisposition induced him to precipitate his departure but arrived at    milan the disorder assumed a serious character and in a few days he died if anything could lighten our loss it would be to think that no sufferings accompanied his last moments and that he slumbered away in the arms of the friend who accompanied him accept sir the expression of the sentiments of respect and veneration with which the excellent man for whom we mourn has inspired us for your person a few days before his death dumont thus wrote of bentham— m dumont jeremy bentham translation what i most admire is the manner in which mr bentham has laid down his principle the development he has given to it and the vigorous logic of his inductions from it the first book of the principles of legislation is an art of reasoning upon this principle of distinguishing it from the false notions which usurp its place—of analyzing evil—and of showing the strength of the legislator in the four sanctions natural moral political and religious the whole is new at least with regard to method and arrangement and they who have attacked the principle generally have taken good care not to make a special attack upon the detailed exposition of the system egotism and materialism how absurd nothing but vile declamation and insipid mummery look into the catalogue of pleasures for the rank which the author assigned to those of benevolence and see how he finds in them the germ of all social virtues his admirable treatise upon the indirect means of preventing crime contains among others three chapters sufficient to pulverise all these miserable objections one is on the cultivation of benevolence another on the proper use of the motive of honour and the third on the importance of religion when maintained in a proper direction—that is to say of that religion which conduces to the benefit of society i am convinced that fenelon himself would have put his name to every word of this doctrine consider the nature and number of mr benthams works see what a wide range he has taken in legislation and is it not acknowledged that no man has more the character of originality independence love of public good disinterestedness and noble courage in braving the dangers and persecutions which have more than once threatened his old age his moral life is as beautiful as his intellectual mr bentham passes in england whether with justice or not i am unable to determine for the chief i mean the spiritual chief of the radical party his name therefore is not in good repute with those in power or those who see greater dangers than advantages in a reform especially a radical reform i do not pretend to give an opinion either for or against but it must be understood that he has never enjoyed the favour either of government or of the high aristocracy and this must guide even in other countries those who desire not to commit themselves for mr benthams ensign leads neither to riches nor to power in a letter to oconnell of   th october bentham speaks of the publichouse licensing system as a most maleficent source of corruption oppression and depredation and says among your parliamentary agenda will naturally be the extinction of it but this will be included in the local judicatories oconnell answers— daniel oconnell nov        dublin jeremy bentham oconnell to bentham merrion square dublin nov        i found here awaiting my arrival a letter from my revered master i hasten to reply before i am entangled in the act of profession my time now reckons by the minute but did i count it by the dropping of my hearts blood i would devote some of it to the man who has done more to ensure the destruction of abuses and the establishment of common honesty than any other human being i ever knew or read of the honourable house shall hear the name of bentham—a name which it would seem has been considered too harsh hitherto for ears polite i will    if you approve of it drive at once to the framing of the code no committee to cushion it no reward to create contention and excite patronage and favouritism your plan simply printing at the public expense—the sentiment of glory and utility the only stimulants—you will live to see your work printed at the national expense and i trust finally adopted my humble name will in spite of the sneerers be found in some margin or beneath the last page and i too will have done the good work of facilitating right and justice and abolishing perjuries and useless oaths the publichouse licensing system is really more surprising if possible than abominable how john bull can be so stupid a dolt as to submit to it is portion however of that practical despotism which the jurisdiction of irresponsible justices has established with an iron hand in england and ireland without responsibility or any that exists almost perfect as a mockery and without appeal the bench of justices collectively and in detail have made the people feel despotism in its worst shape—its emaciating consistency of oppression but for collateral advantages in these countries i would prefer to live under the simple tyranny of a turkish cadi to the endurance of the complicated oppression of an unelected irremovable irresponsible incorrigible bench of justices of the peace—all this they are in fact this remedy comes within the immediate head of local jurisdiction the kings bench is the avowed accomplice of the crimes of the magistracy but you catch my sentiments on these subjects i will endeavour to avail myself of your accuracy and distinctness of mode of redress from your faithful disciple bentham was much distressed by some of oconnells attacks of a personal and almost private character by which he deemed he was damaging the cause of reform and lowering his individual influence and reputation he told me he had been considering how best to make an effort to check his excitable but most beloved friend and he determined to write to him an anonymous letter of which this is an extract— jeremy bentham  0th november      london daniel oconnell bentham under the name of philoconnell to oconnell london  0th november      sir— this comes from a sincere admirer of you and a zealous friend to the catholic cause so far as is consistent with the welfare of all besides it is with proportionable grief that i read your tirade—your altogether undiscriminating tirade—against the liberals as contained in the morning chronicle i flatter myself you will see that in what i am about to say my object is not to cast reproach upon you or to cause an atom of unnecessary uneasiness in your mind but merely to do what depends on me towards prevailing on you to abstain from such reproachful sallies in future to the class of serviles or to that of liberals are generally recognised to belong all men with whom on a political account you have anything to do even serviles those called also sometimes tories sometimes absolutists under the denomination of liberals are commonly regarded as included as well whigs as radicals absolutists are all of them against you and accordingly so are you and of necessity making unceasing war upon them under the head of liberals are comprised all to whom you can look for assistance in the character of friends what on this or any occasion could have possessed you thus to runamuck malay like against all your friends yes against all your friends with the exception of a comparatively small number of zealous catholics to what useful purpose can you thus wage war upon them in proportion as you damage their reputation supposing on your part the capacity of thus producing in any degree that effect would not you be weakening your own force no surely by any such vague reproaches for which no specific grounds are alleged and for which all such grounds would be out of season by any such ungrounded reproaches if any    reputation be impaired it will not be that of those against whom but of him by whom they are uttered on what supposition is it that you thus make war upon them is it not that they are either noncatholics or nonchristians but in either case what good is it possible you should derive even from success in this same unnatural war is it by vague reproaches in that or any other shape that any man can expect to convert any other man to the catholic faith or to any other talking in this strain you afford gratification it may be supposed to your own momentary feelings—and sorry am i to be obliged to call them your own antisocial feelings—you who so laudably abound in social ones of the best and most extensive class this gratification you afford yourself but how dearly do you not expose yourself to pay for it all this while what is the object and end in view of the liberty i am thus taking with you is it to give you pain in any shape this you will see it cannot possibly be for if it were it is not in this private but in the most public manner that i should address you it is on the contrary to preserve you from all future pain if possible from the like source it is to prevail upon you to abstain from drawing it down upon yourself by any more such manifestations of hostile feeling towards almost all those among whom for any of your great and beneficent purposes you can look to find friends true it is that what is past cannot be recalled but what i comfort myself with the hope of is that when you come forward upon the great carpet with your noble plans of real reform the memory of these escapades will be drowned in the blaze of your unexampled merits and your matchless eloquence would you wish can you endure to see a specimen of the effect actually produced by this sortie of yours read it if you have not read it in the examiner in the no of the earliest day thereafter ensuing perhaps it was noticed in examiner more than once being of the number of your sincerest admirers and however unknown friends i sign myself philoconnell and in a letter to oconnell signed by himself and written at about the same time he says— jeremy bentham nov        daniel oconnell nov        dan dear child— whom in imagination i have at this moment pressing to my fond bosom—put off if it be possible your intolerance endure the conception and even the utterance of other mens opinions how opposite soever to your own at any rate when you assume the mantle of the legislator put off the gown that has but one side to it—that of the advocate as to evil tendency of opinions and insincerity in the profession of them and any sinister interests by which in the character of motives the declaration made of those same opinions may have been produced—these are points quite different and distinguishable from the entertaining of those same opinions not that under the assurance could i but entertain it that i should thereby avoid giving you pain not that there is any opinion of mine that it would cost me any pain to forbear exhibiting to your view but that in the nature of the case no such assurance is obtainable it would require that i should be in possession of an exact list of all your opinions—at any rate of all that are of any considerable importance in a religious or political view present and future all your opinions not present alone but future likewise what a comfort it would be to me could i but receive your assurance that you have taken yourself to task on this ground and that the result of it has been a resolution to embrace in words as well as deeds that charity which is called caritas and which whatever it thinks for we are not masters of our thoughts at any rate and in particular of my opinion i who write this feel too plainly i am not avoids at any rate speaking evil evil speaking—speaking evil of any person for not doing that thing which it is not possible to do or    for not doing anything which it is not possible to avoid doing—in a word for the nonperformance of impossibilities again bentham writes— jeremy bentham nov  0      daniel oconnell nov  0        quis tulerit gracchos de seditione querentes—   clodius accuset mœchos   the pot and the kettle   let them this matter settle behold here a further source and subject of anxiety take take in good part my dear child a sermon upon these texts the solicitorgeneral knowingly and wilfully committing an act of deception a suppressio veri by abstaining from bringing forward a matteroffact the certain consequence of which would have been the acquittal of a knot of men against whom in a capital case he by commission from the crown was acting as advocate these men not being any one of them in truth guilty of the fact charged let all this be taken for granted and the conduct manifested by it shall be as bad as you please and in a moral view the censure merited by it as severe as you please well but what then what is this but acting as an advocate doing what every advocate is hired to do and consents to do for hire for this reason amongst others it is that under my system the two branches the professional and the judicial are kept inexorably distinct when the length of time which is long enough for an apprenticeship to the art and mystery of judicature has elapsed admitted to the office of judge shall be no person who has ever practised as an advocate therefore it is that extraordinary exceptions excepted if i admitted of an exclusion of evidence as a security against deception sooner should this fall on an advocate than on a robber or murderer but you the most illustrious of all advocates—does it belong to you to pledge yourself to bring forward your great wheel to break this fly upon could you put it to any such use without bringing down no small part of its weight upon yourself in vain were i so disposed could i conceal the selfregarding interest by which this sermon wearisome as it cannot but be has been produced it is the fear of seeing worn down and rendered less respected less feared less efficient this mighty instrument—the use of which stands engaged to me for crushing in its whole enormous mass the machinery of injustice the man in question be he who and what he may—suppose him brought before the honourable house not that it is possible he should be for what he did how obvious and sure his answer what says he was it that i did more than anybody else in my place would have done that which universally—at any rate generally—is understood to be the duty of every advocate to every client in every case this done should i have been instrumental in the shedding of innocent blood not i indeed my duty to my client having been thus done nothing would have hindered me from doing what is the duty of every man to justice namely to preserve myself from the having been instrumental in the shedding of this same innocent blood that which would set everything right is a pardon and this is what under full assurance of success i should have set myself to procure what again if he should say although the individual charges brought against these men were false yet from all circumstances taken together i was persuaded of their having been guilty of the offences charged or others of the same description in that honourable place an exculpation of this sort would it not be listened to observe i speak only hypothetically for of the particular circumstances of the case other than as above i have not taken any the slightest cognizance observations to the effect of the above sermon i hear from men who are zealous friends to us and our great cause and what to say in vindication i cannot find if upon cooler reflection it should happen to you to see that matter in the same point of view you will of course take the best course that can be taken for backing out inconsistency inconsistency this is one of the rocks which my perhaps    too sensitive—i hope too sensitive—imagination presents you but too often to my view as in danger—not of splitting upon indeed but of being cast upon and more bruised than without severe suffering on my part i could behold you how could i forbear boring you with these sermons are we not linked together by our most philanthropic most meritorious our strongest and fondest hopes your reputation is it not mine all the while with delight gratitude and hope do i think of the excellent temper and endurance with which you bore—yes and upon my suggestion in relation to the so unworthy radical our false brother hunt if after all this does but annoy you without producing preponderant good speak but half a word and my dear

honoured c with all this i am dispirited i am at my wits end—and wherefore even because of you he has declared war against you are not you a liberal can you deny that you are would you wish to deny it since the name was invented have you ever ceased to answer to it on the monday he is at your feet he was a benthamist on the thursday you are the object of his declared abhorrence he is an antibenthamist and in the meantime what is it you have done can you have any doubt of this if after that declaration any doubt is left look to his silence his letter of more than a month ago nov   is the last you will have from him he is a tool in the hands of the jesuits he is a weathercock and their breath the blast that determines its direction those to whom you are most indebted for what you are for your having devoted the whole of your long life to the service of mankind those by whose means he himself became what till the other day he was—a benthamist these are now among the objects of his proclaimed abhorrence in england the men of his own religion are cold to him and indifferent liberals all to a man his warm friends and the only ones and this is the return he makes to them the friends of liberty all over the world those are the men he thus makes war upon the liberal spanish cortes—the liberal portuguese cortes—all over late spanishamerica the constituted authorities with the exception of bolivar till tother day the liberator now the subjugator the declared enemy to all useful lights who after trumpeting my works and declaring that they had given to politics and morals the certainty and precision of mathematics has made it a crime in every man to have so much as one of them in his possession in a word he has made himself to be in his part of spanishamerica what the beloved ferdinand was—completely absolute with the single exception of the person of the despot he has reestablished the ancien régime and what is it that has produced the alliance between him and oconnell one simple merit which absorbs and stands in the place of all others—he has reëstablished and is reëstablishing monks well and what of that are these monks jesuits no but tell them they have taken the vows to disobey the command which says increase and multiply and this is the merit which in the eyes of a father of a family suffices to outweigh the most flagitious crimes with inflexible pertinacity he adheres to the religion of his fathers—to the opinions under which he was born and bred the liberals in all their    varieties of opinion do the same thing and thus it is by pursuing the very same course that he pursues they have made themselves the objects of his abhorrence in what consists their crime—the crime of the very worst of them in differing with him on a question of evidence on the credit due to statements of facts selfdeclaredly improbable—statements written in early and comparatively uninstructed ages—statements unsubjected and unsubjectable to the test of crossexamination granting these statements to be all true yet is it a crime—an unpardonable crime—not to be convinced by them not to be able to comprehend what he himself declares to believe to be incomprehensible he thinks it is in the infallibility of the pope or of the church whoever it is he means by the church and after all in whose infallibility is it that he is believing in whose but his own his opinion is that their opinion is infallible and is not his own then the opinion on which his confidence of the supposed infallibility rests fasting prayers celibacy selftormenting in any or all shapes can it atone for and in the scale of good and evil preponderate over allcomprehensive beneficence this and more in abundance to the same effect is what i have been doomed continually to hear from all around me and what can i find to say in answer just nothing i am struck dumb i stand mute i shrug up my shoulders this is the condition in which you have placed me will you can you say anything do anything that will help me out of it unless you can to what end come hither and take your place in the house of commons the men you have declared war against is it to them that you look for support the whigs and the radicals—of these are composed the liberals—remain the tories is it to the tories that you look for coöperation in the dissolution of the union to the wellingtons and the peels for the abolition of their own tyranny if it is to irishmen alone that you look for the shaking off the yoke and among irishmen to the roman catholics alone whose wish it is to be governed by the jesuits will not any endeavour of yours go farther where you are than here my dear dear oconnell—oh no it is not in anger—it is in grief of mind that i say this hate me as you will i defy you to make me hate you—i defy you to prevent me from being your wellwisher and not merely your motiveless wellwisher but your faithful servant and your benefactor if possible if by anything i can say or do any addition can be made to your greatest happiness as witness these presents written in a moment of dejection—not to say despondency at the close of a night occupied in dreaming of you to this

m p—letter to president jackson law reform in america french politics—humann of brussels—rev humphrey price bentham was desirous of organizing an association of influential persons for expediting cheapening and popularizing the administration of justice and for advancing law reforms in their various shapes he thought that many who would hesitate about lending their aid to the obtainment of constitutional reform might not be unwilling to cooperate for the purpose of making justice more accessible to the whole community for this purpose he obtained the promised coöperation of many distinguished men but the purpose never ripened into an efficient vitality names to ornament—reputations to attract were easily found but not so hands and heads to work so the plan was abandoned or deferred sine die and justice remains as it was a luxury purchasable by the opulent but wholly beyond the reach of the poor its pursuit vexatious—the results of that pursuit unascertainable—wearisome from delay—burthensome from cost—and oppressive from uncertainty the apprehension of blindness gave mr bentham at this time no little anxiety yet he talked of the probable calamity with great composure i shall be cheerful he said blind people are cheerful and i shall escape many annoyances it was thus that in his own case he applied his maxim to look on the bright—on the brightest side of things the public may lose something by my blindness—so i want to get my generalia and my generalissima despatched if i come to dictate my style will change look at that table a board covered with a green curtain on which bentham was accustomed to pin the fragments which represented the leading principles of his writings there are the texts for my sermons but his sleep was often disturbed by gloomy dreams these are the words in which he described one of them no doubt the consequence of indigestion from which he sometimes suffered severely i have been dreaming that i lived near the thames—i walked through streets more and more gloomy i saw lugubrious houses inhabited by lugubrious people and heard lugubrious discourses i tried to escape and found all the streets into which i entered had no outlet it was always a cul de sac    in    0 bentham wrote some letters on the sale of public offices which he deemed a valuable means for maximizing aptitude and minimizing expense in answer to the objection that their sale would open the door to abuse he says with particular reference to the election of a secondary by the common council of london— jeremy bentham sir— accident having put the documents out of my reach i must cast myself upon your indulgence for any little unintended misrepresentation or repetition it may happen to me to fall into what i am ready to admit is—that suppose the office to be sold and nothing done for the purpose of obviating abuse—abuse in all possible shapes and to the highest possible amount will be a more or less probable consequence what in that view i would propose should be done i will mention presently on the other hand i am a plain man and nothing i have seen has been able to extinguish my conception that under the patronage system abuse in all its shapes would be still more abundant to a certainty than under the sale system how it should happen that any man who proposed to purchase the office should place any serious reliance on the plea in question as if it were capable of lessening the probability of his suffering in any way in the event of his misconduct in the office—in any shape whatsoever extortion oppression peculation or negligence—passes my comprehension  i have purchased the place therefore i have purchased the right of doing whatever wrong i can contrive to do by means of it such is the defence which the supporters of the patronage system put into the mouths of extortioners and peculators stating it at the same time as being an unanswerable one here it stands in all its simplicity and now in any company let any man who has nerve enough stand up and after repeating it declare it to be his belief that any man by whom extortion or peculation had ever been practised could have thought that in the faculty of making an observation to this effect he really possessed either a justification or so much as the slightest shadow of an excuse  the pistol i killed the man with i bought exactly as good an apology would this observation be for murder as that other for extortion or peculation now sir what is the assumption made by the opponents of sale when they profess to regard an observation to this effect as rendering it probable that extortion and peculation will have place to a greater extent if the place be sold for the benefit of the public than if given for the joint benefit of giver and receiver what is it but that the means of committing a crime and the right of committing it are the same thing and not only that criminals themselves are persuaded of its being so but that so are people in general likewise or at any rate that by those by whom it is not regarded as a justification it is at least regarded as an excuse no absurdity so gross but that when once it has obtained a certain degree of currency it is capable of passing for argument nay even for conclusive argument and even upon the most intelligent minds where the leisure or the motive for scrutinizing into it has been wanting in the present instance for example upon minds even of this character who can say to what extent the delusion here in question may not have had place but now it is hoped the fallacy has been displayed in its genuine colours and if so those who without any particular and sinister interest have been in the habit of accepting and passing it in the character of an argument in favour of patronage in preference to sale will have to consider whether they would not do well to separate themselves from bad company in a word to declare themselves undeceived and thus leave the corruptionists to stand by themselves singing out this their fallacy to deaf ears and scorning countenances but now suppose that spite of everything that can be said to the contrary there are people who will think that the purchaser of the office will rely upon the sort of epigram in question as a thing that will purchase impunity for him so far as this notion has place    so much the less probable will be his misbehaviour why because so many as there are of them so many spies on his conduct will he have whereas under the patronage system this cause of public suspicion and public vigilance has no place if a man purchases the place of the public nobody will have any interest in screening him in case of abuse if he receives it from patronage he has the patron or patrons who share with him in the benefit of the abuse and are little less sure to support him in it than he is to practise it the owner of an advowson—has he not an interest in the increase of tithes oh but the church patron is but one and nobody knows who he is here the patrons are many all known men—all honourable men true but were they even right honourable it would make no difference in a multitude of this sort on every occasion some one there must be or some very few that take the lead and in so far as this is the case distinguish it if you can from that of the church patron so much for the antivenality argument now for the antiguzzling argument it sticks in my throat along with the other i cannot swallow it the money if received by the persons in question will be spent in guzzling therefore it ought not to be received by them such is the argument please good sir to observe what it is it leads to it leads to this namely that on account of the trust in question to wit that exercised by the common council neither by these same persons nor by any other persons in this same trust should any money at all be ever received from any source at all—from this or from any other such must be the notion unless it be that money received from this source will be sure to be spent in guzzling while monies received from other sources will be sure to be applied to their proper purposes or will at any rate take all of them the same chance now for the proposed remedies   let the election to the office be annual why not to this office as well as to the office of common councilman itself why not in the case of the protégé as well as in that of the patron   let the bills of costs in the suits from which the functionary in question—the secondary—derives his fees or other benefits be not merely accessible on demand or accessible to none but a few—or to none but on payment of a fee be all of them printed and published for the inspection of everybody that chooses to look at them among the places in which copies would be kept would of course be that in which the common council have their meetings and in that place at least to invite attention and facilitate examination abstracts and indexes in the tabular form might be kept hung up one thing more by the house of commons petitions against abuse in all its shapes on the part of office in all its shapes are not only received from all hands but with admirable universality and promptitude printed and published if in all cases by the legislature of the empire why not in this case by the legislature of the

if you think it would contribute anything over and above the money to the great cause advance the money i will pay you on your arrival you would have more—much more—if my means were in any degree commensurate to my wishes but i have almost run myself dry by my longcontinued and persevering libations to the public service you see the cancelling line my eyes are waxing every day dimmer and dimmer and my mind more and more oscillatory or say tottering or toddling like my walk i neither see what i am writing nor remember one moment what i had    just been writing the moment before but

square place westminster london my dear admiral— i am alive though turned of eightytwo still in good health and spirits codifying like any dragon i hope to hear the like of you but the hearing it from you being under the engagements with which you complain of being overloaded hopeless i have commissioned my friend general santander who i hope will be the bearer of this to endeavour to collect satisfactory evidence of the fact—that fact so highly desirable for the benefit of the russian empire—and make report to me now for a short account of him in justification of the liberty i am thus taking with you in his behalf in the state of colombia in late spanish america in the military line he is among the heroes who have had none above them but bolivar in the civil line under bolivars presidency he has been vicepresident but in company with your humble servant having fallen into the disgrace of the archhero has been made to share the same fate being expelled from his country as well as that work of mine which had the honour of receiving so i was told two different translations into the language of yours general santander so i hear from himself as also from other quarters—general santander when in office did what depended on him towards the diffusion of my works throughout the territory of the state of which he was so distinguished a member and such was the part if any which till tother day was taken in relation to them by bolivar but of late bolivar as is natural to man and even in a greater or less degree unavoidable has been spoilt by power and having for so many years deserved—so well deserved—his assumed title of liberator—is now alas become the tyrant of his country at one time he and i had something of a correspondence and in consequence of a recommendation from me he had raised to a colonelcy a talented man of the name of hall an englishman who had been lieutenant in the english service but in the course of the opposition made to him from various quarters some person or other had made reference to some or other of my works and such was the cause for which under i know not what penalties he thought fit tother day to issue an edict having for its declared object the preventing every one of them from being read by anybody this is what i flatter myself will not be quite so easy to effect as to ordain for i have from a booksellers partnership in paris bossange frères an account of  0000 volumes of my works namely those edited by dumont in french translated into spanish and sold by them for the spanish american trade as to general santanders object in his visit to your capital as far as i can comprehend it has nothing political in it our thames he has not as yet at least set on fire or i verily believe so much as attempted it and i do not think the neva has anything more to fear from him being in easy circumstances the tyrant not daring to confiscate his property his object is i believe neither more nor less than to amuse himself by the observation of a state of society which forms a contrast with that to which he has been most accustomed travelling about till tidings arrive of the tyrantusurpers having

as myself is apt to go on and dream as if he were to see things in this wicked world afterwards if i knew any man likely to treat it more to my satisfaction than yourself i should propose it to him but as i do not i take the liberty of hereby proposing it to you it is by your work intituled foreign law that this wish has been suggested to me although of course the law there in question is law as it is including what it is supposed to be of international law as it is the principal part of the matter is composed of treaties between state and state of what it is supposed to be the matter is composed of deductions from these written instruments and from the operation of the several states in relation to one another but this is not all—other matters belonging to the subject are the variations the demand for which is presented to the government of every state by these circumstances—that the individual thing which or person on whom or in favour of whom or at the charge of whom it has it in contemplation to exercise its several powers for its several purposes on the several occasions in question is not a thing or person belonging in ordinary and for the most part to this same government itself but one belonging to some other government between sleeping and waking i am thus insensibly running over a ground which i believe i have touched upon already and on which therefore there was little use overwhelmed as i am with the urgent business of the day in my setting my foot the first thing a man has to do in building is to see and settle in its whole dimensions the ground he has to build upon to my own purpose at any rate perhaps these few hints broken as they are may be not altogether without their use what i should have been and should still be glad to do is to circumscribe it in every direction—but this is not yet done as to the matter of prisons it is with unfeigned regret i have to say to you that it is not in my power to do that which you do me the honour to wish to see done by me i have not time sufficient for a load of business of my own that presses upon me and this subject is by a particular circumstance rendered distressing and hateful to

he thinks me at all doubtful on the feegathering system or that i fall short of the full measure of relief which bentham contemplates indeed if it were possible to go further than bentham does and at the same time to be right i would do so because i know practically that the mischiefs of the present system exceed not fall short of any notions which may be entertained by those who are not practically engaged in its workings i adopt the spirit of the petition for justice that petition is my legal creed i do not believe it to be infallible but i really and seriously think    it as nearly infallible as any purely human project can be the feegathering system has been attacked in ireland thus far—the fees are all now paid to the government the pecuniary emoluments of the judges are fixed and are not affected by the amount of the fees directly or indirectly even the officers whom the judges appoint are now paid by fixed salaries we are therefore suffering from the odious effects of feegathering in former times although that source of increase of mischief is slackened in attacking the feegathering system i must not forget that this is the existing state of facts but i dislike the system itself i am and ever will be its enemy—its implacable enemy in fine there never lived a more complete entire unchangeable enemy to law abuses as they exist—a more determined advocate for the domestic instead of the factitious—the summary in contradistinction to the technical form of procedure than yours very sincerely jeremy bentham   d feb    0 london edward livingston bentham to edward livingston extracts queens square place westminster london   d feb    0 sir— the honour done me by the communication you have been pleased to make to me of the proposed codes and the papers relative to them has called forth my sincere gratitude at the same time it is my misfortune to be obliged to say and it is with no small regret that i do so that the circumstances in which i am placed do not admit of my complying with the wish expressed in the obliging letter by which they are introduced i feel myself beyond all hope of being able to spin out the thread of my own ideas on the subjects in question and others intimately connected and intertwined with them and that thread once broken it is regarded as being in no small degree questionable whether there be any other hand by which it could be gathered up and carried on exactly in the same line what depends upon me towards rendering the honour which is so justly due to you shall however not be neglected it will be not the least pleasant of my cares to look out for and place these papers in such as appear to me to be the most competent hands to which they can be confided for the purpose of rendering some account of them and laying before the public any such useful observations as it may have happened to them to have elicited this enormous delay has had for its cause my desire to give you definitive information of the steps that have been taken for the giving publicity to your penal code in this its latest form an article on it will appear in the jurist—a periodical designed to be quarterly in imitation of the socalled quarterly edinburgh and westminster reviews but not very regular as to time it has law reform and improvement for its object and pursues that object with the best intentions and distinguished talent the article will be written by dr southwood smith by profession a physician but a man of genius philanthropical affections and eminentlyextensive knowledge here a natural question is—why and whence this physician answer—you know or do not know that your code in its first state has been republished here in london the act of publication was a spontaneous act of philanthropy on the part of this physician he was and is far from rich he has no patrimony no source of subsistence but his professional practice which is not by any means adequate to his merits this act of selfsacrifice found its way to the ears of john smith member of parliament president or chairman i forget which they call it of the company of london bankers one of four brothers three of whom are in the house of commons and the other raised to the peerage with the title of lord carrington by pitt the second—besides two nephews of the same name also in that same house john smith took the expense out of the hands of his namesake i say the expense for    under this our aristocracyridden and lawyerridden constitution in royal and ministerial language yclept matchless constitution expense of editing works of this nature stands no chance for reimbursement on the present occasion i wrote to southwood smith and he has consented to write i made application to the editors of the jurist and they have consented to accept and publish the jurist i am told pays no money for the articles it accepts and inserts it is matter of no small satisfaction to me to learn from mr mlane that the senate of congress is about to receive the benefit of your services i look forward with pleasure to the chance of seeing small as at my age the best chance of seeing it can be some proof that under your auspices the cacoethes codificandi to speak in the language of the adversary is become contagious by reputation at any rate if not personally mr lawrence late chargé daffaires at this court can hardly i think be altogether unknown to you i have the honour and pleasure of a considerable degree of intimacy with him he looked eventually to a seat in the house of representatives should that prospect be realized codification i dare venture to hope will receive in him a powerful support another friend i had the good fortune to make among your diplomatic functionaries was mr wheaton with whose function at new york you cannot be unacquainted and who on his way to his mission to the court of copenhagen passed some months in this metropolis an objection that is constantly made and strongly insisted upon by the adversaries of codification is that when your code even supposing it to be an allcomprehensive one is prepared whatever good was expected from it would ere long be extinguished by its being clouded and covered over by an overgrowth of judgemade law in proof of this position reference is made to buonapartes code which by its deficiency has certainly given rise to more of this matter than could be wished but were this reallyexisting law ever so much more imperfect than it is the rule of action composed of it will never be nearly so inadequate and unapt as that is which is composed of the imaginary sort of law distilled from decisions made in particular cases by judges and you or i having buonapartes code before us—and if he is a giant and we dwarfs being accordingly mounted upon his shoulders—might reasonably be expected in the ordinary course of things either of us to make a code less imperfect than his but a method has occurred to me which will render to all reallyexisting law the same sort of service as that which by coppersheathing is rendered to ships and make it as impossible for judges and commentators to defile the work of the legislator by their deductions as it is for—the barnacles i think they call the seaworms in question—to fasten their progeny upon the hulks so protected by the smooth metal of the principle of this contrivance of mine some conception may be formed from section    members motions in ch vi legislature in ch xii judiciary collectively sections     0    and    you will see the same principle applied to the decrees of judges i give to judges the power and the duty to frame amendments in terminis to the code when once made wherever they see reason—whether for the purpose of interpretation correction addition or defalcation these i require to be certified and transmitted to the legislation minister of whose duties a description is given in the section designated by his name ch xi ministers collectively the details are explained at length in those several sections of those several chapters but i stake whatever little reputation may be my lot upon my fulfilment of this assurance and i flatter myself that this account short and

hand of fellowship and take hold of accordingly occasion the symptoms manifested in a late speech or two of his in which he is coming round and attacking the army of chicane in flank at any rate not to say in front and moreover issuing a direct declaration of war against technicalities i even offer to look at those bills of his if he will send them to me as he did some former ones to these advances should he oppose a refusal expressly or by silence virtually they will heap coals of fire on his head for which purpose i have moreover some glorious matter in a letter which he therein gives

me by your most obliging letter sorry i am that by the mention made of denman in mine to which yours is an answer a sensation of an unpleasant kind has been made in one of your heartstrings with denman i never had more than one interview and that a casual one nor more than halfanhours conversation the result of which was on my part as towards him a sentiment composed of esteem and affection and the satisfaction of standing assured of the existence of a sentiment of the same nature on his part as towards me accordingly it is chiefly through the medium of general report that my conception of his character has been formed he is as far as i ever heard of the number of those few of whom everybody speaks well but high as he stands above par in the intellectual scale what i have generally heard said is that he does not in that scale stand quite so high as in the moral scale in regard to law reform i am indebted to his kindness for a copy of a pamphlet of his on that subject if my conception on that subject together with the unanimous voice of all who are acting with me is correct his suggestions taking them all together do not go to the root of the evil if adopted and carried into effect they would cut off no more than a comparatively minute    portion of it and give stability to the remainder be this as it may no call will on this occasion be made to him to declare himself it is unanimously agreed that partly for their own sakes partly for that of the public no such call shall be made to any man of the lawyer class official or professional for this purpose not even bickersteth who is a most cordial friend to law reform to its utmost extent excuse the blunders my sinking frame is continually falling into and has hitherto acceded without reserve to the letter as well as spirit of everything proposed by me by him has been revised and approved of everything that he has seen of my proposed equity despatch court bill and what he has seen comprehends the principal part of it but the newspapers and private report speak of him as likely to be one of the new judges upon the chancellors shamreform plan in which situation i should rejoice to see him placed and i will not place him in any such embarrassing situation as that of being obliged either to give or to decline giving his accession to a measure necessarily so displeasing to the higher powers as to the apprehended difference between denman and myself a few words will suffice for presenting some conception of it in regard to procedure i am for the complete substitution of the summary to the regular on every part whatsoever of the field of law he not in regard to evidence i am for a complete exclusion of the practice of excluding evidence on any such ground as that of preventing deception or that of saving a man who has done a punishable act from the need of contributing to cause it to be believed that he has done so—namely either by stating what it is that he has done or by declining so to do denman on the other hand by the opinion which in common with the generality of the fraternity he maintains or at any rate did maintain stands entangled in the inconsistency alluded to in my former letter should it ever happen to you to hold any conversation with him in relation to either of those points you will observe whether he comes to close quarters or confines himself to vague generalities from which no trustworthy conclusion can be derived in my five large volumes on the subject of evidence the rationale of evidence—the whole running counter to the current—the united current of sinister interest interestbegotten prejudice and authoritybegotten prejudice the subject of the exclusions put on evidence occupies more than a whole volume by what inducements can the perseverance of a lawyer who either is or wishes to be in full practice rare exceptions excepted be reasonably expected to carry him through a volume filled with matter the object of which is to prove that he and all men whose feelings interests and opinions are in unison with his own are in the wrong and this with such effect and to such a degree as to be hostile to the interests and detrimental

angloamerican united states sir— when your last predecessor in your high office was in this country in the character of minister plenipotentiary towards the close of his residence here it happened to me to commence with him an acquaintance which ripened into an intimacy which in my capacity of legislators draughtsman for any political community which should feel inclined to accept of my services was of very essential use to me besides some labours of a private nature he condescended to take charge and became the bearer of a packet of circular letters to the several governors of the united states as then constituted from several of whom i had the honour of receiving favourable answers by candid  0 and authentic information on several topics of high importance he was of use to me in more ways than you have time to read of or i to write days sometimes more than one in a week he used to call upon me at my hermitage as above and to accompany me to the royal gardens at kensington in my neighbourhood where after a walk of two or three hours we used to return to a têteàtête dinner what gave occasion to our first meeting was a letter of which he was the bearer from the president maddison a letter of introduction which i took the liberty of addressing to mr adams in favour of an intellectual character a relation of my friend joseph hume mp experienced that reception which i could not but anticipate you will not be at a loss sir to conceive what must have been my disappointment upon my learning of his failing to receive the customary additions to his term of service judge sir of the consolation—of the more than consolation which i experienced when upon reading your presidential message i found that upon the whole your sentiments were not only as fully in accordance with mine as his had been and in politics and legislation i do not think there was a single topic on which we appeared to differ but that they were so and i trust remain so in a still more extensive degree embracing several topics which between him and me had never been touched upon with mr rush i was also upon such a footing that in a letter of his which i still have he had the kindness to offer himself as my agent and factotum these are his words upon his return to the united states notwithstanding which several weeks before his departure for some cause which i never heard nor can form so much as the slightest guess at he dropt my acquaintance and took his departure without so much as a farewell message since his retreat from office i have however been favoured by him with the copy of a pamphlet of his without further explanation i might mention in a like manner my friendship with mr lawrence late chargé daffaires from your country to this and mr wheaton minister to denmark to whom i have been obliged for various important services but of this you will say more than enough i now look back to a letter i had begun dictating between three and four months ago cause of the long

abovementioned i am reduced to read mostly by my ears intense is the admiration it has excited in me—correspondent the sentiments of all around me  tis not without a mixture of surprise and pleasure that i observe the coincidence between your ideas and my own on the field of legislation the coincidence of mine with those of dr livingston the louisiana senator are perhaps not unknown to you the flattering manner in which he is pleased to speak of my labours in that field is in the highest degree encouraging to me the herewith transmitted publication entitled codification proposal c may serve to bring it to view these circumstances combined concur in flattering me with the hope that the present communication will not be altogether unacceptable to you annexed is a list of some of my works which solicit the honour of your acceptance here follow a few observations which i take the liberty of submitting to you on some of the topics touched upon in your abovementioned message  st navy board—in this subdepartment of the defensive force department you find i perceive manyseatedness established—by you singleseatedness i see is preferred so is it by me—for this preference your reason    is responsibility—so is it for mine but in my account though the principal reason it is but one among several this may be seen in the accompanying copy of the  st part of my constitutional code ch ix section    d after that you come to the judiciary if i do not misrecollect in your superior judicatories the bench is single seated in my leading chapter on the judiciary to all the reasons which apply to the administration department in all its subdepartments twelve or thirteen in number several which are peculiar to the judiciary are added  d utter inaptitude of common law for its professed purpose—guidance of human action places in which you may find this topic worked   papers on codification and education—  codification proposal—and   petition for codification in the volume of petitions  th superfluous functionaries—in this number my researches have led me to reckon the whole of your senate—not merely the whole expense thrown away but the whole authority much worse than useless responsibility in greatest part destroyed by a single functionary what must it be by a multitude so numerous functions legislative and administrative thus united in the same body thus the same men are judges over themselves in my view of the matter the administrative and the judiciary are two authorities employed to give execution and effect to the will of the legislative and which accordingly ought to be in the instance of every member of each at all times distinct the legislative being by means of the power of location and dislocation though not by that of imperation subordinate to the people at large—the constitutive knowing nothing of the facts my theory leads me to expect to find that the sort of relation that has place between the president and the senate is that each of these functionaries the president included locates within his field of patronage a protégé of his own without any check from the authority of the rest this is nothing more than a faint imperfect and inaccurate outline drawn momentarily by a broken memory from the recollection of a short paper written several years ago should it afford any prospect of being of any use and you will favour me with a line to let me know as much i will get it copied and transmitted to you possibly i may even not wait for such your commands it occurs to me that should our opinions agree on this subject there might be a use in the ideas being delivered as coming from me or anybody else rather than yourself seeing the opposition it would be sure to meet with from those who are satisfied with things as they are—the wound that such an opposition might give to your popularity which is as much as to say to the interests of the state  th defensive force—by sea and land its organization tactics of course neither in land nor water service am i who know nothing of the matter absurd enough to have comprised in it but the part that i have undertaken has undergone the minute examination and received the considerate approbation of leading minds of the first order distinguished not only by talent but by experience and splendid success and who indeed though without having published on the subject had in great part anticipated me an intelligent man who is in the confidence of the duke of orleans and bears the whimsical name of le dieu has been here in london for some time publishing a periodical in french under the title of le représentant des peuples he is thought to be the author of an address to the french army that after having been written here and either printed or lithographized has been transmitted to and circulated in france it has for its object the engaging the army should matters come to a crisis to act not against but for the people the abovementioned periodical i have not had time to look into but i am told that it advocates monarchy which considering the connexion of the author with a family so near to the throne as that of the duke of orleans is    he could not choose but do thinking you might possibly have the curiosity to look into it i send you a copy of such of the numbers of it as have appeared la fayette is a dear friend and occasional correspondent of mine but unless it be for some special purpose we have neither of us any time to write forgive the liberty i take of suggesting the idea of your putting in for a copy of our house of commons votes and proceedings the annual sum i pay for them is between £   and £   included in which is a copy of our acts of parliament infinite is the variety of the political information which they afford for scarcely any document that is asked for is ever refused as to the price scarcely would six eight or ten times i believe i might go further the money procure the same quantity of letterpress from the booksellers trash relatively speaking of course is by far the greatest part but if in the bushel of chaff a grain of wheat were to be found the abovementioned price you will perhaps think not ill bestowed on the purchase of it dr livingston if either of the packets i have endeavoured to transmit to him through the same official channel have reached their destination will be able to show you a few articles of the abovementioned stock if i do not mistake you you are embarked or about to embark in a civil enterprise which cromwell notwithstanding all his military power failed in—i mean the delivery of the people from the thraldom in which everywhere from the earliest recorded days they have been held by the harpies of the law having yourself officiated in the character of judge you are in possession of an appropriate experience which in his instance had no place but will you be able to resist their influence over the people in opposition to you so long as you are engaged or believed to be engaged in any such design it were blindness not to look to see their utmost influence employed the interest of the lawyers and that of their fellowcitizens in the character of clients need it be said is utterly irreconcileable you cannot assuage the torments of the client but you diminish in proportion the comforts of the lawyer if these be really of the number of your generous designs i cannot but flatter myself with the prospect of being for that purpose an instrument in your hands the contents of the accompanying packet will in so far as you have time to look at them show

print and make a short extract from them by purging them of some errors repetitions and other superfluities—which done endeavours will be used to convey it to you through the same channel as these

order in which the matter of my works can make its appearance in a new edition i can think of none better than the chronological order of the impressions—for such is the variety of the subjects treated of and such is the multitude of those which remain uncompleted and thence unprinted that the whole power of logical    arrangement is set by them at defiance and in several instances this or

excited sympathy for the suffering carpetweavers of kidderminster had published some matter which was condemned as libellous and was sent to prison he thus tells his story to bentham— reverend humphrey price  d april    0 jeremy bentham rev humphrey price to bentham county prison stafford  d april    0 sir— i am a clergyman of the established church of england some eighteen years ago another clergyman to whom i had been for eleven years a curate built a small country church in the heart of the lately enclosed forest of needwood the king endowed it with one hundred and sixty acres of forest land and i was the first person presented to it there i lived laboriously and ever in mywork silent and little known beyond the immediate sphere of my own duties eking out a livelihood for my wife and four children by pupiltaking till march      at which time the carpet manufacturers in my native town of kidderminster suddenly dropped the prices of weaving and the weavers as instantaneously struck from my dear mother who had never quitted the town i first heard of the turnout of the weavers in about a month from its commencement—of their most exemplary conduct i had been born and reared among the poor men with none other expectations as to the future than the rest of them without patronage or aid of any sort beyond a common free school however i became a clergyman settled in another neighbourhood forty miles distant from kidderminster but always keeping up my connexion with my native town by means before alluded to my heart had always yearned after the poor weavers whom i had known for many years to be gradually sinking into a state of poverty degradation and want and when i heard the particulars of the strike i instantly decided to aid the poor dear fellows to the utmost of my power of purse and pen i did so and if i were at this moment to be conveyed to the gallows for doing so i think it would be impossible for me to repent my act but being ignorant of law and unconscious of breaking it as an infant here i find myself imprisoned after the entire breaking up of my family by the expenses c for libel against sixandtwenty carpet manufacturers now for the express purpose of this letter i am writing a letter addressed to all the operatives of england upon their present state and duties this said letter as far as it is written i have read to my jailor a very respectable man but he says he dares not suffer such letter to be published without the sanction of the visiting magistrates of their permission to publish i despair nevertheless the term of my imprisonment will end in time when i shall be pro tempore at least independent of the arbitrary will of magistrates i would not however though altogether regardless of consequences when conscious of right i would not however violate any law knowingly unless i saw that it was a law i ought to violate—as for instance a law which should command me to throw salt into the fire of a heathen sacrifice c will you then sir permit me to send my letter above alluded to to you for your advice as to the legality of it i will thankfully send with it the requisite fee when known your answer though only one word yes or no will oblige c    he said he had been attached to bentham by the phrase young antiquity which was in itself full of instruction his letter interested bentham deeply and he thus answers it— jeremy bentham  d april    0 westminster reverend humphrey price bentham to mr price queens square place westminster  d april    0 reverend sir— your letter this instant received has called forth my sincere sympathy your mention of the word fee shows how completely unknown i am to you otherwise than by the works you allude to have the goodness to send me this same statement of yours and i will procure for it attention more valuable than any which it is in my power to bestow i could wish to know what that work of mine is to which you allude and by what accident and through what channel it fell into your hands a libel is any writing for which any man who has power has the will to inflict punishment i am myself the most egregious and offensive libeller men in power in this country ever saw i am sir yours sincerely the detailed account which mr price gives of his history is full of pathos he writes— reverend humphrey price  th april    0 jeremy bentham mr price to bentham county prison stafford  th april    0 sir— i was born at kidderminster where my father was a poor weaver and my mother a poor schoolmistress at an early age the toil of supporting myself and an only brother who happily perhaps for himself though agonizingly for me died when four years old a wonder of a child in those days devolved upon our dear mother who could work all day in her school and sit up all night with sick poor neighbours for forty years together this dear woman was saving all that a most diffusive benevolence would allow her to save from others for me and my children but happily thank god i compelled her at last to let me purchase a small annuity for herself with the money she was saving for us so that now she is secured from want provided her government security hold this excellent mother has never quitted her native town of kidderminster and she being well acquainted with rich and poor therein and in full possession of her faculties and also considerable activity both of body and mind though now at an advanced age and taking deep interest in the state of the poor i learnt from her all particulars of the turn out of the poor weavers in about a month after its commencement but if i am to notice my education as well as birth and parentage i must go back to observe that at kidderminster there is a free grammarschool where providentially for me a young man came to be undermaster whose prospects depended upon attention to his duties under the instruction of that young man though in a school which before his day had been for many years grievously neglected i gained in two or three years a style of penmanship you may shut your eyes or lift them up in surprise when i now talk of style of penmanship and a quantum of arithmetic to enable me at an early age say    to migrate to a neighbouring town bewdley to teach writing and accounts in a grammarschool there for sixpence per week each boy and to aid an infirm clergyman in hearing the lower classes latin for the reward of receiving from him in private higher instructions in latin and greek increasing infirmities prevented him from affording me much aid in little more than a year by means of working day and night i was enabled to take the principal labour of my old friends school upon myself which i did take most willingly on my part and with much warm i may say grateful feeling on his about that time two offers were made me the one of two hundred guineas ayear my maintenance and at the expiration of four years a fourthpart share in the trade by an old schoolfellow at kidderminster and the other offer by a clergyman five miles    from bewdley of twenty pounds ayear to labour in a large common country school at from sixty to ninety boarders and dayscholars but with the cure of a title for orders when i should be old enough and qualified enough to present myself before the bishop of hereford who luckily for me was compelled to accept young men of very spare attainments and without university education in order to provide for churches so contiguous to the principality of wales without one moments hesitation i accepted the latter offer accepted it not i fear from a truly religious principle but because i hated trade and loved something like learning and had always an inclination to become a clergyman c c in the above school with from sixty to ninety scholars i laboured hard and willingly for my term of two years sitting up almost every night winter and summer till two oclock in the morning and getting up again at six having thus secured my title to orders i returned to my former and far more agreeable situation at bewdley where i kept on working all day and making it a point for one year to sit up one whole night in every week without taking off my clothes or lying on the bed i had now obtained the age of   ½ or nearly and ventured to apply for orders though scarcely conceiving it possible to be admitted into the very serious and important office of instructing my fellowcreatures in religion i had however discovered that most of my fellowcreatures with whom i had met whether laic or clerical were very ignorant of religion and very lax in the observance of it—and this discovery emboldened me so i applied—passed muster even with encomiums and obtained not that curacy of only £  the title to which for orders i had laboured for the two years to obtain but another curacy of £ 0 per annum which had been offered me while i was undergoing my two years servitude this curacy near savage was eight miles from bewdley and to it every sunday morning winter and summer i used to walk through littlefrequented and very difficult roads performed the morning and afternoon service and returned to a late and plain but welcome dinner at bewdley in about two years after my ordination a clergyman at bewdley of the name of wigan—a gentleman of the most correct morals finished manners liberal sentiments and superior classical attainments i had ever at that day met with—one whom i loved most devotedly and who i think loved me for he gave me a larger share than he gave any one else of his society which all of the superior order in that neighbourhood greatly coveted—that gentleman said to me one evening we generally passed our evenings together when he could get released from company—mr price i have often heard you say if there was one person more than another to whom you should wish to be introduced that person was mr gisborne now i have in my hand a letter from a friend in mr gisbornes neighbourhood stating that mr gisborne is at this very time in want of clerical assistance as his curate is ill and he himself is wishing to go with his family to bath for a fortnight or three weeks if therefore you are in the same mind you were in lately here is a fine opportunity for you to indulge yourself with a trip to a delightful part of staffordshire and to be introduced to one whose writings you so much admire i will write by the present post if you wish it i did wish it and in a few days after found myself in a very different sort of society to any with the exception of dear mr wigan himself manibus pax et honos i had at all anticipated or witnessed there were the old and first lord and lady harrowby a daughter and a son—the present bishop of lichfield and coventry not that i coveted or sought after such company though without any farther seeking i have always had the company of the great and good quite as much as i pleased i might have had far more of it in all probability if i desired it suffice it to say that i who went forty miles merely to know mr gisborne and serve his church for about a    fortnight never afterwards left him for eleven years but was his curate at bastonunderneedwood a retired village within three miles of mr gisbornes seat of toxall lodge where i married and had four children and when mr gisborne built the church to which i referred no doubt in my former letter and which is situate within a mile of his own residence he made me the altogether unsolicited offer of it and there i have remained ever since until the wisdom of the four judges of the court of kings bench whom for the life of me having never even seen a judge before i could not help deeming to be four old women decided that i should be shut up in a prison for twelve months and thus cut off from the active duties of public and social life previously to my law trial i anticipated and made every preparation in my power for the worst that might happen i called in all my bills and settled everything as though i were going to die mr gisborne would have taken every law charge upon himself and there were other friends that would have done the same for the sake of myself and family but they one and all disapproved of what i had done and on that account i was determined the blow should fall on me and mine alone first then i sold my pictures to enable me to meet the expenses of the first trial and when the jury decided against me my two dear daughters left home for the first time and have found a good honest and reputable livelihood in their no ordinary accomplishments of music and painting c my eldest son is doing comfortably my youngest is struggling at cambridge my wife has a small annuity which i purchased for her about the time of my mothers all are scattered the parsonage house a lovely spot is desolate all my furniture was sold and here i am hardened in my political sins and far more likely to die for them than to repent of them here let me say as i am a stranger to you that i have refused and will refuse all pecuniary aid through gods mercy i shall have enough to pay all prison expenses debts i have none and when i get out of prison though i most certainly shall not be able to rally and collect my family again nor even at first send for my wife yet i shall have in my little living of £  0 ayear together with my house and thirty acres of land enough for my immediate support and for procuring by degrees one and another and another needful article of household furniture the poor weavers of kidderminster sent me £ 00 to begin the trial with but i would not touch it i told them it would be like drinking their blood at my appearance in the kings bench to receive judgment i think they call it my adversaries put in an affidavit that a weaver was then in london authorized to furnish me with all and everything i might want i believe that this affidavit was according to truth and that it did what it was perhaps designed to effect—but i certainly have never touched the poor dear weavers money except in one instance when in going last through kidderminster i called upon a very poor relation almost the only relative i know and left him and his wife my watch c as the only thing i had to part with and insisted upon their parting with it instantly for their support which with great reluctance they did this affair the poor weavers somehow or other heard of discovered where the chain and seals had been sold and where the watch with great solicitude collected them again and in about a month afterwards i was surprised and much concerned to receive per coach a little strong box with my watch c carefully wrapped in it and a note declaring that they could not bear to hear of anybody having my watch but myself and that if i sent them the money for it they would return such money though sent them a thousand times this is the only money i had from them poor dear creatures and welcome most welcome have they been to my all how horrible law expenses are i have heard that the prosecution cost my prosecutors though i gave them no trouble from the very first from seventeen hundred to two thousand pounds    but this may not have been the case me it so to speak has ruined though my attorney would insist upon having nothing for his professional aid to which of course i did not and will not accede i cannot conceive why i might not have been tried and condemned if need were as i have been at the expense even as times go of one or two hundred pounds in all i never knew anything of law before—never even having been in a court of justice before this late affair of my own i had always had a very high opinion of the uncorruptness and perfect impartiality of our judges c but my opinion of our law courts and judges c is most seriously changed judges i see are evidently as much the creatures of political prejudice as most perhaps more than most other men this has astonished me perhaps i am wrong and biassed by the untowardness of my own case but if i am wrong it is much against my will for i used inwardly to exult in the supposed character of our judges and i was never altogether without the hope that blundering as i might be in what i did for myself in the matter the judges would find out that i was an honest man in spite of all my adversaries could say or do jeremy bentham westminster reverend humphrey price bentham to mr price queens square place westminster dear sir— the small accompanying cargo will speak for itself and me from it you will judge whether towards you there is on my part any lack of sympathy all i have read of you it is with my ears that i have read it my eyes not being strong enough is that which is in your letter the present lord harrowby i have seen at mr wilberforces his father was once at my house his brother the bishop was my guest at the convivial hour at ford abbey in devonshire in the year      or thereabouts the association of which you see mention is likely to meet at my house for the first time in less than three weeks sympathy has already extracted from me more than it being on so small a scale it now operates to the prejudice of ditto on a greater yes—more than i can justify but you shall hear from me again after i have heard some account of your libels you have lost some friends—you will gain others and perhaps regain your former ones you will have seen already with what sincerity i am yours jeremy bentham age eightytwo strength not much less than at twentyone preaching as per sample practice in accordance with

return to his abode mr price writes— reverend humphrey price july      0 jeremy bentham mr price to bentham needwood parsonage near lichfield july      0 i am now returned to the bare walls of my parsonage with the recollection that a libel prosecution stripped them of numerous beautiful and valuable paintings and scattered to the four winds of heaven a family which contained within itself more perhaps of the elements of rational enjoyment than any other family in even a polished neighbourhood without the possibility of a reunion accomplishments now perform the part of drudgery and are turned to the procuring of bread rather than to the communication of intellectual enjoyment to a once happy family but i repine not i rather rejoice in my sufferings and i think i am prepared to suffer greater evils still—so that i suffer wrongfully in the controversy in which mr price    was engaged he certainly exhibits ignorance of the principles of political economy and supposes that the rate of wages is decided by the feelings—more or less benevolent—of the masters he would trace the sufferings of the labourer—not to the excess of labour in the field of demand and supply but to the determined oppression of those who employ the labourer this is erroneous doctrine but it is not illegal doctrine it ought not to be punishable doctrine and least of all punishable when mingled as it undoubtedly was in mr prices case with a truly philanthropic concern for the felicity of the suffering many it would have been easy to answer mr price it was most unwise—most cruel to persecute him in his addresses to the operatives he reproves them for their want of knowledge he encourages them to seek instruction he exhorts them to eschew violence—while he becomes the organ of their opinions and their prejudices but the most objectionable phrases are but the outbreaks of a sympathizing and strongly excited mind—the overflowing of a really charitable and generous temper the arts of the prosecuting lawyers and of the prejudiced judges were successful in giving to expressions which really originated in and represented regard for the labouring many the character of hatred and wicked

dear father— i received the precious letters and the books that you had the kindness to send to me unalterable are my affections and great is my gratitude i hoped for an opportunity to express that gratitude when the earth began to be agitated and we had to seek out other habitations we commenced by experiencing earthquakes of little consequence at first but repeated since and becoming alarming from four oclock in the morning of the   st to five in the evening of the   d of april last there were fiftytwo shocks on the   d following at nine oclock at night there was one so strong as to destroy the roofs of many houses to overthrow the walls of others and to rend the arches of many churches on the  d of the present month we felt another of some duration which was successively followed by others of equal or less force many towns and a number of houses on various estates have been ruined the government of the state and various families have removed to tocotenango a small indian village near to this city others sought out straw huts ranchos near the suburbs but i and others passed to ciudad vieja which is a town a short distance from this capital we have now however all returned to our habitations but we are not free from apprehension as the earth is still agitated and it has been observed that in other times and places earthquakes return more violently in the rainy season the overthrow of old guatemala took place on the   th of july         this horrible example and some equally disastrous that other countries have exhibited have not been sufficient to induce men to profit by experience and i would beg you to notice this in the different cities and different towns that have been built either on volcanoes or in their immediate vicinity in this republic the southern side which is one series of volcanoes and which seem placed to beautify and afflict our country is certainly the most inhabited on this side either upon the declivity of volcanoes or near them are the cities of st miguel st vicente st salvador old guatemala guezaltenango c a choice so sad for a people who possess a territory sufficient for all the human race is one of the many causes of its backwardness and retrogression little enough is done in times of rest and nothing can be done in seasons of earthquakes we established in november last an economic society of the friends of the state of guatemala and i was elected director i delivered at the installation a discourse which i have the honour of transmitting to you i wrote the prospectus and the number for the first month which i also send i shall proceed in writing other numbers which i shall equally forward and when the laws are printed i shall have much satisfaction in presenting them to you the society will do much good in countries where the resources which abound in europe are but scanty the earthquakes have suspended our operations but we are immediately about to recommence your name is honoured in the number for the first month and will be so in the succeeding numbers if i am connected with it your genius will give it weight and value and will coöperate in dissipating those clouds still dense that obscure the atmosphere of this country the pamphlets published by the society instituted in your capital for the diffusion of useful knowledge the popular library issued by the society for elementary instruction at paris books and catechisms for youth are requisite for those who know how to read in this land convinced of this truth i have proposed and our economic society decided on the translation of some of the principal that have come into my hands and i have sent to paris for the succeeding parts with the same object it is necessary to improve agriculture to create industry and to extend commerce but they are ignorant of the road that would lead to this end they know not where they ought to commence they do not possess the economic sciences nor have they agreed on their cultivation submerged for above three centuries in a chaos the most lugubrious can we expect the sudden production of legislators statesmen financiers c the mind is affected with the most sad sentiments at seeing the perpetual creation of public offices empleos while nothing is thought of that education which is necessary to fit men to fill them we will have a multitude of legislators and there does not exist a single school where the science of legislation is taught we must have many statesmen but we have no hall aula in which can be learnt even the elements of good government i have said this in my memorial upon education and i shall not cease to repeat it perhaps at last the voice of reason may be heard the immediate departure of the bearer of this letter does not permit me to proceed at greater length for the same reason i defer until another opportunity my observations on your important letters i beg of you in the meantime to accept señor bentham the cordial sentiments and the respectful consideration with which i affirm myself c i believe the three following jeux desprit by bentham appeared in some newspaper in    0—   subject for contemplation    get down a

proposed codification petition that petition which relates in a peculiar manner to myself and which if i do not overflatter myself you were kind enough to undertake not merely to present to hon h but to imbed it in your speech in such sort as to make it a matter of obligation to hon h to receive into its ears so much of it as you will be pleased to pour into them—this being according to what i have heard without contradiction an acknowledged right of course if you find it to such a degree grating to the aforesaid honourable ears that honourable gentlemen run out of the house as they used to do when orator burke was pouring forth the torrent of his eloquence you will stop in time to accommodate the proceeding as well as may be to these contingencies i have divided the matter into four or five topics marking the topics at the top of the margin of each page if ever there was a paper which for the importance of the subject matter as measured by the extent presented a prospect of experiencing this indulgence it is this for the extent of it is neither more nor less than that of the whole field of legislation—a field which does not want much of being coextensive with the whole field of thought and action and this with your unexampled brilliancy of imagination you will deal with better than anybody else could do now for a convivial gossip at this hermitage i hope neither gout nor anything else will hinder you from appointing an early day for it meantime you will have looked over it and marked any such passages as you think had better be omitted or changed should anything prevent your taking upon yourself this holy function joseph hume has promised to take it upon himself and if you perform it you will have him for a certainty for your support and he accordingly will be furnished with a copy in time so likewise oconnell who they say shines more particularly in reply—in reply in the generality of cases but in this case his assistance at that period will be more particularly desirable on account of the grimgribber matter which the matter of my petition will if it receives any determinate answer elicit from opponents but what i should rather expect is that they will not dare to grapple with it but fabricate a pretence for getting rid of it out of a quirk composed of some vaguegenerality phrase or move the order of the day upon it c c lest they should be prepared with a stratagem of this sort i shall propose to hume and oconnell as well as yourself to keep the matter secret between you three till the very moment of making the speech for which you will naturally select a time when there is a good attendance oconnell i see has given notice of an intended motion for codification this is without concert with me and i shall beg of him in time to let drop that motion and instead of making it to take upon himself the function proposed to be allotted to him as abovementioned —yours most truly ps—excuse the nonautography of this epistle all my few remaining minutes are you know counted my writing time i devote to codification letters c i dictate at times when i cannot write—for example after dinner while vibrating in my ditch—in the ditch opposite the chair which i hope you will occupy in a day or two the present place of your existence being unknown to me and consequently the fate of the accompanying packet appearing more or less problematical let me beg the favour of a single line to    inform me of the receipt of it without waiting to speak of the contents but burdett did not undertake the task he answered bentham that he would consider of it and bentham considered this as a withdrawal bentham having sent his official aptitude maximized and expense minimized to sir james graham because he had signalized himself in defence of economy was much gratified by his acknowledgment of the receipt of the book in these terms— sir james graham   th june    0 jeremy bentham sir james graham to bentham grosvenor place   th

livingston to bentham montgomery place new york july      0 sir— i thank you sincerely for the valuable books with which you have enriched my library and the kind and instructive letter by which they were accompanied these favours would have been sooner acknowledged if they had not arrived just before the closing of the session of the congress when all the business which the procrastination prevalent i believe in most legislative bodies had put off from day to day is pressed forward and renders a week or two before the adjournment a very laborious period for those who wish to do their duty escaped at length from the bustle of public life to a retreat i have on the banks of the hudson i devote my first leisure to the cultivation of a correspondence from which i expect to derive as much profit and pleasure in its sequel as i have already derived instruction from its commencement not having kept a copy of my letter to you i did not perfectly recollect its contents and my only fear on hearing that you had published it was that it should have imperfectly expressed how much my work is indebted to yours for those parts of my attempts to reform the laws of my state which have found favour from the public from the printed copy you have sent me i find this apprehension was wellfounded and therefore take pleasure in acknowledging that although strongly impressed with the defects of our actual system of penal law yet the perusal of your works first gave method to my ideas and taught me to consider legislation as a science governed by certain principles applicable to all its different branches instead of an occasional exercise of powers called forth only on particular occasions without relation to or connexion with each other i have lately observed with great pleasure the just homage that has been paid to your talents and services in the british house of commons rendered more valuable by its coming from a statesman and lawyer of the first eminence in the kingdom it must be a matter of the highest gratification to you to witness not only the prevalence of your doctrines but to hear their truth acknowledged by those whose professional prejudices they so severely attack and whose pecuniary interest they tend to destroy i think i understand the outline of your plan for the gradual amelioration of a written code without the aid of judicial decisions and thus obviating one of the strongest objections that is made to a system of written law but i should wish exceedingly to see the outline filled up for i feel some pride in having made a similar proposal in relation to our civil code in the year      and i wish to see whether your details can be applied to the general proposition i then made you will find it from page   to the end of a short report which i enclose it supersedes the necessity for that which one of our most celebrated jurists mr duponceau calls the malléabilité that is found in the common law that is to say the permission it gives to judges to make ex post facto laws the plan traced in this report    was not pursued the gentlemen joined with me in the commission were unfortunately too impatient for the completion of this task to enable them to do the work in the manner we had proposed i was overruled and the civil code was reported and sanctioned in the form you will now see in the copy sent to you yet imperfect as it is it has been a great blessing to the state but not greater i think than the rejection of the common law procedure in civil suits a simple system was substituted based upon the plan of requiring each party to state in intelligible language the cause of complaint and the grounds of defence i comprised it in a single law of a few pages and although from its novelty many questions may be naturally supposed to arise under it before the court and suitors become accustomed to its provisions yet our books of reports from   0  to      contain fewer cases depending on disputed points of practice than occurred in a single year   0  in new york where they proceed according to the english law which has been in a train of settlements by adjudication so many hundred years an anecdote to exemplify this may not be unacceptable to you when i was pursuing my profession at new orleans a young gentleman from one of the commonlaw states came there he had been admitted to the bar in his own state and was of course entitled to admission in ours if found by examination sufficiently versed in our laws he had studied them and was ready to undergo the examination but expressed to me his regret that a long time must elapse before he could make himself master of the routine of practice with which on our system he was entirely unacquainted and asking to be admitted into my office until that could be effected requested me with much solicitude to tell in what period i thought he might with great diligence be enabled to understand the rules of practice so difficult to be acquired according to the common law i answered that it was not very easy to calculate to an hour but as he was engaged to dine with me the next day at four i thought i could initiate him in all the mysteries of the practice before we sat down to dinner nor was there any exaggeration in the statement what will your articled clerks tied for seven years to an attorneys desk say to this i have hitherto been too busily employed in extracting the good from your works to think of making any objections to any part of the doctrines they contain and indeed it has happened so frequently that on the second persual my assent has been given to positions which i thought unsound on the first that i always hesitate long before i venture to deviate from them in any of the provisions of my code i have in some instances done so and although i cannot immediately comply with your request of stating the reasons of my dissent from you in those points yet it shall hereafter be done and as you desire fully and frankly i knew before the receipt of your letter that i was under great obligations to mr john smith but was not aware till you apprized me of those i owe to dr southwood smith to whom i shall soon write to express my acknowledgments to mr john smith i sent by mr mlane a copy of my projected code and had written to him twice before you will naturally inquire whether my system has been adopted by the states which commissioned me to prepare it i am sorry to say that they have not yet taken it into consideration a joint committee of the senate and the house of representatives was appointed last year to examine it during the recess and report upon it at the succeeding session but the prevalence of the yellow fever and other circumstances prevented them meeting the next winter i hope will find them disposed to pass upon it in the other states advances are making to free themselves from the reproach of being governed by unwritten and therefore unknown laws none have however progressed so far as to form a general system methodizing their statutes and giving the force of law to some of the judicial constructions of them is the present extent of their daring if cheap editions of some of your    works could be struck off it would aid the great cause but our lawyers are all politicians and our politicians are all partymen and partymen in all countries are alike to you i need not describe their characteristics or point out those causes which render them indifferent to anything unconnected with their prevailing passion the mass of the people therefore must be first enlightened by a knowledge of your principles before their representatives can be persuaded to act upon or even to examine them i send with this letter a copy of the civil code of louisiana a number of the papers printed by order of the senate or house of representatives some of which may prove interesting to you together with a number of other pamphlets relating to the civil and criminal statistics and institutions of the several states my code of evidence is printed but i will not submit it to your inspection until the introductory report which is nearly finished can accompany it—with sentiments of

hamburg jeremy bentham general santander to bentham translated extract hamburg   th july    0 bolivar is acting prudently in giving way to that general opinion which is opposed to his permanence at the head of public affairs it would have been happy for the reputation of his country and for his own had his retreat like that of scylla at rome been voluntary but we withdraw leaving colombia the prey of hostile parties—divided into two camps just ready for civil war instead of giving us peace tranquillity and freedom he bequeaths hatreds and resentments and passions—a demoralised army and a wretched example what has his unhappy dictatorship brought to colombia and his overthrow of the constitution of      his daring has not had even the justification of success his despotism has torn colombia into pieces by factions and discord and filled honourable families with mourning—the scaffolds of criminals have streamed with the blood of honest citizens immorality and anarchy have triumphed and colombia has been dragged back to fanaticism and ignorance in the last three years bolivar has sullied all the glories with which his perseverance his boldness his activity his disinterestedness and many other virtues distinguished him during the war of independence alas the same sword which overthrew spanish domination has destroyed the liberties of the colombian people in    0 were published de montrols memoirs of brissot from which a quotation has been given in the early part of the work the author in transmitting his work to bentham says—    translation allow me to address to you the memento of one who is celebrated in our revolutionary history by the virtues of a noble life and the courage of a noble death you will read not without pleasure his record of the friendship which bound you and him together his eulogium will seem more flattering dictated as it was by the most austere of our republicans in a moment when he never dreamt of disguise m de montrol says the genuineness of the memoires has been impugned and calls on bentham to authenticate the fact by his own knowledge in answer to which he writes i know not how any suspicion as to the authenticity of the memoires can have arisen i will mention one little corroborative circumstance he refers to my habit of dining with my father in the house i now occupy and at four oclock a circumstance so trivial so unconnected with anything important so little likely to be mentioned could be known only to an intimate friend time has made sad ravages on my memory and especially on those parts of it where foreign languages were stowed away so if you use this letter you must do what voltaire did with frederick the greats poetry—or what dumont did for me by translating my anglofrench into veritable french brissot de warville  0th july    0 london jeremy bentham the following is titled—note by jeremy bentham on one of the letters of brissot de warville to him anno      or thereabouts— london  0th july    0 in one of his letters to me my friend says—votre sécheresse me désols of the contents of this letter of mine i have no recollection sure i am that there could have been nothing angry in it or positively unfriendly and accordingly by this same word sécheresse nothing positive is indicated—nothing more than perhaps the absence of some of those expressions of affection which would naturally find their way into my addresses to him perhaps the cause of this complaint of his may have been this namely that on this occasion my letter to him was nothing more than a mere letter of business some little money transaction between us on the occasion of books and periodicals sent to me by him from paris at my desire from it will be seen the chief subject of this little correspondence in which he will be seen drawing on me for a sum of £  odd which i accordingly paid what i have always borne in memory is that the articles he sent me were not exactly those which i had desired him to send but that what they wanted in quality was in some measure made up in quantity being such as he could come at on easiest terms in those days i was very poor but my friend was still more so he was in want of the little sum of money in question to be paid in london where i was i paid the draft and accepted the articles whatever they were which were sent in compensation for it the sécheresse he alludes to may perhaps have had for its cause the disappointment thus experienced by me that upon the whole there was no want of kind feeling on either part is surely not unsatisfactorily shown by the manner in which he speaks of me in his memoires a friend here on reading this word sécheresse put it to me whether i would not keep back this letter it would have been the simplest way and would have saved me the time employed in this explanation but the idea of suppression was not pleasing to me—that of misrepresentation and insincerity seemed associated with it jeremy bentham august       0 duc de broglie bentham to the duc de broglie august       0 the opinion with which i was not long ago favoured by you on the subject of imprisonment for debt afforded me the heartfelt satisfaction of beholding in you a friend to justice it is not however by that or any other isolated and unconnected operation on the field of procedure that the ends of justice can be accomplished and the benefit of the services of the functionaries belonging to the judicial department imparted to all who stand in need of it    in this respect buonapartes codes have made a prodigious advance beyond anything that ever went before them and present to view a pattern of perfection in comparison of that system of abomination under which i have had the misfortune to live and which so large a portion of my long life has been occupied in the endeavour to expose to that full and general abhorrence which must take place before any effectual reform can be accomplished but the system the greater part of which is exhibited by these codes will if i do not grossly deceive myself be seen to be yet at a sad distance from that degree of perfection which the nature of the case admits of after all that has been done by it it leaves the benefit of justice still out of the reach of the vast majority of the whole numbers of the people for besides the fees which it attaches to all the several operations and written instruments which it necessitates it supposes and necessitates on both sides of the suit the intervention of professional assistants or substitutes of the parties under the name of avoués behind whom link without being once held up to view by any of the codes the further and still more expensive assistance of avocats on both sides of the suit what is the consequence that those who are utterly unable to purchase the assistance of these professional men without breaking in upon their own means of subsistence must go without justice—must submit to depredation and oppression at the hands of all those who are content to pay the price of this maleficent service the expense on the plaintiffs side having the effect of denying remedy to wrong in every shape and that on the defendants side of lending the assistance of the several functionaries official and professional together with the use and service of judicatories in the infliction of wrong in every shape for want of the means of defending on the occasion in question his just rights as to the cour de conciliation in name it affords remedy without expense—remedy accessible to all without distinction—without that distinction which has place between those who are and those who are not in condition to defray the expense but the supposed remedy is little better than an empty name and against those against whose machinations the demand for justice is most urgent it amounts absolutely to none—i mean the whole class of mala fide suitors suitors whose plan it is by means of relative opulence on their side coupled with relative indigence on the other side to engage on their side the power and services of the judge to their case this same supposed remedy is clearly inapplicable by resort made to the reconcilement court their plan would be defeated and they are under no obligation to resort to it to the ordinary courts and to these alone they apply themselves for there it is that the faculty of depredation or that of oppression whichever it is that is most to their taste or both in one is upon sale ready to be exercised at the expense of whatsoever relatively indigent individual they have marked out for their victim unfortunately for mankind the interest of professional lawyers on this ground is in a state of direct and inexorable opposition to the interests of the rest of mankind and the same everywhere—in the unchangeable nature of the case the influence of that body can never cease to be very great the interest of nonlawyers is that in the business of procedure expense and delay be at a minimum the interest of professional lawyers is that those evils be at a maximum expense for the sake of the lawyers profit of which in so large a part it is composed delay for the sake of the occasion it produces for expense under the english judicial establishment official lawyers are large partakers of that same sinister interest under the french to a comparatively minute extent if any    if reaping pecuniary profit in proportion as the ends of justice are contravened by them and their professed duty thus violated is not corruption i know not what is if not it is at any rate something worse being practised by wholesale and in the instance of every individual suit whatsoever whereas in the mode styled bribery it has never by the most abandoned offender been practised but in here and there a suit and the money being received under the name of fees the act of maleficence for be it understood it is not an offence is practised with the full assurance of impunity and the profit direct and by means of patronage indirect together is so enormous that you would find difficulty in giving credit to it i am wandering and must have done in a word the object of the liberty i am thus taking is this notwithstanding all that has been done and it is no small matter by buonaparte and his draughtsmen—his codifiers towards the remedying the cost still in france the benefit of justice remains inaccessible to a very large portion of the community—i believe far the largest and to another vast portion is not attainable without a grievous and most oppressive tax paid to the professional lawyers the sum of whose enjoyments from that source bears but a very small ratio to the sum of the sufferings produced by the same cause in all other breasts in this state of things notwithstanding the comparative disinterestedness and generosity of the french character any such expectation as that of finding in the instance of the influential portion of the body of professional lawyers any sincere coöperation with anything other than the most determinate opposition to any plan well adapted to the diminution of their own profit would be altogether inconsistent with any the smallest insight into human nature the object of this is therefore to endeavour to learn whether i may entertain a hope of a disposition on your part to contribute in your country by your endeavours and your influence towards the removal of so cruel an evil as that in question and to honour me with your coöperation towards that end dr bowring obliges me by being the bearer of this letter he is my most intimate and confidential friend and a man so well qualified for giving all the required and desirable explanations is not to be found—i am sir with the most sincere respect yours c the duke replied that he hoped when the agitating events were passed which then occupied every public mans attention in france he should be able à têteréposée et avec maturité desprit to occupy himself with the important subject of law reform on the revolution of the three days in france it was benthams intention to address a series of letters to the french people only one however was written as follows— jeremy bentham august    0 london french people bentham to the french people queens square place westminster london august    0 fellowcitizens— your predecessors made me a french citizen hear me speak like one so said i anno      so say i now anno    0 i have written and i have written i have written and i have torn i had then been more than twenty years occupied in the study of what belongs to the happiness of nations—thirtynine more years have been added to those twenty i was then somewhat known among you i am at present i hope i may say somewhat better known there are those who have said to me—speak now again to these your fellowcitizens what has these forty years been your right is now become your duty hearing this i took up the pen circumstances have been changing every day—circumstances continue changing every day—circumstances will change every day but principles remain unchanged it is from them i speak to you a proclamation of la fayette lies before me it is that which was issued    by him on accepting the command of the national guards of paris date of it august     in this behold my text—at any rate my main text in it i read these words—parisian energy has reconquered our rights     nothing is definitive but the sovereignty of those rights thus far the veteran hero whom it so delights me to call my friend now for an observation which to some may appear a trifling one rights are fictitious entities—the people real ones realities on this occasion as on all others realities i prefer to fictions—even the most innocent ones realities—i understand them better but should my friend say to me—our fellowcitizens will understand us better if we say rights—even so let it be let us say what we will our meaning is the same think you this is a question of mere words not it indeed i will tell you why i say people in the sovereignty of the people i behold a locution which even in the sink of corruption from which i write—even in this seat of illdisguised despotism has at public dinners been for years a not unfrequent toast it comes before the king and not for these many years if ever has any servant of the king dared prosecute for it so much for the commandant of the parisian national guards and his proclamation now for the lieutenantgeneral of the kingdom and his  attached by inclination and conviction to the principles of a free government i accept beforehand all the consequences of it this delights me this is good sense this is good logic all rights must be solemnly guaranteed all the institutions necessary to their full and free exercise must receive the developments of which they have need this though in letterpress it stands antecedent to what is said as above of principles is in reason one great consequence of it but to developments i should have preferred modifications or to speak out changes now for interpretation from words i pass to symbols i hastened says in that same document this same functionary i hastened so and so wearing those colours which for the second time have marked among us the triumph of liberty here there is one change and that a speaking one and what is it that it speaks a second time if not that which it spoke the first time—the sovereignty of the people while writing what i have been tearing i had before me another text—the charter is a truth—charter—i do not like—i never liked the sound charters and the sovereignty of the people cannot have existence in the same place at the same time admitted into the chamber of legislation i behold the sovereignty of the people throwing the charter out of the window oh would but some prosperous breeze blow it over to london i should pick it up with transport—stick it on my hat and cry—charter for ever yes this refuse of france would for england be a feast behold here i would say magna charta the second magna charta the first has been long worn to nothing—trodden under foot by our holy brotherhood—the lawyers before this clear and ablyfashioned reality that miserable fiction—matchless constitution—that maleficent phantom which every corruptionist makes for himself—makes for his own purposes—makes on each occasion out of his own leaven—would flee away screeching and drown itself in our thames  let no evil ever be lessened let every existing evil as does all evil unless nipt by remedy receive continual increase this is what is meant by—for incontestably this is included in—that which is said by those who say let us have no change let all evil be perpetual—this would be too much to say this is what in those same words they dare not say they therefore change the words which done they say let us have no change and out of these words they make an established principle there you have the principle now think of the consequences what if this had been the principle when william the second of england kept laying waste the country to convert it into    huntinggrounds what if when louis the fourteenth of france laid waste the palatinate to make a frontier of it what if having by louis the eighteenth been put into a charter and by a successor of his that same charter declared to be a truth that declaration were to become law and that law an immutable one the ceremony of an oath having moreover as by art    of the same charter been called in and supernatural terrors added to all natural ones for the pious purpose and in the pious hope of preserving for ever all evil from diminution—wrong in all shapes from all remedy le roi et ses successeurs jureront dans la solemnité de leur sacre dobserver fidèlement la présente charte constitutionelle behold here my fellowcitizens one of the rocks which in many places and many times—perhaps in all places and at all times when occasion presented itself—men old in power and men new in power have joined in splitting upon let things as they are continue unchanged for ever has in all places and all times been the cry of all those who reaping good for themselves from the evil done by those same things to other men—good in justification of which no direct and undeceptious argument was to be found—sought refuge for it in this fallacy nor was this fallacy without an outward show of truth all change produces preponderant evil—this would be too manifestly false—to all eyes too clearly so—to be advanced by anybody but all change produces evil—this it cannot but be confessed is little less than true but all change produces preponderant evil—nothing less than this would serve to preserve from the reproach of maleficence universal and perpetual maleficence—the nochange principle so much for power when old now for power when new this constitution is perpetual and unchangeable such in these terms or what is equivalent to them for there is not time to look for them was the declaration of our first national assembly add to this so of every other altogether natural is this for to every man in power natural is a mixture of intellectual and moral weakness—of folly and maleficence for mark well my fellowcitizens the propositions that are involved in it   no change that can possibly have place in the state of things or in the state conduct and disposition of men can be such as to render it contributory to the greatest happiness of the community to make any change in the changes which we have been making for that purpose   we who compose the majority of the body to which we belong—we are to such a degree wise that there exists not any the smallest probability that at any future point of time those who have then succeeded to us will be equally so   we are moreover to such a degree good that there exists not any the smallest probability that at any future point of time those who have then succeeded to us will to wisdom equal to ours have added goodness equal to ours so much for      or thereabouts now for      or thereabouts then came the spaniards with their constitution more modest they than we were in their view years during which the state of things and persons would be so sure to continue without change—not more than four years during which matchless goodness would be so sure to continue in union with matchless wisdom not more than the same number all this while provided the body were but called the same no matter how different the individuals farewell for the present at least my beloved my now so much more than ever admired fellowcitizens i have done what i have felt to be in my power towards laying the foundation a necessary foundation for all future good for remedy to all existing evil i have blown up i hope you will think i have the deadweight i saw the ground encumbered with—the nochange principle rammohun roy brought to england the following letter of introduction to    bentham from a highly valued correspondent—   th november    0 calcutta jeremy bentham calcutta   th november    0 my dear and venerable friend— this letter will be presented to you or transmitted waiting your leisure by no less a person than the distinguished rammohun roy you have heard of him often from me and from others and know that he is one of the most extraordinary productions of the march of intellect a brahmin of the highest order and therefore an aristocrat by birth one of the privileged class and a man of easy fortune by inheritance deeply learned in sanscrit arabic and everything oriental he has nevertheless unassisted and of himself been able to shake off prejudice of almost every kind and to give his natural understanding fair play if i were beside you and could explain matters fully you would comprehend the greatness of this undertaking his going on board ship to a foreign and distant land—a thing hitherto not to be named among hindoos and least of all among brahmins his grand object besides the natural one of satisfying his own laudable spirit of inquiry has been to set a great example to his benighted countrymen and every one of the slow and gradual moves that he has made preparatory to his actually quitting india has been marked by the same discretion of judgment he waited patiently until he had by perseverance and exertion acquired a little but respectable party of disciples he talked of going to england from year to year since      to familiarize the minds of the orthodox by degrees to this step and that his friends might in the meantime increase in numbers and in confidence as it was of the utmost importance to the preservation of his rank and influence with the hindoo community who care less about dogmatics than observances that he should continue one of the pure and should not be suspected of quitting hindooism for any consideration of a personal nature he has externally maintained so much and no more of conformity to hindoo custom as his profound knowledge of their sacred books enabled him to justify—relaxing however by little and little yet however never enough to justify his being put out of the pale i need not say that in private it is otherwise and that prejudices of all sorts are duly contemned by our philosopher but so important does he judge it to the efficacy of his example and the ultimate success of his honourable mission of experiment that he should maintain the essentials of his brahminical sanctity—that even in the flagrant and outrageous act of making this voyage and sojourn he is contriving to preserve appearances to a certain point which he considers sufficient to save his caste so that on returning he may resume his influential position against the abuse and calumnious reports which the whole tribe of bigots will not fail to raise against him while in england and when he comes back he now judges that the time is come and that the public mind is pretty well ripe for his exploit and he embarks in two or three days in the albion for liverpool where he has friends and correspondents in cropper benson and others of liberal feeling the good which this excellent and extraordinary man has already effected by his writings and example cannot be told but for his exertions and writings suttee would be in full vigour at the present day and the influence of the priesthood in all its ancient force he has given the latter a shake from which aided by the education and spirit of bold inquiry gone forth among the rising nations of hindoos it never can recover i need hardly tell you that the liberalism of such a mind is not confined to points of theology or ritual in all matters involving the progress and happiness of mankind his opinions are most independent and he is withal one of the most modest men i ever met with though near fifty years of age and though he is the most learned and enlightened of his countrymen and nation and indeed has held that position for the last fifteen or twenty years and has received praises enough to have turned the head of any other man alive  0 it is no small compliment to such a man that even a governorgeneral like the present who though a man of the most honest intentions suspects every one and trusts nobody and who knows that r m r greatly disapproves of many acts of government should have shown him so much respect as to furnish him with introductions to friends of rank and political and indian influence either they will find him intractable and throw him off or they will succeed in what no one hitherto has succeeded—in beguiling or bending the stranger a stranger however he is and of such sort as has not before appeared among you and he will stand in need doubtless of all the kindness and attention that friends here can procure for him you have weightier and other matters to occupy you nor are your habits such as to enable you to be of service to r m r in the ordinary way yet i felt assured you would like to see and converse with my indian friend and indeed i recollect you expressed such a wish for the rest you will probably make him over with his credential to our friend bowring and the reprobates and stanhope i most truly rejoice to hear and to see printed proofs that you continue to enjoy your accustomed health strength and spirits no one among all whom you know wishes more truly and earnestly than i that you may continue to enjoy those blessings for the sake of us all—your affectionate and attached friend jeremy bentham  d nov    0 london la fayette bentham to la fayette london  d nov    0 my ever dear and honoured friend— i have done my best towards executing your commands about second chambers† through a private channel i embrace the opportunity of sending to you two copies of a tabular view of the composition of our house of commons‡ from the spectator this dissection might i thought in one way or other be matter of curiosity and eventually even of use not only to yourself but even to our king of kings considering how well he is acquainted with our carte du pays in addition to what the table exhibits on the subject of patronage let me tell you that whole classes of commercial men have for supporters their representatives namely those of the west indies and those of the east indies and in former days the nabob of arcot alone had to himself a number of them—i do not remember the exact number three or four at least—all located at his expense and paid or not paid besides in those days the price was not more than £ 000 or £ 000 namely for sitting as long as the parliament lasts in the only two instances that have come to my certain knowledge it has been just now as high as £ 000 a more common price is i believe £ 000 some have hired a seat by the year and paid £ 000 ayear which when it can be managed seems to be the most prudent course i insert an interesting conversation between oconnell and c sinclair cullen it took place on the  th november    0—it was communicated to bentham on the  th and on the  th cullen died—died suddenly while in the apparent possession of health bentham considered him one of his dearest friends— headed in benthams writing oconnells conversion to the antisecondchamberfaith  th november    0 copy of a statement written at q s p by cullen oconnell to cullen—spontaneously in the course of a conversation on other matters november      0—i have read benthams letter to la fayette it has made a convert of me to one chamber i was prejudiced in favour of two chambers when i took up the pamphlet i said—no—he is wrong here bentham will be unable to persuade me of this but he has    convinced me i did not yield to his reasons in the first few pages—but as i advanced i found the chain of reasoning not to be broken and taken altogether i think it conclusive cullen—i never could see a reason for two chambers—but i could not have proved it as bentham has i am glad he has emancipated you it will simplify your scheme for ireland indeed it is a great thing for the world to undeceive them on this subject the delusion about a second chamber has involved all the constitutionmakers and libertyfounders in delays perplexities contradictions and mystifications that have proved injurious or ruinous to freedom it is a grand thing to have made the road to a sensible constitution easy and plain by clearing away the rubbish and superstition of a second chamber as bentham has now done for ever jeremy bentham   th nov    0 henry brougham bentham to brougham q s p   th nov    0 my dear brougham— it is with no small gratification that i heard doanes account of the kind mention you made of me in the short conversation he had with you this day finding thereby that the state of your affections towards me harmonizes so exactly with that of mine towards you whatsoever may be in the westminster review notwithstanding be assured that no sentiment of personal hostility has ever had place in anything i have said of you there or elsewhere it is accordingly truly delightful to me to see such good reason for believing that no considerable if any uneasiness has been produced in your mind by what has been called my truculence for assuredly if you were sitting opposite me as i hope you will shortly be ere long it would not be possible for me to witness any symptoms of uneasiness on your brow without imbibing through the channel of sympathy more or less of it not that in substance my course would be altered by any such irrelevant observation for if you were my brother in the flesh instead of being my soidisant grandson in the spirit oh naughty boy never could i sacrifice to my regard for any individual that affection for my country and mankind to which my whole soul has been devoted for i forget how much more than threescore years as i am dealing with you so dealt i by my friend romilly for on the occasion of the westminster election he being in my phrase no better than a whig i wrote against him in favour of—i forget who douglas kinnaird i believe—of whom i knew nothing but that he stood upon radical ground what the review has said of you either this time or the former time i know not nor do i think i ever shall sure enough did i send in the meat for that meal for it was what nobody else could have done but as to the dressing i neither know how it was done nor who were the cooks i have understood that it was you that let slip the dogs of war at me in the edinburgh and perhaps elsewhere the more there are of them the more tickled i shall be and in so allcomprehensive an assurance you would find a good and valid license should you ever suppose yourself to have need of any such thing i have my views you have yours but in all other respects i am—yours most truly c ps—since writing the above i have heard for i cannot read the morning chronicle in which i see my suspicion that your nolo officiari was nolo episcopari carnalised confirmed though not put absolutely out of doubt i say since and i assure you upon my honour so it is what to say to it i know not if i could assure myself that by this change delay vexation expense and denial of justice will not be increased nor the abolition of those scourges rendered less probable or less speedy it would be matter of sincere delight to me to see a mind such as yours turned aside from feegathering by the indiscriminate defence of right and wrong by the indiscriminate utterance of truth and falsehood and concentrated to the service of mankind  0th november    henry brougham nov    jeremy bentham brougham to bentham hill square sunday morning nov    my dear sir— many thanks for your kind letter but how could you listen to such a tale of tales as that i of all your friends ever could have let slip the dogs in e r at you the truth is i had a correspondence of weeks and all but a rupture with jeffrey on the subject he had got committed on the point before i could remonstrate not having a conception of what was doing till i saw it on my table in print and published i succeeded afterwards in stopping the useless and worse than useless controversy between varying or differing allies for so it was—not enemies i want to see you one of these days and when you summon me to dinner i will attend but dont make it next wednesday for i go that day to our societys monthly meeting— yours ever memoranda made by bentham in    0— under a monarchy the people are the idolators who after making the idol with their own hands fall down and worship it to blind their eyes in order to pick their pockets to blind their eyes not as a hangman does in order to consign them to an instantaneous death but to blind them so as to make their death a lingering one matchless constitution j bs creed— i prefer the english constitution such as it is to nongovernment and to every other but the united states government but i do not prefer it such as it is teeming with abuses and other imperfections to what it would be if cleared in the whole or part of all or any of these same imperfections lord wynford jan        jeremy bentham lord wynford to bentham jan        at bath i shall have leisure fully to avail myself of your suggestions before any bills are in committee i am happy to find that we differ but little if we differ at all as to the examination of the parties i propose that tho examination should take place immediately after an action is brought and before any expense is incurred i also approximate to your views as i propose giving the judges authority to require security from plaintiffs if it appear from the examination of the parties that a suit is hopeless or vexatious the establishment of a code of laws is a matter of great importance i shall with a mind perfectly unprejudiced consider all that you have written on that subject— i am sir with the greatest respect faithfully yours jeremy bentham   st jan      daniel oconnell bentham to oconnell   st jan      once more the proceeding by way of attachment in the case of the two dublin printers brings to my mind a state of things which had place about sixtyfive years ago and does not seem to have attracted attention on the present occasion it may peradventure by the mention of it be rendered under your management serviceable to the cause of the people lord mansfield in those days chief justice of the kings bench in england was notorious for his absolutism a project of his was in cases which by the constituted authorities were regarded or professed to be regarded as abuses of the liberty of the press to substitute to the trial by jury trial by the court of kings bench alone viz by motion for attachment followed by a quantity of affidavit work by writ of attachment accordingly whereupon the defendant having been taken up and committed to prison had tendered to him in the same prison a paper of interrogatories to which whether by written instrument or vivâ voce i forget which he was commanded to give answer in this way a printer of the name of bingley was dealt with and while in prison one of these interrogatory papers was tendered to him and he was commanded to give answers which answers he refused to give and for this contempt as it was called he continued in prison for i forget how many years nor do i recollect in what way his imprisonment terminated whether by death or by disincarceration    on account of this proceeding and others of a similar tendency my lord mansfield became the object of a very extensive and wellmerited odium insomuch that he became an object of attack to a man in so singular a situation for a libelwriter as that of a master in chancery the title of the libel was a letter concerning libels warrants seizure of papers and security for the peace c  th edition      followed by another entitled a second letter on libels    0 the form in which expression was given to the imputations was i remember the hypothetical—if any lord chief justice should do so and so and so on with a train of ifs and i believe a pretty long one in clarks law catalogue the sixth is an edition and the only edition of this pamphlet mentioned from this you may imagine the run it had and the sensation it made the other enormities alluded to were acts of the secretaries of george the third whose abominable misgovernment and endeavours to introduce absolutism have been sufficiently brought to view this case of bingley i should expect to find in burrowes reports but neither time nor eyes admit my making search for it between the application of the power of the judges without the jury to the purpose of inflicting punishment for alleged offences committed by abuse of the liberty of the press and its application to the purpose of punishing offences committed by physical resistance to or noncompliance with the mandates of these same judges there is a very broad and clearly visible line of distinction if punishment for such resistance or noncompliance were made to depend on the will of a jury or of any other authority other than that of the judges themselves theirs would be a state of impotence and the whole fabric of the judicial establishment would fall to pieces whereas in the case where the offence consists in alleged abuse of the liberty of the press not any the least danger is there that any such consequence should follow whatsoever be the attacks made upon them in this way neither motives nor means can be wanting for engaging defenders in any number that can be desired whereupon a suit is thus carried on in the court of public opinion—a court of dernier resort which never acts under that corrupted and corruptive influence under which the highest of the soidisant courts of justice always act the pamphlet is anonymous nor is there in print that i know of this mans name as its author but i had a slight acquaintance with the man having been in his company and to him it was ascribed by everybody i cannot suppose that you will be under any great difficulty in finding out the materiel et personnel of this war in your libraries public or private my notion is or say what i should expect to find is that owing to the odium excited on that occasion by this mode of proceeding in the case of alleged abuses of the liberty of the press it fell into disuse and has never since been revived i remember being present in the capacity of a student at the time of the discussions in that case of bingley here are facts meaning indications of supposed facts to you it belongs to find logic and rhetoric grounded on these facts written what is above from dictation made between sleeping and waking by one who was once your correspondent and even host and will ever be your admirer and sincere wellwisher though not always and without exception your approver daniel oconnell   d february      jeremy bentham oconnell to bentham   d february      i should have answered your letter sooner and should have endeavoured when i was last in town to have seen you but for a reason which does not belong to the characteristics of my countrymen—i mean a sense of shame i am ashamed of my inutility i had formed a confident hope that my career in parliament would be one of considerable usefulness i had flattered myself that in the british senate i could and should be able to advance the sacred cause of rational and cheap government    and assist to cleanse the augean stable of the law my first mistake consisted in entertaining a high opinion of the moral worth and intellectual power of the house of commons and i shaped my course mildly and gently in order to propitiate the opinions of men whom i respected you have a right to despise rather than pity me for this gross mistake the consequences are a shipwreck of my parliamentary fame and the great difficulty i now have to assert a power which perhaps would have been conceded to me had i exerted myself strongly in the first instance under these circumstances i am ashamed to call myself your disciple i deem myself not worthy of your patronage or friendship and i console myself only by working for useful objects in a lower grade and endeavouring to make up by perseverance and moral energy for the loss of the more brilliant prospect of usefulness which i think lay before me but in every situation and under all circumstances your principles and your powers of mind are to me objects of cultivation and great respect my respect my veneration for you is unchanged and undiminished and if you can point out anything in which you think so humble a labourer as i am can be useful pray pray command me rely on it that the principles of legislation which you have advocated are deeply impressed on my conviction and if i can contribute to substitute real justice to the workings of judgemade law it will afford me pride and consolation i write with a proud but wounded spirit—that is my proud spirit is wounded and humiliated at the failure i have experienced in my palmy hopes of doing great and extensive good to mankind and i feel under the necessity of limiting my exertions to the amelioration of the institutions of one of the finest but most oppressed portions of the human race in conclusion i beg of you to accept my most grateful thanks for your letter—for your continued kindness—for your patronage—for your preëminent usefulness i also beg of you to believe that your principles founded as they are on plain sense and irreversible reasoning form the cherished political creed of my dear sir your sincere admirer and devoted servant jeremy bentham   th february      daniel oconnell bentham to oconnell   th february      my dear oconnell— you have cried peccavi come up this day seennight and receive absolution from c i do not know to whom this letter on the repeal of the union was addressed—  pacificus against the conquest of ireland sir— the debates on the occasion of ogorman mahons motion have just reached me in the representation given of them in the morning chronicle i behold a portrait of honourable house the portrait of britannia will not i hope be a pendant to it honourable house has one object of regard britannia i hope—one of her children i am sure has another and that a very different one honourable house has one end in view an end at which it aims britannia i hope—one of her children i am sure another and that a very different one honourable house has one principle by which its sentiments and when the time comes its means and proceedings and will—in a word its actions if conformable to those its sentiments are directed britannia i hope—one of her children i am sure others and those very different ones the principle of honourable house is the absolute government principle the principle by which britannia will i hope in her deeds—one of her children i am sure in his words—be guided yes and governed is the greatesthappiness principle on the part of honourable house unless sadly misrepresented an almost unanimous determination stands expressed—i say expressed for inward feeling is one thing expression another and everywhere and in honourable house in particular but too often a very different one—yes a determination to coerce and risk a civil war    rather than to consent to the repeal of the union now then by what motive is this determination supposing it to have place produced is it by any regard to the happiness of the millions—of the millions on both sides or on either side of the water no such thing sir this is not so much as professed and though any such profession need not so much as ten or a dozen words those ten or a dozen words are not thought worth the expenditure of for the purpose of fixing a mark to intention and endeavours well then on the event in question sir the m ps—the m ps to the amount of a few hundreds are determined to go forth to gird on their armour and with fire and sword to lay ireland waste subdue the insolent irish and by gods help which it will cost them no more than one days fasting to secure to establish an aristocratical tyranny of the inhabitants of the one island over those of the other laying it waste in the meantime with fire and sword for that godly purpose will they so let them then with mr speaker for commanderinchief having first effected a junction with the force of the right honourable house under the command either of the lord chancellor the archbishop of canterbury or the late commanderinchief his grace of wellington or earl grey in his quality of first lord of the treasury or in that of champion of his order as it shall please the right honourable house to determine yes sir i say once more forth let them go by steam they will go and when from the steamboat they have disembarked on the banks of the liffey let the liberator and his fellows lay hold of them toss them in a blanket and then toss them back again into the steamboat with fuel to fire them back again or into the liffey—no great matter which to the transportation of this force i say sir i have not any the smallest objection bearing in mind the proverb which begins with good riddance but lest i should be called to order what it continues and ends with shall remain in innuendo o yes this force so much of it as you will the whole of it if such be your pleasure but as to any addition to it  0000 men for example not that such a number would be sufficient— 00000 men no nor  0 men no nor a single man no nor half a man nor so much as a ninth part of a man for the achievement of this conquest if to that band of heroes any addition be made money and men will be necessary well then in the first place—the money where is it to be found from the people so many millions sterling as will be required no not a penny i hear a voice crying no not a penny of it not a penny will be had but from taxes refuse the taxes is a cry that has been already heard and on such an occasion if on any will be repeated this will not serve the purpose any further than as they use the bayonet or fire on those they are sent to kill and suppose the  00000 or any part of them should when the word of command is given—the word fire—may not the firing either be in the air or if it must be in a line parallel to the earth may it not be in the direction in which it will meet the very leaders who have been abovementioned here then agreed agreed inwardly and outwardly in profession as well as object and endeavours are the tories and the whigs but the radicals—have they reckoned on the radicals—they did not say they had they did not think it worth their while to say as much but if notwithstanding they did inwardly so reckon they reckoned i trust as says another proverb without their hosts tories and whigs in concert will make enactments—will issue orders but the radicals—what is it they will do they will i hope present petitions petitions and the sooner the better that thus in limine the plague of tyranny may be stayed and the honest blood of both countries saved from flowing  the bad example of paris and brussels forsooth when the baroneted offspring of spinning jenny speaks thus he speaks in character—he speaks as might have been expected but lord althorp i am sorry to see him join    in any such sentiments—much more to see him take the lead in them but a few petitions from his brother balloters will bring back to his strangelyforgotten duty this advocate of the ballot let them learn in time let them make haste to petition and with one accord choosing for their presenter the firstborn of earl spencer—put into his hand their petitions that by the presentation of them the result of passion and humour the fault of the moment may thus be expiated this then let the people petition for and when they are about it let them go a step further and petition for the dismissal of the ministry by whom this declaration of war has been made for their dismissal not merely for this their bloody purpose but for the so extreme discordance of their actions with their professions for their sham reform under the guise of half reform for their sham parliamentary reform for their sham finance reform sham law reform with the learned paragon of insincerity the vaux—etiam vox et preterea nihil—at the head of it so sayeth and so prayeth though without fasting pacificus in      bentham took an active part in the formation of the parliamentary candidate society its object was to direct public attention to the men who were most likely to forward the popular interests in the house of commons among the parties whom bentham was desirous of recommending were rammohun roy as a representative of british india a half caste and a negro in order to subdue the prejudices of colour and to hold out encouragement and hope to the rest of these races bentham wrote on this occasion credentials for some of his acquaintance many of whom so recommended found their way into parliament on the passing of the reform bill he was at this time much occupied with a project for establishing a new daily paper to be called the universalist he wrote the prospectus and induced some of his opulent acquaintances to become shareholders but the amount subscribed for did not equal that which was deemed necessary to ensure success and which i think was £ 0000 on relating to bentham some of the statements made in the north american periodicals and which were likely to lower him in the good opinion of others he gave me this memorandum— jeremy bentham false reports that have been spread in the united states in various periodicals to his prejudice    that by singularities by which he is rendered an object of ridicule and a source of annoyance to others he is held in contempt by all who know him or see him this had its origin in a letter which appeared several years ago in the times newspaper it was written or at any rate the matter of it furnished by a man of the name of parry whom in may    0 dr bowring saw in the madhouse in st georges fields the story was that being invited by mr bentham to breakfast and dine with him he had no breakfast and no dinner till ten at night and that in a public street on his way to a workshop in london where parry was to show him some engineering invention such was the ridiculousness of his appearance that he was insulted by a notorious prostitute the fact was that parry breakfasted at mr benthams and after his return to mr benthams dined at his usual hour seven pm and left before ten the hour he mentioned as to the insult and the prostitute it had no foundation whatever mr d— a gentleman now at the bar and who then was and still is an inmate of mr benthams was of the party parry in the character of a workman under congreve inventor of the rockets which go by his name had acquired some knowledge of engineering he was a shameless liar one of his lies was the having refused £ 00000 offered him at washington by president quincy adams for one of his inventions he was sent to greece to serve under    lord byron and by him was he much encouraged in quality of buffoon he was conspicuous there for cowardice and for lying the story in the times imposed as it naturally might upon mr—of new york and found its way into the north american review    that he is remarkably afraid of death—so much so that it is an object of special care to all his friends to avoid all allusion to the subject in his presence as much as possible he is as remarkable for the contrary as for anything else this story has no foundation whatever it must have originated in some strange misconception    that he is afraid of ghosts this originated in a periodical publication published in one of the united states by the editor a man whose declared sentiments and affections towards mr b are friendly and were friendly even to enthusiasm it is the more likely to gain credit the author of it having spoken of himself and with truth as having been for some time an inmate with mr b but for correctness in speaking of mr b or any other person other qualifications are requisite besides friendly disposition and convivial intimacy but this was not wholly without foundation mr b having frequent occasion to speak of what he had suffered nor even to this day has altogether ceased to suffer from the stories about ghosts and other imaginary and horrific beings told by servants to children but the purpose for which he was led to speak of them was that it afforded an illustration of the difference between the judgment and the imagination jeremy bentham  th march      william tait bentham to w tait  th march      yesterday the  th inst dr bowring put into my hands a letter under your signature in which letter i read the following passage—if bentham approves of such unions i shall be gratified by a few lines from him to communicate to the union has he written anything recommending unions of the people his writings are far too little known it is with great pleasure that i make communication of my compliance with the wish thus expressed it produces in me as you see the effect of a law in principle i am and as long as i can recollect have at all times been a decided advocate of the most unrestrained peaceable intercourse between man and man for political purposes consequently for that union of which i have heard such warm approbation from friends in whose wisdom and benevolence i am in the habit of placing the firmest reliance but as to details i have not received any information you would therefore oblige me much by furnishing me with any such information as is in print and in the meantime letting me know by post at what time and by what conveyance i may expect to receive it and through what channel i may convey to you any such literary matter as is too bulky to be transmitted by that conveyance this same principle—namely of unrestrained political intercourse so it be peaceable—including even union will be found pervading and upon occasion showing itself in freedom in every plan i ever published but in a more particular manner in my work entitled benthams radical reform bill in which are contained my reasons for wishing to see given to the suffrage of the electors of the members of the british and irish house of commons the attributes of secrecy universality equality and annuality of the first of which namely secrecy the process called the ballot is the appropriate instrument towards this state of perfection the nearer that any actually proposed plan appears to me to approach the nearer it accordingly approaches to the consummation of my wishes as to the plan at present upon the carpet so considerable is the approval it appears to me to merit that it is not without high delight that i contemplate it    always understood that it will be followed by the ballot which i look upon as a consequence sufficiently assured to keep alive the most sanguine hope but not in such sort assured as to warrant any relaxation of the endeavours which are employed for the attainment of it for without the secrecy in question i look upon all these other securities as little worth as to my works enclosed is the latest list of them that has been printed flattering myself with the having fulfilled your wishes as expressed in your letter i am sir with sincere respect yours c when the whig government was projecting a prosecution of cobbett bentham wrote the following letter to an influential member of that government— jeremy bentham   d june        d june      your kindness will excuse this intrusion the motives will speak for themselves and if it does no good it will do no harm for something or other that has been lately published by cobbett government i understand after having commenced a prosecution against him and let it sleep for some time perseveres in bringing it to a conclusion several men of whose public affections i am sure and of whose judgment i think well agree with me in the apprehension lest by such a proceeding the administration should be lowered in the estimation of the people in my opinion this would be a probable result of any prosecution for anything that goes under the name of a political libel for of bad advice in print if it be in general terms the bad effect may be more effectually counteracted by good counter advice backed by reasons also in print and bad advice recommending the inflicting injury in such and such a shape on an individual would in case of the commission of the injury render the adviser an accomplice and as such punishable as to cobbett a more odious compound of selfishness malignity insincerity and mendacity never presented itself to my memory or my imagination and i know not that man for whose sufferings i should have less sympathy than for this mans nor do i know any man in whose estimation the intellectual part of his fame holds so low a place as in mine moreover a friend writes to me—cobbett has been abusing you very lately be it so his abuse of me is no more a matter of interest to me than would be a dogs barking at me never i believe did he make mention of me for any other purpose than that of lowering me in the estimation of the public for a great many years past never to my recollection have i read ten lines together of anything he has written or heard except by accident a few lines more were i for example to succeed in this my application in such sort that for this cause alone the prosecution were dropped i would not wish that he should know as much he would i should expect labour but so much more to injure me such is my opinion of his gratitude a small part of all this might probably have sufficed as well as the whole to convince you that this address has for its cause regard for the public and not for the individual and with this confession i conclude myself yours most sincerely bentham was used to keep a memorandum book in which under the name of dicenda he entered all the anticipated topics of conversation with his visiters one specimen will suffice—     —june   —dicenda to bowring     in examiner—head detrosier—think of deontology     in examiner—imprisoned

manchester times was tried in which mr archibald prentice was defendant he consulted bentham as to the course he should take who recommended him to require that the words of the indictment should be proved in consequence of his advice mr prentice took the high ground of insisting that evidence should be given to show the falsehood of the libel as its falsehood was made the groundwork of the accusation in spite of the charge of the judge he carried his point ten of the jurors were brought to concur in his views and the jury not being able to agree were called into court and discharged previous to the trial bentham wrote a letter to mr prentice in which after commenting on the indictment he says— jeremy bentham archibald prentice bentham to archibald prentice besides giving acquittal to an innocent and calumniated man though it is not in their power to save you altogether from punishment under the name of costs it is in the power of the jury on this occasion to give a great lesson to all englishmen and through englishmen to all mankind yes it is in their power to drive the first pile for the erection of the fabric—the august fabric—of law reform after finding you not guilty let them make it known by the mouth of their foreman that though it is on the account of the merits that they thus acquit you yet had they ever thought you guilty of an offence and that a serious one they could not have found you guilty of the facts charged in and by a written instrument of accusation thus crammed with known and notorious untruths and that wheresoever an instrument of accusation thus filled with these and other lies is stated as the ground of accusation no verdict will any one of them ever concur in but that which has the words not guilty for the expression of it let them make this declaration or anything to this effect and they will give a lesson to the good men and true as jurymen are styled of the whole community and the lesson will spread like wildfire the lawyers seeing by lies like these and other kinds that their purposes instead of being fulfilled as they have been hitherto will be frustrated will with whatsoever reluctance cease to utter them and confine their steps to the paths of simple truth or at any rate what has the appearance of it on receiving the announcement of the result of the trial bentham wrote to mr prentice— jeremy bentham july   st      westminster archibald prentice queens square place westminster july   st      dear sir— yes i do felicitate you i felicitate the honest and intelligent jurymen i felicitate the country in general i felicitate myself on this your virtual acquittal i say the country in general for further much further than to the deliverance of one innocent man from the persecution under which he was suffering do i look for the benefit capable of resulting from this event it not only always has been but will now be very extensively seen to be in the power—not merely of any jury but of any one man in any jury to effect no inconsiderable progress in the career of law reform for producing an effect so eminently desirable a very few juries and thence a very few individuals one in each jury will suffice choosing for the experiment those cases in which the acquittal though of a person by whom the offence has really been committed will be productive of least evil to the public and many are the cases in which  0 it would not be productive of any evil at all making this choice and declaring that the acquittal had no other cause than their determination not to join with the judges and their partners in iniquity in the contamination of the public morals by the utterance of such a tissue of solemn and pernicious falsehoods it will be in the power of this small number of individuals to compel those on whom it depends to clear all instruments of accusation from the greater part of that mass of pickpocket lies and absurdities with which they have hitherto been loaded this may a small number of the lovers of justice do and thus doing they will thus pave the way for the establishment of that allcomprehensive plan of law reform to the organization of which nearer threequarters than half a century of my life has been devoted and here sir you have before you my ground for selffelicitation the course which i am thus using my endeavours to recommend to jurymen is no other than that which i myself would take were i in their place in former days it happened to me to be summoned to serve upon juries of both kinds—grand and special having received from nature the experienced faculty of remaining without food for several days without considerable inconvenience it would have been in my power in the situation of juryman to command the verdict and if so disposed in the situation of member of a petty jury special or common to give or sell impunity for any crime at pleasure not to speak of the giving to one man the property to any amount of any other with what feelings and what views i figured to myself this power in some hands i leave you to imagine on the particular occasions then in question i saw no prospect of rendering to my country in a jurybox service to so great an amount as it seemed to me i could render and was actually rendering in my closet and thence it was that the invitation never experienced my acceptance  of a bad bargain make the best says one of our old saws nor that the least instructive one under the rotten and antipopular constitution for the change of which into a sound and popular one all eyes are looking with such intense anxiety the main use of juries as at present constituted is in my view of the matter the veto which the institution gives to the people upon laws upon bad laws in general and in particular upon all those in which the oligarchy by whom we are plundered and oppressed have a special sinister interest on a cursory glance it does not seem to me that you had reason to complain either of the learned gentleman who led as counsel against you or of the other learned gentleman who on this occasion officiated as judge thus the law is says the judge and in saying it says what is but too true thus the law is—that is the spurious the judgemade law substituted to legislaturemade law and to parliamentmade law and in this consists the grievance as to the learned counsel—mischief is capable of being done says he by taunting men with offences which they have really committed in this though it would not come up to his purpose by warranting the jury in telling the lies in question there is unquestionable truth and it presents a real demand for regulation such regulation my penal code would accordingly give but of judgemade law if to the tissue of irregularities which have no words belonging to them the name of law must be misapplied one of the evil properties is that by it no regulation of anything can be made it is with no small satisfaction and admiration that i have observed the ability with which you turned to account the materials with which i had the pleasure of furnishing you and the important additions which you made to them —dear sir yours sincerely p s—my advice to jurymen is plain and unmisunderstandable and nothing can be easier than to follow it examine the indictment and if in any part there be any assertion that is either notoriously false or not proved to be true do not join in declaring it to be true but say not guilty    josé del valle august        guatemala jeremy bentham josé del valle to bentham guatemala august        translation—extract my ever dear father— how i

looking at and examining the other—thus studying human nature partly with a view to my own happiness—partly with a view to that of the human species the following reminiscences occur in a postscript of a business letter by bentham to his bankers of date   th january     — within a trifle more or less forty years have elapsed since i had the pleasure of being one at a convivial party with your good family on the martin side i believe the whole of it in company with dr price kippis and i think priestley at your fathers then residing in downing street i condole with you on your announced loss of that gentleman who was i believe the eldest member of it one of the members stone was a schoolfellow and familiar friend of mine at westminster i remember passing some time in his company when he was with his mother at tunbridge wells about seventythree years ago being some years older than myself he can hardly be at this side of the grave at this time afterwards i remember him coming in one day after dinner at our schoolfellows sir w fitzherbert elder brother of lord st helens on his mr stones return from paris where he had been secretary to the duke of dorset then our ambassador at that court what is curious we did not at that time recognise one another he sat down to the pianotable and played malbrook sen va a la guerre the beautiful little song tune which was just then come out at paris in the topsyturvy state of the second page of this letter you will see an effect of the weakness of my eyes but though several of my senses and faculties are nearly gone and several of them altogether so my friends still keep amusing themselves with the assurance they are pleased to flatter me with that the old philosopher will continue to cumber the ground as long as newton did with his ninety years or even say some of them fontenelle with his  00 years sir francis burdett  th feb      jeremy bentham sir francis burdett to bentham  th feb      hassan the cameldriver was not more delighted when travelling oer the desert he received on his parched lips a drop of water from heaven than i am at receiving your kind and allow me to call it affectionate invitation for i value your good opinion and esteem beyond that of the million far i know nothing of the honours you suppose are awaiting me and i assure you in perfect sincerity of heart i care nothing but of this and other more interesting matters when we meet which god willing shall be sunday for i put aside every consideration to have that pleasure i hardly know the thing you could at least would ask of me that i should not feel the greatest gratification in complying with of course there is no need to say anything about mr colls believe me dear bentham most sincerely yours c i had the happiness of bringing talleyrand and bentham together a short time before benthams death they had not met i think for forty years years passed by the one in all the turbulence of political excitement by the other in the calm of an almost inaccessible solitude but benthams name and benthams genius happened to be the    subject of conversation at talleyrands table and i was struck with the warm the unwonted admiration with which the diplomatist spoke of the philosopher was he accessible could entrance be obtained to his presence i engaged to be the negotiator and bentham after listening to me wrote to talleyrand what follows— jeremy bentham talleyrand bentham to talleyrand translation prince— do you want an appetite the means of finding one for friday next is to come to this retreat and take a hermits dinner on thursday i say on thursday for thus bowring whose house looks upon my garden may enjoy your society for a few moments that is to say after dinner for during dinner we must be têteàtête which will be the only way of making ourselves known to each other i give my mornings to nobody i have so much to do and so short a time to live that i cannot abridge my working hours as to visits i have made none for many a year neither to dine nor for any other purpose though dine we must under pain of death if thursday suit you not fix any other more agreeable day bowring departs on saturday as to wine i have nothing better than some tolerable st george so if this drug is a point with you i only use it for medicine as i belong to the sect of the rechabites you will do well to follow what a wicked wit called the example of pitt the second and come to dine with your friend—a bottle of port in each pocket—wholly yours answer— translation  th february to dine with bentham to dine alone with bentham—that is a pleasure which tempts me to break an engagement i have been under for several days tomorrow thursday i shall come to him he will tell me the hour i shall be punctual talleyrand said bentham was introduced to me by dumont in      at queens square place in the room now my library he asked me to superintend the building of a panopticon in paris for which he said the municipality headed by the duke de la rochefoucauld were willing to furnish funds and the dukes house was offered to me for a residence of six months when the duke was murdered the plan fell through talleyrand had the highest admiration of bentham he once said to me that he was preëminently a genius—more entitled to the name than any man he had ever known i once remarked to him that of all modern writers bentham was the one from whom most had been stolen—and stolen without acknowledgment true he said et pillé de tout le monde il est toujours riche and robbed by everybody he is always rich a higher compliment could scarcely be paid from one illustrious man to another and from talleyrand whose mind rather led him to censure than to applaud the praise has a double value the writer who adopted the name of junius redivivus having written to bentham giving to him the credit of having first taught that author to think and look beneath the surface of human transactions bentham requested him to throw off the mask and to visit him the anonymous writer thought however that he should best forward his objects by keeping himself sheltered from personal observation for some months before his death bentham had been anticipating the event the loss of many of his faculties particularly of his memory was very obvious to him and he frequently expressed his conviction that mind and body were giving way together i was absent from england a month or two before he died so anxious was he to save me from the distress which the knowledge of his situation would have caused that he directed certain letters of his to be sent to me only in case of his recovery    or death lest their contents by evidencing the state of his health might be the cause of suffering to me one passage is as follows— jeremy bentham  0th april      john bowring j be to j bo q s p  0th april        oclock sent off this moment to the foreignoffice by the hands of mathew a letter of this same date should the matter of which this packet is the receptacle ever reach your hands it will not do so till after my recovery in which case the disorder so manifest in it will not occasion any affliction to you or after my death in which case it will not add to that affliction though as you see already i cannot write a line in addition to those written already without addition to the confusion the existence of which is so fully proved by the lines which it has for its predecessors but abundant is your charity multitudinous indeed must be your sins if so many proofs i have received of it have not covered them what i perceive but too plainly is that you are in no want of adversaries not to say enemies who will of course be on the alert to take hold of everything that can afford them a prospect of their being able to turn to your disadvantage to which purpose will be endeavoured to be employed every communication by word of mouth this considered let the motto of the worshipful company of scriveners in the city of london—the company of which my father was clerk—be on each occasion present to your mind you will find in it if duly observed a rather better remedy against sufferance from calumny than a caterpillar enclosed in a bag tied round the neck against sufferance from an ague bentham died on the  th of june      his head reposed on my bosom it was an imperceptible dying he became gradually colder and his muscular powers were deprived of action after he had ceased to speak he smiled and grasped my hand he looked at me affectionately and closed his eyes there was no struggle—no suffering—life faded into death—as the twilight blends the day with darkness with a view to the advancement of anatomical science he directed that his body should be dissected and this direction was carried into effect it is not my purpose to trace even in outline the character of jeremy bentham it is best portrayed in those selfdrawn sketches and in that correspondence which are here collected never was it my lot to see mingled in the same human being so many qualities which exacted admiration and inspired affection never have i witnessed so much wisdom and so much wit—so much of the sagacity of a sage and of the simplicity of an infant beautifully blended benevolence beneficence on the largest scale and for the noblest ends were the passion—if passion may be called the temperament of so calm and philosophic a spirit—were the habit of his existence the strength of his intellect could be equalled only by the fervour of his affections—his mental greatness by his gentleness and generosity he lived not to teach alone but to practice his own magnificent morality—to show how the felicity of the individual might draw its habitual element from the felicity of the multitude—how one man might in the happiness of all men seek and find his own highest happiness in all bentham said or did or wrote he was under the influence of the two great principles which form the groundwork of his philosophy to promote felicity and to diminish suffering the greatesthappinesscreating principle and subordinate to it the disappointmentpreventing principle as he denominated them were the tests he had accustomed himself to apply to all pretensions properties and persons he expressed himself sometimes with vehemence when he thought the case required a bold exposure where great interests were associated with great abuses and depredation or oppression    exercised towards the many his indignation often broke out in bitter animadversion yet his nature was preeminently timid and childlike his susceptibilities were most acute he could not tolerate the infliction of needless suffering even upon the meanest of living things—though his philosophy was willing to consent to its infliction wherever a balance of good was to grow out of it of human nature bentham had an exalted opinion he once told me he had known many men who held honours and riches cheap in comparison with the delight of doing useful service to their race by nothing was bentham more characterized than by these microscopic powers of intellect which enabled him to pursue the investigation of a subject into its most minute details seizing the general principle with masterly grasp he carried out its consequences into all its ramifications nothing seems to escape his sagacity which as the field of inquiry opens upon him becomes in a high degree imaginative and inventive he has been sometimes reproached with not applying equal attention to every branch of the same subject but had he explored all the regions of thought and action in the same complete and exhaustive spirit which he applied to portions of the field he would have left nothing to future intellectual labourers what he did was wonderful in its extent and variety he laid down the great texts of morals and legislation and now and then worked some of them out in all their consequences as in the instance of the rationale of judicial evidence his mind was like a mine rich in various ores of which he taught the world only a portion of the uses but the mine is there and it will be worked out by others enough has been done to show the richness of the materials and the value of the metal it will give forth treasures for ages perhaps the rationale of evidence more than any other of benthams writings represents the allembracing character of his mind as applying general principles to an immense variety of minor topics it presents all the merits which belong to a masterly conception of the whole subject accompanied with the utmost accuracy in and most curious discrimination of the smallest matters of detail on the one hand the minutest ramification is traceable up to the great principle from which it emanates—while on the other that principle is followed down with admirable acuteness through all its consequences the varied questions as to the value of testimony are solved by a profound knowledge of the physiology of man all the theory of evidence is built upon the solid basis of a sound philosophy the practices of our courts—the dicta of our judges—the fallacies of our lawyers—are sifted and disposed of with the most felicitous acumen his object throughout is to distinguish between the ends of law and the ends of justice—to defeat the purposes of chicanery and to forward the interests of truth it has been said that bentham was little influenced by the writings and opinions of others this is to a great extent true in early life he had been a diligent reader of the works of other men he was a greek and latin scholar but he valued little the philosophy of the ancients he thought their notions of government and of the foundations of morals vague shifting inconsistent untenable he saw indeed in some of them a faint shadowing forth of the doctrine of utility and in so far he thought they had penetrated into the regions of truth but in the reverence for authority—in what he called the ipsedixitism of the schools—he found nothing but barriers to inquiry and pretences to infallibility and perhaps it is not to be regretted that bentham instead of occupying his attention with the views of other writers was habitually engaged in pouring forth for the use of the present and future generations the contributions of his own critics enough there are in the world—but there are few inventive few original minds—it may be doubted if one has appeared in our day and generation so inventive and original as benthams but turning from benthams intellectual    to his moral nature—few men have been so amiable or so happy in boyhood—in youth—in maturer life he had much to annoy and to discourage him but as age advanced everything grew bright within and around him associates whom he loved were never wanting to his felicity topics of hope—the progress of knowledge—the viotories of reform—the evident spread of his principles—filled his mind with daily sources of delight his society was eagerly sought—his opinions consulted by the most eminent men of his day—and he was enabled to choose for his companions those with whom he most sympathized—with whom and for whom he loved to labour the daily and weekly newspapers were to him a perennial spring of enjoyment—to the last he took the deepest interest in public matters and in the conduct of public men he paid little regard to the attacks of which he was sometimes the object and in fact was scarcely ever known to read a criticism upon his own writings—why should i be put out of my way—i have much to do—i have little time to do it in—was the excuse he made to himself and others for not being diverted from his pursuits by any attacks upon him bentham attached the utmost value to time—he husbanded all his moments with anxious care nothing disturbed him so much as to be called away from his beloved pursuits in fact he could scarcely ever be induced to receive any visiter except at his dinnertable he never admitted any one but for some special purpose he felt no interest in the vague generalities of conversation—and never would gratify the curiosity of those who from curiosity alone desired to be admitted to his presence the striking resemblance between the persons of franklin and bentham has been often noticed of the two perhaps the expression of benthams countenance was the more benign each remarkable for profound sagacity bentham was scarcely less so for a perpetual playfulness of manner and of expression few men were so sportive—so amusing as bentham—none ever tempered more delightfully his wisdom with his wit of the wisdom that is called worldly franklin had no doubt a larger share—for he had been a great actor as well as a great writer—and had been engaged in the most interesting parts of the most remarkable events of his day he was made of sterner stuff than bentham he lived in the eye of the world and had to accommodate his outer man to the worlds usages—but bentham avoided the rush and the shock of men the tide of tendency affected not the quiet repose of his mind—except as it gave new matter for philosophical reflection and afforded subjects to which he could apply his beneficent councils the direct links which associated him with society were few—but to these few he showed an affection and an attachment which exhibited him as made up of the tenderest sensibilities and sympathies benthams industry was remarkable as soon as he rose he was occupied in composition and he wrote on an average from ten to fifteen folio pages aday he was seldom satisfied with the first expression of his thoughts and generally developed his views over and over again he was in the habit of composing on long ruled paper having somewhat more than an inch in breadth ruled off for marginalizing this plan of condensation enabled him more easily to go over the field and to pursue what he called his exhaustive investigations every page was headed with the date of its composition which he found a great auxiliary to his thoughts when occupied by some one subject if something worth remembering occurred to him on another he noted it on a slip of paper which he pinned to a small green curtain that hung near him and which was sometimes covered with these disjecta membra he collated and located them from time to time the manners of bentham were polished in the highest degree he was observant of all the minutiæ of courtesy every little object of desire that he could procure for his visiters he invariably procured—the little enjoyments which he had discovered were acceptable to particular guests were unostentatiously    placed before them his table was excellently served he himself greatly delighted in its moderate luxuries he began with the dessert as he said he wholly lost the flavour of the fruit if he partook of it after the stronger viands of the first course in the latter part of his life the sense of taste was nearly destroyed he drank half a glass of madeira wine daily i believe he passed through life without a single act of intemperance from the period of his fathers death bentham possessed a competence and as far as money was needful to his enjoyments he had no wishes ungratified and he distributed his wealth liberally for every purpose which seemed to him likely to increase the happiness of his race on some occasions he was even betrayed into an imprudent liberality for he had to sustain some severe losses the consequence of the sanguine miscalculations of his friends which were responded to by his own eager and exciteable nature happily none of these losses curtailed his pleasures and he applied to his own case his own admirable maxims—to look always on the sunny side of things—to forget as speedily as possible all evils that cannot be remedied—to hunt for cheerful thoughts—to be busied with no portion of the sorrows of the past but that out of which some instruction or some felicity is to be derived bentham had the benefit of many distinguished followers he was the founder of a school whose principles at all events are intelligible—though in the elaboration of these consequences his disciples have not always followed him it was made a reproach to him that he was sometimes led astray by a point of detail and would follow out a fallacy to its destruction through numberless windings though the influence of that fallacy might be unimportant but making war as he did upon sophisms and sinister interests we cannot be surprised at his desire effectually to clear the field wherever he found it encumbered and the examples given of what he called the exhaustive faculty was often highly interesting and instructive bentham often confessed that nothing had been more mischievous to him than that bashfulness which clung to him like a cold garment through life there was never a man so desirous of shunning others unless some strong sense of duty or prospect of usefulness subdued his natural tendency to seclusion on his early acquaintance with lord shelburne a plan of connecting him with the east india company under the patronage of captain smith then an e i director failed bentham offended lord sydney by not returning a visit who had sent his son to solicit him to do so once when madam de staël called on him expressing an earnest desire for an audience he sent to tell her that he certainly had nothing to say to her and he could not see the necessity of an interview for anything she had to say to him on an occasion when mr edgeworth in his somewhat pompous manner called and delivered the following message to the servant in order to be communicated to bentham tell mr bentham that mr richard lovell edgeworth desires to see him—he answered tell mr richard lovell edgeworth that mr bentham does not desire to see him the leading principles of his philosophy bentham applied to all subjects if a book had to be considered his inquiry was is it correct is it complete—correctness and completeness being the two great elements out of which truth must be constructed his study of the laws and rules of evidence for judicial purposes led him to apply those laws to all other testimony bentham was a warm admirer of music—especially of solemn music and of handels solemn music above all other but modern music he valued little and least of all light and frivolous airs it is not easy to estimate the extent of circulation which the writings of  0 bentham have obtained through the whole world of dumonts translation m bossange calculated that the sales on the continent of europe had exceeded  0000 copies benthams dress was peculiar out of doors he ordinarily wore a narrowrimmed strawhat from under which his long white hair fell on his shoulders or was blown about by the winds he had a plain brown coat cut in the quaker style—lightbrown cassimere breeches over whose knees outside he usually exhibited a pair of white worsted stockings—list shoes he almost invariably used and his hands were generally covered with merinolined leather gloves his neck was bare he never went out without his stick dapple for a companion he walked or rather trotted as if he were impatient for exercise but often stopped suddenly for purposes of conversation he was remarkable for attention to all that the french mean by their petite morale a model of neatness and propriety himself any the slightest deviation from good manners excited his attention and almost always led to some playful criticism not likely to be forgotten for in lesser as in greater things he had adopted for his maxim—that a moralist like a surgeon should never wound but to heal bentham was very fond of animals particularly pussies as he called them when they had domestic virtues but he had no particular affection for the common race of cats he had one however of which he used to boast that he had made a man of him and whom he was wont to invite to eat maccaroni at his own table this puss got knighted and rejoiced in the name of sir john langborn in his early days he was a frisky inconsiderate and to say the truth somewhat profligate gentleman and had according to the report of his patron the habit of seducing light and giddy young ladies of his own race into the garden of queens square place but tired at last like solomon of pleasures and vanities he became sedate and thoughtful—took to the church laid down his knightly title and was installed as the reverend john langborn he gradually obtained a great reputation for sanctity and learning and a doctors degree was conferred upon him when i knew him in his declining days he bore no other name than the reverend doctor john langborn and he was alike conspicuous for his gravity and philosophy great respect was invariably shown his reverence and it was supposed he was not far off from a mitre when old age interfered with his hopes and honours he departed amidst the regrets of his many friends and was gathered to his fathers and to eternal rest in a cemetery in miltons garden i had a cat he said at hendon which used to follow me about even in the street george wilson was very fond of animals too i remember a cat following him as far as staines there was a beautiful pig at hendon which i used to rub with my stick he loved to come and lie down to be rubbed and took to following me like a dog i had a remarkably intellectual cat who never failed to attend one of us when we went round the garden he grew quite a tyrant insisting on being fed and on being noticed he interrupted my labours once he came with a most hideous yell insisting on the door being opened he tormented jack colls so much that jack threw him out of window he was so clamorous that it could not be borne and means were found to send him to another world his moral qualities were most despotic—his intellectual extraordinary but he was a universal nuisance the mice were encouraged by bentham to play about in his workshop i remember when one got among his papers that he exclaimed ho ho heres a mouse at work why wont he come into my lap—but then i should be stroking him when i ought to be writing legislation and that would not do i have been catching fish he said one day i have caught a carp i    shall hang him up—feed him with bread and milk he shall be my tame puss and shall play about on the floor but i have a new tame puss i will make roebuck my puss for his article on canada and many a mouse shall be catch one day while we were at dinner mice had got as they frequently did into the drawers of the dinnertable and were making no small noise o you rascals exclaimed bentham theres an uproar among you ill tell puss of you and then added i became once very intimate with a colony of mice they used to run up my legs and eat crumbs from my lap i love everything that has four legs so did george wilson we were fond of mice and fond of cats but it was difficult to reconcile the two affections from my youth i was fond of cats—as i still am i was once playing with one in my grandmothers room i had heard the story of cats having nine lives and being sure of falling on their legs and i threw the cat out of the window on the grassplot when it fell it turned towards me looked in my face and mewed poor thing i said thou art reproaching me with my unkindness i have a distinct recollection of all these things cowpers story of his hares had the highest interest for me when young for i always enjoyed the society of tame animals wilson had the same taste—so had romilly who kept a noble puss before he came into great business i never failed to pay it my respects i remember accusing romilly of violating the commandment in the matter of cats my fondness for animals exposed me to many jokes an acquaintance of wilsons came to dine with me and i gave him a bed in my chambers he had seen two beautiful asses one of them had the name of miss jenny at ford abbey there was a young ass of great symmetry and beauty to which i was much attached and which grew much attached to me—each fondling the other bentham dined at seven oclock in a room he called his shop it was surrounded by books in the centre was a platform which occupied most of the room and around three sides of it a narrow passage which he named his ditch or vibrating ditch there was an organ in the room which was played while we sat down to dinner it stood opposite the door in a place just large enough to hold the instrument and the performer which had been cut through the platform to the floor and which was denominated the well into which a blind or heedless visiter not unfrequently fell upon the platform stood a bookcase named the caroccio which he could reach without leaving his chair and a reading stand with the mss on which he was occupied aplate with writing materials sticks pens and pins wax scissors c the table was never removed opposite him was an armchair for a single visiter for he did not like to have conversation divided and distracted by the presence of many persons one sometimes two secretaries dined with him who were honoured with the name of reprobates himself he liked to call the hermit and his house the hermitage a usual phrase on the arrival of a visiter for dinner was let me whisk you round the garden i always indulge in an anteprandial circumgyration the first time i visited him when he came to a corner of the garden in which is a fine sycamore tree and behind it an obscure brick house he suddenly stopped and laying dapple on my shoulders shouted out on your marrowbones sir i saw on a slab to which he pointed sacred to milton prince of poets it was miltons house—the house he occupied when he was secretary to cromwell the garden was an object of special delight to bentham who was passionately fond of flowers and the garden had once he said been distinguished for its variety of fruits but the growing deterioration of the atmosphere had destroyed one sort after another so that a few currants and gooseberries with abundance of fine mulberries were all that time and smoke had left anne the housemaid and waiter always summoned us to dinner    his table was always liberally not to say daintily served and when he discovered that a particular dish was a favourite that dish was sure to be found by the guest and often bore the guests name i remember that fried parsley was dr mcullochs dish scolloped oysters was mine he ate abundantly for dinner was his only substantial meal let me have the ensign of authority he would say taking the bellrope and at ten oclock tea was brought in but he had a teapot of his own which nobody else was allowed to use the sacred teapot he styled it its profaner name was dick and dick was always put over the lamp to sing many an odd phrase did dick give birth to has my dick begun his song—then take him off his perch take down dicky he is in a passion what a piece of work he is making in dicky the tea was made according to benthams peculiar notions of teamaking the water was put in at once so that the tea might be of equal strength to the end to the sacred vessel a history was attached it had been given by lind to a dr darsent who had cured his wife of a dangerous disease when darsent died at the age of ninety he bequeathed it to mrs lind then a widow she gave it to a servant to whom she paid an annuity and on her death bentham took that servant as his housekeeper and when she left him in her old age he allowed her an annuity of £   ayear she however frequently pleaded her poverty and the insufficiency of the allowance and as frequently got some additional money from bentham she left however a legacy of £ 00 to her brother and bentham induced her to give him by will the said teapot she was an artful crafty woman who having once succeeded by hysterics in getting some wish gratified tried the trick again upon bentham when he told her he understood hysterics and would have no more of them and he had no more of them much said bentham in mentioning this much depends on doing things in a quiet way try not to be angry and if you are do not let it be seen people may go into hysterics—as they may shed tears at command you may be taught to shed tears as cicero taught you to stamp with your foot at eleven oclock water was introduced—his nightcap brought in which he tied under his chin—his watch delivered to the reprobate who held the office of putter to bed—his eyes were washed—his habiliments were doffed—and during all these proceedings which lasted exactly an hour he kept up a perpetual and amusing chitchat at twelve oclock his guests were visited with ignominious expulsion he then withdrew into his room where he slept on a hard bed across the bed accessible to him even when lying down was a shelf covered with jars jugs and other conveniences the reprobate usually read to him till he fell asleep—but sometimes access was denied and the reprobate waited in the shop till he called out watch—the watch was delivered into the philosophers hands he made every reprobate swear fealty he said to a trinoda necessitas—the asportation of the candle—the transtration of the window—idem of the trapwindow—and when these functions were performed he gave his benediction—the door was shut and he was left to his slumbers but his rest was often annoyed by his extreme physical sensibility if his hand touched his body he awoke in pain he was much disturbed by dreams—last night he said on one occasion i passed the whole night with brougham—and so i move in various companies bentham preserved his eyesight to the end of life though he was obliged both at morning and night to remove with a wet spunge the mucus which otherwise he said would cement his eyelids he was also troubled with a discharge of saliva from the corners of his mouth and on mentioning this one day he sang humorously—   an old old driveller am i   which nobody nobody can deny   nobody can deny that i   am an old driveller in this playful buoyant spirit he always referred to his infirmities he was indeed    one of the happiest of men he had seldom known illness had scarcely ever felt pain in the very later part of his life he was annoyed with a cutaneous eruption and he told me one day i dreamt i was living in the town of itch in which existence consisted of itching it was a pretty and ingenious fancy of condillac to endow a statue with the different senses—first separately and then collectively why should he not have added the itching sense i conclude this memoir by quoting the eloquent opinion on his personal character in connexion with the principles of his philosophy pronounced by his friend dr southwood smith— the discovery and application of the true physical law at the foundation of all physical phenomena has produced a total revolution in the philosophy of physics the discovery and application of the true psychological law equally at the foundation of all mental phenomena is destined to produce a like revolution in the philosophy of morals before the principle announced by newton as affording the true exposition of the constitution and motion of all physical bodies has already fallen every other theory how remote soever the antiquity in which it took its origin how plausible soever the solution it gave of apparent but deceptive phenomena how great soever the ability with which it had been defended and the authority by which it had been sanctioned before the principle announced by bentham as affording the only true theory and directing to the only right and proper object and end of morals legislation and government is destined to fall every institution however ancient how much soever eulogised how deeply soever venerated by whomsoever pronounced to be the perfection of human reason which is not really conducive to human happiness every law constitutional civil and penal with whatever danger to partial and sinister interests its abrogation may be pregnant which is not conducive to security to liberty and to justice every mode of procedure in the administration of the law which does not render justice accessible speedy and cheap—which does not minimize delay vexation and expense every rule of conduct whether relating to public or to private life the observance of which does not tend to educe from the source of pleasure it is intended to regulate and control the largest obtainable amount of felicity and to exclude in the completest degree the corresponding pain with which almost every pleasure is but too apt to be linked every sanction physical judicial moral and religious which does not secure at the smallest cost of suffering the most perfect and uniform conformity of the general will and action to the appointed rule and in like manner upon this same principle will ultimately be established whatever institution law procedure rule and sanction human sagacity and experience may prove to be productive of happiness and exclusive of misery however its adoption may be obstructed for a time by ignorance by sinister interest and by prejudice growing out of such interest and had the human mind applied itself with all its faculties with all the energy which those faculties are capable of putting forth with sincerity of purpose and with perseverance to the adoption of institutions laws procedures rules and sanctions having such and only such ends in view had it devoted itself to this pursuit from that point of civilisation in the history of our race which is compatible with labour of this sort up to the present hour what would now have been the condition of human society what would now have been the amount of obtainable felicity felicity actually and hourly enjoyed by the millions of human beings that make up that vast aggregate if in every community in proportion as it advanced in civilisation every institution constitutional and social every law civil and penal every mode of procedure judicial and criminal every rule of action public and private every sanction physical penal moral and religious had been framed with the sole purpose of securing the greatest happiness    of all its members the greatest happiness of all of them without exception in as far as possible and the greatest happiness of the greatest number of them on every occasion in which the nature of the case renders the provision of an equal quantity of happiness for every one of them impossible framed with this view with all the intellectual power which might have been engaged in this service aided by all the experience accumulated from generation to generation and to the stores of which every hour of every day must without ceasing add framed that is with all the wisdom at all times at command wisdom necessarily approximating to perfection with the progression of time—had this been done not to speak of new sources of pleasure which might and which probably would have been opened but of which we have now no conception not to speak of new creations of felicity the existence of which however within the range of possibility must be admitted to be imaginary until actually in existence not to speak of any pleasures the reality and the value of which are not well known and duly appreciated—had the real the uniform purpose been what i have been supposing how many pleasures now within the reach only of the few would then have been in the possession of the many and how many pains from which only the few have now the means of security would then have been averted from all the contrast thus presented to the mind between the condition of the great mass of human beings as it is as it might have been and as it actually would have been had legislators and moralists aimed at the right end and pursued it with singleness and sincerity will be contemplated by every man with a degree of pain proportioned to the strength of his understanding and the intensity of his sympathy at an age when the intellectual power which he felt within him was in its freshness when the moral affections which warmed his heart were unchilled by contact with the world—when the affectionate sympathy for his fellowbeings which formed so large a part of his consciousness and which subsequently became the ruling passion of his life was in its first ardour this contrast in its full force was brought before the view of this illustrious man destined by the will of his father to the study and practice of the english law he commenced the study and entered on the practice but what was the position in which he found himself placed what when examined by a simple and clear understanding—what when the practical operation of it came to be witnessed by a pure and benevolent heart—was the english law like every one else for ages past he had been told that it was the perfection of human reason according to those who taught it according to those who practised it according to those who subsisted by it according even to those who suffered by it—suffered evils countless in number and measureless in extent it was matchless alike for the purity of its aims and the efficiency of the means provided for their accomplishment it was a fabric reared by the most exalted intellects reared with incredible labour through a long succession of ages with a difficulty not to be estimated yet with a skill so admirable and a result so felicitous as had never before been witnessed in any work merely human the understanding that did not bow down before it that did not worship it with prostrate reverence was low and base the hand that was raised to touch so much as a single particle of it to change it was profane it was the masterproduction of the matured experienced and virtuouslydisposed human mind it was the wonder and perfection of civilisation it gave to this blessed country that amazing amount of felicity by the enjoyment of which its people have been so long distinguished from all other people in the world making them the glory of the earth the envy of the surrounding nations such was the language universally held and the doctrine universally inculcated and that not merely with religious ardour but with enthusiast zeal and inculcated alike from the humble desk of the village school the    pulpit the bar the bench the senate and the throne and yet the english law thus idolised when the substance of it came to be examined by a simple and clear understanding—when the mode of administering it came to be witnessed by a pure and benevolent heart what was it found to be the substantive part of it whether as written in books or expounded by judges a chaos fathomless and boundless the huge and monstrous mass being made up of fiction tautology technicality circuity irregularity and inconsistency the administrative part of it a system of exquisitely contrived chicanery a system made up of abuses a system which constantly places the interest of the judicial minister in opposition to his duty so places his interest in opposition to his duty that in the very proportion in which it serves his ends it defeats the ends of justice a system of selfauthorized and unpunishable depredation a system which encourages mendacity both by reward and punishment a system which puts fresh arms into the hands of the injurer to annoy and distress the injured in a word a system which maximizes delay sale and denial of justice  shall i uphold this vile system said this just and benevolent man shall the prospect of obtaining wealth shall the hope of being what is called rewarded with titles and honours tempt me to assist in perpetuating it shall i do what in me lies to extend the widespread misery which flows from it no i will exhibit it in its true shape i will strip off the veil of mystery which has so long concealed its deformity i will destroy it i will do more for this chaos i will substitute order for this darkness light for this evil good the maximum of the aggregate of happiness—by this test i will try evil and good this shall be my standard this my guide i will survey the entire range of human feelings and volitions—such at least as can assume the shape of actions and as they pass in review before me i will determine by this rule what shall be sanctioned and what prohibited i will rear the fabric of felicity by the hands of reason and of law with powers of mind fitted for an undertaking thus stupendous such as in no age or country had ever before been equalled or even so much as approached with an ardour and energy such as in no cause bad or good had ever been surpassed he betook himself to the accomplishment of this work no difficulty stopped him no danger appalled him no labour exhausted him no temptation whether assuming the shape of good or of evil moved him fortune he disregarded the pursuit of what is called pleasure he renounced praise could as little bend him from his course as blame could check it human fear human favour had no control no influence over him human happiness was his object judicial institution his means and the completeness with which he has succeeded in developing the means is comparable only to the beneficence of the end in order to create it was necessary that he should destroy in order to build up it was necessary that he should pull down in order to establish law as it ought to be it was necessary that he should demolish law as it is alone he went to the assault alone he carried it on every weapon every mode of attack—ridicule reasoning invective wit eloquence sarcasm declamation demonstration—all were pressed into his service and each in its turn became in his hands a powerful instrument his efforts were regarded first with astonishment next with indignation when he was no longer looked upon as a madman he was hated as an enemy he was endeavouring to subvert the most glorious of human institutions institutions which had raised his country to the highest pinnacle of power and happiness institutions which time and the experience which time matures had shown to be at least the nearest approach to perfection which the wit of man had ever devised such declarations and such delarations were made in abundance and were reiterated with all the eloquence which large bribes given now and larger bribes promised    in future could secure did but redouble his efforts to expose the delusion to show that reason had seldom anything to do in the construction of the institutions thus idolised that they seldom aimed at the right end and still seldomer provided adequate means to accomplish the end even as far as the aim was right long and earnestly did he labour without any apparent effect but at last some impression was made the scales fell from the eyes of men of powerful intellects in commanding stations the imposture became palpable the monstrous idolatry before which men had allowed their understandings and their affections to fall prostrate was seen in its true shape a revulsion of feeling followed point after point was submitted to rigorous examination champion after champion stood forth in defence of each champion after champion was driven from his position however impregnable he thought it and now scarcely a single champion remains the cumbrous fabric is abandoned it totters to its fall it is undermined it is known to be so the general admission is that the law of england as it is cannot stand that it must be taken down and reconstructed glory to the hand that has destroyed it glory to the hand that has built up the beautiful structure reared in its place i will endeavour in few words to give some conception of the foundation of this new structure of its main compartments of its form such as it has assumed in the hands of its architect now capable of no further labour happily however as you will see what remains to complete the edifice can be furnished by other hands comprehending in his view the entire field of legislation this legislator divided it into two great portions—internal law and international law internal law including the legislative ordinances that concern an individual community international law those that concern the intercourse of different communities with each other his chief labour was directed to the construction of an allcomprehensive system or code that is law written and systematic of internal law under the term pannomion a term derived from two greek words signifying the whole body of the laws he has constructed such a code this allcomprehensive code is divided into four minor codes the constitutional the civil the penal and the administrative the constitutional code includes the several ordinances which relate to the form of the supreme authority and the mode by which its will is to be carried into effect the civil code includes the several ordinances which relate to the creation or constitution of rights and is termed the rightconferring code the penal code includes the several ordinances which relate to the creation or constitution of offences and is termed the wrongrepressing code the administrative code includes the several ordinances which relate to the mode of executing the whole body of the laws and is termed the code of procedure conduciveness to the maximum of the aggregate of happiness—that is the end in view each code is a distinct instrument specially adapted to secure this end each code has not indeed been left by him in a state of completeness but in no part of either as far as it has been developed is place given to a single enactment which has not for its object immediately or remotely the production of pleasure and the exclusion of pain in no part either of what he has himself done or marked out to be done by others is anything commanded—in no part is anything forbidden but as it is and in as far as it is conducive to or subversive of happiness—no constitutional provision determining the form of the government and the mode of its operation—no action bearing the seal of approbation or of disapprobation selected as the subject of reward or of punishment which is not brought to this standard and tried by this test it is only as the details under these two great divisions are studied that it is possible to form a conception of the steadiness with which this end is kept in view and the wisdom with which the means devised are adapted to secure it to the civil code he has done the least but even of this he    has laid the foundation and provided important materials for building up the fabric for the constitutional code he has done enough to render its completion comparatively easy while the allimportant branches of offences of reward and punishment of procedure of evidence have been worked out by him with a comprehensiveness and minuteness which may be said to have exhausted these subjects and to have left little or nothing in relation to them for any other man to do or to desire but his labours did not terminate here he found the science of morals in the same state of darkness as that of legislation the fitness of things the law of nature natural justice natural equity good order truth the will of god—such were the tests of good and evil the standards of right and wrong heretofore assumed by moralists every different moralist had a different fancy which he made his standard and a different taste which he made his test of good or evil and the degree of conformity or nonconformity to that taste the indication of the degree of desert and consequently the measure of reward and punishment† but by establishing the foundation of morals on the principle of felicity by showing that every action is right or wrong virtuous or vicious deserving of    approbation or disapprobation in proportion to its tendency to increase or to diminish the amount of happiness this philosopher supplied what was so much needed in morals at once an infallible test and an allpowerful motive happiness is the standard and the test happiness is equally the motive can there be if this be not a certain test can there be if this be not an allpowerful motive conduciveness to happiness—this it is that constitutes the goodness of an action this it is that renders an action a duty this it is which supplies a motive to the performance of duty not to be resisted i am satisfied that a particular course of conduct will conduce to my happiness do i need any other inducement to make me pursue that course can i resist the influence of this inducement no as long as this is my conviction as long as this conviction is present to my mind it is no more possible for me to refrain from pursuing the course of conduct in question than    it is possible for my body to refuse to obey the law of gravitation the object of the science of morals then is to show what is really conducive to happiness the happiness of every individual man the happiness of all men taken together considered as forming one great aggregate the happiness of all beings whatever that are capable of the impression for the science in its enlarged sense embraces not only the human race but the whole of the sentient creation according to the felicitarian philosophy there is no contrariety and there never can be any real contrariety between happiness and duty in the true and comprehensive sense of those terms happiness and duty are identical always so and always necessarily so they do not always appear to be so but it is the business of the moralist to show that whenever an apparent contrariety exists the appearance is delusive when he has accomplished this he has effected his end because when he has accomplished this my will—my action as necessarily follows in the direction in which it is his purpose to guide it as a stone projected from the earth necessarily falls to the earth again and the apparent contrariety between happiness and duty from what does it arise either from the representation of that as happiness which is not happiness or from the representation of that as duty which is not duty and what is at the bottom of this misrepresentation either i take into view only my own gratification to the exclusion of the gratification of others or i take into view only my immediate gratification to the exclusion of a higher gratification at some future period or i commit both errors at once now it is the business of the moralist to prevent me from falling into either to make me acquainted with the cases in relation to which the gratification of others is essential to my own in relation to which my own gratification must necessarily flow from the gratification of others in relation to which if i attempt to pursue my own gratification without taking into account the gratification of others and more especially at the expense of their gratification instead of securing happiness to myself i shall be sure to involve myself in suffering to make me acquainted in like manner with the cases in relation to which it is necessary that i should take a comprehensive view of happiness that i should consider not merely the pleasure of the moment or the hour but the pleasure of the year or the remainder of my life to make these matters as clear to my understanding as the light of day is visible to my eye is the business of the moralist often no doubt a difficult task because although the connexion between a certain course of conduct and happiness and misery may be quite as real and quite as invariable as that between light and vision yet not being so immediate the invariableness of the sequence is not so clearly seen by the mind to bring this sequence out from the obscurity in which it may be involved and to make it manifest to discover and to show what moral antecedents are invariably followed by what moral sequents to establish in the mind a conviction of this invariableness of connexion between the one and the other—this is the province of the moralist as he multiplies the antecedents and sequents in regard to which he makes out the fact that there is this invariableness of relation he enlarges his science in proportion to the completeness with which he fixes in the mind a conviction of this relation he fulfils its end it is this which our great legislator and moralist ever kept steadily in view whatever it is for a mans happiness to do or to abstain from doing that as a legislator he commands or forbids whatever it is for a mans happiness to do or to abstain from doing that as a moralist he makes it his duty to pursue or to avoid  0 in selecting as a legislator the subjects of reward and punishment he is invariably guided by this principle that if by misrepresentation of consequences by erroneous reasoning or by fear of punishment whether physical moral political or religious a man be prohibited from the enjoyment of any real pleasure from whatever source derived an injury is inflicted upon him equal in amount to the balance of pleasure of which he is deprived for this reason in no single instance in any law proposed by him is anything commanded which is not in some shape or other conducive to pleasure nor anything forbidden which is not in some shape or other conducive to pain    in like manner in deciding as a moralist what is proper or improper right or wrong virtuous or vicious he is guided by the principle that every one must determine from his own experience what is pleasurable and what is painful that no one has a right to insist that what is gratification to him and only what is gratification to him shall be gratification to another that for any man in the capacity of a moralist to say—if i do this i shall get no preponderance of pleasure but if you do this you may get a preponderance of pleasure yet it is not proper that you should do it is absurdity that if such moralist apply evil in any shape to prevent the act it is injustice and injury that if he call in the powers of government to prevent the act it is tyranny that nevertheless there are pleasures which are pure that is unmixed with pain pleasures which are lasting pleasures which are cumulative the very capacity for enjoying them continually increasing with the indulgence that these are the truest because the greatest pleasures that these deserve the most careful cultivation but that to imagine that any pleasure can come from a bad source that whatever yields pleasure that is preponderance of pleasure is not good—good for that reason and in that proportion—is to despise one pleasure because it is not another to despise a smaller pleasure because it is not a greater which is absurd what a cultivation of happiness is here what true husbandry of it what a thorough rootingout of the tares so often sown with the wheat while the legislator and the moralist have slept after this account of the labours of the philosopher you will perhaps be desirous of knowing something of his private history and habits and there are some points relative to both which now assume a peculiar interest jeremy bentham was born at the residence of his father adjacent to aldgate church in london on the   th of february       and died in queens square place westminster where he had resided nearly half a century on the  th of june      being in the   th year of his age he was a precocious child at the age of three years he read rapins history of england as an amusement at the age of five he had acquired a knowledge of musical notes and played on the violin at the age of seven he read télémaque in french at the age of eight he entered westminster school where he soon became distinguished at the age of thirteen he was admitted a member of queens college oxford where he at once engaged in public disputations in the common hall and excited by the acuteness of his observations the precision of his terms and the logical correctness of his inductions the surprise and admiration of all who heard him at the age of sixteen he took his degree of ab and at the age of twenty that of am being the youngest graduate that had at that time been known at either of the universities from early childhood such was the contemplative turn of his mind and the clearness and accuracy with which he observed whatever came under his notice that at the age of five years he had already acquired the name of the philosopher being familiarly called so by the members of his family and such even in his youth were the indications of that benevolence to which his manhood and his old age were consecrated that a celebrated statesman who at that period had conceived an affection for him and with whom he spent most of his time during the interval of his leaving westminster school and going to oxford speaks of him in a letter to his father in these remarkable words—his disinterestedness and his originality of character refresh me as much as the country air does a london physician the qualities which already formed the charm of his character and which grew with his growth and strengthened with his strength were truth and simplicity truth was deeply founded in his nature as a principle it was devotedly pursued in his life as an object it exercised even in early youth an extraordinary influence over the operations of his mind and the affections of his    heart and it was the source of that moral boldness energy and consistency for which from the period of manhood to the close of life he was so distinguished there was nothing in the entire range of physical moral or legislative science nothing whatever relating to any class of subjects that could be presented to his understanding nothing however difficult other men thought it or pretended to think it—or with whatever superstitious political or religious reverence and awe they regarded or affected to regard it which he did not approach without fear to the very bottom of which he did not endeavour to penetrate the mystery regarding which he did not strive to clear away the real the whole truth of which he did not aim to bring to light nor was there any consideration—no not even apparent danger to the cause he advocated though by the desertion of friends and the clamour of foes that cause might seem for a while to be put in jeopardy that could induce him to conceal any conclusion at which he arrived and of the correctness of which he was satisfied or could prevent him from expressing it in the most appropriate language at his command it was not possible to apply his principle to all the points and bearings of all the subjects included in the difficult and contested field of legislation government and morals—to apply it as he applied it acutely searchingly profoundly unflinchingly—without consequences at first view startling if not appalling to strong minds and stout hearts they startled not they appalled not him mind or heart he had confidence in his guide he was satisfied that he might go with unfaltering step wherever it led and with unfaltering step he did go wherever it led hence his singleness of purpose hence in all his voluminous writings in all the multiplicity of subjects which have come under his investigation as well those which he has exhausted as those which he has merely touched as well those which are uncomplicated by sinister interests and the prejudices which grow out of them as those which are associated with innumerable false judgments and wrong affections hence in regard to not one of them does a single case occur in which he has swerved from his principle or faltered or so much as shown the slightest indication of faltering in the application of it that he might be in the less danger of falling under the influence of any wrong bias he kept himself as much as possible from all personal contact with what is called the world had he engaged in the active pursuits of life—moneygetting poweracquiring pursuits—he like other men so engaged must have had prejudices to humour interests to conciliate friends to serve enemies to subdue and therefore like other men under the influence of such motives must sometimes have missed the truth and sometimes have concealed or modified it but he placed himself above all danger of this kind by retiring from the practice of the profession for which he had been educated and by living in a simple manner on a small income allowed him by his father and when by the death of his father he at length came into the possession of a patrimony which secured him a moderate competence from that moment he dismissed from his mind all further thought about his private fortune and bent the whole powers of his mind without distraction to his legislative and moral labours nor was he less careful to keep his benevolent affections fervent than his understanding free from wrong bias he surrounded himself only with persons whose sympathies were like his own and whose sympathies he might direct to their appropriate objects in the active pursuits of life though he himself took no part in the actual business of legislation and government yet either by personal communication or confidential correspondence with them he guided the minds of many of the most distinguished legislators and patriots not only of his own country but of all countries in both hemispheres to frame weapons for the advocates of the reform of the institutions of his own country was his daily occupation and his highest pleasure and to him resorted for counsel and encouragement the most able and devoted of    those advocates while the patriots and philanthropists of europe as well as those of the new world the countrymen of washington franklin and jefferson together with the legislators and patriots of south america speak of him as a tutelary spirit and declare the practical application of his principles to be the object and end of their labours while he availed himself of every means in his power of forming and cherishing a friendship with whoever in any country indicated remarkable benevolence while howard was his intimate friend—a friend delighted alike to find and to acknowledge in him a superior beneficent genius while romilly was not only the advocate of his opinions in the senate but the affectionate and beloved disciple in private while for the youth la fayette his junior contemporary he conceived an affection which in the old age of both was beautiful for the freshness and ardour with which it continued to glow while there was no name in any country known and dear to liberty and humanity which was not known and dear to him and no person bearing such name that ever visited england who was not found at his social board he would hold intercourse with none of any rank or fame whose distinction was unconnected with the promotion of human improvement and much less whose distinction arose from the zeal and success with which they laboured to keep back improvement that the current of his own benevolence might experience no interruption or disturbance he uniformly avoided engaging in any personal controversy he contended against principles and measures not men and for the like reason he abstained from reading the attacks made upon himself so that the ridicule and scoffing the invective and malignity with which he was sometimes assailed proved as harmless to him as to his cause by the society he shunned as well as by that which he sought he endeavoured to render his social intercourse subservient to the cultivation to the perpetual growth and activity of his benevolent sympathies with such care over his intellectual faculties and his moral affections and with the exalted direction which he gave to both his own happiness could not but be sure few human beings have enjoyed a greater portion of felicity and such was the cheerfulness which this internal happiness gave to the expression of his countenance and the turn of his conversation that few persons ever spent an evening in his society however themselves favoured by fortune who did not depart with the feeling of satisfaction at having beheld such an object of emulation even in his writings in the midst of profound and comprehensive views there oftentimes break forth a sportiveness and humour no less indicative of gaiety of heart than the most elaborate and original of his investigations are of a mastermind but this gaiety was characteristic of his conversation in which he seldom alluded except in a playful manner to the great subjects of his labours a childlike simplicity of manner combined with a continual playfulness of wit made you forget that you were in the presence of the most acute and penetrating genius made you conscious only that you were in the presence of the most innocent and gentle the most consciously and singularly happy of human beings and from this the true source of politeness a benevolent and happy mind endeavouring to communicate the pleasure of which it is itself conscious flowed those unobtrusive but not the less real and observant attentions of which every guest perceived the grace and felt the charm for the pleasures of the social board he had a relish as sincere and perhaps as acute as those who are capable of enjoying no others and he partook of them freely as far as they are capable of affording their appropriate good without any admixture of the evils which an excessive indulgence in them is sure to bring after dinner it was his custom to enter with his disciple or friend for seldom more than one and never more than two dined with him on the same day on the discussion of the subject whatever it might be which had brought them together    and it was at this time also that in the form of dictation in relation to those subjects which admit of this mode of composition his disciple writing down his words as he uttered them he treated of some of the subjects which have occupied his closest attention and in the investigation of which he has displayed the greatest degree of originality and invention in this manner was composed the greatest part of the deontology and nearly the whole of his autobiography at all times it was a fine exercise of the understanding and sometimes an exquisite gratification of the noblest and best feelings of the heart to be engaged in this service he was capable of great severity and continuity of mental labour for upwards of half a century he devoted seldom less than eight often ten and occasionally twelve hours of every day to intense study this was the more remarkable as his physical constitution was by no means strong his health during the periods of childhood youth and adolescence was infirm it was not until the age of manhood that it acquired some degree of vigour but that vigour increased with advancing age so that during the space of sixty years he never laboured under any serious malady and rarely suffered even from slight indisposition and at the age of eightyfour he looked no older and constitutionally was not older than most men are at sixty thus adding another illustrious name to the splendid catalogue which establishes the fact that severe and constant mental labour is not incompatible with health and longevity but conducive to both provided the mind be unanxious and the habits temperate he was a great economist of time he knew the value of minutes the disposal of his hours both of labour and of repose was a matter of systematic arrangement and the arrangement was determined on the principle that it is a calamity to lose the smallest portion of time he did not deem it sufficient to provide against the loss of a day or an hour he took effectual means to prevent the occurrence of any such calamity to him but he did more he was careful to provide against the loss even of a single minute and there is on record no example of a human being who lived more habitually under the practical consciousness that his days are numbered and that the night cometh in which no man can work the last days of the life even of an ordinary human being are seldom altogether destitute of interest but when exalted wisdom and goodness have excited a high degree of admiration and love the heart delights to treasure up every feeling then elicited and every word in which that feeling was expressed it had long been his wish that i should be present with him during his last illness there seemed to be on his mind an apprehension that among the organic changes which gradually take place in the corporeal system in extreme old age it might be his lot to labour under some one the result of which might be great and longcontinued suffering in this case he knew that i should do everything in my power to diminish pain and to render death easy the contributing to the euthanasia forming in my opinion as he knew no unimportant part of the duty of the physician on the possible protraction of life with the failure of the intellectual powers he could not think without great pain but it was only during his last illness that is a few weeks before his death that any apprehension of either of these evils occurred to him from the former he suffered nothing and from the latter as little as can well be unless when death is instantaneous the serenity and cheerfulness of his mind when he became satisfied that his work was done and that he was about to lie down to his final rest was truly affecting on that work he looked back with a feeling which would have been a feeling of triumph had not the consciousness of how much still remained to be done changed it to that of sorrow that he was allowed to do no more but this feeling again gave place to a calm but deep emotion of exultation as he recollected that he left behind him able zealous and faithful    minds that would enter into his labours and complete them the last subject on which he conversed with me and the last office in which he employed me related to the permanent improvement of the circumstances of a family the junior member of which had contributed in some degree to his personal comfort and i was deeply impressed and affected by the contrast thus brought to my view between the selfishness and apathy so often the companions of age and the generous care for the welfare of others of which his heart was full among the very last things which his hand penned in a book of memoranda in which he was accustomed to note down any thought or feeling that passed through his mind for future revision and use if susceptible of use was found the following passage—i am a selfish man as selfish as any man can be but in me somehow or other so it happens selfishness has taken the shape of benevolence no other man is there upon earth the prospect of whose sufferings would to me be a pleasurable one no man is there upon earth the sight of whose sufferings would not to me be a more or less painful one no man upon earth is there the sight of whose enjoyments unless believed by me to be derived from a more than equivalent suffering endured by some other man would not be of a pleasurable nature rather than of a painful one such in me is the force of sympathy and this force of sympathy governed his very last hour of consciousness some time before his death when he firmly believed he was near that last hour he said to one of his disciples who was watching over him—i now feel that i am dying our care must be to minimize the pain do not let any of the servants come into the room and keep away the youths it will be distressing to them and they can be of no service yet i must not be alone you will remain with me and you only and then we shall have reduced the pain to the least possible amount such were his last thoughts and feelings so perfectly so beautifully did he illustrate in his own example what it was the labour of his life to make others    appendix selections from benthams narrative regarding the panopticon penitentiary project and from the correspondence on the subject i must give a separate place to the panopticon as it occupied so large a portion of benthams life and is so constantly referred to in his correspondence in    0  he wrote a volume which he entitled history of the war between jeremy bentham and george the third by one of the belligerents containing an account of the progress and failure of the panopticon scheme it is too long to reprint but i shall extract from it the most remarkable passages bentham begins by saying— but for george the third all the prisoners in england would years ago have been under my management but    for george the third all the paupers in the country would long ago have been under my management the work entitled pauper management—the work to which this brief and it is hoped not altogether uninstructive nor uninteresting history is designed to serve as an introduction—would have become law but for george the third one of the joint wishes and endeavours of pitt the second and lord melville the first to which no just condemnation can be attached would they had been more numerous would have been fulfilled it was with me the war commenced i confess it i feel no need of being ashamed of it it is for the reader to say to himself whether i have or no yes i was the first aggressor—meaning in the character of a subject making in a certain way war upon his sovereign but whether that sovereign had not been intentionally an aggressor in endeavouring to plunge his subjects into a groundless war against a foreign sovereign the reader will judge i paralysed his hand i saved the two countries perhaps others likewise from this calamity he vowed revenge and to effect it he wounded me through the sides of this his country not to speak of so many others† no muse shall i invoke no muse would listen to me a plain tale is all i have to tell let others if any who may feel disposed and able stick flowers in it catharine the second had celebrity nor that altogether undeserved in a female body she had a masculine mind she laid the foundation of a code—an allcomprehensive code my brother whose loss i had to lament not many years ago—my only brother of whose education he being nine years my junior the superintendence fell into my hands when on a travellers visit to that country was found possessed of rare talents was arrested put into office and succeeded in the year      or      i being on a visit to my brother of a year and a half or thereabouts at crichoff in white russia where he was stationed with a battalion of a thousand men under his command on an estate then lately purchased by prince potemkin prime minister of russia under catharine the second the idea presented itself to him of a mode of architecture to which i gave the name of panopticon from the two greek words—one of which signified everything the other a place of sight a mr pinchbeck a sort of artist who enjoyed more or less of the personal favour of george the third had either anticipated me or afterwards followed me in the employment given to that name the purpose to which this rotundoform was destined to be employed by my brother was that of a large workshop in which with or without the benefit of steamengine power occupations capable of being in any degree diversified might be carried on partitions in the form and position of radii of the circle being employed in separating from each other such as required to be so separated in the centre was the apartment styled from its destination the inspectors lodge from thence by turning round his axis a functionary standing or sitting on the central point had it in his power to commence and conclude a survey of the whole establishment in the twinkling of an eye to use a proverbial phrase but forasmuch as men had not in these days—whatsoever may have been the case in the days of pliny and the traveller mandeville—any visual organs seated in the back part of the human frame it was considered accordingly that it was material to good order that the workmen whose operations were designed to be thus watched should not be able to know each of them respectively at any time whether he was or was not at that moment in a state in which the eyes of the inspector were directed to his person in such manner as to take a view of it accordingly for the production of this effect provision was made of an annular screen pierced in such a manner with slits or holes that    by any person it might be seen whether a person whom in this or that other part of the building he was taking a view of was knowing whether he was viewed or not taking in hand this idea i made application of it for the purpose of the case in which the persons subjected to inspection were placed in that situation not only for the purpose of being subjected to direction but also for the purpose of being made to suffer in the way of punishment in a word as a place of labour and confinement for convicts to the carrying this design into effect two requisites were necessary—the first an appropriate form of architecture as above and an appropriate plan of management so organized as to draw from that mode of architecture as far as practicable all the advantages it was capable of affording in the course of my reflections on this latter subject i came to my conclusion that the customary plan pursued in works instituted by government and carried on on account of government was in an eminent degree ill adapted to the purpose though to this general rule particular exceptions there might be but to the particular purpose then in hand they had no application accordingly management by contract i became convinced was the only plan that afforded a probability of good success in pursuance of the labours of howard who died a martyr to benevolence sir william blackstone the illustrious commentator on the law of england—sir wlliam blackstone in connexion with mr eden afterwards coroneted by the title of lord auckland devised a plan of architecture and management of a prison for the confinement of convicts and accordingly drew up for that purpose a bill which received the official denomination of the hardlabour bill their plan was in some form or other laid before the public with such explanations as were thought requisite the plan of management was—not contractmanagement as above but trustmanagement the managing hands whether one or more not having any interest in the success gaining nothing in case of profit losing nothing in case of loss in a word their interest was not to be coincident with their duty on the contrary the one was destined to operate in constant opposition to the other for where a man has nothing to gain by labour it is his interest to be idle or do anything but labour actuated by these conceptions i published anno      a tract entitled view of the hardlabour bill in this work i took in hand the plan of the two illustrious statesmen applied to it the above principle examined it in all its details and the result was what appeared to me to be a complete demonstration of its inaptitude blackstone notwithstanding the war i had made upon him in my fragment on government in answer to the present i made him of a copy of that little work sent me a civil note acknowledging that he and his coöperator had derived assistance from it they went to work notwithstanding and obtained an act of parliament under and by virtue of which they fixed upon a site for the erection it was a spot of about fourscore acres in the vicinity of battersea and distinguished by the name of battersea rise for ascertaining the sum to be paid for it by government a jury according to custom was summoned and assessed the value at a sum between six and seven thousand pounds on payment of that sum it was in the power of government at any time to take possession of it and transfer it into any hands at pleasure from causes not necessary to bring on this occasion to view the undertaking lingered and the verdict of the appraising jury remained without effect meantime my brother remaining still in russia i was unable for want of his assistance to determine upon the exact form of the edifice and through want of means to make a proposal for the performance of the function in question by contract in the year    0 the return of my brother to england furnished me with the requisite architectural skill and the death of my father which took    place in march      with the addition of assistance from without supplied the pecuniary means accordingly in march      i sent in to mr pitt then first lord of the treasury and mr dundas then secretary of state afterwards created lord melville a proposal for the taking charge of convicts to the number of a thousand according to the abovementioned plan of construction and management upon the terms therein mentioned this proposal in the terms in which it was sent in is here subjoined at the bottom of the page for giving the requisite powers to the executive authority an act of parliament was necessary somehow or other the business lingered nobody but the king and prime minister pitt knew why even lord melville i have some reason to think remained in a state of ignorance for as i still remember mr nepean then undersecretary of state under mr dundas showed me a short note from mr dundas to mr pitt reproaching him with the delay what i also remember is mr douglas created then or afterwards lord glenbervie  00 telling me of something which on the occasion of an interview of his with mr pitt he had said in the view of expediting it at length came the day in      on which the act was passed by which the doing the business by contract was authorized and the spot at battersea rise which as above had been destined to the reception of a penitentiary establishment on the plan of sir william blackstone and mr eden was made to change its destiny and was transferred to the intended penitentiary to be erected and managed upon my plan the lingering continued nobody knew why mr pitt was shy in speaking of it after three or four years interval the business came upon the carpet in another form in the year      was instituted the important and influential finance committee—the first by which a report approaching to any such length as that which this committee gave birth to was produced mr abbot having distinguished himself at christ church college oxford where through the medium of westminster school he had succeeded to a studentship had been received into favour by the duke of leeds of that day and through his means had been sent by a rotten borough to the house of commons having been called to the bar he was nominated chairman to that committee by mr pitt at the recommendation of mr pepper arden afterwards made lord chiefjustice of the common pleas mr abbot was related to me by marriage when he was between five and six years old his mother took for her second husband my father and became his second wife he and his elder brother were bred up together with my brother in the house which i now inhabit they going at the same time for instruction to westminster school between the ages of the abbots there was an interval of two years—my brothers was at a nearly equal distance between the two in those days mr colquhoun who upon the institution of the metropolitan police magistracy in the year      was appointed one of the three police magistrates sitting at the queen square westminster office had distinguished himself by his work on the police by the abovementioned finance committee he was brought before them with my proposal the same by which the abovementioned act of parliament had  0  been procured in his hand how this happened i never knew—whether it was of his own accord or at the suggestion of the prime minister or some other member of the government among the members of that committee was mr now the right honourable reginald pole carew he had become my friend and a warm partisan of the panopticon system through the medium of my brother with whom he had become acquainted at petersburg the task of making a report on the panopticon plan was committed to his hands the report he drew up accordingly in favour of the plan was couched in such strong terms that prudence suggested and produced the suppression of it it went into other hands—whose they were i do not at present recollect if i ever knew—whether those of mr abbot chairman of the entire committee or any one else of a speech which on that occasion mr abbot made in the committee the substance was at the time reported to me referring to some of the most noted instances of cruelty that history records we do not sit here said he to try causes but the cruelty of the cruelest of those cases was not comparable to that which this man has been suffering on this occasion the lords of the treasury were called upon to say whether or no they were prepared to go on with the plan and if not why not—they answered in cold terms in the affirmative at this time however or before i was informed that the spot at battersea rise which had formed the basis of the proposal made by me and acceded to as above could not be given to me two personages were the parties interested—the then archbishop of york dr markham in right of the see the paramount proprietor earl spencer as lessee under a long lease from that same see the archbishop had been headmaster of westminster school during the five or six years which i had passed in that seminary he submitted without reluctance a civil letter which he wrote to me on that occasion intimating his consent is still in my possession lord spencer demurred he refused to cede the spot to me but he gave me reason to hope that another part of his estate called i believe battersea fields might be conceded to me his steward he said had informed him that the setting up of an institution of that sort threatened to be detrimental to other parts of his vast property in that neighbourhood the spot destined to the institution by parliament was an elevated one—the highest part of it at the same height above the water by which one boundary of it was bathed—namely about ninetytwo feet—as the top of the roof of westminster abbey the spot which i had been led to expect in lieu of it was also contiguous to the river but was little if anything better than a marsh by the noble earl i was kept from the cold in hot water for about a twelvemonth at the end of which time i was informed that it never had been his intention that i should have either the one spot or the other but that should he be compelled to give up part of his estate for the purpose the choice between the two being at the same time allowed to him it should be the low and not the elevated ground i was thereupon turned adrift dislodged from this spot and sent abroad in quest of another spot like our first parents the world before me—but if providence was my guide she proved for this time but a blind one many were the spots thought of several visited and two or three provisionally approved of of one of them about seven or eight miles to the south or southeast of london i remember nothing more at present than that it was elevated—this property being originally recommended and always wished for and to such a degree stony as to be barren another is that which is called hanging wood—an elevated and beautiful spot on this side of woolwich by what means in these several cases the door after having been opened was finally shut against me is not worth recollecting at length an opportunity that seemed favourable presented itself the earl of salisbury of that day happened to be in want of a sum in ready money—he had a freehold estate at millbank—it had for one of its boundaries  0  a line of about halfamile in length and washed all the way by the thames at length the time was come for putting a final extinguisher upon all hopes the millbank estate was now in my possession all but the one piece of gardenground for the buying out of the lease of which £ 000 was necessary the mornings as usual were passed in the treasury chambers either in a waitingroom—not unfrequently the boardroom itself—or the passages i had become familiar with three of the chief clerks one day said one of them to me well now you will not have long to wait—the warrant for the £ 000 is gone to the king—his majesty is a man of business—seldom does a document wait more than twentyfour hours for his signature the next day came and the next to that and so on for three weeks—a day or two more or less—all the while the same familiarity and favour in all faces but the surprise on both parts continually on the increase on the day that followed on repairing to the usual haunt i found everything converted into ice upon my putting some question or other mr bentham said the clerk to whom i addressed myself you must be sensible that this is a sort of information that is never given and as seldom asked for if these were not the very words this at any rate was the very substance here ended all hopes of setting up the prison institution still however the millbank estate remained in my hands part and parcel in the occupation of tenants holding of me at will—other part at first in the hands out of which it should have been purchased and at length the lease having expired in the occupation of a tenant at will as before not only the land itself was thus in my possession but the deeds by which it had been conveyed to me until those deeds could be got out of my hands and transferred to certain others it was not thought advisable to dispose of the land in any other manner various were the stratagems employed for the acquisition of these same documents the recital would be not only instructive but amusing could time be spared for it i come now to another campaign of the war in      pitt the first then prime minister brought in his poor bill universal was the sensation produced by a measure so important and extensive it had for its leading idea and groundwork a plan that had been proposed by mr ruggles a country gentleman of essex i took in hand this bill i dissected it i proposed a succedaneum to it this succedaneum i couched in the form of letters addressed to arthur young for proposed insertion into the annals of agriculture which had been brought into existence a short time before they appeared accordingly in four successive numbers in the form of letters addressed to the editor of these same annals the matter of them is that which forms the matter of the body of pauper management† it may be seen to contain a complete system of provision for the helpless and indigent portion of the community of england and wales included local field the same as that of minister pitts abovementioned poor bill mutatis mutandis plan of architecture the same as that of panopticon plan—devised for the lodgement maintenance and employment of prisoners note—that it was for persons of the unoffending class that this new plan of architure was originally devised principle of universal and constant inspectability the same in both cases inspectability of the inspectors by the eye of the public opinion tribunal the same in both cases but actual subjection to inspection in no cases except those in which it was required by the different purposes or objects in view of the different or in some respects coincident institutions arthur young was in a state of rapture he presented me with   0 copies of those nos of his annals in which the matter was contained by me they were distributed at different  0  times among such persons in whose hands they presented to my conception a promise of being of use whether any of the copies were ever on sale is more than i can remember among those presented were one to minister pitt the other to senior secretary of state george—afterwards sir george rose and one i take for granted but from inference rather than remembrance to secretary dundas all this while panopticon for prison management remained upon the carpet one day i received from mr rose an invitation to call upon him—not at his office but at his house days are on this occasion of more importance than months or even years notwithstanding the unequivocal and repeated tokens of approbation that had been given to the panopticon plan by the plannergeneral of all the arrangements of the prime minister my intercourse with him had as yet been no otherwise than at arms length in demeanour master and man proportions gardées were alike cold and haughty the man was passionate rough and coarse imagine my astonishment who can when after giving me to understand that those on whom the issue depended had read the work and read it with approbation he concluded with saying come and dine with me here one day the beginning of next week—mr pitt and mr dundas will meet you—and we will settle about this plan of yours the day of the week on which this announcement was made was friday i was in the seventh heaven the monday passed away—the tuesday in like manner—the wednesday eke also there ended the beginning of the week on the thursday i heard as it were by accident by whose mouth i did not long remember that on the wednesday instead of myself mr ruggles had been the guest but that the entertainment had closed with mutual dissatisfaction from the abovementioned seventh heaven this intelligence cast me down if not to the bottom of the abyss of despair at any rate but a little distance from it—a bush of thorns having caught hold of the skirts of my clothing and saved me from absolute destruction before this time i had received intimation from mr rose that strong as had been the approbation bestowed upon my plan by all those to whose department the business belonged other persons there were by whom it had been viewed with an eye not altogether favourable who these persons were was not mentioned nor any description given of them less mysterious than this what the power was that thus stood in the way was more than at that time i had any suspicion of there was an end to my situation of subregulus of the poor but my claim to be subregulus of the imprisoned part of the population still lingered to contractmanagement was to be substituted trustmanagement—in other words the trustees being constituted authorities nominees of other superior constituted authorities management by patronage or in still ulterior words to management by functionaries in whose instance interest coincided with duty—trustees whose interest was at daggersdrawn with duty that everything might be done in due that is to say in accustomed form a committee of honourable house was duly organized—number of members twentyone appropriately packed for the purpose on this occasion what other persons were examined i cannot recollect—the votes of the time would of course show i of course was of the number this formality being gone through an act was passed in      never does the current of my thoughts alight upon the panopticon and its fate but my heart sinks within me upon the panopticon in both its branches—the prisoner branch and the pauper branch upon what they are now and what they ought to have been and would have been had any other king than this same george the third been in those days on the throne according to the calculations which had then been with close attention made the pecuniary value of a child at its birth—that value which at present is not merely equal 0 but equal to an oppressively large negative  0  quantity would under that system of maintenance and education which i had prepared for it expense of conveyance to the distant site allowed for have been a positive quantity to no inconsiderable amount so much for unoffending indigence as to the criminallyoffending part of population no tamer of elephants had a better grounded anticipation of the success of his management than i had of mine as applied to the offending school of my scholars learned and right honourable judges i would not then have undertaken—i would not now undertake to tame learned gentlemen in full practice i would not have undertaken to tame noble lords i would not have undertaken to tame honourable gentlemen i would not have undertaken to tame as to learned judges under the existing system i have shown to demonstration nor has that demonstration ever been contested nor will it ever be contested that not to speak of malevolence and benevolence the most maleficent of the men whom they consign to the gallows is in comparison with those by whom this disposition is made of them not maleficent but beneficent various were my adventures when year after year i was sent or encouraged to go upon a place του στω—a landhunting—hunting after terra firma which i so oftentimes found slippery as ice—slipping through my fingers analogous in some sort was my unhappy chase to that of fenelons telemachus when rambling in quest of his father ulysses as often as he thought himself on the point of receiving the paternal embrace consigned by some delusion or other to final disappointment but how sadly different the catastrophe—how opposite in my case to what is called poetical justice a little before or after the presentation of my convicts panopticon plan to pitt the second in london i had transmitted it to ireland to sir john parnell then chancellor of the exchequer father of the present sir henry favourable in no small degree was the acceptance given to it out of it grew the two volumes entitled panopticon c which are still before the public between myself and that worthy man and honest functionary it produced a correspondence and in the course of a visit of his to london a personal intercourse and interchange of convivial hospitality at one time came to me from the baronet an invitation to dublin for the purpose of superintending the building and organizing the institution there in this summons was comprised an invitation to take for the time that my stay in that metropolis continued his house for my home all this notwithstanding somehow or other i found that after that invitation i had sent to dublin to the appointed office my mss for impression the impression notwithstanding my instances stood still and hence it was that it was continued at my own expense and put into the form in which it is now visible at this time lord westmoreland was lordlieutenant of ireland an architectural plan of the prison contemplated for dublin was put by the chancellor of the exchequer into the hand of his excellency they will all get out were the very words of the answer as reported to me nor was the observation altogether groundless for of those safeguards which are common to all prisons no graphical representation was i believe contained nor even for want of room the plan of external fortification and circumvallation be this as it may the laconicalness of the observation in conjunction with the tone and deportment which accompanied it were such as sufficed to show that attempts at explanation would have been fruitless—would have been presented to averted head closed eyelids and obdurated ears not altogether favourable to the superior was the observation hereupon made to me by the subordinate functionary and the character in few words given of him but the maxim de mortuis nil nisi bonum has its counterpart in the shorter maxim de vivis ne maledic—at any rate when the situation of the vivi is in so high a degree elevated many years after a similarly decisive rejection was put upon the plan—that is to say the architectural part of it—by a home secretary in london  0  divers models of different sizes for the purpose of conveying an impression of the whole together in particular parts of it had been put together by my brother and exhibited in the house from which this is dated in the room which now is employed as a library by appointment enter the duke of portland with two of his graces sons scarce had he bestowed a glance upon each of the models when the observation came from him—not light enough such was the substance of the observation not more than twice as many the words whatever they were—nor was this condemnation passed by his grace in london more groundless than that passed so many years before in dublin by his excellency true it is that the edifice being circularly polygonal glass was the sole material of which the boundary all round was composed with the exception of the aggregate of the ironbars and leadings necessary for the imbeddings of the panes of glass and as to the want of light in the inspectors lodge in the centre in the first place what his duty required was not to be seen but only to see and the partitions ten or eleven in number being all of them in the direction of the radii of the circumscribing circle opposed next to no obstruction to the entrance of the light even to that station in which light was so little necessary namely the abovementioned central lodge in the history written by iforgetwhat illustrious frenchman under the unpretending title of fairy tales one of the occurrences is the imprisonment of the heroine in a palace the boundaries of which were composed throughout of one solid mass of glass of this archetype the panopticon was as near a similitude as the limited power of human art could admit of in form the edifice had its similitude and its really existing archetype in the once celebrated place of entertainment designated by the appellation of ranelagh house or for shortness ranelagh—having originally been built for and inhabited by general jones created by william the third earl of ranelagh in ireland scene of many an amorous intrigue and for that purpose indicated as destined by the viscountess and her learned gallant in one of the prints of hogarths marriage àlamode† another and much betterfated similitude for it still exists and flourishes is the capital part of the splendid conservatory in the nurseryground of mr loddiges in the neighbourhood of hackney all this is true but not less true it is that in the room in which the models in question were dimensions of the boundary fronting the light    feet in it number of windows not more than three nor those very large ones nor had any particular solicitude been employed about the removal of little obstructions to the entrance of the light nor about the choice of the day appointed for the visitation of the illustrious guest at the abode of the humble host nor had phœbus vouchsafed at that moment to illuminate the receptacle by his rays of this condemnatory visit such as it was i remember the transmitting information by a note in writing to my friend mr wilberforce in those days one of the most distinguished zealous and influential patrons of the measure an answer of his is still in my possession somewhere in terms altogether remarkable if not unprecedented on the part of my pious and benevolent friend he gives vent to the indignation which that occurrence had awakened in a bosom so unaccustomed to sensations of this nature bentham was a frequent visiter at the table of mr wilberforce where he met with lord eldon then attorneygeneral lord stowell lord harrowby and many other leading political men bentham remembered and often repeated a strong phrase of wilberforce i will never forsake you but the minister is not with you there had been a misunderstanding between pitt  0  and wilberforce not such as to stop all communication for they availed themselves of lord carringtons friendship for both to preserve through him a certain intercourse bentham thought that pitt was not unfavourable to his scheme for on more than one occasion he said that bentham had been greatly injured and cruelly treated by the procrastination but pitt communicated to nobody not even to dundas the real cause of the delays wilberforce was disposed to blame pitt severely—but without sufficient reason wilberforce thought pitts opinions on religious matters lax and immoral and to that laxity he was habitually disposed to attribute whatever was amiss the government however was so much compromised by its acts and its promises that a parliamentary committee mr holford being chairman was nominated with the consent of the ministers for the purpose as bentham was afterwards compelled to believe of crushing the panopticon plan of management and setting up the patronage plan in lieu of it this was in     —after nineteen years of waiting it was only however on the progress of the inquiry that bentham saw evidence of the concert of a majority to defeat his object for his supposition had been that the committee was nominated for the purpose of giving effect to it of wilberforce bentham said—from the first to last his wishes for the melioration temporal and spiritual as well as comfort of these peccant members of society had been sincere his labours towards the effectuation of those objects correspondent so long as my share in the promised institution for that purpose afforded a ray of hope he had stood by me at what precise time he joined himself to that baalpeor it fell not in my way to know at the time at which these symptoms of tergiversation presented themselves to my observation he cannot but have understood so much of the nature of the obstacle to the maintenance of the public faith that had been pledged to me as to see that it was invincible that which was best being no longer possible that which to him seemed next best was of course that which it was his duty to transfer his endeavours to the accomplishment of by the part he took in the business my condition was not in any degree or way deteriorated the change if any was made in it was for the better of the design he was engaged in the tendency and one object at least was to preserve as far as might be a calm in my mind and prevent any such ebullition as would be apt to produce feelings of an inimical nature towards me in the minds of those on whom the compensation due to me for my sufferings might depend in whatsoever instance any direct violation of the law of veracity had been committed by other persons he had no share in it true it is he had given me reason to believe that the course it was intended to be taken in relation to me and my institution by these same omnipotent persons was not known to him and that it was in a more or less considerable degree unknown to him is what i see nothing to prevent me from being persuaded of the sum which bentham received as compensation for the nonfulfilment of the contracts with him for panopticon was £  000 the amount was paid him in      the panopticon plan had been in discussion for more than a quarter of a century on the  th may      leave was given to the chancellor of the exchequer mr dundas and to the attorney and solicitor general to bring in a bill for the erection of a penitentiary house c on that occasion mr dundas said—when first the plan was mentioned to him mr dundas and when he was told that many of those convicts who were transported to botany bay for life might be usefully employed in  0  manufactures in this country he owned he thought the scheme a visionary one but on more closely examining the mode proposed by a gentleman whose manufactory was not far from that house he found that the plan was not only practicable but also very easy to be carried into effect—viz by means of a machine which enabled every man to be a manufacturer without the assistance of any skill whatever it might be said to be a machine that gave the power of sight without eyes and of feeling without hands merely moving the machine answered all the purposes of completing the manufacture a great number of persons he was persuaded might be employed here where their labour would be very useful to the public and he believed that with very little additional expense the produce of the labour would equal the expense of carrying on the work in remarking upon some observations from another speaker he said—the plan would not only be lucrative to the persons employed but he was extremely well satisfied would defray its own expense instead of the panopticon the unexampled inspectable prison of bentham—the penitentiary of millbank was erected—not to be entered without the order of a secretary of state and while it had none of the advantages of the panopticon it cost more than ten times the amount the panopticon would have cost speaking of panopticon bentham said to me in     —among my undivulged instruments of amusement and good morals for the prisoners in panopticon one was singing in chorus for audience volunteer visiters in the central lodge tune   malbrook coda to the song our worthy governor stanza reciting in verse all the good things he stood engaged to do for them and stating them as done this in so far as done would be just eulogy in so far as left undone merited satire and accusation before all the world tune   another pretty melody and almost as simple—   drink and set your hearts at rest   of a bad bargain make the best words the same except that instead of drink in stanza   work stanza   learn in stanza   sing i have not been willing to interrupt the narrative by the introduction of the correspondence which in fact would of itself fill large volumes but as it appears to me that many of the letters have an interest more than temporary both from their style as compositions and the intrinsic value of their contents i have selected some of them partly in the character of probative documents or pieces justificatives as the french denominate them and partly as illustrative of the history of the times and of the character of bentham jeremy bentham august         earl spencer bentham to earl spencer extracts august         no doubt but that the effect of such an alienation upon the value of the rest of your lordships property in that neighbourhood is an object that has as strong a claim to consideration as the amount of the price obtainable for that particular part nor should i be at all surprised if that effect should at first blush be apprehended to be prejudicial for my own part i have no such apprehensions nor will your lordship i hope when the particulars of the plan as far as this question is concerned have been more fully laid before you the persons of the prisoners will be altogether out of sight not only of any house at present existing but of any house that can ever be built upon any other part of your lordships estate the whole thousand will be enclosed in a single building of   0 feet diameter that building so far from being an eyesore will i hope i may venture to say be an ornament to the neighbourhood not less than the rotunda at ranelagh is to which it will have a considerable degree of resemblance it will be completely enclosed by walls with guardhouses on the outside occupied by guards who by the height of their situation will be enabled to observe not only what is doing within but what is doing without to a considerable  0  distance who of course can be sent to or even called to at a much greater distance than the situation of the ground and other objects may in every instance admit of their commanding with their eye and who of course will have orders to lend their aid at all times and during the night time more especially to put a stop to any misdemeanour that may be attempted within the circle of their cognizance and to apprehend the authors i say during the night time for the plan of management requires the walling to be well lighted all round without as well as within the neighbourhood therefore being watched and guarded and even in some degree lighted at the expense of the establishment will instead of suffering in point of security be greatly benefited on the other side of each of the two roads which bound the premises on the east and on the west the land i observe is occupied by gardeners whose ground as such being unenclosed by walls must at present be in a considerable degree exposed to depredations these grounds would receive an immediate benefit by the protection afforded them by the watchhouses though i am not at present in the commission of the peace yet having been bred to the bar and having succeeded about a year and a half ago to the estate of my late father who was in the commission for two counties i may without much presumption suppose it not unlikely that if i thought fit and in such a situation i should think fit to have my name inserted for surrey it would not be rejected and in that case and in that situation i may leave it to your lordship to judge whether the neighbourhood would be likely to find me negligent of their service before i quit the subject of security give me leave to assure your lordship that any further measures which might suggest themselves to your lordship in this view would not find me backward in adopting them nor is it a small expense that would prevent me so much with regard to security—is the establishment likely to present anything disgustful or unpleasant to the neighbourhood—your lordship may soon judge—adopting in their fullest energy the ideas of howard with regard to the importance of publicity it is part of my plan as your lordship may have observed and indeed the main pillar of it to give the establishment such a face as may attract to it persons of all classes but particularly of the superior ranks of life whose inspection as such would afford the most powerful check to mismanagement on sunday in particular it would be my endeavour to render it by means of the chapel which is enclosed in the centre of the building a sort of place of public entertainment suitable to the day like that afforded by the magdalen and the asylum your lordship will judge how far it would be possible to carry on any such plan if the establishment or anything belonging to it were ever suffered to be in the smallest particular an object of disgust it is in that view as well as in the view of making the residence to which i have doomed myself the more comfortable that i should make a point of giving to the place considered at large what embellishment it may be susceptible of nor does it appear to me that it would be a departure from the true spirit of the institution if while with reference to the class of persons for whose correction it is designed it is seen to have the properties of a prison and an establishment for forced labour—to the neighbourhood and to the passengers it should wear the aspect of a ferme ornée allow me here to represent to your lordship how much reason the neighbourhood will have to rejoice at the change of plan which in the room of three men of rank subject to no control but what has reference to the prosperity of the establishment itself and they not resident substitutes a single individual like myself by an article which i took care to insert i am subjected as your lordship may have observed to be removed or censured by the court of kings bench in a most summary way at a minutes warning and by the terms of that article should i ever recede from any of my engagements whether as to those points in which the neighbourhood as  0  such would be interested or any other there is not that individual so obscure who might not make his appearance in court in person and without any expense and face to face call me to account for the failure but along with the good company it may be supposed may come bad and will come were it only to visit their friends in durance—no such thing my lord see them they may indeed but not hold the smallest converse with them unless i please such is the construction of the building no man who does not come decently clad will be admitted every man will be liable to be searched were it only that he may not conceal any instruments of hostility or escape every man will be liable to be questioned as well as searched if i or mine see cause nor can any man get in at all without presenting himself to his examiners to the officers of the police the establishment will be open of course and thither they will come at times not foreknown if there be any prospect of prey while to a malefactor who is once within my gates escape will be impossible under these circumstances will a man whose conscience accuses him of a crime come and plunge into the net—impossible he has everything to fear he has nothing to gain by it—in newgate and other prisons upon the common footing containing criminals as yet untried men of similar characters cannot be excluded because before trial no man may be precluded from concerting his defence with whomsoever may present themselves in the character of his friends neither can they be subjected to examination in the way of questioning because such examination would be inconsistent with the freedom of admission which is deemed essential to that purpose no my lord—the last place in which a felon at large will think of trusting himself of his own accord will be my penitentiary house allow me here to mention a circumstance which in this point of view may perhaps appear to your lordship tolerably conclusive if setting aside the contriver of the plan one man more than another should be supposed to have a just view of its probable effects in this as well as other particulars it should be mr nepean who has had so much occasion to consider it tother day in conversation—i want a little bit of ground says he in the country within reach of london to build a house upon—do you happen to know of any such thing—yes says i i do there is a board up advertising ground to be let on a building lease close to the premises just on the other side of one of the roads that bounds them—oh—is there says he then i will go and look at it its just the spot for me its vicinity to the panopticon would be a recommendation to me no wonder indeed if people enough should be found who hearing that felons were to come among them as report might say hearing that it is no great distance and knowing nothing as yet of those circumstances of the plan which would render that vicinity an advantage instead of a prejudice no wonder they should be more or less alarmed at it nor considering the differences of mens tempers and casts of character is it possible to say that there should be nobody who even after hearing everything that could be urged to dispel such apprehensions might remain dissatisfied but in estimating the effects of the measure upon the value of your lordships estate the true question is as your lordships discernment will i make no doubt acknowledge not what may be the notions of a few individuals for a moment and before the true nature and effects of it can have been known but what will be the sentiments and feelings of the public in general after those effects have been indicated by experience in proportion therefore as i may have succeeded in dispelling any apprehensions that may have presented themselves to your lordship at a first glance previous to a knowledge of the circumstances in that proportion i shall have succeeded in rendering your lordship indifferent to what may be the apprehensions of the neighbourhood or anybody else under the same disadvantage will any such apprehensions supposing them formed have any duration—no my lord—so far from   0 flying from the spot builders will flock to it were it only for the benefit of the protection afforded by the guard but let me admit for arguments sake and it is only for arguments sake that the neighbourhood and even in particular the value of your lordships estate would ultimately be rather prejudiced than served by the establishment—will your lordships candour allow me to inquire whether under the particular circumstances of the case that would be a just motive for opposition or present to a person in your lordships situation a prospect of opposing with success the materials for judging have in some particulars not presented themselves yet to your lordships view allow me to perform that office publicity as i have already observed is of the very essence of the institution it is with a special care to that advantage that the spot in question was made choice of and by whom made choice of not by the supervisors only but by the most respectable and competent body that could be devised a body composed of the twelve judges with the addition of the lord chancellor the speaker and the first magistrate of the metropolis of these fifteen fourteen as mr bowdler one of the appointed supervisors informed me or at least thirteen actually signed the instrument of approbation and if it went without the signature of the other or the two others it was—not because he or they disapproved of it but because after so great a majority the person or persons in question not being on the spot it was thought not worth while to delay the measure for the sake of adding their signature to the rest another circumstance may in this view be very material for your lordships consideration before this place occurred another not to mention two that are not to the present purpose had been made choice of viz a spot much nearer wandsworth and so near that its vicinity and the disgust that the inhabitants conceived on that account your lordship will remember the plan then in contemplation was one which presented none of the antidotes above stated was made a ground of objection this ground of objection was accepted as conclusive by the very tribunal i am speaking of such was its becoming tenderness for the feelings of individuals and by that very same high and considerate tribunal was the choice of the very spot now in question confirmed without a dissenting voice as being free from the objection which had put a negative upon the other the rejection itself appears by the report which i enclose the reason of it as above stated a matter which must be known in the neighbourhood i mean in wandsworth i had from the supervisors and the difference is indeed apparent on the face of the present spot for my lord what are the buildings that except in the way of distant prospect as london may be are in sight of it two or three cottages of no value and a public house that would make a fortune by the choice did your lordships agents i should have said those of the late earl make any objection then i never heard they did but if they did they were overruled the choice your lordship will have the goodness to observe is not now to be made it is a res acta in succeeding to the estate your lordship found it with this obligation lying upon it the only questions there can be i rely upon your lordships goodness for forgiveness if zeal has betrayed me into error the only questions at least i can see are that which regards the time and that which regards the price and even this latter was no question until out of respect for justice it was made so by me your lordship then will have the goodness to consider how the case stands with regard to the place in question the penitentiary establishment is determined on by parliament the spot for the reception of it it is determined shall be a spot in which vicinity to the metropolis and to the river should be accompanied with that degree of elevation which is deemed essential to the health of so numerous an assemblage of persons so subjected to confinement this decision is given with respect to the     sort of place by a subsequent committee of the house of commons with respect to the individual place by that same committee see the report of      in confirmation to that given by the twelve judges added to the lord chancellor the speaker and the first magistrate of the metropolis the measure had already been sanctioned and the price of the place assessed under the act of parliament by the verdict of a jury an improvement is afterwards devised in this system—an improvement deemed such in spite of predilection and every personal motive—by the very persons for such is their generosity and public spirit whom it throws out of office it is deemed such and as such adopted and patronized by an administration with whom the author had not the honour of the most distant previous connexion or any prospect of connexion whatsoever this improvement cannot any more than the original plan do without a spot to rest upon the building to be erected in conformity to this improvement must then be set down in some neighbourhood possessed of the abovementioned advantages what then is to be done shall the establishment be turned off on account of this improvement from a more eligible to a less eligible neighbourhood or for want of a neighbourhood that might like to receive it is it to be supposed that an establishment of such public importance will be set aside altogether a prison cannot exist but it must exist in some neighbourhood it cannot exist in a town but it must exist in a crowded neighbourhood—a neighbourhood beyond comparison more exposed to the objection supposed than the place in question can be—is there then no such thing as a prison to be built anywhere how was it with regard to the immense house of correction at clerkenwell is there anything like a reason for apprehending that such a prison as the one proposed can be more incommodious to the distant inhabitants of battersea and its neighbourhood than the actually existing one must be to the inhabitants of the contiguous house of correction in the crowded neighbourhood of clerkenwell no man give me leave to say my lord can be more sensible than i am to the abuses to which the maxim that private interest should give way to public is liable and is but too frequently made subservient—as if the public were made up of anything but individuals no man who would be more resolutely bent against making himself an instrument of such abuse in any case and above all things in a case where an interest of his own was so visibly concerned it is a subject i have made a study of and considered under all its faces but in the present instance would it be any real injury to any individual—would there be so much as any real damage is the damage if any such as can be set in comparison with the public benefit does it exist in any assignable shape is it of such a nature as to have any claim to indemnification—indemnification then it will have with regard to your lordships suspicion that a part of the land in question may prove to be upon lease i rather think your lordship will find the fact to be otherwise not that it is at all material as your lordship will see presently in the course of a visit to the spot i happened a short time ago by accident and without my seeking to fall into conversation upon the subject of the penitentiary plan with one of your lordships tenants a gardener of the name of glenie who did not know the relation i bore to it beginning the conversation for he avowed a suspicion of me on that score he mentioned it as a remarkable circumstance that no part of the land either is now upon lease or has been for these two hundred years his own part he spoke of as being forty acres being the upper part on which the building would be placed and he applied the same observation to the remainder in equal quantity which agreed exactly with the quantity detailed in the inquest of the jury with respect to his own part i think he can scarcely have been otherwise than correct in regard to a circumstance in which he was so highly interested and that is     the only part for which i should have occasion before parliament had time to do its office i set out with observing that lease or no lease is immaterial to the present purpose and so your lordship will find it to be why because the actual immediate possession is equally out of your lordships power as landlord to grant whether there be or be not a lease as i well knew that must depend at any rate upon the occupying tenants without their consent to whom i well knew i must have to apply for it after all that of the landlord would in point of law be unavailing since a tenant styled a tenant at will is not so far at will as that he can be removed or his exclusive possession infringed upon without a certain interval of notice and with the consent of the tenant on the other hand a man might have the use he wanted were the landlord ever so averse so far then as immediate possession is concerned it was the respect due to your lordship and to what appeared to me to be the rules of propriety and decorum and not any necessity in point of law that was the motive of my humble application to your lordship to whose decision in that particular the same considerations will command my submission and your lordship will be pleased accordingly to recollect that in the very sentence in which the request was made i added that it was not any formal act that i stood in need of troubling your lordship with for that the purpose would be equally answered by a simple acquiescence to satisfy your lordship of the concurrence spoken of on the part of the gentlemen who had been appointed supervisors i take the liberty of enclosing a letter or two just returned by the archbishop of york together with one i happened to have by me expressive of the spontaneous support of a respectable and learned friend an old connexion of the archbishops and who may not improbably fall within the sphere of your lordships acquaintance i hope the good archbishop will pardon the liberty i may perhaps take of adding his own kind letter to the rest to show your lordship the state of the business in respect of the land in question i also send a report of a committee of the house of commons of the year      the estimates it contains of the expense your lordship will be pleased to observe are for  00 prisoners only and my house is to contain  000 actual expense i believe was scarce ever known not to exceed the estimated especially in public works and neither that of furnishing nor that of stocking is included your lordship will have the goodness to return the report as it is not mine but sir charles bunburys upon second thoughts i fear it must be a copy for the present the printed original being in mr nepeans office from which things are not to be got in a hurry give me leave to add that though this is the last public testimony of the penitentiary systems having been kept in mind and consequently the land that had been appropriated to it yet it never actually has been out of the mind of administration it was not more than a twelvemonth before my plan in its original shape had been sent to mr pitt that the late mr blackburn the architect had an audience of him on that subject as well as of the then lord chancellor as blackburn himself told me jeremy bentham june        henry dundas bentham to henry dundas q s p june        sir— a measure of administration having been deserted by administration was carried by me through the house of commons the fact is not more ridiculous than true mr long brought mr long chance brought me two private friends an opposition of two was thus subdued after a hard struggle in the lords after lying by till the third reading lord spencer obtains an order for the printing of the bill in other words opposes it opposes it after having held such language to yourself sir i presume for one as according to mr long to whose frankness i am beholden for the communication rendered it impossible for him to oppose it when thus opposed since opposed it is to be in the lords how then is it to be     defended—as it was in the commons time at least has not been wanting for getting it through or for exposing it to disasters since i had the honour of an audience the week spoken of sir on that occasion has been already doubled what other helps it was destined to receive remain as yet to be discovered a secretary of the treasury neither knew what had been done nor what was to be done an undersecretary of state asked me indeed sir i do not know one thing i do know that i am no match for lord spencer anywhere especially in his own house and unless some such person as a secretary of state or a first lord of the treasury should happen to know of some means whereby a treasury bill after having passed the commons may be supported against a groundless opposition in the lords there is an end of my hopes as well as of other things better glanced at than expressed i have the honour to be c jeremy bentham william wilberforce bentham to william wilberforce my dear sir— enclosed is the paper which you gave me leave to trouble you with observe the dates it was after receiving a copy of it together with a memorial addressed to the treasury board which he desired to have pro forma that mr dundas upon my meeting him at the outsidedoor of his office at the horse guards said to me these words—mr bentham i have just been saying to mr long what i had before said to mr long and to mr pitt that it is impossible to change the land mr dundas was addressed at that time in consequence of mr pitts having signified his intention of resting his decision as mr long told me on the judgment of mr dundas who he observed had the circumstances more on his mind than he mr p could have afterwards mr long sent for me and notified to me in form that mr pitt had fixed upon the land in question as the proper spot—and an instrument for the purpose was accordingly by mr longs direction drawn by me approved and signed by mr long—settled by the attorneygeneral and engrossed by mr white and when i heard last of it about six weeks ago was lying so mr long told me together with the draught of the contract perused and settled by the attorney and solicitor general and ready for engrossment upon mr pitts table lord spencer has given up his opposition more than once once as i was informed by mr long who called upon me at my house to congratulate me on it and afterwards in conversation repeated to me that after what lord spencer had said to him—as i understood—he certainly could not go back with honour—honour was the word another time after having been at my house and seen what was to be seen as was notified on his part by lord hugh seymour to my brother who came to me full of it at the time but i doubt has since forgotten it lord spencer has since offered to me through my brother to give up his opposition if i would accept of a marsh admirably convenient for me in a pecuniary view but as certainly pregnant with the destruction by hundreds in a year of those whom i would wish to reform and not to poison i speak not from surmises but records i wished to rid myself once for all of the temptation to commit safe murder for great gain and accordingly after a hard struggle prevailed to have retained in the contract the clause binding me in consideration of what was deemed an adequate premium to pay £ 00 for every death lord spencer on the report of his steward who i believe has been the private mover of all these vexations estimates at between £ 000 and £ 000 ayear the detriment that may accrue to his son to whom he pointed on the occasion by an adhesion to the old choice quoting two instances in which persons who had been treating for taking land of him on i know not what advantageous terms had broke off on hearing of the penitentiary house hopeless of justice i would most gladly bind myself to take the land upon those terms whatever they were and in short indemnify this poor family from the apprehended injury according to their own estimate of the extent of it     it was in september last that the draught of the contract after having been settled in terminis with mr pitt through the medium of mr long went to mr white with a letter signed by mr long ordering it to be prepared for their lordships signature since which i have been obliged to pay inter alia in addition to £ 000 or £ 000 out of pocket before £   0 for castiron materials for the building not to reckon some hundreds more which by this time i am bound for i am now lending my mind to the irksome task of drawing up my case with the vouchers for publication that when those who take an interest in my fate become witnesses of my ruin they may see it has not had imprudence for its cause unless it be imprudence to have attributed common honesty to mr pitt in this crisis you are my sheetanchor—more orientali p s what can i say more i could read you a memorial to the treasury with mr dundass answer refusing to forward it as being injurious to lord spencer attributing to him what he has since avowed—n b it attributed nothing it was merely hypothetical—that people would say how it would look if c it was about the month of september abovementioned that lord spencer according to his own account of the matter to my brother signified his last and still subsisting opposition to mr pitt who all the while either not meaning to sign the draught he had ordered to be prepared or at least doubting whether he should sign it or no has been suffering me without vouchsafing the least hint of any such doubts to amuse myself with putting it through all its stages and laying out my money upon the faith of it i have introduced the following paper because it exhibits benthams manner of looking at every subject in all its bearings and secondly because it affords an answer to an accusation frequently brought against bentham that he selected the unhealthy site of the penitentiary millbank for his panopticon but the correspondence shows that the site was no choice of his—   th august

demeanour of the bishop i really thought it possible that he might have been susceptible of some feeling for the public good when not preoccupied by private interest we will try what can be made of rose or of the bishop through the influence of government but i own i fear that you would be hardly able to carry a bill through both houses in the face of the dean and chapters opposition i say you i ought not to have it to say but i doubt if it will be practicable to prevail on the ministry to bring forward the proposition themselves as     they ought and to support it with all their force however we will talk of this when we meet i may probably pass through town on thursday at three oclock which i throw out that you may know where i am likely to be if you wish to see me i would cheerfully come up on wednesday if i thought it of moment to be present at your interview with rose but i dont think that of the least consequence i will however give him a line to quicken i must say few things have more impressed my mind with a sense of various bad passions and mischievous weaknesses which infest the human mind than several circumstances which have happened in relation to your undertaking a little ever so little religion would have prevented it all i long ago have put the public in the possession of the practical benefits of yourplan this is one amongst the many instances i have had occasion to observe how much a little of this only solid principle tends to the wellbeing of communities i need not repeat that it will ever give me pleasure to coöperate with you or desire you always to call on me for aid without ceremony i heartily and strongly wish i could lend you more effectual assistance—in great haste yours sincerely w w samuel romilly   th april      jeremy bentham romilly to bentham   th april      i have spoken to the solicitorgeneral and at his recommendation to the attorneygeneral respecting your bill and though the attorney has not neglected it—he has done what will probably be as injurious to you he has so fully considered it that he has a thousand difficulties which it will take a long time to get over he says it is the most unlike an act of parliament he ever saw i told him that lowndes drew it was i right or have i confounded it with a former bill i begin to suspect that i have for though lownders compositions have many defects—that of being unlike acts of parliament is not one of them—yours ever s r again— samuel romilly  d may      jeremy bentham  d may      dear bentham— i have done my best for you but i am afraid you will think i have done but little i had a consultation this morning with the attorney and solicitor general as soon as the business of it was over i introduced your bill and found that it had not been looked at since i saw them last however they promised to settle it before they parted and i left them with the bill before them and pens in their hands i pressed them to let me have the draught or to permit you to see it before it was returned to the treasury but was not able to surmount their objections to such a proceeding i told them i understood from you that they had promised or at least given you to understand that they would communicate their objections if they had any to you but they had no recollection of it and i found i could make nothing of them i told them on going away that i should inform you that white would have the bill today—yours ever s r jeremy bentham   d february      george rose bentham to george rose   d february      sir— i understand from the solicitorgeneral that my bill the tothill fields penitentiary bill is unexceptionable—that consent of parties may be dispensed with—but that the bill is an enclosure bill and as such cannot be brought into parliament till next session for want of certain notices here then commences a certain suspension of the business for another twelvemonth making from the time of my being ordered to take my arrangements fourandahalf years and at the end of it a prospect already thus darkened by experience meantime while others are proving their loyalty by their affluence i who have nothing left but loyalty am reduced to shut up my house the residence of the family for threeandthirty years fortunate in finding a brothers to take refuge in between £ 0000 and £  000 was i think the     amount of advances as stated it is years since in the last of my memorials on the subject to the treasury since then it has been increased to an amount which it frightens me to look into by interest and fresh expenses—for every fresh effort brings its expense i cannot think that the utter ruin of the individual whose pecuniary advances are not the greatest even of his pecuniary sacrifices would be regarded by mr pitt as a fit termination for this business under these circumstances i will venture to submit an expedient the adoption of which would at least not be detrimental to the public and might afford me some relief without expense to government or cause of complaint to anybody had my plan taken place at the time originally intended the existing plan so far as the hulks are concerned would have ceased several years ago the adoption of the new plan has never been a secret to the conductors of the old one whatever may have been the benefits of it they have therefore already been in possession of those benefits longer—much longer than they could naturally have expected there seems no reason why they should reap a profit from this fresh misfortune i mean this fresh delay coming on the back of so many other misfortunes the death of a duncan campbell esq and the sale of his effects appeared some months ago in the papers i suppose mr campbell the superintendent—but under the circumstances just stated whether he be or be not in existence will not be thought i presume to make much difference the existing contract ceases at any time on three months notice several years ago mr campbell declared to sir charles bunbury that the retaining his situation was no longer a personal object to him—his delegates remained the sole object of his care in this there was nothing but what was natural enough after receiving for so many years £   ahead the profit to be made upon less than £   with additional charges and provisions so much dearer would comparatively be of small importance were the convicts to be intrusted to my care upon the existing plan it would besides the present relief afford me the opportunity of initiating myself into the business and the transition from the hulk plan to the penitentiaryhouse plan would be smoother and attended with less hazard than if at one and the same time persons as well as places were comprehended in the change mr campbell himself never resided in the hulks the persons who supply his place on board would of course be the persons to supply mine the system is too effectually vicious to admit of much improvement yet here and there something might perhaps be done were it only in the way of preparation for a better giving the notices necessary for the bill at the same time with the notice for the termination of the contract would publish the sincerity of the government which however real must be confessed to stand in some need of publication and show that something more is intended on both sides than the bartering a system for a job as to the change of hands i have never heard that any very uncommon qualities have hitherto been looked for as requisite for the situation in my own instance the foundation of everything has been done on the supposition of my being capable of giving birth to a new and better plan i hope i am still capable of preventing the old bad plan from getting worse i have the honour to be with all respect sir your most obedient humble servant george rose   th february      jeremy bentham george rose to bentham   th february      dear sir— i observe by some orders from the committee on finance that among other subjects they are about to enter on the consideration of the expense of the convicts which i am extremely glad of for various reasons i think you may with perfect propriety lay before them the whole of your plan they may perhaps think themselves confined to the expense only of the system but the difficulty might be got over by a special instruction in any event it is competent to them to consider     of your proposal for taking care of the convicts in the hulks i have always wished well to the measure proposed by you of solitary confinement and am sorry so many difficulties have occurred about it the one you last mentioned i could not foresee if the committee can be prevailed with to take up the business the public would be satisfied that it should either proceed or at once be given up as they should report—because i am sure their opinion would have very great weight as it ought to have i am quite ignorant of the expense you state yourself to have been at—i am dear sir your faithful humble servant

communication in any shape on the subject of rise of prices audience refused memorial ordered with refusal to hear or to say upon what points was not this an audience say you—yes an audience in a passage mr longs long legs straining themselves to escape this is what mr long gave you by way of answer to a question about causes of delay—your question embracing i suppose but you alone know the delay from july      to july   00 i told you it was a hasty answer given under the pressure of your question for want of a more satisfactory one was my construction uncandid—find me one that is less so and i will adopt it j b ps—why mention this only that you may not turn aside from me like the— who was it—and the levite under the notion of my having cut my own throat by starting rise of prices you think i ought not to do it so cheap moreton pitt is sure i cannot and shall be ruined mr rose pro contra the last time i had the honour of seeing him viz about this time twelvemonth ipsissima verba—  so mr bentham i find you have taken very good care of yourself—special care indeed i thought you had dealt more liberally with the public so far mr rose think you i flew at him as i did at you i know better things supposition whimsical enough but not unprecedented panopticon lost by four votes two because the terms not high enough the project therefore either knavish or foolish and impracticable—two because the terms so high the project rapacious and extortionate the article binding me to pay forfeit for every person recommitted after discharge has lost me many a vote it had hurt me even with abbot it had hurt me with nepean—not to mention persons too high to be named i satisfied him in three words that the loss could not befall me but in company with a much greater gain better the man is hanged and then his superannuated annuity is saved to me or he comes back to me again and then i squeeze it out of him with interest nepean was satisfied but the diningroom gentlemen are above the reach of satisfaction jeremy bentham   th july   0  lord st helens bentham to lord st helens q s p   th july   0  my dear lord— the mansion of st helens i learn this moment has been

howsoever poetry may be more harmonious prose by its sincerity sounded most in unison with my feelings murmurations about situations may now i hope subside in the scale of substantial value the possible angel does not under the existing circumstances appear by any means a match for the actuallyexisting mouse a mission to a christian country where glory cries come reap me is surely preferable to the best mission in partibus—not to say in imbibus nepean i hear has a long letter in which his majestys representative at the court of russia complains of ill health whoever has been in russia knows how ambiguous a sort of a thing ill health is in russian language boljesn may i think be not unaptly rendered indisposed i hope in the present instance it is nothing worse than a sort of a swiss maladie du pays for which in gods and his majestys own good time locomotion would be a cure exactly at this time i learn from the semiofficial fountain of french truth that lord st helens so well calculated by his personal character to succeed in all diplomatic missions intrusted to him is far from finding at petersburg those dispositions with which the english administration flattered themselves far from finding them why then he has made them better and better still quoth he accordingly in the estimation of the timess hamburg correspondent this is his lordships chefdœuvre of diplomacy in our small way here at q s p we are jogging on tolerably well in naval work matters things are done persons appointed pretty much according to our advice in matters of menum and tuum they cheat us sadly and by whose counsel of all the birds in the air but of that archachitophel n— being remediless in the premises we make french shrugs while a tolerably successful and not dishonest though obscure ambition affords a sort of salve for the wound in the purse dont say anything to the traytor in panopticon matters he is a daniel according to vansittarts report the dart and arrow attracted much notice in the baltic your lordship may have heard more they are among the vessels which certain dockyard officers by inspiration from above discovered—not by intuition but without intuition and without so much as inquiry about construction discovered and reported officially reported to be unfit for his majestys service at sea but now lazarus is comforted and they are tormented i am in a sort of relation with vansittart about annuity notes and generous creature as i am to acknowledge it this babe and suckling—this abortion rather of diplomacy pointed out the same amendment that was made by a patriarch in the trade i am to publish and they furnish me with documents being a goodnatured man he complies with some whims of mine and we seem not unlikely to be on pleasant terms panopticon is still in darkness he has sent me an appointment for tuesday the   st but which is to be the order of the day i know not the treasury in their distress in two of their further proceedings papers have referred the proposed defalcation to an alleged enhancement of terms on my part the glaring falsehood and mala fides of this charge the act of the exadministration gives me what appears to me and what i think i have found already in experience a considerable advantage certain omitted documents would fix the expeople not only with error but with mala fides i rave and clamour upon the plea of injured character for the publication of these documents hoping they will find it less trouble to do me justice upon the principal point than to make a bad defence upon the interlocutory question in endeavouring to whitewash their predecessors my screams have already so far prevailed that cockatoo in an accidental chance medley conversation assumed—not compensation in lieu of everything but the reduced number with compensation—full and ample compensation for the number defalcated pretending with long to read as much   0 in the treasury minutes c which contain no such thing upon the whole i am not quite so near hanging myself as when you saw me the public zeal and uprightness of that office i am got back to the admiralty now as far as your brother lord of a saint achitophel daniel and another person a very little one are concerned would afford some really pleasing sketches what lord spencer and lord st vincent join in looking upon as our due and what we are dying for want of in a parenthesis that fellow will not suffer us to have he would sooner give it us out of his own pocket he has lent it us rather than that the king should give it us—and so we lose it we would give lordship now and then a few gleanings in this way if lordship did not disdain such trash and would favour us with a few pickings from the tabletalk of petersburg no these are meat for our master—his majestys representative has no such pearls to throw away to any such swine ps—i am not a woman i scorn for my part to put the punctum saliens and final cause of a letter into the postscript i say nothing of the fatherless still less of the prisoners jeremy bentham sir charles bunbury bentham to sir charles bunbury dear sir— crimes distinguished by the name of unnatural are endemial not to say universal on board the hulks in both places woolwich as well as portsmouth as the hulks are emptied of the contents these crimes flow out with them and propagate themselves in patriam populumque at woolwich an initiation of this sort stands in the place of garnish and is exacted with equal rigour this fact is put out of doubt by indubitable evidence not only such things are but as the mayor of portsmouth sir john carter in a letter now before me very sensibly observes from the very nature of the receptacle such things ever must be such are the abominations of which lord grosvenor has obtained and lord pelham and mr addington decreed the perpetuation and diffusion the official lord has had notice of them over and over again to the pious lord it does not seem very likely to have been a secret query in a court able and willing to do substantial justice who is most guilty of them he who practises them upon an individual scale or he who protects and establishes them upon a public scale this is a query i propose submitting to the public know you any just cause or impediment that should prevent me or will you take the task off my hands the long letter you favoured me with is still in my minds eye will you make the experiment upon your noble and pious friend give him legal notice of what he knows already and ask him whether he still chooses it shall be so alas no your heart fails you i see you shrinking from it you misconceived me the piety of the noble lord was never with me the matter in dispute the question was and is respecting the connexion between piety and morality—if public morality be morality in his noble breast this in my heretical view of the matter is the end piety useful only as a means leading to that end for except through the medium of morality who is to be the better for a mans piety man i suppose if anybody not the almighty i presume as to your potent friend mr addington on this as on other occasions he waits to be determined as he has hitherto been determined by the greater uneasiness by the greater force of parliamentary and closet pressure to all considerations of good faith and public morality and public decorum on those grounds he has been reported callous such was the expressive word and from a surgeon who probed him to the quick candid honeyminded man how pure his public spirit how passionate his desire to do whatever were for the best what professions what effusions the judgment of sir evan nepean could not stand against the torrent does yours dare encounter it mistake me not nepean was not the surgeon spoken of as for the man of might his perpetual smiles are entailed upon every man whom it is possible he     should ever have to count with he makes himself amends upon a defenceless and deserted man like me good faith public morality constitution—all alike sacred to your potent friends plea for the constitution—a pamphlet of which you will not bear—dare—which shall i say to read so much as the titlepage the attorneygeneral was shocked at it to a man who was not yet callous what can be more shocking than truths at once disgraceful and incontestible the mention made of himself in the preface he was not displeased with the truth of the fact he admitted expressly or tacitly to romilly thank me—yes even me—for the transportationfacilitating act thanks to what they have not yet destroyed of the constitution it is in the power of a worm while writhing under the foot of the oppressor to give motion to the sceptre i have not done with them yet by a great deal the attorneygeneral if he is to be believed would be favourable if he durst sir c bunbury has or at least had a project for forming a posse to storm the minister in the closet wilberforce will he join or head the posse wilberforce and h thornton are they good samaritans or are they priest and levite jeremy bentham  th dec   0  william wilberforce bentham to william wilberforce  th dec   0  as a spot in the carte du pays it may not be amiss that your protectorship should be apprised that in the duke of portlands reign his prime minister mr b took a very active though a very civil and covert part against panopticon he had projects of his own of which he made no secret to me and took more occasions than one to endeavour to make me regard my own as desperate i learned from different persons that being in as bad odour at the treasury as i could be without having the like pretensions on the score of justice his applications experienced if possible less attention than mine he once brought to my house his grace cum totâ sequelâ suâ to see what was to be seen at that time the works had long ago been taken to pieces and locked up panopticon model little better than a ruin so that had i even been in a humour for officiating as showman no tolerable rareeshow could have been made i endured the honour not being able to escape it but without any of those advertisements which i received afterwards i saw enough to see that prepossessions and purposes were far enough from being favourable a point his grace was clear about was that a lantern so large as mine could not be so light as a long parallelogram room upon the london plan with glass in a small part of one of the short sides and as the model of the lantern was enclosed in a room which is none of the lightest experiment was unfortunately on his side on another point the existence of a spot within the building from whence every part of it might be viewed at once i was equally unfortunate a staff which had been set up with a sighthole in it for the marking of that spot was among the fractured limbs of it and the assurances that i gave him that the fabric had been put together by measurements made by an architect for the express purpose of producing that effect and that as many as had looked through the sighthole had been witnesses of the production of it were not fortunate enough to obtain signs of credence i have despatched to the taylors for a handsome suit of clothes for what is acknowledged to be the best part of a bookmaker his book when it comes home i propose sending it in quality of representative of the remaining part on a visit of homage to his graces successor of whom i have better hopes parve nec invideo sine me liber ibis—a book in russia may i hope be accepted as an equivalent for a piece of card jeremy bentham sir william pulteney bentham to sir william pulteney sir— a man that obtains approbation such as yours does not write in vain the little work you speak of was a published one since my being favoured with your letter i have looked out two     still smaller ones one of them but a fragment and which being unpublished can scarcely have met your eye the fragment has for its subject a situation i had once some prospects of which are now sunk by perfidy and oppression together with so many other prospects and about half the property that should have served for their support the other i send for the sake of a principle of political economy which to me has long been a fundamental one but which if received in practice would make a very extensive change in our appetite for untaxable colonies—our projects for encouragement—our apprehensions of discouragement in regard to particular branches of productive industry consequently in our anxieties about treaties of commerce our wars to punish people for not entering into treaties of commerce with us our fears about taxing exports i e taxing foreigners and a thousand other things you have already my unpublished work intituled panopticon i have a letter of yours rewarding me with your approbation of it these small scraps are an experiment upon your patience say you have read them you have paid me for the next i send and i have plenty for you upon the same terms the defence of usury and the anonymous fragment on government i suppose you may have read in your day since others did of my  to introduction to the principles of morals and legislation scarce the existence is known here i have pursued the investigation in detail through almost every branch of legislation but scarce any part is finished much less published as it never happened to me to receive any the smallest reason for expecting that anything from me would in my own lifetime at least be of any use i should have excepted one instance and in that you see the sort of payment i have received once indeed it just occurs to me mr rose in the presence of mr pitt did say to me that he had read my pamphlet about law taxes and that there should be no more law taxes my labours are not so perfectly unknown on the other side of the water as on this a friend of mine whose native language is french and to whom at his desire i turned them over as so much lumber has given them there a sort of currency some tokens of it are in the bibliothèque britannique a journal by professor pictet of geneva lately elected to the tribunate three volumes of ideas long ago forgotten by their author are i understand to make their appearance in paris before the month is out meantime they have put me up at the institute as one of the three candidates for the sort of distinction lately conferred on major rennel and sir joseph banks so much the worse perhaps for me here the word candidate seems to imply solicitation directly or indirectly i had no more hand in the matter than you had all i have ever known about it is from the newspapers i have run on into the usual loquaciousness of complaining egotism it is time i should beg your pardon and subscribe myself sir yours c ps—if you have read the treasury reports you will have supposed my business to have gone off upon a disagreement about terms a studied falsehood no disagreement on my part about anything the real grounds of relinquishment have been a succession of concealed promises which they have never dared either to deny or to avow but which i have evidence of in the   th finance report is a guarded history by me of a course of four years perfidy it has since been doubled      in the course of the eight years provocation i have endured i think you must have given me credit for something in the way of sang froid and prudence at least in never having stooped to go to acheson with my story oh how would his chops water did he but know of the bonne bouche i could treat him with should lord pelham wish to see the substance of the paper in print for example to serve him as an ostensible warrant for doing his duty and to afford him the plea of necessity for     breaking so many illegal and corrupt promises as there will be to break he could be accommodated without difficulty the hostilities in it would cost me much less trouble to put out than it did to put them in they were put in why—because the conduct of this present administration has all along been such to me as never to hold out to me any hopes but from their fears losing the post of yesterday has since given me time for running over collinss continuation of his n s wales history from september      to august   0  the predictions i had hazarded as above are verified to a degree astonishing even to myself the most promising settlements hawkesbury and norfolk island either abandoning or recommended to be abandoned famine at the times of the greatest possible future plenty at all times probable from any one of five sources—  drought   inundation   fire—natural   incendiarism and   savage hostility against which defence is unavailing as to returns to england the idea of preventing them on the part of expirees an imprisonment always illegal is now disclaimed though illegal exceptions continue to be made returns by nonexpirees less and less preventible the profligacy always universal and at its maximum the d of p with mr k with full notice of it spreading lies to the contrary for no better purpose than that of pimping to the whims of lord b about his millbank estate to the prejudice of his real interests as declared by all his professional advisers impeachable matter crowds in in such quantities the only perplexity is about the choice a single drop in this ocean of guilt and that demonstrable by record has been declared assets for impeachment by professional men of the first eminence—no party men and in the coolest blood i have exhausted my own paper and i fear your patience—yours with the truest respect j b talk of bastilles—n s wales the true bastille the other if true a molehill to a mountain on the  0th sir charles bunbury received a letter from lord pelham as follows— lord pelham   th august   0  wimbledon sir charles bunbury wimbledon   th august   0  my dear sir charles— i have received mr benthams papers and i will find out what steps have been taken by the treasury before i send for him as it appears to me that to give him any false hopes would in the present state of his mind produce the very worst effects at all events i will apply my mind to the subject and endeavour to get something settled before the meeting of parliament—with very sincere regard ever yours most faithfully jeremy bentham   st august   0 —sent   d sir charles bunbury bentham to sir charles bunbury q s p   st august   0 —sent   d my dear sir— i have this moment to thank you for your kind letter enclosing that of lord pelham and has this passed upon sir charles bunbury for satisfaction my dear sir you have not been at the fair lately this is the old lay over and over for the hundredth time this is sanchoniathon and the cosmogony again and again with ephraim jenkins pitt rose long king portland addington robertson lathrop murray at the bottom of it to be serious in your situation stranger as you happily are to the incidents with which my memory is stocked in such minute detail and such unhappy abundance his letter appears to have produced as it was but natural it should produce the effect it was intended to produce—viz that of appearing to imply approbation but what approbation that very approbation which was somewhat more than implied almost a twelvemonth ago but without producing the smallest particle of that satisfaction the hope of which such is your good opinion of your friend continues notwithstanding to be produced by it for my own part i wish it were possible to me to see anything better in it than a qualis ab incepto—a     perseverance in the same system of complicity and evasion that he and his colleagues adopted at their entrance into the ministry with the materials for decision passing through their hands and staring them in the face till the meeting of parliament he has obtained a respite from you so he thinks at least by his talk about endeavours when parliament meets he shirks you as before as long as he can and when you have caught him at last and forced him to speak out then it is that you will learn that he is sorry for it but his endeavours have been fruitless the amusement it affords me to see what turn evasion takes in such a mind in such a situation and in such circumstances is the only satisfaction i have derived from his epistle the two characters in which he affects to view me are—that of a patient labouring under a sort of mental derangement though the hope is but a temporary one and that of a suitor—an unfledged suitor—prone to embrace phantoms for realities and panting for the felicity of falling at his feet as to the present state of my mind you may venture to assure his lordship that it is precisely the same as it was above a twelvemonth ago as he has seen in my papers if he has been pleased to look at them—in my papers of that date—as it has been ever since and as it will continue to be so long as the like impressions continue to be made upon it by the action of the like causes he may see the same mind in the same state in my printed evidence as laid in june      before the committee of finance and if such things were worth preserving you yourself my good sir could furnish him with some copies of it written four years earlier at a time when perfidy and corruption were in the bud and when lord spencer after seating himself for the first time at the same table with mr pitt stood up and said i am now above the law—mr pitt answering and saying so you are for his lordships determination not to give me any of those false hopes which in a state of mind less compassionable another man in my place might have been treated with and which i have been saved from being plied with in consideration of the tremendous effects these indescribable worst effects of which an application of that sort might in my place have been productive he is certainly not to be blamed not indeed in respect of any such bad effects or any effects that any machinery in use for the raising of such phantoms could have produced for all the powers of mechanism could not add anything to the exhibitions of that sort that have been so familiar to me for these eight years but because no attempt in that way can be of any use to him and his associates whereas the abstaining from it leaves a load the less on their character and their conscience throughout the whole of the business from the time when the finger of corrupt and clandestine opposition was held up by the first in the train of successive lords the general rule has been to give nothing but hopes and those hopes false ones witness one sample instead of a thousand—orders—official orders—  th march   00 to make preparations for  000 convicts—these orders in a letter concerted between the two floors of the treasury for the express and afterwards even avowed purpose of making a pretence for giving none all this you say is old and stale the new incident then is that for once—pro hâc vice—this rule is now it seems to be departed from departed from not dejure but ex gratiâ in consideration of the particular circumstances of this very particular case understand always provided his lordship continues to the end in the sentiments now professed an expectation in which this very letter forbids me to indulge myself i will tell you my good sir what their plan is and what my chance is under it—judge whether it can content me in the first place they fall at the feet of the sack of oats that gained which is impossible then with that in their hand they fall at the feet such feet as adders have of the deaf adder—i mean the pious lord who is so     well known to take that hero of scripture history for his model but lest they should fail in either—and they will fail in both—thence come the expeditions of discovery—the expeditions for finding out what steps have been taken at the treasury and the fears about the giving of false hopes shut against everything that could be said about his land and about the effect of the penitentiary establishment upon the value of it by his landsurveyor and his landsteward you will judge whether the ears of that personage are likely to open themselves with more facility upon those topics to the representations of a first lord of his majestys treasury or his majestys secretary of state so long ago as the  0th of september   0  mr vansittart as declared by him in a letter copy of which had been already for a month or two in the hands of lord pelham at his lordships desire as signified to you—mr vansittart acting secretary to the treasury was labouring in the fruitless endeavour of finding an opportunity of consulting with lord pelham now on the   th of august   0  lord pelham on his part is setting out on this his expedition of discovery bent upon finding out maugre all concealments what steps have been taken by the treasury—i e by mr vansittart—the packet put by you as above into his lordships hands certifying that no steps at all had been taken by the treasury other than those exhibited by it and the motionless state of the business being the declared cause why he was then troubled with it all this while within a stones throw of both these ministers whose efforts to find one another out at the distance of the two contiguous floors of the same house had for a twelvemonth been so unavailing—in sight of them both sat mr now sir evan nepean from whom both personages and above both mr addington were determined with equal resolution never to find out what steps to his sir evans knowledge had been taken by the treasury the former treasury in the business—determined by this most coercive of all reasons that he was the only man in office from whom they could be apprehensive of receiving any true account of it in a copy i sent of this letter of mr vansittarts among other papers in december last to mr wilberforce i find a comment which accompanied it in pencil in these words—when mr wilberforce spoke on the subject to lord pelham neither mr vansittart nor either of the mr addingtons had had any such opportunity they knew better things they did not intend to have it they durst not have it to any purpose to return to his lordships letter the point i looked to in it was—whether amidst so much guilt—by the former people amidst accusations upon accusations never yet denied—frequently though always in the view of adding to it even confessed—any symptoms were to be found of those regrets which in his situation a man who meant honestly and really intended to turn over a new leaf would in my view of the matter not dissemble finding no such indications my exertions i mean in the line spoken of in my former letters far from being relaxed will be quickened by the intended opiate one thing i understand pretty distinctly dates are to me a sufficient proof of it it is after taking a week to hear† and hearing accordingly and from the treasury not only what steps have been taken but what steps under providence will be taken that he is setting out upon his expedition to that unknown and distant clime for the discovery of the facts that have been in his pocket for these six weeks in this circumstance my little mind even in the present state of it reads the present state of two great ones i see terror enough in both places not yet enough     indeed to open either of them like the little one to fearless honesty but however to drive gentlemen upon this fresh and speaking attempt at evasion instead of their former silence i see enough to put them upon employing the time they think they have thus gained upon employing it and even in good earnest in holding councils of war about the job with those from whom they received it and in those councils considering which of the two repugnant engagements it were best to break definitively the original legal engagement or the last in the succession of illegal ones and in the former event being the most probable one by what kind of botchery the breach may be best cobbled it is to this that his lordships mind is at all events to apply itself for if it had any more straightforward any less crooked object—what should have hindered its applying itself to it near a twelvemonth ago upon the spur of those impressions which even then it found its convenience in pretending to have received what has it been applying itself to all this while—what is it now applying itself to what was it put for where it is what did it take the sceptre for from king log was it to give him a king stump for successor in november last at the latest how much earlier i know not lord pelham thought new south wales a bad thing he thought the penitentiary plan a good thing at that same time he knew for all his industry could not prevent him from knowing that it was his duty to see to the carrying of that good thing into effect without a moments further delay and that every day lost to it was not only a day of fraud corruption and injustice but a day of contempt and disobedience to parliament and now it is that at the end of nine months from that time after promise upon promise and neglect upon neglect and after receiving papers upon papers the object of which was to render it no longer practicable for him not to know what he could not but know already—now when the post of neglect and ignorance is no longer tenable—now it is at last that he is to apply his mind to the subject under the declared apprehension that any hopes that might be entertained of seeing his majestys secretary of state and the first lord of his majestys treasury do their duty might prove false ones one thing i should be glad to know as to the present state of that same noble mind is it out of doubt with him or is it not yet out of doubt that there is no such virtue in new south wales as to quash an imperative law of parliament and to rescind the engagements taken in regard to panopticon in consequence in the former case why does be not come forward with his declared support immediately in the other case why did he not call upon me for the proffered papers the object of which was to put an end to all such doubts i mean always to all pretences of such doubts my calculation was—that for appearance sake at least his lordship might wish to have it supposed that it was by considerations relative to the merits that his suffrage if favourable to panopticon had been gained that accordingly he would either read or make as if he had read those papers but in this you see already one article in my apprehended budget of false hopes if instead of wavering between corruption and incorruption and to hide his indecision pretending to be going upon sham errands while he was sounding the ground and looking out for loopholes—if instead of this he had decided manfully and taken at once the post of duty a letter still shorter than even this short one might have sufficed there lies the engagement of his predecessor for the  000 prisoners there lies the memorial i mean the suppressed one you put into his hands expressive of the terms grounded on that engagement those very terms to which the approbation of mr long had been whispered over and over again to mr nepean under the determination of not granting     either those terms or any other to send this memorial to the treasury with a letter urging compliance with the prayer of it was and is the one thing needful on his lordships part i mean officially and in black and white verbal explanations might have been sufficient for the rest this was exactly the course taken in      by mr dundas to wash his hands of the corruption he saw even then going on between mr pitt and the first of the titled subscribers to his statue think not however that i mean this as a judgment altogether peremptory upon his lordships honesty but you see that if the badness of these very worst effects depends upon the sanguineness of my hopes nothing very serious is to be apprehended i shall be upon the lookout for you at the time you have the goodness to mention by that time sincerity will have been manifested or disproved more could not be done by man than you have done you see i have scarce left myself room to thank you for it or to stamp upon my gratitude the mark of jeremy  bentham jeremy bentham   th august   0  samuel romilly bentham to romilly q s p   th august   0  my dear romilly— the enemy begins to squeak judge from the following letter to understand it rightly you must understand that the papers there spoken of are papers breathing fire and flame full of scorn and menace no small part of the spirit which animated them was extracted from a former opinion of yours defœcated from the caput mortuum of croaking and despondency that diluted it should their cowardice prove true to me heaven knows whether it will or no it will raise the british constitution in your estimation a few pegs have at em again—i follow up my blow not a moments respite your fresh opinion completes their petrification it is the head of medusa staring upon them from minervas breast do not hurry yourself no immediate demand for the litera scripta the esprit of it like the wind of a cannon ball lays them prostrate for the present sir charles bunbury august    chester jeremy bentham sir charles bunbury to bentham chester august    dear sir— perhaps i have too little suspicion and you from the treatment you have met with too much but what i know and what i have heard of lord pelham is much in his favour and i cannot therefore without proof conceive him guilty of practising evasions and artifices which would disgrace not only a ministers secretary but even his porter lord pelham may be and i believe is inclined to support the panopticon system but he may not have the power to control the adverse opinions of his colleagues in office and mr addington perchance may have imbibed the prejudices of mr pitt to whom i have always attributed the delays and vexations you have suffered jeremy bentham august      0  m dumont bentham to dumont august      0  now for a bit of an intrigue worthy of the talents of the omnium intrigantium intrigantissimus the genevoanglogallico the reverend squire citizen montaineer oh but my dear dumont i had forgot myself i have need of you it is therefore both a bounden and an incumbent duty of mine to be very civil to you therefore never you mind the abuse in the first paragraph—regard it as nonavenu the letter in the other column will inform you of the present state of my expectations in regard to panopticon taking with it this explanation that the papers therein spoken of are letters and other papers of mine which though addressed partly to sir c bunbury were written for the edification of his majestys secretary of state and his colleague and are as full of fire and flame and scorn and menace to pitt and portland c c addington himself not excluded and lord pelham halfincluded as i could cram them     and then a comment from me on this very letter went immediately after to sir charles with whom it lies as a deposit ready to be produced and published inter alia in the character of a prophecy of perfidy should such be the event you are looked for at paris romilly tells me in september i am glad of it for divers reasons this goes by him and stays with him till you meet as everybody is or will be at paris some of the leaders of opposition will therefore be there as for example your friend lord holland and according to the newspapers even the coryphæus of the foxes i have of late made a discovery of a piece of villany on the part of pitt portland and others of the late gang which for the sake not only of justice and humanity both very pretty things children of the utility family but for the sake of this old constitution of ours forgive my weakness i cannot but confess that i have a whoreson kind of tenderness that hangs on me i should like to see punished of their multiplied enormities there are some which are not so completely involved in english grimgribber but that you can understand them perfectly i as to new south wales since the foundation of this penal colony in      convicts have been sent thither under sentences of transportation for various terms—mostly seven years a few for life still fewer for fourteen years this under a variety of acts of parliament—say from twenty to thirty made for the punishment of so many modifications of delinquency almost all coming under the head of depredation nine out of ten perhaps sentenced only for seven years and more or less of those seven years expired before they were shipped off in direct breach of all these acts of parliament they have given orders upon orders to their governor of new south wales in virtue of which orders the convicts upon the expiration of their respective terms have been confined there i e destined to be confined there for life adding thereby to a temporary legal punishment a perpetual illegal one   to the above illegal confinement and banishment they have moreover added various lengths and modifications of equally illegal bondage   the unexampled distance from the principal seat of government added to the particular character of the people to be governed required powers to be vested in a single hand—powers very little short of pure despotism—of itself a pretty sufficient reason why no such colony should have been established understanding this and fearing to apply to parliament for such powers pitt  co have been all along setting their government to legislate in all manner of cases without legal power for legislating in any one powers for some purpose and in respect of some classes of persons he has but upon the whole of the mass of power of all sorts exercised by him about half has been illegal and thereby there is not a creature that has ever been in any sort of office in the colony that is not at this moment liable to be ruined over and over again by actions at law for what he has done some perhaps liable to suffer as for murder   among the destined as above to perpetual confinement are numbers who instead of the seven years had smaller lengths of time remaining unexpired when sent thither some no more than two years my brother by application to lord pelham stopped one or two that were on the point of being sent thither as above for life though perhaps before their arrival thither their respective legal terms—the legal part of their punishment—would be at an end the exact length of time and the number thus circumstanced cannot be distinctly mentioned but would be ascertained in case of a parliamentary inquiry from the official booker   in several instances whole shiploads of convicts have been sent out without sending out with them any accounts exhibiting their respective terms and by this most scandalous and perhaps wilful neglect their bondage as well as their confinement has been rendered     indefinite in duration not to say perpetual their terms expired when they have claimed their liberty or have tried to exercise it by getting away they have been flogged   so much for criminality on the part of the archtyrants here at home now for punishment what they have been doing there for these fourteen or fifteen years is an offence not only against magna charta as per lord coke but against the bill of rights and the habeas corpus act they are liable at the suit of any individual thus confined besides damages £ 00 to the party injured to the punishment called a præmunire a part of which consists of general confiscation together with imprisonment for life and the kings power of pardon is in this instance taken away by the same statute the ground of the above statements as to matter of fact is constituted partly by private intelligence but principally by the printed accounts given of the colony by the late judge advocate of it captain now lieutenantcolonel collins of the marines his first volume published in    0 a second just come out now in   0  he is a professed panegyrist dedicating his first volume to the ostensible founder the late lord sydney his second to the present manager lord hobart the abominations came out through his candour partly perhaps through holes in his discernment the matter of law has been discovered by me together with the facts within these few weeks and the accuracy of the views i have taken of the matter of law has received the most unreserved confirmation from romilly i have ready for the press inter alia a pamphlet with this title the true bastille showing the outrages offered to law justice and humanity by mr pitt and his associates in the foundation and management of the penal colony of new south wales by j bentham of lincolns inn esq barrister at law it is the same except a trifling part having nothing to do with law that romilly has revised for me were i to publish now before parliament is in readiness to do anything the great probability is that the colony would be in a flame for ships are going thither nor from hence only but from america and other countries frequently and as they are ready for revolution most of them at all times without any pretence a fortiori would they be when general independence on the part of all whose terms were expired could be seen to have the sanction of the law if therefore i publish at all it will not be till the meeting of parliament because then and not till then there would be a power in the country capable of preventing the flame from breaking out by sending out legal powers parliament would certainly pass a bill of indemnity so far at least as to save the secretaries of state and perhaps members of the council board with their respective subordinates for so many years from such tremendous punishment god forbid they should not but it is something for an homuncio like myself to put all these potentates into jeopardy and force parliament to act and though opposition would not be able if they wished it to prevent the bill of indemnity from passing yet they might i should think make sure of getting the whole official history of the colony laid before parliament it would be the usual course and thereby expose their enormities at any rate to public shame and possibly even make them glad to compound for some inferior censure another pamphlet of mine ready for the press will have some such title as the following—panopticon versus new south wales showing the complete and incurable repugnancy of the system of penal colonization to the several ends of penal justice as contrasted with the degree of perfection in which the same objects are provided for under the penitentiary system kept in suspense for these eight years by corrupt influence in contempt of an imperative law of parliament and a long train of engagements grounded on it this having nothing to do with law romilly has not   0 seen though i should agree with ministry the substance of it might be published though with a tamer title to warrant their proceeding in consequence a third likewise ready for the press is observations on a late exercise of legislative power by the duke of portland his associates and subordinates in contempt of parliament for the purpose of obstructing panopticon on the   th of october      by a letter which he had the unnecessary folly to sign with his own hand having the two exlawyers his undersecretary king and his mentor baldwin for advisers which letter being ashamed and afraid of they have endeavoured to suppress though to no purpose i having a copy of it he has fallen into the following impeachable heresies his doctrines and his acts serving for the explanation and crimination of one another—   professing a determination of his own authority to prevent the execution of an imperative act of parliament the one made for me    geo iii c    without any reason assigned   professing for the same purpose an intention of crowding the existing jails with such convicts as ought to have been consigned to panopticon in contempt of another act of parliament    geo iii c      assuming by his own authority the power of taxation by throwing the expense of such convicts upon the contributors to the poorrates instead of the general fund assigned by parliament to me this letter seems to constitute an impeachable offence it is in direct repugnance to the bill of rights it appears in the same light to romilly though he takes my account of the letter not having time to examine my argument on the subject of it agreeing so perfectly with my other argument containing a most extensive mass of law the probability is that he would not find in my statement in the present case any very material incorrectness in case of the present ministrys agreeing so far with me as to fulfil those engagements in which i am concerned their pride and their incapacity together would prevent them i make little doubt from endeavouring to make any such bargain as would put it out of my power to lend a hand towards bringing them or their predecessors to shame at least if not to justice looking upon their exposure as a very important benefit to the constitution i would resist any such bargain as strenuously as possible but lest at the worst i should find myself forced to submit to it one object of the present letter is to put it out of my own power to deprive the country altogether of so useful an example if therefore any favourable opportunity should present itself and if you see the matter in the same light as i do or do not decidedly see it in an opposite one you will embrace such opportunity my dear dumont and with your skill in paving pave the way for me for a junction with some of your opposition potentates for this purpose even without me collinss book if they have but industry to sift it would afford them a very good ostensible ground though having paid so much attention to the subject and made so many constitutional discoveries in it which nobody ever made before their indolence would i think find its account in one way or other in taking the benefit of my industry sure enough through the whole period of pitts administration they never in any instance took ground comparable in strength to this and unless they have made a vow to the goddess of folly to prefer matter of vague declamation to the most perfect legal solidity they will jump mast high at the first mention of such an opening romilly though agreeing with me so completely in all the points of law yet has no hope of success from any of them but this despondency arises from a sort of general tone of croaking he has given into and is founded as he himself declares on his contempt for the judgment of opposition and his persuasion of the imperturbable servility of parliament it is not that this particular ground is not strong enough but that in his view of the public mind on all sides of it—no ground whatever not even the strongest would be strong enough you may imagine how clear and     decided romilly is since he has given me his opinion in black and white for the express purpose at my request of my making any even the most public use of it if you find any difficulty about undertaking any of this he could give you explanation of it but he not being such an intriguant as you are i do not wish you to give him any unnecessary trouble about it i have lived too long in this wicked world and set too little value upon everything contained in it to think it worth my while to go cap in hand to them or any of them for this or any other purpose neither on this nor on any other occasion should i think on any consideration to become one of their gang for general purposes neither on this nor on any other parliament or anywhere else in speaking or writing would i maintain a single proposition of the truth of which i were not myself persuaded to save them all myself included from the gallows joining then in this attack upon the enemy i should defend him against the very next if it appeared to me unmerited as to serving me if they offer to put it on that footing bid them go to the devil what i want is to serve the constitution there are some of them so profligate that for the sake of making the better attack upon the ministry they would be glad to set new south wales in a flame and some hundreds of throats cut on both sides and would spread the intelligence prematurely with that view this is a danger for such intriguers as you and me to guard against i should hope charles fox might be trusted for taking the requisite precautions for preventing any such mischief but you know best and that others i would not trust i should think it would chime in particularly well with the rout charles fox has always been making about the according to him unnecessary suspension of the habeas corpus act as likewise the pother that sir f burdett would be disposed to keep up for the purpose of the election question about his bastille had all he said about it been true it would have been but a mousetrap to mine romilly will have it that neither opposition nor the ministry nor the public at large care a straw about convicts—or would manifest any sort of resentment for any injustice that ever has been or could be done to them admitting this and considering them all as so many logs of wood that could be made use of as so many clubs to beat the ministry past and present about the head with—for such a purpose i should think it worth their while to regard these logs as sentient ones and for the good of the cause to speak of them with the most edifying tenderness horne tooke i am clear would sell his soul to ten thousand devils for the satisfaction of contributing to such a means as that of a general massacre in new south wales in my hearing he has defended septembrization and wished in a large and mixed company to see it imitated here if by any puffing of yours—and my dear dumont you have a tolerable good hand at puffing witness prefaces to dumont principes—you can puff any of those potentates into a persuasion that by any means they might be able to get a good attack upon pitt and co with the roses longs and portlands of the age you would do this country i think and the general interests of justice and humanity some service and opportunities might present themselves if not at paris in this country before the meeting of parliament it would be lost labour for me to attempt to direct your eye to this or that or tother man as a likely person all this will be as much in your eye and much more in your knowledge than in mine if lord henry had stuff and spunk enough in him for such business would it not be a good commonplace declamation topic enough to bring him into notice nb it is that sort of thing that might be taken up in either house if by accident you should light on anybody and excite his concupiscence do not let him come to me abruptly to satisfy it but let me hear from you first to prepare me i see a somebody has begun puffing in the moniteur at last who i hope and     suppose is gallois according to your word but the wretch has not put his name why not is he afraid of being sent to the temple for it—your new bastille i wish to god i could steal over the herring pond to you for a week or two but just at present it is not to be thought of sir charles bunbury has offered himself to make mention in parliament as to anything that concerns me personally i may possibly beg of him to make a motion for the publication by the house of some documents suppressed to my prejudice—to wipe away the imputation that was endeavoured to be cast upon me by rose and long as if it had been my fault that panopticon was not set up inasmuch as i had insisted upon an increase of terms the point seems trivial but as it was a most gross lie and the refutation of it would bring to light a most dirty fraud on their part the idea of such a thing struck terror into them before and would distress them beyond measure upon the revival of it what am i writing all this to you for you are a dead man and the proof of it is my never having received a syllable from you in answer to the letter i had the credulity to address to you to geneva poste restante upon the faith of your perfidious assurances adieu my dear dumont be a good boy and write to me jeremy bentham  d september   0  charles abbot bentham to charles abbot friday  d september   0  if on grounds purely public or at any rate completely exclusive of all private regard for me you cannot find sufficient motives for taking upon you the mediation i venture to propose i neither ask nor so much as wish you to think of it on any other you will see presently what it is i look to you for and why i in the course of my researches for the purpose of the narrative i have of late been employed in drawing up containing the history of my transactions with government on the penitentiary business it is but very lately that i have been led to the subject of new south wales and to my unspeakable astonishment as well as that of my eminently learned friend to whom ex majori cautelâ i have applied as counsel i have made the following discoveries—   that by orders from hence expirees convicts whose terms are expired have been forcibly detained there—not individually only and for special cause but collectively and for an indefinite time—and with the evident intent of adding to the expired legal punishment a perpetual illegal one and that by so doing all persons concerned in such illegal orders are liable to the penalties of the habeas corpus act    car ii c   §    including a præmunire ousted of pardon by an express clause   that to this false imprisonment have been added in many perhaps in most instances various lengths and modifications of illegal bondage   that in many instances this complicated and perpetual illegal punishment has been made to attach upon convicts who out of a term of seven years had served five years or upwards in a jail or hulk before they were sent out my brother by representation to lord pelham saved one or two orderly and useful men whose punishment in new south wales would scarcely have commenced before it had become illegal beyond the five years i cannot speak with certainty as to times but the officebooks will show or ought at least to show   that in repeated instances whether by negligence or as the repetition would indicate by design the accounts establishing the dates of expiration of the respective terms have been omitted to be sent to new south wales whereupon the presumption instead of being in favorem libertatis has been in favorem servitutis—in favour of the perpetual servitude thus created   that whereas the powers legalized by the several new south wales     acts are extremely limited an absolute and illegal power of legislation has all along been exercised by the sole authority of the governor there always under the eye and in many if not all instances according to instructions of persons here at home   that of the several acts of authority that have been exercised in that colony from the foundation of it to the present moment a great part have been contrary to law and that in respect thereof many perhaps all persons that are or ever have been in authority there remain exposed to ruin by actions and other persecutions all this is set forth in detail in a paper which though in substance a law argument wears at present the form of a letter addressed to lord pelham to whom in his quality of secretary of state i had begun addressing my narrative designing to have sent the whole in manuscript and not suspecting the bulk to which i found it swell as i went on with it the sort of spirit it is written in is that which would naturally be called forth by the enormities displayed in it and is purposely preserved in the view of exciting in the public mind that attention which would be necessary to the applying to the grievance whatever may be the proper remedy it occupies fiftysix pages of the substance of it a tolerable conception may be formed by the marginal contents as given in the table herewith sent neither lord pelham nor anybody else but romilly has as yet seen it ii so much for law—policy forms another topic by deductions drawn from analogous experience and so far as economy is concerned by the facts and calculations given by the committee of finance i had been led to the persuasion that the institution of the penal colony was from the first and will be to the last in a state of radical and incurable repugnancy to every one of the points that were or ought to have been the objects of such an establishment—to every one of the ends of penal justice—example—reformation—incapacitation for fresh offences—compensation for injury by past offences—and economy from the first volume of captain collinss journal† added to other unprinted but not less authoritative accounts these preconceptions had received already very ample confirmation a continuation of that history to the time of the latest accounts has just made its appearance and the confirmation received from this latest testimony is ample and conclusive to a degree beyond what i myself could have imagined from the time that the illegality of the government of new south wales was known in new south wales what strikes me as not very improbable is—that all subordination—all government there—would be at an end unless parliament were to give it that legality which is at present wanting but that parliament would not give it any such sanction on any other terms than the putting an end as soon as may be to a system thus replete with misery and wickedness diseases both incurable—both raging in a degree without example were i as insensible to human misery and wickedness as the founders and maintainers of that scene of abominations have shown themselves for so many years i should publish immediately and as the bulk of the inhabitants indifferent to life and death are ripe for insurrection at all times and without any pretence—a fortiori would they be so when general independence on the part of all whose terms were expired would be seen to have the sanction of law and though the intelligence might be prevented from being carried out from home directly in government vessels yet from various other countries receiving intelligence from this vessels are going at all times‡ so much for what might be being as i am you may perhaps think it superfluous for me to say—that it will be my care not to let any information transpire of the disorder till parliament is in a condition to apply a remedy in some eyes a degree of ridicule     might attach to the idea of keeping secret what has been in print these four years but besides that to the ignorant the preoccupied and the incurious publication of needles in bottles of hay is no notice to you it can be no secret that in law as in chemistry results altogether new may be produced by new combinations of old elements of the pamphlet on the question of law the short title is—the true bastille c of the other on the question of policy panopticon versus new south wales c of this last the table of marginal contents has been in the hands of lord pelham since the   th iii in the course and for the purpose of the intrigues of which by and by the duke of portland by an unusually selfsigned letter with mr baldwin for his counsel and mr king for his scribe was illadvised enough to avow in an address to the treasury the following designs and practices—   putting of his own authority a professed negative upon the sole object of the imperative provisions of the penitentiary contract act†   filling the country jails with penitentiary prisoners in direct contempt of the original penitentiary act‡    assuming as well as exercising of his own sole authority the power of taxation by throwing the expense of convicts upon a fund of his own choosing the county rates i e the poorrates instead of the general fund on which by the penitentiary acts those expenses were charged by parliament other similar heresies i pass over as requiring too many words to state them and he not only quotes distinctly by their titles the two acts the provisions of which he thus abrogates on the declared ground of their being very inexpedient but says of them in so many words i have examined and understand the object of them of this letter a copy was refused me by the prudence of mr long but i obtained a sufficient extract by imprudence elsewhere another publication in readiness for the press is a pamphlet written upon the strength of this letter for the purpose of inquiring who is the sovereign of this country—the king in parliament or the duke of portland it is a point to be ascertained what the house of commons will say to a power thus exercised by a servant of the crown—a single lord of parliament—over the public purse title—observations on a late exercise of legislative power by the duke of portland in declared contempt of parliament with the details of this less serious and more debateable business i will not attempt to trouble you unless you call for them no more than i have romilly taking it upon the face of my statement of it a statement drawn up in writing and with great care he makes no difficulty in speaking of it in writing as containing impeachable matter whatever may be the uncertainty in which decisions on questions of this sort have been commonly involved by what is called politics iv in the agony of their distress the late treasury when called upon to show in their proceedings why nothing was done about panopticon were desperate enough to speak of a pretended increase of terms‡  as the cause it was not a misconception it was a studied longpremeditated elaboratelyprepared falsehood a grosser a more transparent one was never uttered it was so gross that the man whoever it was that first broached it was afraid to put his name to it it stands in the printed proceedings in the form of an anonymous communication i have looked over these proceedings carefully your kindness gave me the means in the whole pile of them there is not another such example for it is not given as a minute of the board the more direct utterances of the same falsehood contained in the proceedings forced into day by the change of ministry§ were destined for     eternal night and by express order most studiously concealed from the man whose conduct they were libelling and whose fate they took upon them to dispose of anything they had ever received from me on the subject would have disproved the falsehood and therefore everything they have ever received from me was suppressed i wrote immediately to mr hiley addington stating the injury and praying publication of the suppressed documents for redress saying i must publish if they would not mr h addington was frightened mr long was frightened to divert me from that claim they drew me by a trick into an unexpected conference the object of which was to make me hear a sham offer they had to make to me the very nature of the offer showed me at once it was not intended to be realized the event has proved as much the cover given to it was an affectation of extreme surprise at my perversity in pretending not to understand the same offer to have been already made in the last official letter to me† that letter bound them to nothing as to one half of the offer the reduced number of  00 convicts instead of the original number of  000 and the augmented number of  000 and put a clear negative on the other half—viz compensation for the difference what passed at the conference is as curious as the contrivance for producing it and in the sketches of treasury morality would make a picture of itself some allusions to it are in a paper already in the hands of lord pelham they got nothing by their stratagem for parrying the demand i got nothing by the demand itself unless it be the opportunity of observing how sore they were in the place it touched them in in saying i got nothing i mean at the time for in the long run together with an additional motive i have obtained an additional ground for applying by petition to the new parliament for relief against insinuations having the effect of defamation for the injury done to me by it was a serious one and suppressions having the effect of forgery if on my petition the house does not publish i mean call for the suppressed documents and order them to be published i do to publish a correspondence between the treasury and myself is no offence against the house but what saving your better judgment is an offence against the house is reporting to it anonymous falsehoods instead of authenticated facts v you have no more forgotten than i have your opinion of mr pitts treatment of me as declared for his edification before mr rider at the committee‡ the barbarity was then not more than a barbarity of four years it has since been doubled in duration i mean but in multiplicity of acts and variety of engines it has been swollen and improved to a degree that would astonish you the underhand practices—the system of longspun and elaborate yet always transparent treachery concerted—sometimes between the two floors of the treasury sometimes between the treasury and subordinate offices—form such a history as i cannot think would be altogether without interest to the public or even to parliament it cannot if there be any the smallest spark of regard in either for probity and good faith in the headquarters of the state   the assurance without which i refused to meddle with the then proffered and since purchased land—the assurance that no opposition on the part of lord belgrave should prevent the application of it to the public use lord belgrave a mere neighbour having no interest in the land the assurance given me in the most energetic and apparently confidential manner by mr long thereupon a promise of which i have proof given to lord belgrave that the land never should be applied to that same use the existence of this perfidious promise assumed over and over again by myself and others in black and white as well as in conversations with mr long and mr long never attempting to excuse it nor daring to deny it   care taken that the £  000 purchasemoney     should be received by lord salisbury care taken at the same time that the £ 000 known from the first to be necessary to the application of the land to its pretended public use viz by buying out remains of leasehold terms should not nor any part of it be ever received by me the £  000 not suffered to pass through the hands of me the feofee who was to acknowledge the receipt of it lest the deficiency of the necessary and promised £ 000 should be perceived by me my signature obtained to a false receipt—a paper acknowledging the receipt of it—obtained by a contrivance the very possession of the leases as well as the titledeeds endeavoured to be withholden from me the possession of the land such part as could be withholden withholden from me to this hour in spite of all remonstrances viz by the withholding of the money for the purchase assurances that orders had been issued for a warrant for that money as in fact they had been issued and a minute made accordingly those assurances given to me and in the same breath measures taken for preventing the money from being ever issued   the very species of misconduct that furnished the sole pretence for breaking the public faith with mr palmer—the having conceived under the agony of provocation the momentary idea of throwing confusion into the public service in that subordinate department—that very species of misconduct adopted and practised in the department paramount in cold blood for the purpose of the breach to be made in the public faith as plighted to me confusion and insubordination purposely organized subordinates encouraged in declared contempt of the orders of the board encouraged in repeated instances and in different offices and after full notice of the contempt by written complaints from me facts and arguments forming the ground for the orders of the board kept back from subordinates lest they should be deterred from the opposition they had been instructed to make engagements sanctioned by minutes of the board these engagements broken to my prejudice—broken without apology or explanation under the observation of the clerks and other witnesses of the transactions of the board   attempts to render me an instrument of oppression and much vexation in spite of my indefatigable labour to prevent it actually caused to twenty unoffending families inhabitants of houses in the purchased land for the purpose of the ruin in which it is hoped they would involve me by suits at law instead of the promised £ 000 for buying out these and other interests a price at which after lord salisbury had offered i had offered to bear the expense an order obtained from the board directing me to inquire into the compensation requisite with an advice from their solicitor to insist that the evacuation of the premises should be absolute and immediate—that order obtained under a determination never to give me possession of the premises—never to give any money for the compensation the damage thus swelled from the abovementioned single thousand to several thousands in spite of the most indefatigable exertions on my part to keep it as low as possible recorded exertions testimony of which i have been careful to preserve all this in spite of or rather by reason of the most strenuous remonstrances on my part remonstrances in writing exhibiting the mischief in all its features of the insidious refusal of the promised £ 000 one evident motive was—the hope of driving me for i was not to be led into this snare   to blind me the more effectually and at the same time involve in the more certain ruin my character by the appearance of their own ill faith my fortune by litigation and my health and peace of mind by vexation and disappointment—a sham treaty carried on all this while—carried on for a matter of a twelvemonth—for other necessary contiguous land the proprietor a gentleman of fortune but under temporary difficulties mr wire disturbed by the fraud in his economical arrangements and to my knowledge materially injured in his fortune       letters upon letters from me unanswered and unnoticed personal access eluded for months at last openly refused from the time that for the accommodation of lord salisbury himself innocent and irreproachable i was deluded as above into the acceptance of his estate scarce in a single instance a fair audience of mr long three weeks without the intermission of a single day—three whole weeks on one single occasion—i remember passing in the passages and when at last mr long was pleased to send out a refusal to see me it presented itself to me as a favour because discharging me from my attendance wanton and unprovoked insults were what i got from mr rose when attending him for the fulfilment of the prospects he had held out to me they were put an end to prospects and insults together by a refusal to see me any more not to speak of clerks whose civility to me had real merit in it i owe it to the kindness of the porters that i received no insults from them after the treatment they saw given to me all without so much as the fancied shadow of a complaint against me as mr long before witnesses and particularly at our very last interview has been forced repeatedly to confess in the midst of all these transparent frauds—under all these barbarous oppressions—not a single harsh word on the part of the patient—in conversation or writing towards a single individual among his oppressors of all ranks more of this—i know not how much—might be added i spare it you—i spare myself the hunting for it if this be not enough what else can be panopticon it is obvious enough is not the more beneficial a system for any scrape into which its adversaries may have floundered true but neither is it the worse against it scarce an expression of vague dislike much less anything in the shape of a specific objection has been ever urged that i could ever hear of by its most determined adversaries no man has ever yet been hardy enough to deny though the calls for denial have been perpetual that the sole causes of the sacrifices so often made of it have been the successive compliments paid to the train of successive lords ending with lord belgrave for my petition i mean to avail myself of the offer of sir c bunbury he having been the first to mention panopticon to parliament† before mr dundas came forward with his panegyric wilberforce must either help to pour shame upon the heads of his friends in both ministries or desert his own opinions and belie his feelings not only as declared to myself in black and white and that very recently but declared for years to all sorts of persons without reserve be the prayer of the petition granted or refused—all the perfidies—all the treacheries—all the oppressions—all the corruption—all the disorder—come out of course for the constitutional points without yet knowing the particulars a person out of all party but above all party and of no small account—particularly in points of that nature has promised in a letter i have by me a strict attention to the business having tried nobody else yet i have met with no refusals of the opposition of whom i know nothing i leave you to judge who can say the same spirit which has so lately brought upon the head of mr mainwaring a punishment which judging from the report of the commissioners of the crown and the confession of one of those who voted for him along with you i cannot look upon as altogether unmerited may it not give some trouble in its call for punishment—not of mr pitt or the duke of portland only but even of mr addington for connivances so much more culpable the opinion of romilly was not lightly given after a consideration of some weeks it was first given vivâ voce i resuggested the points that seemed most novel or least clear an inconsiderate opinion might have hurt both of us i told him there might be     occasion for me to make it public he kept the papers and in a letter written for the purpose on the point of his departure found he could do neither more nor less than say—what you state respecting botany bay has very much astonished me it has the more astonished me because i take the law upon the subject to be exactly as you have stated it the marginal contents are not sufficient to enable you to form an opinion of your own but they show upon what points it would have to turn i would not load you with the paper at large    pages it is at your command of course at any time romilly is for the crown on the question of the prince of wales white was beforehand with the princes people in retaining him and the prince himself has expressed his disappointment at it the spirit of selfdelusion might have suggested this and that and tother in relation to a man who though no party man was no greater an admirer than myself of the late ministry but this works by estoppel you probably know better than i whether for some time past he has not been by far the first man in the court of chancery though originally more conversant in the common law upon the whole in regard to mr addington my calculation is—that even setting aside all danger to his friends he would find it less trouble to break at once the corrupt illegal promise than to persist in breaking the legal one—to establish a system of certain reformation than to maintain by waste of public money a system of unexampled and altogether remediless abominations should his calculation agree with this of mine he will act accordingly should yours agree with it your regard for his honour still more for the honour of government as bound up with it will according to another calculation of mine afford you a sufficient inducement to apprize him of your sentiments to that effect the ground upon which these prospects such as they are are built is not the most flattering of all others to mr addington but it is he that has driven me upon it before trial i looked up to him with the firmest confidence the margin† refers to a most faithful picture of it nothing short of experience nor even that for a long time could wrench it from me on that occasion mr addingtons probity failed him and with it as is but natural his courage though mr nepean was my evidence or rather because mr nepean was my evidence he durst not hear my evidence as little durst he refuse to hear it he set his brother to shuffle with me as you may see my representations he had no objection to receive because a paper the more upon his shelves would not give him much trouble from mr nepean though i mean always because the only person from whom he could have got any correct and honest account of the secret part of the business that is the dregs at the bottom of the dirty and dishonourable part of it he could not bear to hear anything about it because having every now and then occasion to face mr nepean and being known to mr nepean to have had notice of the business with more or less of the perfidies and treacheries and oppressions and corruptions sticking to it in mr nepean he would as often have to face a man who would behold in him a privy and by adoption a party to so many scandalous enormities the maxim mr addington has hitherto found it convenient as he thinks to take upon this as upon other occasions for his guide is—that mr pitt can do no wrong and it is that he may not be obliged to part with it that he has taken for his model the judge i have just been reading of in a newspaper who would never suffer more than one side of a cause to be heard because both sides he said confused him the side that gave him the support of so useful not to say necessary a friend presented itself to his prudence as the side of safety the example of such a predecessor—of such a possible successor—presented itself to his probity as an advantageous     substitute to the dictates of law public policy and justice my case being among those which by the law itself are put out of the protection of the law—and mr addingtons station in it being that of a judge but with a power much more boundless than that of any judge so called the injustice of his conduct is by so much the more efficient than that of the very considerate magistrate just mentioned mr addingtons hope is—what mr pitts hope was—to see me die brokenhearted like a rat in a hole i may die any day but so long as perfidy and treachery and oppression and corruption and arbitrary power and contempt of parliament and the persevering propagation of immorality and misery are the order of the day with him so long as i live he will find me living to his annoyance living did i say yes and even when i am dead he will not be rid of me being no longer hare but hunter the spirit that animates hunters is come upon me by leaving me nothing to do of that which i ought to have had to do so many years ago he leaves me no other mode of serving the public so efficient or impressive as the reading of that moral lesson which will be read to it by the uncovering of his shame my demand is an extremely simple one—that an engagement of oneandahalf years standing entered into after seven months taken to consider of it may be trampled upon no longer—that according to that engagement prisonroom be given me for the  000—terms to be grounded on it as per memorial settled by mr nepean—principles assented to over and over in conversation with him by mr long the number to be secured to me no more than the original number  000 for anything beyond that number i neither asked any engagement nor would have accepted it had it been offered for taking the least bad course that can now be taken in relation to new south wales he might perhaps in this case find his account in consulting a man who is not an utter stranger as so many have been to the subject either on the chapter of law or policy—who is not above taking trouble on any subject nor above looking upon these outcasts as fit objects of his care lord pelhams letter does not satisfy me you may see why it does not it may be sincere but though i were sure of its being so i could not trust to it it binds not mr addington it is much less than i got from mr dundas in his lordships place on the occasion of battersea rise time begins already to show the value of it in any declaration he might make to you though it were but a verbal one so it were a specific one he knowing you to be in possession of the case i might venture to have confidence why because it will never be in his power to fly from your presence as he might have done for the most part from mr nepeans as often as he looked up to you in your chair with those professions of probity upon his lips which will be so often called for from his place your eyes would bear witness against him if he were false this is my last private attempt to drive into the head of mr addington the sense of justice should this pass unnoticed or prove fruitless the die is cast if i hear nothing from you before the   th of this instant september   0  this being the  d i shall no longer look for it on that day it may be necessary for me to take steps that may be irrevocable time passes and presses i must not lose the commencement of the approaching session as messrs addingtons made me lose the remainder of the session of   0  jeremy bentham  th september   0  charles abbot bentham to charles abbot  th september   0  i had been used from time to time to send panopticon progress to wilberforce august   th i sent him the correspondence with sir c bunbury and lord pelhams letter and the marginal contents of panopticon v new south wales sir cs last letter excepted   0 which did not come till afterwards yesterday he returned my packet with a long letter of four sheets the remarkable feature in it and the cause for which i mention it is this the most material and striking article of the packet lying before him was this letter of lord pelhams in which his lordship says—at all events    i will endeavour to get something settled before the meeting of parliament yet with this before his eyes—all his good advice—all his projects assume that nothing at all will have been settled before the meeting of parliament to get it settled such and such things are to be attempted though with a chance of success which he scarce ventures to give as more than a faint one in parliament this assumption of his to what cause can it be imputed was it that he thought lord pelham would not so much as make any attempt was it that he thought it would be unsuccessful was it that he knew it would be unsuccessful viz by having communicated on the subject with mr addington the latter is a matter of fact which might have been a material object of inquiry if my time admitted of the making of it meantime of these three interpretations between which mr wilberforce did not look upon it as worth his while to distinguish one at least supposes that sort of conduct which in sir c bunburys more frank and open estimate would disgrace not only a ministers secretary but his porter the uniformly honourable character which as far as my obscurity would admit of my hearing anything i had always heard attributed to lord pelham—this added to the marks of candour on his part that seemed to transpire through the debates would have led me to place as much confidence as my experience of those offices would admit of my placing in so positive an undertaking on his part as the above had it not been for his expedition of discovery for finding out what steps had been taken by the treasury what if anything had been done there legally and above board the minutebook would have shown him at any time in half an hour out of the week he took to give his answer the only possible matter of discovery the case afforded was any such clandestine and dishonourable and unavowable and unavowed assurance or assurances as that which had been given to lord belgrave far from being matter of triumph it is matter of most serious concern to me to find those suspicions of mine receive already so much apparent confirmation there are two things i could not get either mr long or mr hiley addington at the conference they entrapped me into  th july   0  to speak of as possessed of any the smallest binding force acts of parliament and the engagements taken by men in office in consequence nothing could equal the scorn with which the idea was received wilberforce notwithstanding the probity of his own conduct seems to have entertained all along a sort of implied notion to the same effect derived doubtless from that practice which on the part of messrs rose and long and perhaps pitt he must have had so many occasions to observe i cannot antecedently to experience bring myself to think that these notions will find approbation with the public at large i am sure they do not among all placemen sir evan nepean at any rate is an example next to the setting up of panopticon which if i were to live might enlarge my opportunities of being of use in one way or other i cannot think of anything by which i could do more substantial service than by exposing a line of conduct which seems at present to be endemical and habitual in such manner as to render it if possible no longer tenable wilberforce however amongst other good advice preaches passive obedience and nonresistance for this one session giving me a dispensation for hostility should this prove fruitless and in the meantime recommends that botany bay should be exposed in a quiet way and     on the ground of immorality only i mean without blame to anybody for which he offers aid which if i understand him right is by communication of facts he however knows nothing of the præmunire and the illegalities and tyrannies connected with it not that i shall take his advice my own experience runs uniformly counter to his theories i have found the principle of terror operate in several instances and no other principle in any he is all in a flutter about his friends he does not himself think they will do as he is convinced they ought to do and he dreads the seeing them exposed for it he shuts his eyes against the facts and then imagines excuses for them incompatible with the facts which from the first so far as they tend to imputation he has never been able to bear to look at—or at least to own the looking at them it is natural enough that he should be for laying law and engagement out of the case because those topics cannot be handled without imputation to his friends it is equally natural that i should not part with strong ground and confine myself to weak ground for the accommodation of those who have made a point all along of keeping me to that weak ground that they might crush me at their ease not that he is indifferent to panopticon for he talks of it all the while like an enthusiast jeremy bentham   th october   0  m dumont bentham to dumont q s p   th october   0  my dear dumont— i got back here at night last saturday fortnight the  d instant on the next day sunday understanding from my brother that sir evan nepean had mentioned his having had two interviews on the subject with mr addington i called to hear particulars what was said or at least what was reported to me as said was chiefly on nepeans part and consisted principally of testimonies in my favour added to what he had said and was ready to say to pitt long c as to what he thought of their conduct in the business addington appears to have said little he touched upon that article in my proposal in which i engage to pay a limited sum in the event of a subsequent offence committed by a convict that had been under my care he was pleased to term it one of my flights in fact it amounts to no more than a partial not a total deduction of a profit that would result to me from the same incident but this is what few are either able or willing to perceive in default of all solid objections it serves people for the shadow of an objection on the score of quackery in the pamphlet i have sent to the press panopticon versus new south wales of which afterwards i offer full explanation to the above purport to any one who will vouchsafe to look at it he concluded with saying that he had not made up his mind on the business and that it was his intention to turn it over to mr vansittart i wrote accordingly on that same day to mr v telling him of what i had heard as above and apprizing him of my return which he might not otherwise have heard of but i have heard nothing from him as yet in addition to the letters mentioned above i found one from sir charles bunbury dated  0th september in which are these words i saw lord pelham and desired he would send to you and inform you what steps he intended to take in the business of the panopticon prison he said he would as soon as he had read through your books and conversed with the chancellor and the judges on the subject looking upon this as an evasion i considered it as calling upon me upon the principle of selfpreservation to tell my story to those same personages i have accordingly sent to the press panopticon versus new south wales c in the form of a letter to lord pelham stating the above intimation of his as the occasion of my taking that method of multiplying copies for the edification of the said personages to return to nepean—as far as he was concerned nothing could be more satisfactory than the short conference which was all he could or at least thought proper to allow me he gave me to understand that for a long time past he had set down in his own mind as a     contingency not very unlikely to happen the bringing the business before parliament that he had kept himself accordingly in preparation and was ready at any time to give his evidence in my abovereferredtoletter to mr addington written to him very soon after his accession and commencing with the averment of its being written with the privity of mr nepean i gave him sufficient intimation that nepeans evidence wherever and whenever given would cover with shame mr pitt and his subordinates what made these assurances of nepeans the more satisfactory was—that for one and a half year i had never set eyes on sir evan nepean he began with explanations in the form of reproaches for my invisibility c—which produced counter explanations on my part and were followed with the strongest assurances that in respect of affections as well as of opinion he remained unchanged what an opportunity for opposition if they have but the understanding to improve it had they ever anything like it before a man of nepeans impregnable and popular character having not the least personal quarrel with either the present people or the past ready to stand up against both for the pure love of justice one thing i had like to have forgotten—a caution on the part of n to avoid acting through the very channel through which what was done had been done his hurry real or affected prevented me from getting an explanation of the grounds of this caution on which he appeared to lay a considerable stress public situation or character and disposition as towards myself—which of these circumstances had he in view on your part my dear dumont you will not fail to feel the extreme delicacy that attends the communication of a correspondence of such a nature with such a personage no security can be too great that can contribute to ensure the preventing it from coming round in fact you will indeed perceive that nothing could be more guarded on his part as well as mine armed on both sides capapied but in case of a disclosure of this sort of confidential correspondence how convenient a pretence to the great man for shaking off and even openly turning against the troublesome little one not the least curious incident in the business is a correspondence on the subject with wilberforce i had been used from time to time to send him reports under the title of panopticon progress a little before my trip to paris i sent him one on the occasion of the intercourse with lord pelham through the medium of sir charles bunbury thereupon on my return i found a letter of his of four  to sheets half of it taken up with apologies about haste and so forth agonies of terror about my threatened narrative counter threats of utter silence having the effect of abandonment on the part of all my friends abbot for example by name and himself not excepted in the event of my bringing on the matter in any tone of inculpation recommendation to try this one session in a quiet way with nothing but a statement of the bad points of new south wales for which he expressly offers materials consent to my acting hostilely in another session if nothing comes of quiet proceedings in the next short answer—very short—on my part expressing an intention of profiting by his advice so far as consists in the making an attack upon new south wales and asking him for his documents reply from him in a tone of unusual coldness saying that the communications he meant were verbal ones and referring me to conversations in the course of the winter for the time we not being of late years more especially in the habit of any such conversations my notion is that in the meantime some intimation had reached him by conversations for example either with my other correspondent or with addington c that i did not mean so far to take his advice as to give up my attack upon his dear friends for whom he had been expressing his regard to me—even the rose of roses not excepted in the long letter piety in abundance on the occasion of lord belgrave and upon the whole a not unamusing or altogether unedifying contrast might be exhibited between the     ardour of his piety and the icy coldness of his love of public justice he confesses pitts procrastination to save him on the score of perfidy for my part i shall admit the procrastination but instead of admitting it as a disproof of the perfidy i state it as the cause this same pious gentleman had broken on a former occasion as solemn and deliberate and spontaneous a promise as it was possible for one man to give to another a promise that he would not desert me and that he would bring on the panopticon business in parliament at any time and in any shape i would point out i pointed out in due season a shape so quiet and unexceptionable as that of a mere motion for the continuation of those accounts from new south wales the continuation of which had been so strongly recommended in the twentyeighth report of the committee of finance he would neither bring it on in that shape nor in any other nor his friend thornton neither who was present and by whom it was my plan that the motion should be made he having been an efficient member of that committee i forbore irritating him by any the least allusion to his promise at the time of his making it he had not yet quite reconciled himself with pitt on whose want of good faith he spoke with great freedom imputing it to his want of faith in the religious sense a capital object of his alarm was i return to his long letter my including in my narrative a letter i had written to him about ten months ago on the occasion of a conversation of his with lord pelham written to him w giving him an account of a visit i had undergone a year or two before from the duke of portland with billy baldwin to take care of him it would cover his grace—and for life—with ridicule ineffaceable would it so quoth i—tant mieux he shall not catch cold for want of it though a covering composed of the four walls in some room in the tower would be a further covering not ill suited to his deserts λάῖνον ἔσσ ϰιτῶνα ϰαϰῶν ἑνεχ ἕσσ ἔοϱγας you have read homer since i did and can conclude or correct the metre and the sense the pleasant part of the story is—that in the midst of all this concern for the reputation of his grace he himself makes no secret of his considering himself under an obligation of bringing before parliament something on the part of his said grace big with enormity though unspecified so that my attack upon his grace—an attack he does not dispute the justice of—is to be given up for his beautiful eyes while his is to be made comme de raison from which i infer that he has contrived or thinks at least that he has contrived in this attack to keep the now again dear pitts and roses and longs out of the scrape in all this sacrifice of public justice to private connexion there is nothing very miraculous upon ordinary mundane principles but on the pure spiritual ones that breathe through every pore of this epistle what shall we say to it what a contrast between this man and nepean from whom i have never in the course of the whole business heard a syllable about holiness poor dear religious sanction what a bump it gives to the beam when thus weighed against the moral meantime this crack in a house divided against itself—a sort of a tenement which we are assured from the highest authority cannot stand—might be not altogether unworthy the ear of opposition it is their business to have or rather to have had intimation of the cause and particulars of it and thereupon not to sit still with their arms across and see it close again  th jan   0  jeremy bentham the rev brownlow ford ordinary of newgate to bentham  th jan   0  your own investigation of the subject will furnish you with many documents as well as arguments on the subject of executions better calculated than anything i have said to do away the disgrace which they are to our country and from you they will have weight pursue them i beseech you to the abolishing of executions and you will deserve ten thousand times more from that country than ever howard did my situation     in life is too insignificant to have any attention paid to my opinions besides as one of the aldermen said when i expressed some such thoughts as i have now given to you—pray be quiet doctor and keep your mind to yourself if there were no executions there would be no occasion for an ordinary verbum sapienti—if the enclosed remarks be worth preserving please to indulge me either with them or a copy of them as soon as you can make it convenient the title which bentham had proposed to give the volume afterwards called plea for the constitution was constitution conquered dr parr liked the title and the preface and wrote to bentham urging him not to cast it aside but romilly more cautious thought differently and wrote thus— samuel romilly   th feb   0  jeremy bentham romilly to bentham   th feb   0  dear bentham— if my criticism has no other merit it will have that of frankness i dont like your preface if i were to decide between that and none should vote for omitting it altogether there is too much levity in it especially as it forms a striking contrast with the proposed title a man who is about to read of the constitution not violated only but conquered—of enormities committed and all our most sacred laws broken—would not expect to be so much amused at the outset as he will find himself when he has read only a few paragraphs of the preface in truth it appears to me that the title is too vague and the preface much too comic i dont like your passing from the attempted conquest of america to the attempted conquest of the constitution in      which by the by was long anterior in time to the conquest of america though not to lord chathams speech which you allude to and which related to a different kind of conquest—a conquest from the french i dont like it in the first place because though the forty days tyranny was a transaction very properly brought to the recollection of those to whom you are about to show that the constitution has been since violated in more important points without any attention being paid to it yet that forty days tyranny is not to be compared in any point of view with the american war and in the next place i dont like it because the word conquest is applied in its literal sense to america but is a metaphor when used either of the transactions of      or the proceedings at botany bay the truth is that notwithstanding what has been done at botany bay the british constitution is not conquered but still remains as it did it has been disregarded—violated if you please—but because ministers have done what is alleged and nobody but yourself yet knows anything of the matter i think you would hardly maintain seriously with the parliament sitting with its accustomed forms and your favourite juries deciding causes every day that the constitution is conquered again samuel romilly march     0  jeremy bentham march     0  dear bentham— i had a short conversation today with the attorneygeneral nothing in the preface has given him offence and on the contrary he seems to think that you have spoken very civilly of him but he has been shocked very much by the title—the title and the preface are all he has read i wish i could recollect his words—they were as nearly as i can remember them to this effect if i were disposed to interest myself to have the panopticon established and to have him placed at the head of it—and i should really be glad to do it if i saw a proper opportunity—how could i recommend to a secretary of state to place in such a situation a person who had written such things of him or his predecessors—ever and most sincerely yours c joseph jekyll march     0  jeremy bentham joseph jekyll to bentham spring gardens march     0  dear bentham— you know i am such an old jailbird that i am really vexed we have not met especially as     sir c bunbury says you wished to meet me your letters to lord pelham i have read with care and total approbation but as to any step in parliament—what can we do—jupiter hostis—at least as far as finance goes and their own habitual support of a most abominable system—abominable chiefly because most foolish jeremy bentham  th april   0  joseph jekyll bentham to jekyll q s p  th april   0  dear jekyll— many thanks for your kind letter of the first of last month the best return it has been in my power to make for it i have made which is to forbear taking advantage of it to plague you to no purpose the devil tempted me to shoot you flying during circuit time with a third pamphlet which i shall now deposit quietly at your house in company with these presents the devil tempted me but your good genius or genuises in the shape of two evil geniuses of mine—irresolution and indolence—cried out avaunt satan and so you escaped what is it that has turned my brain and thrown me among the supernaturals your jupiter hostis i believe oh yes hostile enough i warrant him but have you not heard—when you come to town i suppose you will hear—of a conspiracy among certain titans to force him in his celestial chamber first titan sir charles bunbury if he has not forgot it or given it up it waits i suppose for you botany bay which he has an invincible penchant for and does not like i should say anything against it was to be connived at the attack was to be pointed at the hulks wherefore he issued an injunction against the letting off the aforesaid and herewith enclosed squib he said be it so and so it was whereby you escaped as above and your circuit likewise for my project was that you should have tied it to the tails of your two judges i dont know who they are and bounced it off at one of your circuit dinners i submitted and with the best grace imaginable ask him eh prudence is his province fortitude and patience mine but not to trespass any further upon yours i conclude with assuring you that as faithfully as you are mine i am yours gratefully c i am always in the same doghole where i have been kenneling for above these twelve years i am never out of it so that if it should ever happen to you to prefer walking to vexation you may be sure to find me jeremy bentham  d may   0  sir charles bunbury bentham to sir

party will serve the dr for defence orders from on high passive obedience below allegiance—but what is to become of the protection that was to pay for it visit from jekyll who talked of making up a jailgang at his house sir h mildmay whom i have never seen is notorious as an enemy to the hulks but his still more notorious friendship for pitt may perhaps have indisposed him against the comparative view and the cause in general letters and plea—it is high time they were published if no good is to be got by forbearance—your most obsequious c jeremy bentham   st may   0  william wilberforce bentham to william wilberforce q s p   st may   0  dear sir— on the  th instant i received from sir charles bunbury a letter the conclusion of which is in these words—  i spoke to mr wilberforce to know whether he would apply with me and other friends to mr addington but he declined saying he thought you had been used very ill and could not keep his temper when he talked on the business the practical determination thus represented as announced presented itself to me as being in such diametrical     opposition to the observation on which it is represented as grounding itself that i should have stood convicted of rashness in my own mind had i suffered myself to regard the intelligence as correct without applying to yourself for the confirmation or correction of it it is my misfortune to be a principal in the business so much so as to have everything at stake upon it it never yet occurred to me to have the smallest apprehension of not being able to keep my temper in talking about it much less if i were to go prepared silence at the very worst would be a sure resource that a comparative stranger in the ocean of whose public concerns this business is but a drop—a man remarkable as i have ever understood for the mildness of his temper too as well as for so many other virtues—should be so much more affected than the party himself who has had nothing else to think of for these ten years seems to me so irreconcileable to the known principles of human nature that i feel myself quite unable to admit it at this rate were a minister on any other occasion to find his convenience in sacrificing the interests of public security and morality—in trampling upon acts of parliament—in breaking the public faith to the oppression of an unoffending individual—he would need to but screw up the enormity of his guilt to a pitch sufficiently provoking and on those terms he might make sure of the acquiescence of mr wilberforce what a lesson what an encouragement—for the advocates of the slave trade for example were they to hear of this—which perhaps they have done by this time—though certainly not from me had the proposition been to move for the impeachment of these friends of yours—to move for an inquiry—to move for papers—so much as to stand up and say anything upon the subject in the house it would be a different case but if i understand the matter right your refusal went not merely to the speaking on the occasion but the so much as going up to the minister in his closet and entering a silent appearance among the approvers of the measure sir charles was then on the point of setting out for the country whether he has returned or no i know not for i have not seen or heard from him since by the date of his letter you will see how far i have been from being forward to trouble you on the subject but the case is every now and then somebody is dropping in upon me and asking—well and mr wilberforce what says he to the business—a question to which i know not what answer to make pressed as i am between the apprehension of doing you an injustice and the difficulty i find in conceiving any incorrectness in the evidence in a case upon the face of it so simple labouring under this perplexity you will i flatter myself forgive the trouble i am putting you to in thus applying to the only person in whose power it is to relieve me from it two former letters had in some measure prepared me—as it seemed they were designed to do—for abandonment but that recollection far from removing scarcely so much as lessens the difficulty i experience in conceiving such a reason to be assigned for it i once considered myself nor shall anything short of absolute necessity make me cease to consider myself dear sir your much obliged humble servant william wilberforce june     0  jeremy bentham william wilberforce to bentham house of commons june     0  my dear sir— i am very sorry that our friend sir charles bunbury by reporting to you i am sure through mistake not very correctly a few words which i uttered to him very hastily when my mind was full of other business on our accidentally meeting in a shop has occasioned in you any uneasiness or any misconception of my sentiments and feelings towards you these are the same which they have long been such as proceed from a perfect conviction of the great advantages which would result from the carrying into execution of your valuable plan from a persuasion that you have been most hardly used from various circumstances which     i need not particularize and lastly from an earnest desire that you may at length overcome all obstructions and see your ingenious theory realized and your long labours crowned with success i shall ever be ready to lend my best efforts so far as they can properly be exerted for the accomplishment of this end you may reckon upon me as steadily possessing these dispositions and as being always desirous of acting upon them i will also at any time see you and confer with you on the business and with any friends of yours my being occupied beyond my constitution and my having been ill has alone prevented my anticipating your application and attending to your affairs in the early part of the present session i scribble at a crowded committee amid interruption and bustle you must allow therefore for this hasty scrawl and believe me always with esteem and regard dear sir your faithful c there is an hiatus in the documentary history of the panopticon controversy from the date of the above till the year   0  when i find wilberforce writing as follows— william wilberforce june     0  jeremy bentham william wilberforce to bentham kensington gore or new pal yard june     0  my dear sir— though the incessant bustle in which i live during my residence in the neighbourhood of london is such as to render it impossible for me to bestow much thought on any but urgentlypressing business yet i can truly declare that you and the treatment you experienced have been often in my mind and that the sense of it which i have formerly so often expressed to you remains utterly unaltered but in truth i always felt that it was more than could be expected i might almost say out of nature for you to think that i had not neglected opportunities of pushing forward your business and therefore i was impressed with the persuasion that however your good nature might prevent your opening your mind to me you must number me among those who had used you ill and consequently not much relish my society i therefore satisfied myself with speaking of you of your merits and cruel sufferings in the way which justice appeared to me to require as often as opportunities occurred at length an occasion arose the other day in the house of commons for publicly noticing your plan and some private conversation though but a few words with one of the treasury people confirmed the opinion which various circumstances had led me to form—that the present was a favourable moment for carrying into execution your great project and obtaining for the public all the benefits it is calculated to produce i have been therefore ever since intending to write to you that i might learn whether you had still the heart to go forward after all your former disappointments indeed i hoped that what i said in the house would have attracted the public attention but according to the usual treatment which on principle i experience from the reporters of our debates and which i expect will at length have the effect intended—of ruining me with those of the public to whom i am not personally known not one word of what i said on this subject was mentioned in any newspaper i saw and in one the times i was not even mentioned as having spoken at all though my speech was i will not say anything of its quality more in quantity than that of any other speaker i should be glad to confer with you on the business at any time and would either call on you or be happy to see you at the hôtel or kensington gore at the former i often am from about three to four oclock and at the latter till twelve oclock in the day from halfpast ten unless the house has sat beyond twelve oclock the night before in which case i sleep in westminster excuse the effects of extreme haste and believe me with esteem and regard my dear sir yours most truly the report of the select committee     on penitentiary houses in      is mentioned above p  0  as having been designed for finally crushing the panopticon project it is thus alluded to by romilly— samuel romilly june        jeremy bentham romilly to bentham dear bentham— the committee made their report yesterday i have not been able to see it it is very long and i understand very unfavourable to your contract i attended the last day but one of their meeting but found it quite impossible to do anything except abercromby and myself and wilberforce no person friendly to you was present—evermost sincerely yours c june        the part of the report which bears on the subject is as follows— the   th geo iii cap    reciting that certain lands at battersea rise which are described in the recital and stated to contain    acres and one rood had been fixed upon by the supervisors appointed in pursuance of the former act and after being duly approved of under the provisions of that act had been valued by the verdict of a jury at £  00 but that penitentiary houses had not been erected directs the lords commissioners of the treasury to fix upon that spot of ground or any other equally convenient and to contract for the erection of a penitentiary house or penitentiary houses thereupon they were to appoint a feoffee or feoffees to treat for the ground and accept a conveyance of it and the usual powers were given to compel a sale by the owners of the spot selected the provisions of the former act respecting the appointment of a committee for the superintendence of the establishment as well as those enactments which related to the treatment of the offenders to be confined therein were virtually superseded by the third clause of this statute enabling his majesty to nominate a governor or governors of such penitentiary house or houses when erected and giving to such governor or governors the care management superintendence and control of the same under such powers directions limitations and restrictions as are contained in the   th geo iii cap    or as should be appointed by his majesty under the powers of that act which is an act empowering his majesty to commit to the care of persons to be named overseers offenders either under sentence of death and reprieved or under sentence of transportation to be fed clothed and kept to hard labour in such places and under such directions as his majesty shall appoint the   th geo iii appears to have been brought into parliament with a view to an arrangement which had been for some time in contemplation founded on an offer made by jeremy bentham esq a gentleman of great respectability to contract with the lords commissioners of the treasury for the erection of a penitentiary house and the care and custody of the persons to be confined therein upon a plan described in a paper entitled a proposal for a new and less expensive mode of employing and reforming convicts a copy of which is contained in the appendix to this report and about a month before the act received the royal assent a sum of £ 000 was actually advanced to mr bentham from the treasury by way of imprest to enable him to make such preparation as might be necessary for the custody and care of the convicts proposed to be confined in the penitentiary houses intended to be erected it appears that articles of agreement were accordingly drawn up between the lords commissioners of the treasury and mr bentham and the various sums of money to be received or paid by the contractor in the several cases that might occur under the contract were settled and inserted in the draft a blank being only left for the description of the ground in the selection or purchase of which the difficulties which have prevented the completion of the arrangement appear to have arisen it does not appear for what reason the site of the intended erection was changed from battersea rise but the ground which had been chosen there and valued under the former act was abandoned before any contract for the conveyance of it had been completed for a spot in tothill fields where    acres of land were purchased for £  000 and a conveyance of them taken on the   th day of october      from the vender to mr bentham as feoffee under the provisions of the   th geo iii mr bentham who is still in possession of this land considers himself as entitled to have attached to the penitentiary house under his contract such additional quantity of ground as shall make the whole of what is allotted to him amount to    acres that being the number which he found appropriated to the intended establishment by the recital in the act of parliament and he states upon that head that the portion of such ground which may exceed the quantity absolutely necessary for the erection of a penitentiary house formed a part of the consideration for which he consented to the terms of the original agreement and that he intended to use the whole for the purposes of the establishment by employing such of the convicts as were fit for it in agriculture and gardening mr bentham having appeared to your committee to be still desirous that the contract to which though not actually signed he conceives the public faith to be fully pledged should be carried into effect with such variation in the sum of money to be paid by     government for the maintenance of each convict as should be deemed equitable in consideration of the advance of price which has taken place in all articles of consumption since the agreement was framed and with the exception of such part of the agreement as relates to the erection of the buildings for the penitentiary house which he does not now find himself able to undertake your committee found it necessary to enter into the consideration of the principles of the contract alluded to in order to form a judgment on the expediency of its adoption for the management of the penitentiary establishment recommended in this report mr benthams offer the terms of which appear in a pecuniary point of view to be advantageous to the public was founded according to the statement contained in his original proposal upon his having contrived a building in which any number of persons might be kept within the reach of being inspected during every moment of their lives the plan upon which it was his intention to erect this building may be seen in a paper annexed to the proposal and entitled outline of the plan of construction alluded to in the above proposal and models of a penitentiary house as therein described were exhibited to many persons in mr benthams own house before his proposals were accepted but no plan or form of building is referred to in the articles of agreement and mr bentham states himself to be at liberty under it to place what number of convicts or prisoners he may think fit in the same cell and to make them sleep and work in the same apartments which statement appears to your committee to be correct there being no restriction or direction relative to those points to be found in the articles by the agreement mr bentham is to build within one year after he shall get possession of the ground mentioned therein fit accommodation for  000 male convicts or prisoners certain sums of money being to be paid to him for that purpose by instalments and he is afterwards to make provision for the reception of supernumeraries if required upon certain terms the contract being to continue during the lives of mr bentham and his brother general samuel bentham the building and the stock and effects used therewith are to be valued on the decease of the survivor of them and a deduction being made of the sum of money originally advanced by government the remainder of the estimated value is to be paid to the representatives of such survivor the management of the prisoners is to be vested in mr bentham or in any fit person or persons to be named by him from time to time during his life to exercise the authority and receive the benefits derivable under the contract with the appointment of governor and with such powers as his majesty is enabled to grant under the   th geo iii the act to which the   th of the king refers upon that head as has been already stated and in the event of mr bentham dying in the lifetime of his brother general samuel bentham the same office and powers are to be exercised and the benefit thereof enjoyed by the said samuel bentham or some person or persons to be named by him during his natural life the contractor is to receive a certain allowance for the care and maintenance of each prisoner and is to be annually paid for  000 at least though the persons committed to his charge should not amount to that number he is also to retain for himself threefourths of the profit upon their labour the remainder being appropriated to their own use payable in part to them immediately and in part convertible on the expiration of their respective terms of imprisonment into annuities for their future benefit the contractor undertakes on his side to feed and clothe the prisoners supplying them daily with wholesome sustenance composed of bread and meat and other articles commonly used for human food and with one suit of clothes yearly as well as with a clean shirt twice aweek he is also to furnish each a separate bed and bedding of sufficient warmth with clean sheets or blankets once amonth and he engages that all possible attention shall be paid to the cleanliness of the prisoners in every respect as far as circumstances will permit that the penitentiary house and buildings belonging thereto shall be sufficiently warmed and lighted and that every proper precaution shall be taken to prevent the same from becoming infectious or unwholesome to preserve the prisoners in good health he further engages to provide at his own expense a clergyman of the church of england to live on the spot a surgeon and a sufficient number of competent schoolmasters by whom instruction shall be administered on every sunday at least in reading writing and arithmetic to such of the prisoners as shall stand in need of it subject to these stipulations every arrangement in regard to the treatment of the prisoners as well as the determination of the manner in which they should be employed of the hours of the day or night in which they should labour and of the classes or numbers which should either work together or associate at their meals or times of exercise or recreation is entirely left at the discretion or will of the contractor while every officer and servant connected with the establishment is to be placed there by his appointment and removable at his pleasure the system of management here described appears to your committee to have been framed with reference rather to the personal character of the party in whose custody the prisoners were on the first instance to be placed   0 and to the favourable opinion entertained of the construction of the building proposed by him than to the principles upon which prisons have hitherto been conducted in this country your committee are satisfied that mr bentham would enter upon the undertaking to which his contract relates with the best intentions but the prosecution of that measure together with the benefits derivable under the contract might by the terms of the agreement pass at any time into other hands and even if that were not the case the arrangement above stated is too exceptionable on general grounds in the judgment of your committee to be adopted from confidence in an individual under the   d geo iii c    sect   which prohibits the governor or keeper of a house of correction from having any advantage from the sale of any article used in the house there is a security for the goodness of the provisions and necessaries sent in on account of the public for the use of the prisoners arising from the circumstance of their passing under the eye of the governor and his servants who have no interest in concealing their defects while the governor is not exposed to any temptation to sanction the introduction of any improper degree of luxury into the prison with a view to his own profit or of demanding an undue price for such articles as may properly be admitted there mr benthams contract contains no provision upon these points if however this objection could be removed by additional articles in the agreement by the establishment of a fixed table of diet and by the appointment of resident inspectors the public could have no reasonable assurance that sufficient attention would be paid to the religious instruction and moral improvement of the prisoners under a system of management every part of which is to be formed and directed by a person whose interest it must be that the prisoners committed to his charge should do as much work as they were competent to execute and that their labour should be exercised in the manner by which most profit would be produced if the chaplain should suggest that individuals very profitably employed in the same workshop were unfit from their characters or other circumstances to associate with each other or that any practice in the prison which might be convenient in a manufactory operated to retard rather than to accelerate the progress of moral improvement it cannot be supposed that such intimations would be heard with as ready an acquiescence and would meet with the same encouragement when addressed to a governor whose profits they were calculated to diminish as if they were communicated to persons having no interest in the produce of the prisoners labour your committee see much reason to apprehend that under a system in which pecuniary advantage is thus made the most prominent object of attention the experiment of reformation would not be fairly tried an answer has been supposed to be furnished to this objection by an article in the agreement binding the contractor to make compensation for losses occasioned by the future felonies of every person who may have been confined in the penitentiary house to an amount varying from £  to £   for the felonies of the same individual according to the length of the period during which the offender shall have been under his care which provision is argued upon as giving a sufficient interest to the governor in the reformation of every prisoner your committee however attach very little importance to this article and it is the more nugatory as although its operation must continue during the lives of all those who shall come under the care of the contractor no funds whatever are provided in the contract or are now proposed to answer the contingent payments to become due after the contractors death reliance has also been placed on a provision of the same kind operating in the nature of a pecuniary penalty for the preservation of the health of the prisoners it being agreed in the   th article of the contract that the contractor should insure the lives of the persons confined on such terms that if more than a certain number shall die within the year he would be a loser instead of a gainer by the insurance your committee observe that in their opinion the health of the prisoners will be more effectually guarded by the exercise of the judgment of a professional man not dependent upon the governor and acting under the direction of other disinterested persons than by the payment of any sum of money to fall on the governor in the case of the prisoners actually dying within the walls of the prison during his confinement it appears to the committee that the proposed system affords no sufficient protection to the prisoner upon any point in a place of confinement in which the prisoners are compelled to work and expected to be reformed something of a more strict discipline may be looked for than in ordinary prisons it is therefore more particularly requisite that in a penitentiary house opportunities of complaint should be frequent and redress near at hand the most obvious channel of complaint if the governor be concerned in the supposed injury is the chaplain within whose province it lies as on the one hand to endeavour to reconcile the mind of the offender to the lot which he has brought upon himself by his misconduct so on the other to prevent its severity from being aggravated by any hardships or privations which the law did not intend to impose the surgeon is another person through whom the prisoner may properly complain but to make these officers of real use in this     particular they must occasionally confer with the prisoner without the presence of the governor or his servants they must neither be under strong obligations to the governor or subject to his power and they must be in habits of communicating with persons armed with sufficient authority to punish or redress the grievances laid before them the committee to be appointed under the   th geo iii had full powers at all times for this purpose and they or any two of them were to examine into the state of the penitentiary house at least once in every fortnight and to see every offender confined there and not disabled by sickness in the contract no provision whatever is made for personal inspection but the governor is to present a comprehensive report in writing of the whole state of the establishment to the court of kings bench on the first day of every term and he is to answer upon oath if required all questions put to him by the judges of that court or by any one judge thereof in vacation time or by any officer of the crown or by any other person with the leave of the said court or of any one judge thereof and he is further to surrender his office of governor if ordered by the said court on proof duly obtained as above or otherwise of misbehaviour in the execution of the said office the insufficiency of this article the only one in the agreement that concerns the superintendence of the establishment to provide for the redress of grievances or the correction of any improper practice which may prevail there is so evident that it cannot be necessary for your committee to enlarge upon this point it is obvious that circumstances must frequently occur in a prison which call for the interposition of higher authorities to censure or control the keeper without constituting such instances of misbehaviour as would justify the avoidance of a beneficial contract to occasions in which an erroneous or indiscreet mode of treating the prisoners should be pursued from want of judgment in the contractor or from any cause not falling under the description of misbehaviour the proposed remedy by the authority of the kings bench appears to be totally inapplicable and in the cases in which it does apply it could only be attained in term time while the court which is to make the order is sitting mr bentham supposes as may be seen in his evidence that sufficient inspection and opportunities enough of making complaints on the part of the prisoners might be afforded by the admission of the public at all reasonable times into the inspection room in the middle of the building from whence all the cells would be visible and which would be accessible to the voice of every prisoner by means of tubes to be constructed for that purpose and he seems to lay some stress on the vigilance which the newspapers are to exert in watching his conduct but your committee agreeing with mr bentham in the belief that curiosity would bring many persons to view a penitentiary house of so novel a construction do not concur in the supposition that any intercourse of the description alluded to between such visiters and the prisoners can supersede the necessity of having persons nominated expressly for the inspection and superintendence of every part of an establishment of that nature in whom the powers of obtaining information in regard to any mismanagement shall be accompanied by sufficient authority for its correction while your committee state their opinion of the inexpediency of carrying into execution a contract of the description above stated they feel themselves called upon to bring under the notice of the house the strong equitable claims which mr bentham possesses to compensation in consequence of the contract not having taken effect your committee have not gone into a detailed examination of the various circumstances connected with that subject as an inquiry of that nature might have occasioned an inconvenient delay in their reporting upon the more important matters referred to them but mr bentham has stated that he was encouraged by his majestys government to take measures preparatory to the erection of the intended establishment that he has employed much time and has expended a large sum of money in addition to the £ 000 advanced to him in      as mentioned above in preparations for the execution of his part of the agreement and that its nonperformance was not owing to any default or backwardness on his side he has therefore under these circumstances a just right to expect not only that the money so laid out should be repaid but that a liberal remuneration should be made to him for his trouble and ultimate disappointment he on his part accounting for any advantage that shall have accrued to him from the lands of which he has been stated to be in possession as feoffee and your committee recommend that measures should be taken for the settlement of these claims without delay the second report of the committee as it chiefly consists of a communication from bentham follows at full length— second report from the committee on the laws relating to penitentiary houses—ordered by the house of commons to be printed  0th june      the committee appointed to consider of the expediency of erecting a penitentiary house or penitentiary houses under the acts of the   th and   th of his present majesty and in case the adoption of the measure now referred to their consideration     should appear to them to be for the advantage of the public to report whether any additional legislative provisions will be wanted for that purpose and what number of persons such penitentiary house or penitentiary houses should in their judgment be calculated to receive together with any observations which they may deem material upon the subject of their inquiry—and who were instructed to inquire into the effects which have been produced by the punishment of transportation to new south wales and of imprisonment on board the hulks and were empowered to report their observations and opinion thereupon from time to time to the house—have further considered the matters to them referred and agreed upon the following report— your committee having received the following letter from jeremy bentham esq since their former report was made to the house have thought it their duty to submit the same to the consideration of the house although the observations therein contained have not made any difference in their opinion upon the matters referred to them  0th june      jeremy bentham  th may      westminster corrected copy received  0th june      dated queens square place westminster  th may      sir— understanding at different times from different gentlemen members of the committee that in calling me before them the object of the committee has been—not merely to scrutinize into the contract to which i am a party but also for the purpose of forming their judgment concerning the most eligible mode of disposing of such part of the convict population of the country as it may not be thought fit to confine in hulks or employ in colonizing to collect any such information as in any shape i might be found capable of affording—i take the liberty of submitting in this mode to your consideration and that of the committee a few suggestions on the subject of the country convicts for such of the convicts whose conviction shall have taken place in london or middlesex with or without the addition of a few other counties nearly contiguous to the metropolis such as those for instance which are comprised in the homecircuit the provision made by the existing contract may it seems to be supposed suffice on this supposition what in some mode or other of the penitentiary plan remains to be provided for is—that as yet indefinite part of the convict population which may be expected to be furnished by the more or less distant counties—say for example the five remaining circuits for this large remnant of that population the question then is—what is the best mode to this question the answer presents three options—   panopticons in the metropolis over and above the one supposed to be determined upon viz in number one at least and as many more if any as the number of convicts to be provided for shall be deemed to require   panopticons upon an equal scale and consequently in equal number in the country these two plans belong alike to what for distinctions sake i would beg leave to call the open mode upon a large scale   penitentiary houses in the existing mode one in and for each county or in such cases in which the convict population afforded by a single county would be manifestly too small one in each aggregate of contiguous counties to be associated together for the purpose this last mode i would beg leave to distinguish by the appellation of the close mode upon a small scale as to the question between the open mode upon a large scale—viz the panopticon mode upon the panopticon scale and the close mode upon a small scale—my opinion has been already submitted and not my opinion only but the considerations or the ground on which it was formed     management in every imaginable point better expense less in these few words all those considerations will be found comprised on the question between panopticons all in the metropolis and panopticons one in the metropolis and others in the country in each case in the open mode upon the large scale neither are the points of distinction so manifest nor the importance of them so great on the whole however the result of my inquiry is—that panopticons all in the metropolis present a decided title to preference what presents itself to me as the principal reason is that the metropolis affords beyond comparison the best public here whatsoever matter proper for consideration comes into existence is with the minimum of trouble brought instantaneously to the ear laid open even to the inspection of the eye of the whole body of constituted authorities of the members of the administration of the immediately superintending judicial authority of every member of the legislature not that objections are altogether wanting but neither from report nor from imagination have i been able to collect any the united force of which seems sufficient to constitute a preponderant one   danger to the metropolis from forcible and general eruption increased   inordinate accumulation of convicts for whom provision may be to be made after discharge   remoteness of the convicts from their respective desired abodes at the time of their discharge   inordinate expense of conveying the convicts from the place of conviction to the place of punishment   supposed unsuitableness of the fund upon which on this plan the expense of maintenance with or without the expense of conveyance would be to be charged these are all the objections which i have been able to discover and to these i proceed to submit such answers as the nature of the case has suggested i objection   danger of general and forcible eruption answer in my own particular opinion it will readily enough be conceived considering the peculiar guards which the peculiarities of the panopticon plan provide this danger cannot appear very considerable in either case but if it be considerable the metropolis is the spot in which it should naturally appear much less considerable than in any other place in any other town or towns at least to which otherwise this part of the convict population would be to be consigned millbank and tothill fields being by the supposition the spot fixed upon already for one panopticon i see not what should hinder its being made to receive as many others as can be required within a few hundred yards of tothill fields is constantly stationed a body of regular troops to the amount of some thousands the distance so small that in case of commotion communication might be made by signals of both sorts signals not only to the ear but even to the eye if an apparatus to that effect were thought fit to be provided in tothill fields at one end of rochester row stands and has stood for i think it is about eight or ten years a military infirmary in which is constantly stationed a military guard consisting as i have just been informed on the spot of nine soldiers on one side the waste called tothill fields has for its boundary this rochester row on the opposite side the parcel of ground already purchased for the panopticon penitentiary house on no part of this ground is there any building but what may at present be actually seen from the infirmary just mentioned and by the guard there stationed on a subject so plain i should never have thought of troubling the committee with so many words but for the recollection that some eighteen or nineteen years ago at the commencement of my negotiations to an observation of mine pointing to the military force in the park as an obvious source of security the answer returned by a gentleman then in office was an inexorable negative what the objections were i     inquired in vain with the gentleman himself they did not originate be they what they may they would now be found i should hope no longer in existence if the panopticon contained within its lodge an acting magistrate this military guard being actually in his view would on any such occasion as that in question be actually under his command i mean by commonlaw to which no order from any waroffice would i presume be opposed by the constant sight of a similar guard stationed if thought necessary close to the spot for example three or four at the entrance into the panopticon ground through the walled avenue that leads to the house—two or three at each of the two elevated watchhouses which command each of them by night as well as by day the inside as well as the outside of two of the four surrounding walls—by the constant sight of this small guard coupled with the knowledge of the arrangements that might so easily be made for instantaneous communication with the great body stationed in the neighbouring park it would be extraordinary indeed if in the imagination of the most refractory prisoner all chance of success in any such attempt would not be rendered hopeless—manifestly as well as constantly hopeless further observations on this head may be seen in panopticon postscript part   sect    pp from  0  to  0  works vol iv p      against every danger of this sort such are the means of security afforded by the metropolis in general but in a more particular degree by the particular spot in question in any of the provincial situations what security comparable to this could be afforded and that too as in this case without any special allotment of military force for this particular purpose true it is that spite of military guards french and other prisoners of war have from time to time and but too often and in too great numbers contrived to make their escape but against the escape of convict prisoners the panopticon plan presents securities in abundance few of which if any would i believe be found employed on any existing plan in the case of foreign prisoners   uniform conspicuously distinctive   close dress in which the concealment of any weapon suited to the purpose of offence or defence would be impracticable   mark by which on the mere baring the habitually covered arm the other being habitually uncovered the condition of the person in question viz the fact of his being a person belonging in the character of a prisoner to the prison in question would for weeks at least after escape be manifested   constant division of the prisoners into small and those assorted companies   the prisoners rendered distinguishable at a distance each of them by a number marked upon his clothing at the back and at the breast   no outlet for the prisoners into the enclosed area but through a passage commanded by a guard and so narrow that no more than one can make his exit at a time nor then but under a horizontal bar so stationed as by obliging each person to stoop to render impossible any acquisition of conjunct force by running   light kept constantly thrown by night as well as by day not only upon every spot to which the prisoners have access within the prison but upon the whole surface of the four surrounding walls   for the purpose of inspection eyes in considerable numbers constantly availing themselves of that light viz some in the centre as well as other parts of the circularly polygonal building within the walls others stationed in the commanding watchhouses above mentioned on the outside of and in part above those walls   on the top of the walls all round a range of spikes iron or wooden of such slightness that in the attempt to set a ladder against them or throw a rope over them to get up by they would give way and break and in either case strike against a range of wires by which a number of bells would be set aringing      0 a conversationtube from the central lodge to each of the exterior guardhouses    on the outside of each of the surrounding walls a ditch the water of which would on any attempt to undermine the contiguous wall inundate the miners and while it betrayed their operations render an exit if not absolutely impracticable at least impracticable without such noise as would give abundant warning to the guardhouse    to each such guardhouse a dog or dogs of the sort of those which in the night are set abarking by any the least noise in the eyes of the committee the enumeration of these several resources may be perhaps the more pardonable if they should appear any of them capable of being applied with advantage to the giving additional security to those modes of confinement of which in the present state of things the inefficiency has so frequently been seen to betray itself to such of the convicts as it might be thought fit to give employment to in the panopticon ground at large and thence without the limits of the enclosed area true it is that no more than a part of the above securities nor that the most considerable part would be found applicable but considering that the time of daylight would be the only time at which the demand or use for any such employment would present itself considering that in fact on the many public works on which convicts have now for so many years been employed they have been employed in large numbers and as supposed without any particular means of selection or anxiety on that head and that too under slight guard and yet at those times at least without any instances i believe of escape considering that the passion by which a prisoner is prompted to seek by violent means and at the hazard of his life a relief from durance is not likely to be found in equal strength in the breast of every individual member of a society so numerous and so miscellaneous the members of which may with less danger of injustice than anywhere else be rendered responsible for each other considering that in the mode of treatment which is essential to a system of commercial operation conducted upon the plan in question there is nothing that seems to present a probability of its being productive of any exertion more violent and desperate than in the case of a prison upon any of the ordinary plans all these things considered the conclusion may it is hoped be that in a case where by any failure of human prudence the party failing would as in the present case be in so many shapes and in so high a degree a sufferer that same human prudence on which in spite of all possible securities of every other kind reliance must in every case be placed is not in the present case to be considered as destitute of all claim to that sort and degree of confidence which is so unavoidably bestowed upon it in all other cases to make use of every one of these securities at all events and under all circumstances without any exception in any case is more than i see any necessity of pledging myself for nor yet do they constitute a complete list of all the securities to which it might eventually happen to me to have recourse many of them will be attended with an expense which if incurred without necessity would be so much waste but for which the justification as well on the score of necessity as of good economy will be the more complete the larger the scale is on which the establishment is conducted the faculty by which these securities were devised will not i presume be considered as putting an exclusion upon the kindred faculty by which the decision on the question how many and which of them to employ will from time to time be to be pronounced i proceed with the objections ii objection  d inordinate accumulation of convicts for whom provision may be to be made after discharge answer upon the panopticon plan there will be the subsidiary establishment open to as many as may choose to take the benefit of it some will     some will not but whatever may be the proportion of the one number to the other and whatever may be the sum of the two numbers the exclusive choice of the metropolis does not to my apprehension present itself in the shape of an inconvenience in the character of a reservoir for the influx in question the option lies between the metropolis and some country town some other town within the circuits of south britain the metropolis will it is true already have to provide for the influx from its own panopticon but taking into the account the magnitude of the influx in both cases compare the magnitude of the mass of population into which the influx will have to discharge itself in this case say in round numbers a million with the magnitude of the largest mass into which it can be set to discharge itself in the case of any other such town say  0000 by this comparison all apprehension on this score will it should seem be dissipated iii objection  d remoteness of the convicts from their respective desired abodes at the time of their discharge answer   merely for the purpose of facilitating on the part of the prisoners after their discharge the return to their places of birth or subsequent settlement in the open mode on the large scale it would hardly i presume be deemed worth while so much as to build one additional panopticon as above much less as in the close mode upon the small scale to establish in each county or set of associated counties a penitentiary house or improved prison on any other plan or plans on this occasion the object ultimately and intrinsically aimed at would be i suppose not the birthplace of each person nor yet his place of last settlement as such but the place wherever it were of his choice but take either of those places of presumed preference the stain upon his character considered it might not less probably be the spot that of all others he would be the most averse than that which he would be most desirous to fix upon for his residence   the subsidiary establishment which under the panopticon plan the governor would stand bound to provide for the purpose of making provision for all such as chose to accept of it has for its basis the supposed nonexistence of any such place of former abode or the unwillingness to fix in it and the least that this provision does is to remove from the ground of necessity to that of mere inclination the demand for means of conveyance to any other spot   whatsoever be in preference to employment in the abovementioned subsidiary establishment the object of each mans desire that portion of the earnings of his whole term which by the contract is secured to him must be small indeed if it does not afford him ample means of gratifying such desire   if after all it were deemed necessary that to each such discharged convict means of conveyance to the place of his choice whatever it be should be afforded at the public charge a mode beyond comparison less expensive than providing though it were no more than a single prison in this sole view would be the putting into his pocket a sum of money under the expectation of its being applied to this purpose but as the ascertaining upon any satisfactory evidence the spot really desired would be plainly impossible the spot assumed could be no other than the spot most distant from the penitentiary house in question for as that most distant spot is the spot that would command most money that would of course be the declared spot of each mans choice but even this maximum—meaning the annual sum of all these maximums—would be a trifle in comparison of the expense of an additional prison to be built and kept up on purpose as to conveyance the means of locomotion derived by each man from the bounty of nature would for this purpose be i presume regarded as sufficient of the maximum in question the expense would therefore be neither more nor less than the supposed necessary expense of subsistence during a journey begun continued and ended in the pedestrian mode     iv objection  th inordinate expense of conveying the convicts from the place of conviction to the place of punishment answer supposing the convicts to be conveyed from the several assize and quarter session towns to the metropolis the expense it must be acknowledged could not but be greater than it would be upon the supposition of a plurality of panopticons of which the number being determined by the largeness of the scale the situations should be exclusively adapted to this one purpose say one allotted to each of the three points of the compass—east north and west but—   suppose that in addition to the one london panopticon only two such country receptacles were required—place these two in any two of the three abovementioned points of the compass to the exclusion of the third—in the east and north only—or in the east and west only—or in the west and north only—it seems questionable whether any such saving as supposed even to any the minutest amount would really take place   even supposing each of those three points of the compass to have its panopticon and thence in respect of length of journeys and magnitude of travelling expenses a corresponding saving produced the advantage produced on this score would on calculation be found i am inclined to think so small as to go but a very little way towards counteracting the disadvantage already indicated as having place on the more important score above mentioned being as to a more or less considerable portion of it unavoidable we have here an expense which as to so much cannot be saved but that which may be done and in point of justice it should seem ought to be done is to equalize it—to equalize it i mean in such sort that upon a county the assize or quartersession town of which is more distant than that of another county from the place of permanent confinement man for man the burthen of conveyance may not on that account be rendered or left to be the heavier in its pressure on the firstmentioned county viz in the proportion of the distance now as to the mode of equalization on the contract plan whosoever carries on the management of that panopticon receptacle which is the common reservoir for the convicts of all the several counties in question in his contract it might be made a condition that for a sum certain he should take upon him the conveyance of the convicts from all the several assize towns and quartersession towns in the district—for which purpose an average would of course be taken viz by taking the sum of the distances and dividing it by the number of the towns—charge of conveyance so much per mile v objection  th supposed unsuitableness of the fund upon which on this plan the expense of maintenance with or without the expense of conveyance would be to be charged to this objection two answers present themselves i that for the expense in question the fund in question is not an unsuitable one but on the contrary a more suitable one than the fund upon which it would in the other case be charged ii that supposing the rival fund a more suitable one there would be no difficulty in transferring the expense to that rival fund i first then the proposed fund is not an unsuitable one   the proposed is the common national fund it is the same fund on which the expense is charged in the instance of all that portion of the convict population which is sent to colonize it is the same fund on which the expense is charged in the instance of all that portion of the same population which is consigned to the hulks if as yet of that portion which has hitherto been consigned to prisons—to improved or not improved prisons—the expense has hitherto been charged on the counties that is on the contributors to the poor rates the disposition thus made had i should suppose for its cause—not any such opinion as that the poor rates constituted a fund more suitable than the national fund but     merely this circumstance viz that the poor rates of each county constituted the only fund out of which it was possible to obtain money for defraying the expense of the sort of prison in question—viz a prison situate within the county and appropriated to the use of that county to the exclusion of every other part of the kingdom to save the trouble and responsibility of making provision at the charge of the national fund for an expenditure to a certain amount a public man would hardly i should suppose be desirous of imposing upon this or that class of his fellowsubjects such as the contributors to the poor rates an expense for example of double that amount but my calculation as well as my expectations will have greatly indeed deceived me should the difference in point of expense between the open mode upon a large scale and the close mode upon a small scale turn out to be as little as to the amount of two to one to the disadvantage of the small scale in the case of poorhouses in the tract entitled pauper management improved c published in youngs annals of agriculture in p    works vol viii p     may be seen a calculation made by a professional and official hand in which under the head of construction for a system of poorhouses on that small scale which then was and actually is in practice in the suffolk poorhouses the expense for all england being £ 0     0 money of that time the expense of the centralinspection plan on the scale of  000 inhabitants to a house is stated at no more than £    000 considerably less than a fourth part—amount of saving       0—and upon the official establishment an annually recurring expense the amount of the annual saving is therein stated at £ 0      s—ditto multiplied by  0 to bring it like the other expense to principal money        —number of persons maintained in each such supposed panopticon poorhouse  000 being the exact number of the persons for whom in the character of prisoners above eleven years ago viz on the   th of march   00 as stated in a former letter of mine now lying before the committee i was ordered to prepare this is the case of poorhouses and both being on the panopticon plan so far as concerns the influence of magnitude of scale upon expense no difference will be found between the case of poorhouses and the case of prisons ii but secondly supposing the determination should be taken to charge on the poorrate fund this third part of that general head of expense the convict expense of which the two other thirds are charged on the national fund on this supposition the transference might without difficulty be made the average numbers of the convicts which for a certain number of years back the several counties have respectively been in the habit of furnishing being taken those numbers would serve for expressing the relative sums with which each such county might annually be charged towards the expense of the common panopticon or panopticons the station of which is supposed to be in the metropolis i mean the panopticons serving in common for the maintenance of the aggregate body of the convicts receivable from those several counties but any such number as  000 would it not i hear it asked be an unwieldy number too unwieldy for good management oh yes on every ordinary plan too unwieldy by a great deal nine hundred was the number of the prisoners that on the original and supposed highlyfinished penitentiary plan as per    g   c    were to have been confined in the town that was to have been built for that purpose at battersea rise and as to houses nine hundred being the number of separate houses which over and above such as were to be occupied in common were to have been included in that town was assuredly too great a number for good management two thousand consequently in a much greater degree too great on every as yet exemplified plan of construction and management the natural and naturally prevalent apprehension     of unwieldiness has therefore very just grounds to stand upon but upon the panopticon principle whether it be for paupers or for convicts for free and innocent men or for prisoners though the number of the inhabitants be  000 the house is but one and that one house is capable of being pervaded in all directions pervaded by a single glance and without so much as a change of posture of the difficulties which upon any ordinary plan of construction for want of that source of simplification attends the business of management even in the case of a poorhouse and of a moderate size an exemplification may be seen in pauper management improved p    works vol viii p     in panopticon letter vi and in various parts of the postscript and in the case of a prison in the instance of several american prisons in the tract intituled panopticon versus new south wales letter ii pages from    to    works vol iv p      0—i have the honour to be c jeremy bentham george holford esq chairman of the committee on penitentiary houses in a communication addressed to a noble lord—probably lord sidmouth—bentham combated the arguments of the committee from an impression of the letter made by a copying machine i extract the following passages omitting a portion of the argument addressed to the private ear and understanding of the recipient of the letter and bearing on a view of the arrangements which is supposed to have influenced the committee in their decision but is not referred to in the substance of their report— objections to the making experiment of mr benthams panopticon plan obviated—viz partly by answers partly by fresh offers objection i—you will overwork them it has been said—you will underfeed them those by the underfeeding of whom there is anything to be gained—you will overfeed them those by the overfeeding of whom there is anything to be gained—you will pamper them with luxuries—you will work them so that you will not leave time for their receiving any sufficient religious and moral instruction answer  —no tolerably intelligent man howsoever selfishly disposed would do so in my place this is what i had pleased myself with the thoughts of having made tolerably clear and used to be considered as having done so—viz in and by the panopticon book here with submitted to your lordship part ii sect   entituled management why by contract from which place honourable gentlemen have taken all their objections forgetting to say anything about the answers answer  —as to underfeeding them by terms of the contract i stand bound to give to each man as much as he can eat as to luxuries i really do not understand what it is that can so it be paid for be stated as a pernicious luxury unless it be fermented liquors which by the contract at my own solicitation i stand precluded from giving admittance to and with such securities against contravention as had never before been so much as imagined offer—but if any honourable gentleman in whose view of the matter an index expurgatorius of meats and drinks would in the situation in question be an article seriously subservient either to religion or morality will be pleased to frame one and obtain the requisite orders i am ready to pledge myself for its being inviolably observed answer  —as to the neglecting their religious and moral instruction i should forfeit all my pledges i should incur reproach by such neglect and i could never get anything by it for i could not work them on a sunday without a positive breach of the law of the land such as to persons in abundance besides the prisoners themselves could not but be of the utmost notoriety answer  —i would humbly entreat your lordships perusal for at least that   0 section together with the antecedent one entituled leading positions the rather as being applicable to poorhouse as well as prisoner management answer  —may brother and i had a favourite sunday plan for the combining religions edification with public inspection and the most perfect and universal facility of complaint and the architectural design was in a most striking manner adapted to it as shown in the models which were seen by members of the upper house by dozens and by those of the lower house by scores ere i could have suffered that feature of the management to fall into neglect my character must have been completely forfeited offer  —answer  —taking an unknown—taking an average man were i to give it as my opinion that he would conduct the business as much for the advantage either of the public or the prisoner for a salary or without any pecuniary remuneration as upon the terms of the contract proposed by me i should utter a gross untruth but after the perusal of these two sections should this matter present itself to your lordships mind in a different light to cut up all such objections by the roots there shall be an end of the contract i would conduct the management on account of the public purse without a farthingsworth of pecuniary profit in any shape direct or indirect—keeping and regularly delivering in accounts upon the plan indicated in my work intituled pauper management herewith submitted with any additions or other amendments that may be prescribed to me objection ii—under your contract you were to have had no fewer than  000 prisoners all worked under your direction and for your advantage this is too great a power to be trusted in any individual hand answer  —it is no greater nor other power than what by the law of the land every master has over his apprentice as to the number so far from being increased the power as to all purposes of abuse is lessened by it except his own particular relatives or other friends when he is fortunate enough to have any an apprentice has no person engaged by any special tie or interest to look to him with a protecting eye my prisoners would by the common and most obvious tie of interest as well as bond of sympathy stand engaged to afford to one another this as well as whatsoever other assistance could be afforded against oppression in every shape at the hands of the common master and as to persons without doors each would accordingly have so many friends in the friends of every other answer  —in so far as concerns sinister profit this objection would together with the preceding ones be cut up by the roots by the giving up of the contracts as above answer  —independently of all consideration of sinister profit and danger of abuse on that score can it be that the magnitude of the power merely in respect of the number of persons subjected to it is considered as being so great as to constitute of itself an objection and that a peremptory one a colonel of a regiment has as much or more answer  —if numbers being the same this objection taken from a supposed excess of power were conclusive against the panopticon plan how much more ought it to be against the new proposed nonpanopticon plan under the panopticon plan behold the management in the hand of an unseated unofficed unconnected insulated individual whose blameless life known to have been for little less than halfacentury devoted to a course of unpaid yet unremitted howsoever fruitless toil in the service of mankind has not been able to preserve his rights from being an object of neglect and himself an object of silent oppression to every administration for these last eighteen years under the nonpanopticon plan the management in the hands of a detachment of the ministry rendering no account but to their assured protectors—the body from which they have been detached who is there who does not     know or will think it worth while to affect not to know that in all these cases the whole power is in the hands of some one individual in whom the confidence is reposed and those of an assortment of colleagues who to each other are a tower of defence the use in this respect is by dividing and by dividing and dissipating the responsibility to increase that power which in demonstration they are employed to reduce what is very true is that if the prison were a den of devils so that no mischief that were done in it for the benefit of the tyrant could be known the security afforded by his being liable to be dismissed for it if known could not be very effective but that this should be urged as an objection against the only plan which ever had for its declared object the maximum of publicity and in proof of the superior wisdom of a plan in which neither in that nor indeed in any degree publicity is so much as professed seems not very consistent in the one case one tyrant devil working in impenetrable darkness in the other a company of guardian angels—such is the supposition on which though not declared everything in the nonpanopticon plan is all along grounded objection iii—you may profess to desire inspection and to court gratuitous inspectors but in these professions of yours either you are not sincere or if you are you will not long be so and though you should be ever so much so you might as well be otherwise for nobody will come answer  —on this head at least as to my sincerity present and future probable after what i have said in my panopticon book to compare minute with great obscure with illustrious with submission it would be less unreasonable to impute to your lordship a desire to see protestantism extirpated and catholicism towering in its place than to impute to me the possibility of harbouring any such idea as that of shrinking from inspection your lordship has not professed any such invention as that of an engine for the universalising of protestantism in the christian world my brother and i have for these twenty years and more professed to have invented an engine for the universalising of inspection in a penitentiary house answer   offer  —true it is that if in numbers sufficient for the purpose after all that were done to invite them people would not come—let this be supposed all my sincerity and all the exertions of which it can be productive would be to no purpose well then my lord if my schemes for making people come should all fail insomuch that after all people do not come—in short if in the opinion of the appropriate judges say the king in council although no abuse actually appears yet for anything that appears to the contrary there may have been abuse—then under this case let the experiment howsoever free from blame on any part be pronounced to have failed and on that ground let me be dismissed and if such be the pleasure of the said judges let my said supposed inspection plan be put aside and for remedy let the plan in which general inspection is not aimed at or so much as professed be set up in its stead objection iv—well sir if you please you yourself shall be a wellmeaning man and not only for a moment but as long as you live and for the purpose of the argument even under so corruptive a plan as yours is an honest manager all this will not make your plan a good one you live to commence and for a time carry on the management be it so sooner or later however there is an end of you and then whatsoever be the security afforded by your personal character there is an end of it answer  —if before the building is finished i die there is my brother on whose plan if for me and in my lifetime it will be built if before that time he dies also there are others in this town under whose direction a building on this same plan was lately completed viz at petersburg and the management of a correspondent establishment conducted and to whom the advantages of it are accordingly well known by experience     nor for the management would there be any want of persons to whom the principles of management detailed in the panopticon book and in the book entitled pauper management herewith submitted are already familiar and who are perfectly competent to the purpose of applying them to practice answer  —if for a moment any such supposition be endurable as that in my management there can be anything worth copying and preserving the nature of the case affords as good a security as can be reasonably desired for its being accordingly copied and preserved yes my lord if i am what i ought to be such as i am such will my successors be my rules my practice according to these rules will be public public as i and the press and open doors can make them being public what there is good in them will be as so many laws to my successors or if they are not so the fault will lie not in me and my successors but in your lordship and your successors whenever to any successor of mine it happens to swerve from these by the supposition good laws out with him true it is that by wearing out so many years as have been worn out of a life of which four and sixty are already past honourable gentlemen have given to this argument of theirs a degree of force as well as to some other of their arguments and expedients beyond what i could have wished and seconded by such treatment as it has been my lot to experience at their hands and to which unless stayed by the intrepidity of your lordships justice this last measure will have given the crowning stroke the chances of life and death were certainly in favour of the plan so perseveringly pursued for ridding the powers of highseated darkness of the incumbrance for already as may be seen by the calculation printed in report   th of the finance committee of       it has been my lot to live several years more than according to the tables i ought to have lived yet still considering the counterconsideration above submitted this argument will not i hope be found to have so far accomplished its purpose as to be in your lordships account a conclusive one offer  —on the nonpanopticon plan what the space is that is deemed requisite for the  00 prisoners i do not know on the panopticon plan in case of necessity i could make less than half what there is serve for the experiment on that supposition should there be also a sufficiency for the nonpanopticon system the two could be carried on together here then if the honour of honourable gentlemen could be reconciled to the idea the benefit of competition and emulation a benefit to which in some cases for example that of the highest courts of ordinary justice no small value has been ascribed might be given to the service for my own part in so far as all consideration of the public and the prisoners being put out of the question i myself am alone concerned were i to choose my competitors i know not of any whom i would more gladly choose than the honourable gentlemen with whose company in that quality i should in that case be likely to be honoured their desire to be rid of me can scarce be stronger than mine would be to possess in that shape the benefit of their assistance and though my general character were as noted for insincerity as it may perhaps be for the opposite failing in the present instance my sincerity would be put sufficiently out of dispute by the observations which in case of necessity i should have to make on their report and the plan of management which it has served to introduce by the act founded on the report of the committee see above p  0  the compensation to bentham was to be fixed by two arbiters the one chosen by the treasury the other by bentham on this subject i find the following from jeremy bentham   th november      samuel romilly bentham to romilly q s p   th november      dear romilly— nobody can be more fully or feelingly sensible to anything     than i am to the regard for justice manifested by mr vansittart throughout the whole course of this business justice i call it—favour i will not call it for that would not be to do justice either to his probity or his discernment what he i perceive is as fully sensible of as myself is—that if by a chancellor of the exchequer without concert with the individual the arbitrator to act in a case such as that in question for the public were to be chosen arbitration and compensation might in that case be converted into a mere form since by an arbitrator of his choice nothing could be easier than for a minister in his situation so to order matters that of the enacted compensation not a halfpenny would ever find its way into the individuals pocket as to any person to whom the nature and history of the panopticon plan from the time when it first found acceptance and so on through the revolutions it was destined to experience were not more or less known—you seemed as fully sensible as myself how ill qualified in comparison of one to whom those things were thus known a person so circumstanced would be to form any tolerably wellgrounded award as to mr rose in addition to a great part of the knowledge i had had of the business he could not have but had knowledge of a great deal of secret history of some part of it i received from him some obscure intimations at the time which it was not permitted to me to know it was this added to the confidence which from his political situation i could not but presume would be reposed in him by the treasury and the hope that in his dealings by me he would be so far mindful of former actings and declarations as well as of the opinion entertained of the plan and its authors by mr pitt and lord melville to whose department the business belonged as to procure for me some small aliquot part which was the utmost i could expect or indeed accept of and which by the breach of the engagement i have been deprived of—it was this that gave birth to the idea of casting myself upon his mercy from what it has happened to me now and then to hear from a and b i had reason to presume that in respect of general character his opinion was not unfavourable to me as to partiality whether i had anything of that sort to expect from a man who when i have met him in the street as i have every now and then done has never appeared to know me may be left to be imagined after disappointment about mr rose the same principle viz the wish of having for my judge a person who to a presumable absence of hostility or ill opinion as towards myself and some acquaintance with the history of the transaction might from his situation be to any such purpose as that in question expected to add the qualification of being regarded as a proper person by the treasury—led me to lord glenbervie but once in my life was i ever in any residence of his and that was at lincolns inn some thirty or thirtyfive years ago when he had chambers there not within these twenty years has he been in any residence of mine except one morning about eighteen years ago when he brought some company to see the panopticon rareeshow since that time i have never met him in the street but it has been matter of doubt with me whether i was to know him or no upon your informing me of the disappointment in regard to him i forget whether i had sufficiently thought of the matter to mention to you any person in particular to mention to mr vansittart what i do remember if i did not misconceive you is—an intimation from you that you felt a difficulty about suggesting any person to mr vansittart without a previous assurance that a proposal from him would find such person already prepared for signifying his willingness to accept it casting my eyes around with this instruction before them i have thought of two persons viz sir charles bunbury and mr moreton pitt both of them were in its day well acquainted with panopticon and it was that circumstance that pointed them out to me the names of both of them were by or with the approbation of mr holford     c i presume put upon the late penitentiary committee from that time to the present i have not had with either of them directly or indirectly any the smallest intercourse neither of them on that occasion gave me any signs of life if there could be any need of it this circumstance would i suppose be regarded as sufficient evidence of the absence of any connexion from which partiality might be to be apprehended even if in other respects their characters had been such as to admit of any such surmise should mr vansittart approve of either of them which it may be is to me a matter of entire indifference should he indulge me with the option i would have two strings to my bow and my first application would be made to the first of them i could get the speech of with his consent and with the assurance it would enable me to convey that application i could make without difficulty but without the power of affording any such assurance the errand i make no doubt of your agreeing with me would be rather an unpromising one for in that case neither of them could yield to my request without exposing himself to the hazard of knowing himself to be rejected mr moreton pitt i think you informed me is returned again for dorsetshire that being the case though i suppose he has no house in town for i happen to know of his having some time ago parted with the house he had some time or other i suppose he will be in town to take his seat whether he will or no is i suppose perfectly known to mr vansittart for my part i have not set eyes on him for i know not how many years—about ten years ago i think it is—that for the last time i saw him in the street by accident for two or three minutes as to sir charles bunbury on sending about ten days ago to his house in town i learned that he was expected in town but that at that time no day had been fixed it is i think about two and a half years since i saw him for a few minutes oh how grating—how odious to me is this wretched business of compensation forced after twenty years of oppression—forced to join myself to the baalpeor of bloodsuckers and contribute to the impoverishment of that public to which in the way of economy as well as so many other ways i had such wellgrounded assurance of being permitted to render some signal service halfayears payment of my permanent compensationannuity was due last michaelmas and reduced as i am i have not yet been able to bring myself to apply for it last sunday fortnight it was that you called on me and till now i have not been able to drag myself or to attempt to drag you to this abominable task if you mention to mr vansittart this about the arbitrator will you have the goodness to ask him about the annuity whether a payment on it will now be made and if not at once at what other time and how i should apply for it whether by memorial or how after all besides the breach of public faith—than which surely there never was a grosser one—can such a man as lord sidmouth can such a man as mr vansittart bring himself to put the public to an extra expense of £ 00000 plus my miserable compensation only to make a job for mr h to any such supposition my conception finds itself utterly unable to square itself yet if lord castlereagh  co insist how can they refuse what is it that will be done nothing this is what presents itself to my view as the most natural and least improbable result panopticon not gone on with nor the job neither howsoever canine is it impossible to the appetite of the enemy to be satisfied by any less expensive means a compensation would it not be more suitable to his case than to mine—dear romilly yours ever c the arbiters finally chosen were mr john hullock on the part of the treasury and mr john whishaw on the part of bentham they pronounced their award on the  th july      in further illustration of this subject i conclude with two extracts from the     twentyeighth report of the finance committee      the one is the report of the committee in favour of proceeding with the panopticon contract the other is benthams evidence before the committee proposal for a new and less expensive mode for employing and reforming convicts it did not escape your committee that mr colquhoun in pointing out the errors of the present mode speaks of an improved system for the employment of convicts as one of the chief means by which the expenses of the police are to be diminished your committee were therefore induced to inquire whether that gentleman had any particular system in view in making that observation and they learnt with considerable satisfaction that mr colquhoun who appears himself to have submitted a plan to the secretary of state for this purpose did allude to a particular system from which according to his decided opinion if adopted and carried into execution infinite advantages would arise to the public not only in the diminution of the expense at present incurred but in the improvement of the morals of the convicts who may be placed under such an establishment your committee have therefore annexed to this report a sketch of that plan contained in a printed paper intituled a proposal for a new and less expensive mode for employing and reforming convicts impressed with the advantages of which the perusal of the heads of the plan appears to justify the expectation your committee were gratified in finding that it had already attracted the attention and obtained the encouragement of his majestys government that so long ago as the   th of june      the sum of £ 000 had been actually granted to the proposer jeremy bentham esquire under warrant from the treasury to enable him to make the necessary preparations for the custody of the convicts to be confined in the oroposed penitentiary houses that an act of parliament received the royal assent on the  th july         geo iii c    not only authorizing but requiring the lords commissioners of the treasury as soon after passing the act as conveniently might be to fix upon ground therein described or upon any other convenient and proper spot within certain limits for the erection of one or more penitentiaryhouses and giving the usual compulsive powers for purchasing the ground that should be so chosen that articles of agreement were thereupon drawn up by the solicitor to the treasury and approved by the attorney and solicitor general for the purpose of carrying the proposal into effect reciprocally binding upon the proposer and upon the lords commissioners of his majestys treasury that encouraged by these proofs of confidence and approbation and by these assurances of support mr bentham had proceeded to the performance of his part of the contract and had incurred an expense of many thousand pounds of his own money in addition to that advanced by the treasury in consequence of the preparations which he had made but that his further progress has been impeded and the contract has remained without execution from difficulties in regard to obtaining a spot of ground proper for the purpose your committee however are informed by the lords commissioners of his majestys treasury that they have always felt a disposition to carry into effect the contract intended to be executed whenever a proper spot of ground could be obtained and that the contract intended to have been entered into has been delayed because an essential part of such contract was to be the giving possession of the land upon which the penitentiary house was to be erected but that they are ready to enter into the contract whenever the preliminary difficulties relative to the ground are removed upon further inquiry your committee find that a spot has been pointed out which appears well adapted to the object and against the appropriation of which to a purpose so interesting to the public no solid objection occurs and     that the preliminary difficulties above alluded to have arisen from the rules and orders of the house relative to bills of enclosure which are supposed to be applicable to the ground in question the difficulty is therefore one which may be easily removed before the next session of parliament and your committee were glad to receive from mr bentham himself the assurance of his perfect readiness to proceed with his part of the business it is in the judgment of your committee no small recommendation of the plan alluded to that the contractor proposes to employ the prisoners on his own account receiving a proportionably smaller sum from the public for their maintenance but it must be noticed and remembered that the great and important advantages which distinguish that plan from any other which has been hitherto suggested consist in the certain employment and industrious livelihood which it ensures to those whose terms of confinement are expired in the responsibility which the contractor proposes to take upon himself for the future good behaviour of the criminals intrusted to his care even when they shall no longer be under his control in the publicity which is meant to be given to the whole conduct and effect of the establishment moral medical and economical as well by an annual report of its state and proceedings as by that constant facility of inspection which will in an unusual manner be afforded by the very form and construction of the building upon which the prompt and easy exercise of the superintending powers of the governor himself principally depends your committee are led to dwell the more on the importance of these advantages when they contemplate the accounts which have been furnished to them of the periods of enlargement of the several convicts now confined in the hulks to which they desire to direct the most serious attention of the house bearing in mind as they do the evidence given by an experienced magistrate of the pernicious effects produced upon the unfortunate persons who are confined in those seminaries of vice recollecting too not only that new south wales is at the present moment fully supplied but that it affords no security for the future good behaviour of those who having outlived the periods of their sentences may return again to afflict the society from which they have been separated it appears that of      convicts on board the hulks on the  th of june         will be enlarged in this year     in the next and      within the period of seven years if a similar progress be made in the enlargement of those who are still confined in the different gaols the whole number of felons that will be turned loose on the public will amount to      a discharge at the rate of     per annum continuing for a period of seven years of the      unemancipated and unsettled convicts existing in new south wales and norfolk island on the   d of october      it is probable from a consideration of the years in which they have been severally sent thither that the periods of discharge of a still greater number will have expired in the same seven years and if it could be supposed that the whole or the greater part would endeavour to avail themselves of that circumstance to return to the scene of their former delinquency the prospect would indeed be dreadful when viewed through the medium of the experience which the magistracy of this metropolis has already had of the effect of such returns mr colquhouns testimony on this point is that all of the delinquents that have returned from these settlements who have come within his knowledge are either at this moment thieves on the town or have been executed for new offences your committee therefore trust that no further delay will interfere with the execution of the contract above mentioned not only because any such delay would add to the loss already sustained     by the contractor and thereby enlarge his claim to compensation but because it would deprive the public for a longer time of the benefits of a plan which they cannot but look to as likely to be productive of the most essential advantage both in point of economy and police a mode of compensation has indeed been proposed by the contractor which so far as it goes has the advantage of not being attended with any expense to the public and to which it does not appear to your committee that any substantial objection can be made june         examination of jeremy bentham esquire question—the draught of an intended contract between the commissioners of the treasury and yourself for the confining maintaining and employing convicts in penitentiary houses to be erected by you being before the committee and it appearing from documents that have been laid before the committee that in the year      a sum of £ 000 was advanced to you to enable you to make preparations relative to this business you are desired to state whether you have made any such preparations and whether you are now in readiness to sign and carry into execution such intended contract answer—i am in perfect readiness to do my part in the business and have been so little less than five years in consequence of a proposal submitted by me in march      and approved of matters were so far advanced that in july      i was twice called upon and both times in the same terms to take my arrangements i had at that time in conjunction with my brother brigadiergeneral bentham expended some thousand pounds in bringing to maturity a system of inventions of his for executing by machinery and consequently as to the greater part of the business without the aid either of dexterity or goodwill the most considerable branches of woodwork besides many branches of stonework and metalwork upon the repetition of the above orders in concert with my brother i took my arrangements without delay the system was in such forwardness that we were upon the lookout for a steamengine human labour to be extracted from a class of persons on whose part neither dexterity nor goodwill were to be reckoned upon was now substituted to the steamengine and the system of contrivance underwent a correspondent change being in daily expectation of receiving the sums stipulated for in the intended contract the heads of which were settled in what was then the proper office early in august      and the demand i had made of the spot i had found appropriated to the penitentiary establishment an appropriation since confirmed by the statute of the  th july      having been acceded to by a memorandum in my possession in the hand of the chancellor of the exchequer and being under the necessity of keeping the works going on under pain of suffering the dispersion of a collection of workmen who in that event would not for a length of time if ever be to be replaced i made shift to keep up my advances under circumstances of great difficulty and inconvenience and it was in consequence of representations to the above effect that the imprest in question was made to me in the meantime castiron work had been ordered by me for the frame of the intended building to the amount of several thousand pounds of which order as much was executed as came to within a hundred pounds of the neat produce of the nominal £ 000 advanced to me as above my expenditure over and above the £ 000 received does not now if i include interest amount to so little as £ 000 of the fruit of this expenditure some part would now be lost although the penitentiary establishment were at length to be set on foot and if it were not almost the whole it is too late now to revert back to the steamengine the capital which was to have set it agoing is gone my brothers whole time is engrossed by his official situation and at my time of life and after my experiences it is now too late for me to return to a manufacturing speculation into     which no prospect of ordinary advantage would even then have tempted me question  d—do the advances you speak of make any and what difference in the terms you expect—in the event of the contracts being carried into execution or in the opposite event do you expect anything and what by way of indemnification on that score answer—in circumstances such as mine it is natural enough i believe for the idea of indemnification to present itself but as often as i have set myself to consider in what shape by what persons and in what manner it was to be brought about the appearance of feasibility has seemed to desert it altogether there was a time if my memory does not deceive me when the idea of eventual indemnification used now and then to be alluded to on the other side as a matter of course but this was long ago and the damage which might at that time present itself as lying within compass has since received such an increase that its very magnitude may by this time be considered as having formed a bar to indemnification an issue which i have for some time been training myself to the expectation of is that dispositions will remain that difficulties will accumulate that this will go on till all recollections are at an end and that thus execution and indemnification for nonexecution will glide away together after the difficulties i have found in obtaining attention for measures which i could speak of boldly as beneficial to the public it may be imagined whether i can have confidence enough left for coming forward with claims of a tendency such as i could not myself represent as otherwise than purely burthensome and after having for such a length of time been permitted to entertain prospects such as those delineated in the plan which the committee have before them it is easier to conceive than express the reluctance with which were it even in my power i should see myself fastened as a deadweight upon the public i had hoped to serve as to terms mine is not a situation to make terms were i to say i cannot do so and so upon such terms the answer might be then it cannot be done at all turning aside from what some in my situation might call justice considering what if anything in the way of compensation retained a chance of being found practicable an idea that occurred to me not long ago was that in the event of the penitentiary systems being proceeded with there might perhaps be no great objection to the turning over the convicts to me a little earlier than would otherwise be done to be provided for under the present plan until the penitentiary house should be in readiness for their reception as since the passing of the act of  th july      it was impossible that the persons now occupying the situation in question should not have long ago made up their minds to the parting with it—as they have already retained it so much longer than they could have expected while i have been kept out of my expected situation so much longer than i had reason to apprehend—as under such circumstances the reputation of the persons in question could not suffer the smallest prejudice from a transfer made and declared to be made for no other than such a cause—the idea seemed to me to be free from objection on that score a step would thus be taken and might be taken immediately for no more than three months warning is requisite which would evidently and declaredly be a step and that a decisive one towards the establishment of the penitentiary system the opportunity i should have of becoming acquainted with the characters i should have to deal with would be accelerated and the transition would thus be smoother in many respects than if persons as well as local situation were at the same time to be comprehended in the change this idea i have accordingly ventured to suggest and though it has not yet been complied with the reception given to it was not altogether a discouraging one as to the annual allowance per head since the approbation given to my demand of £   which was in july      the allowance to the present contractors on the hulk plan has throughout     been raised a penny aday per head amounting by the year to £   0s  d the rise in the price of provisions having been the evident ground of this allowance the same indemnification would not i suppose be thought unreasonable in my case question  —do you think you should now be able to exhibit vouchers for or distinct statements of the expenditure of the £ 000 you speak of answer—i have taken care to preserve vouchers for the money expended in materials for the building itself to an amount more than equal to what i have received as above and for the rest i should think that satisfactory vouchers might be collected although the money being my own and no conception entertained of any occasion for accounting to or with any body on the subject i had no reason for keeping vouchers as such in march      on my applying for the £ 000 which i did through mr nepean then under secretary in the home department my brother delivered or produced to that gentleman a hasty sketch of an account drawn up in obedience to a suggestion made at the moment for that purpose at that early stage of the concern it contained i remember articles to the amount of above £  00 after which it was needless to look out for more upwards of £ 00 of it was for patents which are become of so old a date that before i could now make any advantage of the inventions in the proposed penitentiary house more than half the terms would be expired after a variety of unsuccessful attempts in which no inconsiderable part of the money was expended we had already succeeded in executing by machinery planingwork sawingwork from large timber down to veneers of an unexampled fineness wheelwork in the small and in the great windowsashes the greater part of the workmanship and the remainder nearly finished sawing and polishing of stone besides a variety of branches of inferior account and the number was increasing every day question  —what ground is it now proposed should be purchased for the purpose of the establishment answer—a part of tothill fields together with such addition from the grounds adjacent and which may be purchased under the existing act as shall be necessary to make up the quantity allotted to the establishment by that act question  —the committee have understood that certain difficulties have attended the choice of the spot—should these difficulties prove unsurmountable in the instance of tothill fields is there any other spot in contemplation that you think would answer the purpose answer—i know of no other spot whatever that would answer the purpose in any tolerable degree and at the same time afford anything near an equal prospect of seeing the choice finally approved this is the last of four places each of which at the outset afforded me prospects which in the three preceding instances proved delusive nothing could be more decided than the approbation bestowed upon this spot upon the very first mention of it legal obstacles with the existence of which nobody is chargeable have been unavoidably productive of a part of the delays as far as i may be permitted to judge the great aversion entertained to the employing in the present case or applying for the compulsive powers regularly granted as often as land is to be purchased for a public purpose is and has been throughout the only source of difficulty at least at the fountainhead i am satisfied in my own mind that the business would have been despatched near five years ago if land could have been found that belonged to nobody and was in no neighbourhood my own aversion to such powers is not inferior and would be productive of the same effects if i saw by what possible means the business could be done upon less unpleasant terms my great comfort as well as my great encouragement at the outset of this business was the observation of a spot in the instance of which as it seemed to me these difficulties had already been overcome it was upon the ground of   0 an act of parliament and of a decision that had been given upon it by a tribunal of which the twelve judges formed a part—it was upon this ground coupled with other assurances that i proceeded at the outset of the business it was upon the faith of another act of parliament which the committee have before them i mean that of the  th july      that i persevered in it had it been said to me in those days these powers are employed in other cases but they will not be in yours my property would have remained undissipated and the committee would not have had this trouble tothill fields possesses two properties essentially necessary to the execution of my plan vicinity to the metropolis and vicinity to watercarriage in my manufactory raw materials and finished work are both of the bulkiest kind and a prompt communication with the market is indispensable vicinity to the metropolis is a condition much insisted upon by the original planners of the penitentiary system and most of all by howard for the purposes of example and inspection if a place could exist of which it could be said that it was in no neighbourhood it would be tothill fields two prisons and four or five poorhouses of different sorts already in existence will surely be sufficient to shut the door against objections on the score of neighbourhood i can say from measurement that no house of an account superior to a tradesmans or a publichouse stands within a quarter of a mile of the intended building the persons principally interested in the character of proprietors have been applied to with that respect and reverence which is their due a formal or decided consent is more than i have to boast of but symptoms of acquiescence were manifested and none of opposition the opinion of professional advisers was declaredly in favour of the measure to speak with confidence of the disposition of several thousand inhabitants possessing rather a nominal than a real interest in the character of commoners will not be expected of an individual by whom they have not been canvassed but as far as assurances can be depended upon from a quarter the best qualified of any for affording such assurances assistance much more likely than opposition would be to be expected from that source they had authentic notice long ago though from another quarter and not the smallest symptom of opposition was then manifested nor has been since      see works vol ix p     et seq  see these in the works vol v  in allusion to the dukes duel with

of educated people in this country are sufficiently advanced to read and appreciate these profound and admirable works but the time is not distant when however they may be now neglected by the present members of our legislature it will be universally deemed alike absurd and disgraceful for any man to aspire to the character much less to the seat of a legislator who has not made them his study † in his work on legislation and morals this philosopher had long ago laid down the principle of felicity as the basis of morals and shown that all other foundations attempted to be established different as they are and even opposite as they seem to be to each other are capable of being reduced to two—asceticism and sentimentalism the principle of asceticism like that of felicity approves or disapproves of an action according to its tendency to augment or diminish happiness but in an inverse manner approving of an action in as far as it tends to diminish happiness disapproving of it in as far as it tends to augment it whoever reprobates any the least particle of pleasure as such from whatever source derived is pro tanto a partisan of the principle of asceticism the principle of felicity is capable of being consistently pursued that of asceticism is not let but onetenth part of the inhabitants of this earth pursue it consistently and in one days time they will have turned it into a hell by the principle of sentimentalism is meant that principle which approves or disapproves of an action not on account of its tendency to augment or to diminish happiness but because a person finds himself disposed to approve or disapprove of the action in question that approbation or disapprobation being assumed as sufficient of itself and the necessity of looking out for any external ground being expressly disclaimed this is not so much a positive principle as a term employed to signify the negation of all principle a principle is something which points out some external consideration as a means of warranting and guiding the internal sentiment of approbation and disapprobation but that which merely holds up each of these sentiments as a ground and standard for itself is not worthy of the name in examining the catalogue of human actions with a view of determining which are to be marked with the seal of disapprobation says a partisan of this principle you need but to take counsel of your own feelings whatever you find in yourself a propensity to condemn is wrong for that very reason for the same reason it is also meet for punishment the proportion in which it is adverse to happiness the not being adverse to happiness at all is of no manner of consequence the degree of disapprobation you feel is also the measure of punishment if you hate much punish much if you hate little punish little punish as you hate if you hate not at all punish not at all the fine feelings of the soul are not to be outborne and tyrannized by the hard and rugged dictates of political utility the various principles that have been formed concerning the standard of right and wrong may all be reduced to this principle of sympathy and antipathy one account may serve for all of them they all consist in so many contrivances for avoiding the obligation of appealing to any external standard and in referring to the sentiment of approbation or disapprobation as the ultimate reason or the true standard it is curious to observe the variety of inventions contrived for this purpose the phrases different—the principle the same thus one man says he has a thing made on purpose to tell him what is right and what is wrong and that it is called a moral sense and then he goes to work at his ease and says such a thing is right and such a thing is wrong—why because my moral sense tells me it is another man comes and alters the phrase leaving out moral and putting in common in the room of it he then tells you that his common sense teaches him what is right and wrong as surely as the others moral sense did meaning by common sense a sense of some kind or other which he says is possessed by all mankind the sense of those whose sense is not the same as the authors being struck out of the account as not worth taking this contrivance does better than the other for a moral sense being a new thing a man may feel about him a good while without being able to find it out but common sense is as old as the creation and there is no man but would be ashamed to be thought not to have as much of it as his neighbours it has another great advantage—by appearing to share power it lessens envy for when a man gets up upon this ground in order to anathematise those who differ from him it is not by a sic volo sic jubeo but by a velitis jubeatis another man comes and says that as to a moral sense indeed he cannot find that he has any such thing that however he has an understanding which will do quite as well this understanding he says is the standard of right and wrong—it tells him so and so all good and wise men understand as he does if other mens understandings differ in any point from his so much the worse for them—it is a sure sign they are either defective or corrupt another man says that there is an eternal and immutable rule of right that that rule of right dictates so and so and then he begins giving you his sentiments upon anything that comes uppermost and these sentiments you are to take for granted are so many branches of the eternal rule of right another man or perhaps the same man it is no matter says that there are certain practices conformable and others repugnant to the fitness of things and then he tells you at his leisure what practices are conformable and what repugnant just as he happens to like a practice or dislike it a great multitude of people are constantly talking of the law of nature and then they go on giving you their sentiments about what is right and what is wrong and these sentiments you are to understand are so many chapters and sections of the law of nature instead of the phrase law of nature you have sometimes law of reason right reason natural justice natural equity good order any of them will do equally well we have one philosopher who says there is no harm in anything in the world but in telling a lie and that if for example you were to murder your own father this would only be a particular way of saying he was not your father of course when this philosopher sees anything that he does not like he says it is a particular way of telling a lie it is saying that the act ought to be done when in truth it ought not to be done the fairest and openest of them all is that sort of man who speaks out and says i am of the number of the elect now god himself takes care to inform the elect what is right and that with so good effect that let them strive ever so they cannot help not only knowing it but practising it if therefore a man wants to know what is right and what is wrong he has nothing to do but to come to me the mischief common to all these ways of thinking and arguing which in truth as we have seen are but one and the same method couched in different forms of words is their serving as a cloak and pretence and aliment to despotism if not a despotism in practice a despotism however in disposition which is but too apt when pretence and power offer to show itself in practice the consequence is that with intentions very commonly of the purest kind a man becomes a torment either to himself or his fellowcreatures if he be of the melancholy cast he sits in silent grief bewailing their blindness and depravity if of the irascible he declaims with fury and virulence against all who differ from him blowing up the coals of fanaticism and branding with the charge of corruption and insincerity every man who does not think or profess to think as he does  i feel in myself say you a disposition to approve of such or such an action in a moral view but this is not owing to any notion i have of its being a useful one to the community i do not pretend to know whether it be an useful one or not it may be for aught i know a mischievous one but is it then say i a mischievous one examine and if you can make yourself sensible that it is so then if duty means anything that is moral duty it is your duty at least to abstain from it and more than that if it is what lies in your power and can be done without too great a sacrifice to endeavour to prevent it it is not your cherishing the notion of it in your bosom and giving it the name of virtue that will excuse you  i feel in myself say you again a disposition to detest such or such an action in a moral view but this is not owing to any notion i have of its being a mischievous one to the community i do not pretend to know whether it be a mischievous one or not it may be not a mischievous one it may be for aught i know an useful one may it indeed say i be an useful one but let me tell you then that unless duty and right and wrong be just what you please to make them if it really be not a mischievous one and anybody has a mind to do it it is no duty of yours but on the contrary it would be very wrong in you to take upon you to prevent him detest it within yourself as much as you please—that may be a very good reason unless it be also an useful one for your not doing it yourself but if you go about by word or deed to do anything to hinder him or make him suffer for it it is you and not he that have done wrong it is not your setting yourself to blame his conduct or branding it with the name of vice that will make him culpable or you blameless —introduction to the principles of morals and legislation p    et seq  all laws he says which have for their end the happiness of those concerned endeavour to make and in the degree in which they are wise and effective actually do make that for a mans happiness which they proclaim to be his duty that a man ought to sacrifice his happiness to his duty is a common position that such or such a man has sacrificed his happiness to his duty is a common assertion and made the groundwork of admiration but when happiness and duty are considered in their broadest sense it will be seen that in the general tenor of life the sacrifice of happiness to duty is neither possible nor desirable that it cannot have place and that if it could the interests of mankind would not be promoted by it  sacrifice sacrifice is the demand of the everyday moralist sacrifice taken by itself is mischievous and mischievous is the influence that connects morality with suffering morality is then the most effective when it is the least painful its associations are cheerfulness and joy not gloom and misery the less of happiness is sacrificed the greater must be the total sum of happiness let it be obtained gratis where it can where it cannot be had without sacrifice let the sacrifice be as small as possible where the sacrifice will be great let it be ascertained that the happiness will be greater this is the true economy of pleasure this is the prolific cultivation of virtue in treating of morals it has hitherto been the invariable practice to speak of mans duty and nothing more yet unless it can be shown that a particular action or course of conduct is for a mans happiness the attempt to prove to him that it is his duty is but a waste of words yet with such waste of words has the field of ethics been filled a man a moralist gets into an elbowchair and pours forth pompous dogmas about duty and duties why is he not listened to because every man is thinking about interests it is a part of his very nature to think first about interests it is not always that he takes a correct view of his interests did he always do that he would obtain the greatest possible portion of felicity and were every man acting with a correct view to his own interest to obtain the maximum of obtainable happiness mankind would have reached the millennium of accessible bliss and the end of morality the general happiness would be accomplished to prove that an immoral action is a miscalculation of selfinterest—to show how erroneous an estimate the vicious man makes of pains and pleasures—this is the purpose of the sound and intelligent moralist unless he does this he does nothing for that a man should not pursue what he deems conducive to his happiness is in the very nature of things impossible there is the like coincidence between selfishness and benevolence between the selfregarding and the extraregarding principle between what may be termed selfregarding prudence and efficient benevolence the first law of nature is—seek your own happiness the united voices of selfregarding prudence and efficient benevolence add—seek the happiness of others seek your own happiness in the happiness of others the selfregarding affection is not only not a vice but a virtue and not only a virtue but a virtue on which the very existence of the race depends if i thought more about you than i thought about myself i should be the blind leading the blind and we should fall into the ditch together it is as impossible that your pleasures should be better to me than my own as that your eyesight should be better to me than my own my happiness and my unhappiness are as much a part of me as any of my organs or faculties what is demanded by prudence is then required by necessity i could not continue to exist but for the continuance of the selfish principle had adam cared more for the happiness of eve than for his own and eve at the same time more for the happiness of adam than for her own satan might have spared himself the trouble of temptation mutual misery would have marred all prospect of bliss and the death of both have brought to a speedy termination the history of man and yet to disregard the social affections—not to look to them as sources of happiness—not to seek happiness in them is the capital error which it is the business of the moralist to correct while engaged in the pursuit of immediate pleasure and the avoidance of immediate pain we may for the sake of what is present sacrifice a greater distant pleasure or occasion a greater distant pain for nature artless and untutored nature engages man in the pursuit of immediate pleasure and in the avoidance of immediate pain and while acting under the influence of the selfregarding affection we may neglect or violate the social it is the business of the moralist to prevent both of these errors to place before the eyes of the actor a more correct and complete view of the probable future than he is likely to obtain in the midst of present influences to assist him in making reflections and drawing conclusions to point out ends which had not suggested themselves and means by which those ends may be accomplished to perform the duty of a scout a man hunting for consequences—consequences resulting from a particular action or course of action collecting them in the completest manner and presenting them in the best form for use in a word as the whole of virtue consists in the sacrifice of a smaller present satisfaction to a satisfaction of greater magnitude but more remote so the sum of moral science consists in establishing the true distinction between and the ultimate and perfect coincidence of prudence and benevolence this is truly the spear of ithuriel by which evil and good are made to present themselves in their own shapes the selfregarding principle which takes not into account the interests of others which takes not into account anything future has as little in it of prudence as of benevolence it is truly the killing the goose for the golden egg myself myself—now now are but the cries of insensibility to happiness and insensibility to evil—evil certain though not instant is a dear advantage to its possessor—deontology  a general conception of benthams projected plan will be found in the following outline— outline

contrivances the keeper concealed from the observation of the prisoners unless where he thinks fit to show himself hence on their part the sentiment of an invisible omnipresence—the whole circuit

accidents in st georges fields the surrounding wall itself surrounded by an open palisade which serves as a fence to the grounds on the other side—except on the side of the approach no public path by that fence—a sentinels walk between on which no one else can set foot without forcing the fence and declaring himself a trespasser at least if not an enemy to the four walls four such walks flanking and crossing each other at the ends thus each sentinel has two to check him thus simple are the leading principles—the application and preservation of them in the detail required as may be supposed

situation and in a state of cleanliness scarce anywhere conjoined with liberty  th to ensure to them a sufficient supply of artificial warmth and light whenever the season renders it necessary and thereby preserve them from being obliged as in other places to desist from or relax in their work as well as from suffering by the inclemency of the weather  th to keep constantly from them in conformity to the practice so happily received every kind of strong or spirituous liquors unless where ordered in the way of medicine  th to provide them with spiritual and medical assistance constantly on the spot  th to make and maintain such a distribution of their time as deduction made of what is necessary for meals and repose and on sundays for devotion shall fill up the whole measure of it with either productive labour or profitable instruction to allow them the sex horas somno the time lord coke allows to his student and no more not to leave them stewing or shivering in bed for sixteen hours out of the fourandtwenty as in other improved prisons to save candles  th to give them an interest in their work by allowing them a share in the produce  th to convert the prison into a school and by an extended application of the principle of the sunday schools to return its inhabitants into the world instructed at least as well as in an ordinary school in the common and most useful branches of vulgar learning extraordinary culture of extraordinary talents is not in this point of view worth mentioning it would be my private amusement in the account of public benefit—i should take no credit for it  0th to ensure to them the means of livelihood at the expiration of their terms by giving to every one of them who wanted it a trade not requiring confidence on the part of the employer and for the produce of which i could engage to furnish them a demand   th to lay for them the foundationstone of a provision for old age upon the plan of the annuity societies   th to pay a penal sum for every escape with or without any default of mine irresistible violence from without excepted   th to take upon me the insurance of their lives for an under premium at a rate grounded on an average of the number of deaths among imprisoned criminals   th to take up my ordinary residence in the midst of them and in point of health to share whatever might be their fate   th to present to the court of kings bench on a certain day of every term and afterwards print and publish at my own expense a report exhibiting in detail the state not only moral and medical but economical of the establishment and then and there to make answer to all such questions as shall be put to me relative thereto not only on the part of the court or officer of the crown but by leave of the court on the part of any person whatsoever questions the answer to which might tend to subject me to conviction for any capital or other crime not excepted treading under foot a maxim invented by the guilty for the benefit of the guilty and from which none but the guilty ever derived any advantage by neatness and cleanliness by diversity of employment by variety of contrivance and above all by that peculiarity of construction which without any unpleasant or hazardous vicinity enables the whole establishment to be inspected almost at a view it should be my study to render it a spectacle such as persons of all classes would in the way of amusement be curious to partake of and that not only on sundays at the time of divine service but on ordinary days at meal times or times of work providing thereby a system of inspection universal free and gratuitous the most effectual and permanent of all securities against abuse to any one who should be apprehensive of seeing the condition of convicts made too desirable i have only this answer—art lies in meliorating mans lot any bungler may make it worse at any rate what you take from severity you might add to duration you see the use of a rent and that a high one payable by me for a building not yet erected but under my direction to be erected the interest of the public is completely mine every penny spent beyond necessity lays a tax upon me i should require no new confidence give the convicts to me as they have been given to the hulks capital i should want little or none the subsistencemoney is capital that you would have security for the hulks are and must be impenetrable to the public eye they need more than human goodness to ensure them from abuse my prison is transparent my management no less so the hulkmasters have from year to year to do as they please a summons from the kings bench might oust me the same day i am no nabob i want no jury i would have none the best friend to innocence i know of is open and speedy justice of the dispositions i should bring with me to such an enterprise or the motives that have urged me on to it i shall say nothing—you would inquire what is public i will mention the books i send will show by their dates that the subject had occupied a warm place in my thoughts four years and thirteen years before any personal views had mixed with it those views are but of yesterday i began with planning for a and b to execute—you will see i did—every page of the tract just printed four years ago sent over in manuscript will show it you views rising upon views drew my affections after them till at last i said to myself—alas where is the stranger who will enter as deeply as the contriver into the spirit of the contrivance on my part i should wish to stipulate—   to have the office assured to the contractor during good behaviour a phrase which in the ordinary terms means for life but which on terms like the above would mean simply what it says   the station of jailor is not in common account a very elevated one the addition of contractor has not much tendency to raise it education profession connexions occupations and objects considered i hope i should not be thought unreasonable in wishing to be preserved from being altogether confounded with those by whom those situations have been hitherto filled and from finding myself a sufferer in estimation by having performed a public service in this view two expedients present themselves—one is the assurance of your assistance towards obtaining a parliamentary sanction for the offer of standing examination in manner abovementioned the other is an eventual assurance that if after a fair trial the success of the undertaking and the propriety of my conduct in it should appear to have been fully ascertained i shall be recommended to his majesty for a mark of distinction not pecuniary such as may testify that i have incurred no ultimate loss of honour by the service and afford me some compensation for the
