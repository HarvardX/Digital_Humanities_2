barbarous age always affects and pleases the heart more than the most finished and artificial effort of a refined composer  to examine this matter thoroughly might employ much philosophical research i shall only beg leave to lay before you a few remarks which may not perhaps have offered themselves to your enquiries  in the first place what do you call a barbarous age or country to what period of society may this denomination be properly limited the greeks gave this denomination to the persians tho the latter were arrived at more refinement of manners than themselves we give it to the chinese the chinese with equal propriety to us  barbarism like every other human accident and quality must be allowed to be merely comparative if any one said that most of the european kingdoms had not yet emerged from barbarity nay that the most polished of them are yet but barbarcus every beau of the era of george i would stroke his chin and smile yet were all ancient roman to revisit this globe and make a tour to paris i have no doubt but he would with great justice affirm that the french were very little improved since his own days that their customs their dress their luxuries were barbarous au dernier point i say with justice because from a comparative view of the roman manners every one must allow that they were in the days of their glory as much superior to the french in luxury which is always considered as the great criterion of refinement as the french are to the esquimaux indians indeed one cannot help smiling when the declamations of writers and of the clergy in particular against the luxury and refinement of their own several ages are considered in the old english days when the drawingrooms of palaces were carpeted with clean straw and maids of honor breakfasted on roast beef the pulpits shook with virulent invectives against pride of furniture and delicacy of food what more can be said now when forests are robbed of their music for the sake of the rumps of the nightingales what more will be said four centuries after this when i will venture to prophesy luxury and refinement will be in such a state as justly to reflect upon this age the appellation of barbarous  these remarks are only made with a view to show the necessity of defining what is meant by barbaric poetry before the subject is further opened to the poetry of the modern french just as the above observations may be we should no more think of giving the epithet of barbarous than to that of the ancient greeks or romans  as in youth most people have felt an inclination to write verses tho in a more mature age they have lost that desire so it is in the youth of society if i may so express myself that poetry has most flourished now this youth of society is commonly like that of man lost in tempestuous passions which call forth extraordinary exertions of mind such exertions form the very life and soul of poetry homer was a witness of such emotions as arise in a barbarous state of society ere he recorded them in the iliad violent actions and sudden calamities of all kinds are the certain concomitants of uncivilized life to these we owe a poetry warm rapid and impetuous that like a large river swelling from a bleak mountain carries the reader along in the barge of fancy now by vales fragrant with wild flowers now through woods resounding with untaught melody but most generally through deserts replete with romantic and with dreadful prospects  society always passes through three different stages ere it arrives at refinement the first is the mere savage state during which the lord of the world is almost on a level with the brutes themselves living like them in caves or wretched huts in the woods that saw him born and subsisting on wild fruits and such prey as his rude invention can seize by force or guile climate has such power over human happiness as sometimes to fix society in this state without any hope of further progress as for instance in lapland the poetry of such a country must of course be always barbaric the second stage is that of pastoral life the third may be considered as a kind of middle state between barbarism and civilization and is that in which the shepherds of the second state begin to confederate together for defense of themselves and their flocks against such of their neighbors as are yet in the first condition and who ignorant of property would admit of no law but force for that effect towns are built and by the collision of different minds the arts and sciences begin to be struck out which are in time to spread the light of refinement through the community  all poetry composed in these different periods of society may with propriety be termed barbaric but more particulary that of the first and second the iliad if not written during the third is yet a living picture of its manners and it is to this as much as to any other circumstance that it owes its wonderful superiority for no state of society can be so interesting as that in which the sun of science is beginning to rise and discover prospects full of splendour and novelty and in which the mind vegetating strongly begins from a vigorous stem to display the buds of elegance  as in this stage of society poetry may be carried to the highest perfection so the two first do not impede its real influence for what it wants in art in elegance in harmony is fully compensated by a wild force of nature by a simplicity by a pathos to which every heart is in unison attributes no less declarative of the power of poetry than the former love a passion of every age and climate imparts his tenderness even to the savage breast amid the snows of lapland as we may perceive from the songs preserved by scheffer which you so much admire and which may be compared to the roses that grow wild as mr maupertuis informs us on the banks of the rivers and lakes of that dreary country  from what i have written you will no doubt see that i am still the same skeptic in most matters that you left me thinking always ways with sir roger de coverley that much may be said on both sides so that if you wish to have an opinion on any subject you will be much disappointed if you apply to me but if you desire to hear doubts instead of decisions i may perhaps furnish you with a sufficiency  as i know your fondness for such pieces of rude poetry as have intrinsic merit i subjoin two that may not perhaps have lain in your way  the first is extracted from a history of the canary islands by captain glass and is one of the most exquisite pieces of elegiac poetry which i have ever met with in the year      you must know guillen peraza an enterprizing youth was governor of the canary islands but attempting to reduce palma one of them to the power of spain he was there killed the following verses were made on that occasion and as our author informs us are repeated in palma to this day which i do not wonder at as every one who hears them must wish to remember them and the heart must be hard indeed that is not affected by their deep pathos there is a bit of a pun however in the second stanza which to understand you must remember that palma signifies a palm tree as perhaps to use a royal metaphor your spanish may be rusty i shall subjoin a prose translation as literal as possible  llorad las damas assi dios os vala guillen peraza quedo en la palma la flor marchita de la su cara no eres palma eres retama eres cypres de triste rama eres desdicha desdicha mala tus campos rompan tristes volcanos no vean plazeres sino pesares cubran tus flores las arenales guillen peraza guillen peraza do esta tu escudo do esta tu lanza todo la acaba la mala adanza let the ladies lament guillen peraza as god shall help them in their miseries for in palma the flower left his cheek  thou fatal isle art not palma a name significant of victory and joy thou art a bramble thou art a cypress of melancholy branch thou art a misfortune a dreadful evil  let dismal volcanos burst thy fields let no pleasures be seen there but sorrows let sands cover all thy flowers  guillen peraza guillen peraza where is thy shield where is thy spear a fatal rashness destroyed all  the second has not been published so far as i know it is an indian song translated by john nettles a cataba indian who learned english at the school founded by sir robert boil at williamsburg  i was walking through the shade of the grove in the morning dew i met my fancy she talked with her smiling lips to me i gave her no answer she told me to speak out my mind bashful face spoils good intent that cleared up my heart but when my love is gone from my side my heart faints and is low  letter ii indifference for fame is by no means to be regarded as a virtue if desire of praise be a vice it is a vice that is the author of many virtues and we are glad to have rich grain tho we use dung to produce it  at the same time i perfectly agree with you that common and universal applause is in the eyes of a man of wisdom or even of true taste a matter not to be wished the praise of one fool or knave we should be ashamed of surely then we ought infinitely more to despise that of an innumerable multitude of both if a man has vanity his vanity itself ought to be rather offended than pleased at the incense arising from the flowers of such weeds even his vanity should have a better taste as mr gray expresses it  praise says lord bacon is the reflection of virtue but it is as the glass or body which gives the reflection if it be from the common people it is commonly false and naught and rather follows vain persons than virtuous for the common people understand not many excellent virtues the lowest virtues draw praise from them the middle virtues excite in them astonishment or admiration but of the highest virtues they have no sense or perceiving at all but shows and species virtutibus similes serve best with them certainly fame is like a river that bears up things light and swollen and drowns things weighty and solid but if persons of quality and judgment concur then it is as the scripture says nomen bonum instar unguenti fragrantis it fills all round about and will not easily away for the odours of ointments are more durable than those of flowers  so far this excellent writer upon whose estimate of fame some illnatured reader may perhaps make this censure that if lord bacon had held popular applause in more reverence he might have had at least one strong motive not to degrade his high office by the acceptance of a bribe it may however be remarked upon the above quotation with more justice that by persons of quality the great chancellor must mean persons whose quality lies in their mind not our mob of persons of quality who are most commonly if you will excuse a pun persons of no quality at all  indifference for vulgar fame therefore you will do well to discriminate from indifference for genuine praise of the true flavor the former certainly belongs to a mind that can stand upon its own basis without the props of adventitious opinions the latter i will be bold to say is the parent of every vice what will the world say is a reflection that has stifled many a bad inclination in the breasts of those who are either above or below every other motive want of shame and total profligacy follow like a flood if you remove this bank which excluded them it is true this principle has done as much harm as good in the world a false respect for the opinion of others having destroyed many a virtue because it did not happen at that time to float upon the stream of fashion such effect has false fame upon a little mind and the force of the true upon a large soul is yet more strong the praise of the few swells and invigorates it to its most complete perfection at the same time that it shrinks from multitudinous glory  for what is glory but the blaze of fame the peoples praise if always praise unmixt and that the people but a herd confused a miscellaneous rabble who extol things singular and well weighed scarce worth the praise they praise and they admire they know not what and know not when but as one leads the other and what delight to be by such extolled to live upon their tongues and be their talk of whom to be despised were no small praise his lot who dares be singularly good milt par reg an author in particular who has any regard for his fame should beware of building it upon such a sandy foundation as the applause of the mob the popular gale as horace phrases it is eternally veering but in no clime does it vary more than in that of literature fashion after exerting her power upon most other subjects has at last chosen literary reputation to display the utmost caprices of her sway sometimes it happens wonderfully that she blunders right but most commonly her favors are unworthily bestowed these fashionable scriblers who are now so common are however by no means to be envied for in the course of a year of a month of a day the public may see the deception and as it happens when we treat a stranger with respect who we afterward find deserves our scorn their warmest admirers most frequently revenge the insult they have themselves imposed on their own understandings by commencing their bitterest enemies  there is a grievance just now reigning in this capital of which you in the country can scarcely have an idea after being blessed with a variety of swindlers in all occupations we have at last got literary swindlers people who steal reputation in order to steal money as the character must be new to you i will give you some outlines of it  a literary swindler is a scribler who regards fame as only a road to the temple of wealth of consequence so he can get what is here called reputation he cares not by what means his first step is to form an intimacy with the printers of newspapers of magazines of reviews and other periodical works through these channels he gravely communicates to the public what are here emphatically denominated puffs or praises of himself and his writings the more bombastic the better those who know the trick laugh at his effrontery but as they are but few in comparison of the others he minds not their derision the mob who know nothing of the matter stare and wonder they have not heard of such a celebrated writer every one not to appear ignorant whether he has read the work puffed or not calls it admirable tho were he to trust his own judgment he would call it the silliest nonsense that ever fell from a gooses quill the scribler in the mean time goes on puffing as fast as he can writes anecdotes of himself sends letters from the country telling of his being so happy as to be in the company of himself and what a modest and wonderful man he himself is at length by these and such tricks he gets what is called a reputation and perhaps makes a fortune by it ere the knavery is revealed  no consideration can make a man of reflection more deaf to popular approbation than the view of such a charmer as the above he will perceive that the fame he pursued as a chaste bride is no better than a common prostitute and abandon the suit with scorn and indignation  letter iii had you perused the work of vavassor you would cease to wonder at your friends taking no notice of him in his essay on ludicrous composition his book de dictione ludicra which you think must abound with curious matter is the most vapid performance you can imagine you likeways mistake its intention it is written to prove that the ancients either knew nothing of or else despised ludicrous writing and what do you think is the consequence he derives from this discovery which his halflearning enabled him to make why to be sure that we the poor moderns must not pretend to feast on more luxurious things than our elders and must look on a way of writing unknown to them as forbidden to us ah lepidum caput his book de epigrammate is of the fame stuff the one half of it is filled with invectives truly jesuitical against some collector of epigrams because as would appear he did not think any of vavassors epigrams worthy a place in his work however he afterward gives his antagonist ample revenge by presenting us with his own epigrams in three books among all which there is not one that will bear reading twice or indeed once if one could judge of them at first sight  such are the works of vavassor who has written on subjects of elegance without taste and on subjects of curiosity without interesting nay i may add on subjects of erudition without learning  what must we think of an author whose works instead of advancing knowledge would confine it whose arguments if extended prove that we must not use gunpowder because unknown at the battle of marathon nor printing because cicero does not mention it  yet such a writer has had his admirers among his countrymen for according to one of their own prophets  un sot trouve toujours un plus sot qui ladmire i entirely agree with you that bossu and the other french critics whom addison followed with blind adoration cannot be held in too sovereign contempt how mistaken a critic that fine writer was may merit discussion on another occasion  letter iv as i know that akensides work on the pleasures of imagination is deservedly one of your most favorite poems i send you enclosed what i have no doubt you will set a due value on no less than a copy of all the corrections he made with his own hand on that poem they were inserted in the margin of the doctors printed copy which afterward passed into the hands of a gentleman from a friend of whom and of my own a very ingenious young templar i received them at what time they were written i cannot pretend to say much less to reveal the authors reasons for not giving an edition according to them most of them are evidently much for the better one or two i am afraid for the worse you will observe that a few of them have been adopted by the author in his proposed alteration of the poem as appears from the two books and part of the third of that alteration published by mr dyson in his edition of akensides poems       to but far the greater part is unpublished and that the mot valuable as being evidently written ere the author had taken up the strange idea that poetry was only perfect oratory so that i will venture to say that an edition of the pleasures of imagination adopting most of these corrections would be the most perfect ever yet known read and judge  book i argument erase the words or wonderfulness and the

subject to enquire what is the spirit of lyric poetry or in what does its discrimination from other kinds of poetry consist those who have even pretended to write in this style have often betrayed perfect ignorance of the very principles of so exquisite a mode of composition  the greeks the greeks alone my friend are the masters and their works the models of this kind of poetry if we examine these models with care we shall perceive that this species of poetry divides itself in resemblance of the works of nature into two kinds the sublime and the beautiful in the first class pindar stood without a rival till gray appeared in the second anacreon and sappho still remain without equal competitors  from these writers therefore the genuine spirit of lyric poetry may be discovered from pindar we learn that sudden transitions bold and abrupt metaphors a regular cadence and a warm and impetuous glow of thought and language thoughts that breathe and words that burn are essentials of the higher mode of lyric writing i place a regular cadence among these requisites in spire of drydens wonderful ode which is of itself worth all that pindar has written as a large diamond is worth a vast heap of gold because that masterpiece is a dithyrambic poem not a lyric one and that as well for its want of regularity as for ts subject which being perfectly convivial as its title speaks falls with much propriety into that class which the ancients called dithyrambic and which were most commonly sacred to bacchus  in the second division of lyric poetry the essentials are less easily fixed harmony of cadence and beauty and warmth of sentiment passion and expression seem the principal above all uncommon elegance in turns of language and in transition are so vital to this kind of lyric poetry in particular that i will venture to say they constitute its very soul a particular that none of our lyric writers before gray at all attended to his mode of expression is truly lyrical and has a classic brevity and terseness formerly unknown in english save to milton alone of which to produce a few instances from his very first ode purple year for flowers of spring insect youth for young insects honied spring for honey of spring liquid noon for liquid air of noon with many others are all modes of expression of the genuine and uncommon lyric hue  hume has well observed in his essay on simplicity and resinement that no criticism can be instructive which descends not to particulars and is not full of examples and illustrations it may be added to this very just remark that the more minute criticism is the more need it has of example to give a kind of body to its evanescence for this reason since i have spoken of transition as so material a form of the ode i shall beg leave to consider a moment one of the best in any language with regard to this beauty in particular namely dr beatties ode on lord hays birthday a production which that supreme judge of lyric poetry mr gray praises with great justice for the lyric texture of the thoughts  the opening of this fine piece is however unhappy a muse for a poet is a violent and bad metaphor the muse in any good modern writer only means poesy personified by another name a muse unstained is worse unstained is an inelegant epithet even when applied in its proper sense to garments etc as it gives an idea that they might have been stained unstained with art is a mixed metaphor one of the worst faults of composition but leaving those painful remarks these lines no gaudy wreath of flowers she weaves but twines with oak the laurel leaves thy cradle to adorn are exquisite the civic crown being of oak the victors of laurel the image is beautiful to a degree of lyric perfection but observe the transition to the next stanza and pronounce it truly lyric for not on beds of gaudy flowers thine ancestors reclined etc this transition in prose were ridiculous for what connection between not giving a child a wreath of flowers and the reason assigned namely because his ancestors did not recline on them yet this want of connection forms the beauty of this very lyric transition  the next to hurl the dart etc may be called a transition from a distance as the last was to a distance it is equally classic with the former  in the  th stanza the muse is as happily introduced as she was unhappily brought in at first it would require too much length to display the rest of the transitions in this ode which are all of them fine but none more so than that in this stanza yon castles glittering towers etc which brings the very object before your eyes  as such microscopic parts of criticism are rather fatiguing to the mental eye i shall here conclude with assuring you tho perhaps with a lyric transition in prose that i am very truly etc  letter vi i agree with you that the life of the latter cato would if executed with a pen worthy of it prove one of the noblest pieces of biography extant not to mention the public benefit that might be derived from it in these our evil days days in which a remote found of the applause reaped by patriot virtue has hardly reached our ears  of all the great characters of antiquity few equal none exceed that of cato the vastness the force of his mind are only to be rivalled by its regular consistency a consistency that makes all his a actions appear of a piece a beauty if i may so express myself rarely to be observed in the portraits of heroes many of whom seem to have fallen as short of common exertion in some passages of their lives as they exceeded it in others how little how mean how trifling the character of cicero when opposed to such a model the very first storm of public outrage tore his feeble patriotism up by the roots while the strong virtue of cato like a mountain oak received fresh vigor from the utmost rage of the tempest  they who peruse the familiar letters of cicero will find that orator malapert and various as he is uniform in his respect and almost adoration of cato such was the power of real dignity of mind over fancy and loquacious eloquence these letters are enriched by the preservation of one of cato being the only composition of his that has reached us and which shows us clearly that his soul solid as diamond was brightened with politeness even friendship that greatest snare of a lofty mind could not influence him against the consistent plan of his virtue yet his refusal to act against his real sentiments has nothing harsh but is given at the same time with a firmness that leaves nothing to hope and with a mildness that leaves nothing to censure  spirit of cato what must be thy indignation if thou perceivest the degeneracy of a country in which hampden lied russel have bled  it is remarkable that three of the best roman poets have as it were vied with each other who should most elevate the character of cato virgil and horace tho the minions of a court whose frame was cemented with the blood of that patriot have almost excelled their common expression in his praise the first in the eneid where his hero finds cato in elysium giving laws to the good  his dantem jura catonem the second in his odes et cuncta terrarum subacta praeter atrocem animum catonis   but lucan above all has risen to the actual sublime fired by the contemplation of that sublime character  victrix causa deis placuit sed vita catoni to which of the poets is the preeminence due virgils praise is wonderfully fine at first sight for how good how just how virtuous must he be who is qualified to give laws to the good to the just to the virtuous in elysium itself but like the other beauties of this writer it will not bear a close examination for what laws are to operate among the blessed where there can be no punishment nor reward how can they receive laws who are emancipated from all possibility of crime the praise is therefore futile and ridiculous nothing being more absurd than to erect a column of apparent sublimity upon the morass of falsehood  the praise of horace has great truth and dignity every thing on earth in subjection to caesar save the mind of cato is a great a vast thought and would even arise to the sublime were it not for that of lucan which exceeds it and nothing can be sublime to which a superior conception may be found  the praise of lucan is sublimity itself for no human idea can go beyond it cato is set in opposition to the gods themselves nay is made superior in justice tho not in power now the power of the pagan deities may be called their extrinsic justice their intrinsic virtue cato excelled them says lucan in real virtue tho their adventitious attribute of power admitted no rival  letter vii your opinion of the comedy of le mechant i heartily subscribe to tho mr gray has pronounced it the best comedy he ever read it is perfectly in the style of the french tragedy inactive and declamatory yet i do not wonder at mr grays favorable opinion of it when he admired the silly declamation of racine so much as to begin a tragedy in his very manner which however he was so fortunate as not to go through with  our stage thank heaven refuses the insipidity of the french drama and requires an action a business a vigor to which the run of gerontes and damons which all their comedies are stuffed with are mere strangers moliere in attempting to introduce laughter into the french comedy has blundered upon mere farce for it is the character of that nation always to be in extremes in short if w except fontaine i know of no writer in the french language who has real claim to poetical merit their language is not the language of verse nor are their thoughts or their costume those of poetry fontaine uses their language familiarly in which way only it can be used to advantage his thoughts are likewise in the style of mere familiar humor comic tales may be well written in french but nothing else their prose writers i readily allow yield to none in the world but of their poetry the bon mot said by one of themselves to voltaire which was les francois nont pas la tete epique may be with great justice enlarged thus les franccedilois nont pas la tete poetique  in english comedy congreve i believe stands without a rival his plots have great depth and art perhaps too much his characters are new and strong his wit genuine and so exuberant that it has been alleged as his only fault that he makes all his characters inherit his own wit yet this fault will not be imputed by adepts who know that the dialogue of our comedy cannot possibly be too spirited and epigrammatic for it requires language as well as characters stronger than nature  shakspere excells in the strength of his characters and in wit but as plot must be regarded as an essential of good comedy he must not be erected as a model in the comic academy a loss sufficiently compensated by the reflection that it were vain to place him as a model whose beauties transcend all imitation  tragedy and comedy both ought certainly to approach as near the truth of life as possible in so much that we may imagine we are placed with le diable boiteux on the roof of the house and perceive what passes within this rule in tragedy cannot be too strictly observed tho it has escaped almost every writer of modern tragedy the characters of which speak similies bombast and every thing except the language of real life so that we are eternally tempted to exclaim as falstaff does to pistol prythee speak like a man of this world  in comedy this rule ought by no means to be adhered to as insipidity is the worst fault writing can have but particularly comedy whose chief quality it is to be poignant now poignancy cannot be effected without strong character but an excellent tragedy may be written without a strong character in it witness douglas the characters of tragedy therefore cannot have too much truth but those of comedy ought to resemble the painted scenes which if examined too nearly are mere daubings but at a proper distance have the very truth of nature while the beauties of more delicate paintings would not be perceived  sentimental comedy as it is called tho of late birth in england is yet the comedy of menander and of terence terence is quite full of sentiment and of a tenderness which accompanies it and so barren of wit and humor that i only remember two passages in its fix comedies that provoke a smile for a smile is all they can provoke the one is that scene which passes after the eunuch is supposed to have ravished a young lady this is the only proof of the humor of terence and the only sample of his wit we have in the reply of an old miser to one who he expected brought him tidings of a legacy but who instead thereof makes very gravely a moral observation to the impatient old man who peevishly retorts what have thou brought nothing here but one maxim  sentimental comedy bore a very short sway in england indeed it was incompatible with the humor of an english audience who go to a comedy to laugh and not to cry it was even more absurd it may be added in its faults than that of which congreve is the model for sentiments were spoken by every character in the piece whereas one sentimental character was surely enough if a man met with his mistress or left her if he was suddenly favored by fortune or suddenly the object of her hatred if he was drunk or married he spoke a sentiment if a lady was angry or pleased in love or out of it a prude or a coquet make room for a sentiment if a servant girl was chid or received a present from her mistress if a valet received a purse or a horsewhipping good heavens what a fine sentiment  this fault i say was infinitely more absurd than that of congreve for a peasant may blunder on wit to whose mind sentiment is totally heterogeneous besides congreves wi is all his own whereas most of the said sentiments may be found in the proverbs of solomon  no wonder then this way of writing was soon abandoned even by him who was its chief leader goldsmith in vain tried to stem the torrent by opposing a barrier of low humor and dullness and absurdity more dull and absurd than english sentimental comedy itself  it is very much to the credit of that excellent writer mr colman that while other dramatists were lost in the fashion of sentiment his comedies always present the happiest medium of nature without either affectation of sentiment or affectation of wit that the able translator of terence should yet have sufficient force of mind to keep his own pieces clear of the declamatory dullness of that ancient is certainly a matter deserving of much applause the jealous wife and the clandestine marriage with others of his numerous dramas may be mentioned as the most perfect models of comedy we have to all the other requisites of fine comic writing they always add just as much sentiment and wit as does them good this happy medium is the most difficult to hit in all composition and most declares the hand of a master  by the school for scandal the style of congreve was again brought into fashion and sentiment made way for wit and delicate humor that piece has indeed the beauties of congreves comedies without their faults its plot is deeply enough perplexed without forcing one to labor to unravel it its incidents sufficient without being too numerous its wit pure its situations truly dramatic the characters however are not quite so strong as congreves which may be regarded as the principal fault of this excellent piece lesser faults are charless sometimes blundering upon sentiments nay sometimes upon what are the worst of all sentiments such as are of dangerous tendency as when rowley advises him to pay his debts before he makes a very liberal present and so to act as an honest man ere he acts as a generous one  rowley ah sir i wish you would remember the proverb    charles be just before you are generous  why so i would if i could but justice is an old lame hobbling beldame and i cannot get her to keep pace with generosity for the soul of me   this sentiment than which nothing can be more false and immoral is always received by the silly audience with loud applause whereas no reprobation can be too severe for it a lesser blemish lies in the verses tagged to the end of the play in which one of the characters addresses the audience the verses are an absurdity the address still greater for the audience is by no good actor supposed to be present and any circumstance that contributes to destroy the apparent reality of theatrical representation cannot meet with too sharp censure but it gives me pain to remark any faults in a piece that in general so well merits the applause it constantly receives i shall only observe that the sentiment put into charless mouth in the last scene tho not liable to the objections brought against the former is yet incompatible with the character which is set in strongest opposition to the sentimental one of joseph the words i mean are if i dont appear mortified at the exposure of my follies it is because i feel at this moment the warmest satisfaction at seeing you my liberal benefactor  it may be observed that every thing like a sentiment is sure to meet with applause on our theater which the actors well express by calling sentiments claptraps this trick of securing applause by sentiments lately proved the salvation of the very worst tragedy that ever appeared on any stage for the audience had so much applauded the two first acts from the number of those claptraps that they were ashamed to retract so that the piece took a little run very quietly to the disgrace of our taste it being one of those very farragos of nonsense that the rehearsal was written to expose to due scorn and had it been fabricated before the era of that witty performance it would certainly have had the honor of being placed in the first shelf of absurdity  letter viii how can you treat petrarch with so much contempt tho i agree with you that there is a tedious sameness in most of his compositions yet i by no means think him without his merit the very idea indeed of reading upwards of three hundred sonnets gives pain the stated form and measure of that kind of poetry being so disgustingly similar that i believe no man of genius would now write twenty in a life time yet it has its beauties and tho your comparison of a desert of sand where the same objects always meet the eye were allowed in speaking of petrarch nevertheless in traveling that desert you will now and then at great intervals i confess light on a spring surrounded with verdure and flowers in his own country i suppose the purity of his language and his antiquity secure his fame independent of his poetical beauties which are not many  i also grant you that he abounds with false beauties among which the most gross and disgusting is his playing on the name of his mistress which unhappily signified a laurel tree in every other line but i cannot assent to your proposition that a writer of real genius may be in a fault but can never happen on a false beauty shakspere has many false beauties and so has milton  it is amazing that a writer who in some passages discovers great force of mind should so utterly lose himself in the unnatural metaphysics of love yet by a singular fate it is to his weakness that he owes his fame for his platonic passion threw such a fairy light round himself and his writings as rendered them very conspicuous in these dark times but in some of his odes or canzoni he proves himself not wholly undeserving of his fame at this day witness the vth in which there are beauties of the highest kind as in this stanza una part del mondo e che si giace may sempre in ghiaccio ed in gelate nevi tutta luntana del cammin del sole la soto i giorai nubilosi e brevi nemica naturalenente di pace nasce una gente a cuil morir non dole questa se piu devota the non soli col tedesco furor la spada cigne turchi arabi e caldei con tutti quei the speran negli dei di qua dal mar the fa londe sanguigne quanto sian de prezzar conoscer dei popolo ignudo paventoso e lento che ferro may non strigne ma tutti colpi suoi commette al vento and in these lines of the same ode pon mente al temerario ardir di serse che fece per calcar i nostri liti di novi ponti oltraggio alla marina e vedrai nella morte de mariti tutte vestiti a brun le done perse e tinto in rosso it mar di salamina e non pur questa misera ruina del popolo infelice del orient vittoria ten promette ma maratona e le mortali stratte che difese il leon con poca gente   in canzone xxix this stanza is eminently beautiful voi cui fortuna ha posto in mano il freno delle belle contrade di che nulla pieta par che vi stringa che fan qui tante pelligrine spade perch l verde terreno del barbarico sangue si dipinga vano error vi lusinga poco vedete e parvi veder molto chen cor venale amor cercate o feed qual piu gente possede colui e piu da suoi nemici avvolto o diluvio raccolto di che deferti strani per innondar i nostri dolci campi se dalle proprie mani questo navven or chi fia the ne scampi his sonnets truly fine and in which the train of thought varies might be reduced to about a dozen the real poetical beauties of dante might likewise fall into very small compass consisting chiefly of the celebrated tale of ugolino and of that in the close of the vth canto of the inferno which is as exquisite for tenderness as the other is remarkable for terror now that beauties of writers are fashionable reading a small duodecimo extracted from these two poets would if performed with taste be an acceptable present to the public for no works i have read afford so fair a field for selection as those of the fathers of italian poetry as they contain diamonds of the finest water lost in a mass of common soil yet were they both men of real genius for superlative genius must be discovered from the amazing height it sometimes rises to tho at other times it displays no extraordinary vigor the genius of petrarch is however more equal and correct than that of dante yet he by no means wanted strength when he chose to exert it nor was dante whose excellence is native force deficient in describing the tender passions as may be seen in the canto above referred to petrarchs learning almost destroyed his genius dantes genius shot freely having no bound of erudition to confine its vigor he is a bold original writer whose beauties are peculiarly his own while his faults are those of the times  letter ix perhaps no question of criticism may afford room for more curious investigation than this in what quality does the perpetual and universal excellence of writing consist or in other words what property of composition is certain to procure it the classic and legitimate admiration of all ages and countries  to decide on this point it is certainly the surest method to judge of the future by the past and to pronounce that the same perfections which have secured to an author of three thousand years standing his due applause will most infallibly effect the same end to a modern writer  a poet of fine talents but of far superior taste has pronounced wisdom or good sense to be the very of fountain of perfect composition scribendi recte sapere est et principium et fons and this maxim will be found to hold true in every species of writing whatever good sense may be called the salt that preserves the other qualities of writing from corruption this property is alike required in every branch of the belles lettres but there are others which may be considered as confined to one particular path of writing  such is imaginary invention with respect to poetry i say imaginary invention to distinguish it here from that scientific invention which belongs to the judgment this invention as the parent of novelty is the superlative qualification of poetry and nothing can contribute more to procure it permanent admiration yet invention itself is inferior to strong sense even in poetry for there are poems in which the invention is rich yet disgusts by its futility not being conducted by that acer animi vis that keen force of mind which always accompanies true genius  if good sense is therefore a praise superior to invention itself in poetry we may with great safety pronounce it one of the very first qualities that ensures applause to composition  a beautiful work of genius may be aptly compared to a beautiful woman good sense may be called its health without which it cannot live charming as its other powers may be but tho a woman has good health it does not follow that she is fair nay we often applaud a morbidezza or an appearance of sickly delicacy as an improver of female beauty and in this the comparison fails a works as well as its present parallel must have the bloom and the features of beauty with grace and elegance in its motions to attract admiration the bloom and fine features the grace and elegance of a work consist in its style which is the part that is most recommendatory of it as outward beauty and grace are of a woman considered as an object of sight  the bloom and the features of composition lie in the verbage and figures of its style the grace in the manner and movement of that style  a work immoral and unwise has yet been found to live by its style in spite of these defects style is therefore a quality of writing equal if not superior to good sense for the latter without the former will by no means preserve a work tho the reverse of the rule is true indeed a fine style is commonly joined with good sense both being the offspring of the same luminous mind  can a work live long which is defective in style impossible homers style is the richest in the greek language style has preserved herodotus in spite of his absurdities every ancient who has reached us has an eminent style in his respective walk and manner style has saved all the latin writers who are only good imitators of the greeks terence is only the translator of menander sallust an imitator of thucydides horace is an imitator and almost a translator in all his odes as we may boldly pronounce on comparing them with such very minute fragments of grecian lyric poetry as have reached us yet it was he who exclaimed o imitatores servum pecus style has saved virgil entirely who has not the most distant pretense to any other attribute of a poet  good sense i have called the health of a work without which it cannot live but a work may live without much applause and the first quality of writing that attracts universal and permanent fame was the subject of the present discussion this we have found to be style  letter x to your observations on the barbarism of some modern customs may be added those which arise from the following lines of juvenal in his thirteenth satire coerula quis stupuit germani lumina flavam caesariem madido torquentem cornua cirro who would have thought that our sidecurls and frizzled toupee had such antiquity but along with that such barbarism as to be the fashion of the germans ere they left their native woods tacitus in his excellent book of the manners of the germans mentions their twisting their locks into horns and rings as he calls them it is curious to observe that a custom invented in the most barbarous times should again be brought into vogue at the most polite period  we see that both juvenal and tacitus have chanced on the same appellation in mentioning this strange piece of dress the curls bearing indeed a very strong resemblance to the horns of animals happy germans will some modern husbands be tempted to cry whose horns were only of hair how would juvenal stare if he came into a modern assembly and saw every man in the company have his horns non sine cauda  perhaps it has escaped you that the invention of hairpowder did not arise in the country of the plica polonica as some malicious antiquaries affirm fauchet in his antiquites gaulloises tells us that the kings of the merovingian race were in use to powder the hair of their heads and beards with gold dust an extravagance to which our beaux and belles may arrive in time  fashions may be laughed at but must be followed to avoid greater evils  letter xi i totally controvert your opinion that our language has arrived at its highest pitch of refinement so far from that i know of no writer before gray whose works are of classic correctness except milton  hume i remember tells us very gravely that the language of pope is too much refined as the language of some other writer whom he names is too little so but he gives parnell as a standard author between the two extremes this distinction is truly ridiculous and worthy of a critic of the french school for it has unluckily been discovered that pope improved the language of almost every line of parnell so that he is almost as much the author of parnells poems as parnell himself  by refinement here i mean a manner of writing more pure and of more exquisite figures than the run of even good composition miltons poetry is almost universally such but far less equally than that of gray who uses not a single word without a due value being stamped on it this is classic refinement in which not one word one syllable is superfluous or improper  popes works are superabundant with superfluous and unmeaning verbage his translations are even replete with tautology a fault which is to refinement as midnight is to noon day what is truly surprising is that the fourth book of the dunciad his last publication is more full of redundancy and incorrectness than his pastorals which are his first  but of any works which have obtained considerable applause thomsons poem of the seasons is the most incorrect any reader who understands grammar and classic composition is disgusted in every page of that poem by faults which tho in themselves minute yet to a refined eye hide and obscure every beauty however great as a very small intervening object will intercept the view of the sun this reason makes me very much suspect the fame of the seasons will not be of long existence for i know of no work that has inherited long reputation which is deficient in style as the seasons undoubtedly are to a most remarkable degree the fact is that the poem on which the future celebrity of thomson will be founded is by a strange fatality almost totally neglected at this day that is his castle of indolence a poem which has higher beauties than the seasons without any of the faults which disgrace that work tho the conclusion even of this is most absurd and unhappy and could never have occurred to a writer of taste except in a frightful dream  by the bye mr gray has closely imitated a stanza or two of the castle of indolence in his elegy as you will judge from comparing he exquisite description of the manner in which the poet is supposed to pass his time  often have we seen him at the peep of dawn etc with these lines of thomson not less exquisite  of all the gentle tenants of the place there was a man of special grave remark a certain tender gloom overspread his face pensive not sad in thought involved not dark as sweet this man could sing as morning lark and teach the noblest morals of the heart but these his talents were yburied stark of the fine stores he nothing would impart which or boon nature gave or naturepainting art to noontide shades incontinent he ran where purls the brook with sleep inviting sound or when dan sol to slope his wheels began amid the broom he baskd him on the ground where the wild thyme and camomoil are found there would he linger till the latest ray of light sat trembling on the welkins bound then homeward through the twilight shadows stray sauntering and slow so had he palled many a day when i speak of refinement as a perfection of writing you must observe i by no means recommend an affected and foolish refinement such as that of the spanish poets than which the most gross want of correctness is more allowable the refinement i would applaud is such as is truly classic such as we admire in the superior greek and roman authors such a refinement as is perfectly compatible with an elegant simplicity for you must observe my friend that the simplicity of the ancients is a refined simplicity the purity of their language and that of every good writer resembles that of wine which requires labor and time to effect not that of water which is common and of no price  letter xii ammianus marcellinus informs us of an observation which hormisdas a prince of persia made on rome and which is something remarkable namely that one thing only had there pleased him to find that men died at rome as well as elsewhere  mr gibbon in his history has told us to read displicuisse for placuisse displeased for pleased a correction to which those of bentley are innocent he says the contrary sense would be that of a misanthrope whereas his affords a reproof of roman vanity  the sense that strikes me is very different from either of these and is this that the princes envy at the pleasures of the inhabitants of rome could only be moderated by the reflection that their pleasures were transitory  how would the miserable envy the happy were not the grave the equal termination of pleasure and of pain  letter xiii your character of our deceased friend is undoubtedly just the goodness of his heart atoned even for the prejudices and caprice of his head  for what defects will not benevolence atone is not that virtue superior to every qualification must not genius itself hide its diminished head before the superior splendour of humble and uncelebrated worth  how contemptible do the brightest pursuits of fame appear when opposed to the modest merit of doing good to mankind how much sweeter are the soft whispers of gratitude than the loudest plaudits of popular praise  there is not surely a consideration that can be more productive of contempt of fame in a virtuous mind than this that the madman who ravages kingdoms and puts whole nations to the sword is looked on as a deity while he who rewards industry and relieves distress lives without renown and dies without pity  to real goodness my friend even the praise of real and innocent greatness which is that of the mind must yield for there is certainly more genuine merit in doing one good action than in writing an iliad  letter xiv an opinion that is opposite to virtue is always opposite to truth this maxim which tho expressed in few words is the fruit of much observation i have in no case found more applicable than in that most absurd popular error that extravagance and inattention to economy always accompany genius  we all flatter ourselves in our youth especially that we are possessed of that nondescript jewel called genius indeed if the term genius have so extensive a meaning as to imply capacity in general or capability as brown the celebrated layerout of grounds used the phrase we cannot deny that every one has genius of one kind or another a man may if you will have a very fine genius for stupidity a sort of genius which tho i have not observed to be mentioned in any treatise on the subject is yet at this day the most lucrative species of genius one can be possessed of  genius is in my estimation a word of ineffable reverence the gnostic abraxas itself is not to be weighed with it sometimes one man of genius rises in the space of one thousand years only sometimes indeed when nature is unusually rich three or four will appear in one country in the course of a century as was the case when bacon cromwell milton newton illuminated england together or at short successions but now good heaven every man every woman every child has genius i will venture to prophesy that in the year      from a natural progression of the word genius will imply folly the fact is i have met with no man who in describing genius did not tacitly paint himself  but to discuss the opinion mentioned in the beginning of this letter we shall for the present consider genius in the popular sense as merely opposed to want of capacity for any art or science and allow that middling quality which we imply when we call a person or  work ingenious to fall under the grand class of genius even allowing this we must still to form a proper judgment reason from the most high and perfect form in which genius appears as a chemist would not i imagine display the specific gravity of gold from that which is beat out to an inconceivable thinness and exility for gilding but from a solid mass of that metal  if we examine therefore the conduct of such men as all the world allows to have been endued with superlative genius we shall perceive that so far from being universally cursed with inattention to economy we shall perhaps not find one example of want of that virtue among them of homer we know nothing certain and to build arguments upon fable is to write on sand pindar tho extravagance itself in his writings yet was prudent enough to acquire great wealth by the sale of them and what is more to keep that wealth and use it with discretion a french writer has wittily put it as the strongest proof of pindars genius that he sold his writings well to those who could not understand a line of them findare etoit homme desprit en faut il dautres temoignages profond dans tout ce quil ecrit pindare etoit homme desprit a qui jamais rien ny comprit il sut bien vendre ses ouvrages pindare etoit homme desprit en faut il dautres temoignages anacreons luxury the ancients agree lay more in his writings than in his life in short of all the greek poets i remember none who is branded with extravagance much less any of their historians or philosophers  among the romans with whom it may be questioned if literary or scientific genius ever existed as i remember few writers in the latin tongue who are original or who in other words had a superlative genius yet we shall find that their ingenious men if you will labored under no stain of dissipation to mention their firstrate writers tacitus and others as men who paid the strictest attention to propriety were superfluous catullus one of their most licentious poets was yet no debauchee in his life if we may judge from his own deposition nam castum esse decet pium poetam ipsum versiculos nihil necesse est a sentence that surely would not have dropped from his pen did his own manners contradict it as we may always observe that writers adapt their words to their actions not their actions to their words  if we come now to our own country we shall find that genius has always been attended with economy chaucer acquired wealth by his genius and left it perfect to his heirs so did shakspere bacon it must be confessed may be urged on the other side of the question but the dissipation of his wealth was owing to no habit of extravagance on his part but to his indulgence to his servants and to absence of mind milton out of his shattered fortune found means from strict economy to leave a comfortable subsistence to his wife and family newtons decency of life is well known to conclude with pope who indeed can only rank with ingenious men he amassed a considerable fortune which he used with the strictest economy and propriety a conduct which however does not atone for his always mentioning in his poems poverty as matter of reproach to others and thus eternally blaspheming the providence that had made him rich  this leads me to observe by the bye the falsity of another popular opinion which is that poetry and poverty are as nearly related in fact as in sound as poor as a poet is almost a proverb and took its rise from the itinerant minstrels who in former times were poets by real profession or by trade but few seem to know that no bard of classic days has reached us whom we do not know to have been moderately rich except homer who for aught certain may have been a petty king just as likely as a beggar and that modern times afford no real poets who were poor except spenser and tasso even with regard to the first of these we have no proof and the poverty of the latter was that of a man of high birth not of a mendicant  letter xv i do not wonder that your search after bishop halls satires has failed of success for perhaps there are few books in the language which are more uncommon after reading that pope upon their being shown him when he was far advanced in life expressed great applause of them and much regret that he had not chanced to see them sooner i do not wonder at your eagerness on this head which in some measure to gratify i send you extracts of his most shining passages  the work opens with a kind of poetical preface called a defiance to envy the three first lines of which are much in the spirit of our authors great cotemporary shakspere nay let the

picturesque style of lucretius  could no unhusked akorne leave the tree but there was challenge made whose it might be this couplet of sat ii is divine and a perfect specimen of the moral sublime  thy monument make thou thy living deeds no other tomb than that true virtue needs in sat iii ridiculing a citizens pompous feast he concludes  for whom he means to make an often guest one dish shall serve  and welcome make the rest these lines in contempt of ostentatious charity are excellent  who ever gives a pair of velvet shoes to the holy rood or liberally allows but a new rope to ring the curfew bell but he desires that his great deed may dwell or graven in the chancelwindowglass or in the lasting tomb of plated brass this ludicrous description in satire v must not be passed over  late traveling along in london way me met as seemed by his disguised array a lusty courtier whose curled head with abron locks was fairly furnished i him saluted in our lavish wise he answers my untimely courtesies his bonnet veiled ere ever he could think the unruly wind blows off his periwinke he lights and runs and quickly has him sped to overtake his overruning head etc it is with regret i observe that satire vi of this third book is foolish and absurd to the most contemptible degree and totally unworthy of the author it ought in justice to all the rest to be struck out of every future edition in which the fame of the author is at all consulted  of sat ii book iv these lines have no small merit  let sweetmouthd mercia bid what crowns she please for halfred cherries or green garden pease or the first artichoaks of all the year to make so lavish cost for little cheer when lolio feasteth in his revelling fit some starved pullen scoures the rusted spit for else how should his son maintained be at inns of court or of the chancery there to learn law and courtly carriage to make amends for his mean parentage where he unknown and ruffling as he can goes current each where for a gentleman in the same satire speaking of a bankrupt he says  that has been long in shady shelter pent imprisoned for fear of prisonment the last of the thoughts in this quatrain has genuine wit  whose mention were alike to thee as lieve as a catchpolls fist unto a bankrupts sleeve or an hos ego from old petrarchs spright unto a plagiary sonnetwright these verses of the same satire are excellent  how i foresee in many ages past where lolios caytive name is quite defaced thine heir thine heirs heir and his heir again from out the loins of careful lolian shall climb up to the chancel pewes on high and rule and reign in their rich tenancy when perched aloft to perfect their estate they rack their rents unto a treble rate and hedge in all the neighbor common lands and clodge their slavish tenants with commands whiles they poor souls with feeling sigh complain and wish old lolio were alive again and praise his gentle soul and wish it well and of his friendly facts full often tell afterward speaking of the proud heirs purchasing a pedigree and arms of the herald he wittily adivses him to take for the latter  the scottish barnacle if i might choose that of a worm does wax a winged goose these characters in sat iii are very well  ventrous fortunio his farm has sold and gads to guianeland to fish for gold meeting perhaps if orenoque deny some straggling pinnace of polonian rye then comes home floating with a silken sail that severne shakes with his cannon peal wiser raymundus in his closet pent laughs at such danger and aventurement whey half his lands are spent in golden smoke and now his second hopeful glass is broke but yet if happily his third furnace hold devoteth all his pots and pans to gold i know of no classic writer to whom the above lines would not do honor  this stroke in the same satire is truly in the arch style of horace  florian the sire did women love alive and so his son does too all but his wife of satire iv take this specimen  hye wanton gallio and wed betime why should thou leese the pleasures of thy prime see thou the roseleaves fall ungathered then hye thee wanton gallio to wed let ring and ferule meet upon thine hand and lucines girdle with her swathingband hye thee and give the world yet one dwarf more such as it got when thou thyselfe wast bore look not for warning of thy bloomed chin  can ever happiness too soon begin the following strokes of sat vii are admirable i must premise however that aquine here means juvenal who was of aquinum not thomas aquinas as one might imagine from this very illimagined patronymic  when once i think if carping aquines spright to see now rome were licensed to the light how his enraged ghost would stamp and stare that caesars throne is turned to peters chair to see an oldshorn lozell perched high crossing beneath a golden canopy the whiles a thousand hairlesse crowns crouch low to kiss the precious case of his proud toe and for the lordly fasces borne of old to see two quiet crossed keys of gold or cybeles shrine the famous pantheons frame turned to the honor of our ladys name but that he most would gaze and wonder at is the horned mitre and the bloody hat the crooked staff their coules strange form an store save that he saw the same in hell before virgils varium et mutabile semper foemina h been much applauded the following sly insinuation i think exceeds it  was ever feather or fond womans mind more light than words the blasts of idle wind sat i b these lines of the same satire deserve selection  would it not vex thee where thy sires did keep to see the dunged folds of dogtayld sheep and ruined house where holy things were said whose freestone walls the thatched roof upbraid whose shrill saintsbell hangs on his levery while the rest are damned to the plumbery yet pure devotion lets the steeple stand and idle battlements on either hand lest that perhaps were all these relics gone furius his sacrilege could not be known the following lines of the next satire are exceedingly well  look to the towred chimnies which should be the wind pipes of good hospitality through which it breaths to the open air betokening life and liberal welfare lo there the unthankful swallow takes her rest and fills the tunnel with her circled nest in the same satire the black prince is an unhappy appellation of pluto as that name is almost appropriated to one of the greatest of english heroes  the beginning of sat iii is fortunate  the satire should be like the porcupine that shoots sharp quils out in each angry line and wounds the blushing cheek and fiery eye of him that hears and reads guiltily ye antique satires how i bless your days that brookd your bolder style  their own dispraise and well near wish yet joy my wish is vain i had been then or they been now again in the first couplet above quoted however a simile is confounded with a metaphor  the following allusions are not unlucky  yet certes moecha is a platonist to all they say but whosoever do not list because her husband a far traffickd man is a professed peripatecian in book vi and last which consists of only one satire speaking of a factor who knows he is in his lords last will and of his pretended grief at the sickness or his patron he proceeds  then turns his back and smiles and looks askance seasning again his sorrowd countenance whiles yet he wearies heaven with daily cries and backward death with devout sacrifice that they would now his tedious ghost bereavn and wishes well that wished no worse than heaven there is a curious mixture of the manner of shakspere and pope in the above quotation and in the following there is as curious an anticipation  go ariost and gape for what may fall from trencher of a flattering cardinal and if thou gettest but a pedants fee thy bed thy board and coarser livery o honor far beyond a brazen shrine to sit with tarleton on an aleposts sign the following ridicule of the then fashionable style of writing shows that our authors taste was as just as his composition is excellent  he knows the grace of that new elegance which sweet philisides fetched of late from france that well beseemd his highstild arcady tho others mar it with much liberty in epithetes to join two words in one forsooth for adjectives cannot stand alone as a great poet could of bacchus say that he was semelefemorigena the following stroke upon false descriptions of beauty is witty  another thinks her teeth might likend be to two fair ranks of pales of ivory to fence in sure the wildbeast of her tongue from either going far or going wrong i shall conclude with observing that no poet in our language has had so little justice done him as the writer of these satires it must be owned that in reading satire we expect to find real characters which are here wanting every attempt of this kind being the evident product of the authors invention only and it must likewise be confessed that the whole work smells more of the scholar than of the man of the world to compensate these small faults this volume displays a correctness and manliness of thought that for the age of conceits in which it was published are quite wonderful and in general a beauty and harmony of versification that leave little to wish were my suffrage of any weight bishop hall should instantly burst from the cloud which still envelops him and like another aeneas receive at once the honor due to his merit  letter xvi you wonder at my assertion on a former occasion letter ix  that virgil has not the most distant pretense to any attribute of a poet except that of a fine style to vindicate my opinion from the charge of rashness i now submit to you my reasons it is indeed dangerous to attack the reputation of a good writer as i allow virgil to be in any respect for if your assault is not supported by a strong host of arguments it will recoil upon yourself but as i know your liberality of sentiment too well to fear your pronouncing hastily upon an opinion merely because it controverts your ideas or those of the world at large i shall lay what i call my proofs before you without hesitation  it is agreed by all the critics that genius known by invention as a cause from its effect is the very first power and praise of a poet i believe however the most sanguine admirer of virgil will allow that not one ray of invention appears through his whole works his eclogues considered as works of invention are beneath all contempt where he has not followed the tract of theocritus he has wandered into childish absurdity witness the pollio in which because some senators wife was brought to bed of a chopping boy he prophesies the golden age will return i know some christian writers have applied this prophetic eclogue to an higher event  but i see you smile in contempt  and i pass the dreams of fanaticism witness the sixth eclogue into which a system of philosophy has crept by some strange backdoor or other a critic in the adventurer has pronounced all the pastorals of virgil exceptionable except the first and tenth now in these there is no invention both of them as that critic allows deriving their superiority from their being founded on real events i conclude therefore that virgil is in his pastorals no poet but merely an excellent versifier  if we proceed to the georgics we shall find as few marks of genius in them as in the pastorals in spite of the blind admiration which has been paid that poem the subject is confessedly unhappy for virgil in this was the imitator of hesiod as in his pastorals of theocritus and in his aeneid of homer o imitatores servum pecus was the just exclamation of his more ingenious cotemporary horace how blind my friend must those be who could not infer if this remark be just how little is virgil virgil whose whose fame rests upon three specimens of imitation  to examine the georgics by the criterion of invention which is that of genius and true poetry we must confess that in a didactic poem the precepts are quite out of the province of invention and for this reason the didactic is the lowest of all the kinds of poetry but the georgics are allowed to be virgils chief work the work on which his fame principally rests tho he afterward aspired to be an epic writer what an epic writer and it follows that at the most virgil is but an excellent didactic writer even in the opinion of his most sanguine admirers that is if you please we will grant for a moment that he stands first in the very meanest rank of poetry surely no high praise  where is his fame as a poet if it is proved that even this praise slender as it is is yet infinitely too high for him yet this will be easily proved to those whose minds are not secured from the light of truth by the impenetrable shades of prejudice  a didactive poem must be written in such a style as to be understood by those to whom it is addressed if painting for example is the subject the language ought to be such as may be understood by any painter of common intelligence this rule universally just as it is must always be followed else the absurdity were as great as if a country curate should preach to his staring parishioners in hebrew and expect they should follow precepts which it was impossible they should understand common sense my friend which is so uncommon a thing among the critics and yet which enables any man to judge better of writing than all the capricious dictates of criticism teaches us that the necessity of following this rule is indispensable yet it has not been followed by virgil who writes to country farmers in a most elaborate and to them impenetrably obscure style who can help smiling to see him constantly addressing himself to people who as he well knew could not possibly understand him yet he is called the judicious virgil by those who can see very near as far as their noses with the help of a borrowed lanthorn  why dwell on particular absurdities of a production which in its very essence is absurdity itself yet we must not pass the episodes and ornaments of the georgics which have been hitherto allowed the very brightest proofs virgil has given of genius or invention let us weigh these proofs if possible in the very scales which critical justice holds  the invocation to caesars spirit the spirit of a tyrant who trampled on the liberties of his country could never have been written by a poet of real genius for invincible honesty of mind has always been its attendant fulsome flattery and adulation unworthy of the soul of a slave constitute the merits of virgil in this admired address may execration pursue his memory who has placed a crown on the brows of a tyrant that were much too bright for the best of kings the signs preceding the death of julius enumerated in the end of the book are in the same style with the address superstitious offerings on the altar of slavery they who find invention in either of these ornaments are welcome to feed on it mixed up with a little whipped cream  i allow it were prejudice alone that could induce a reader to deny the beauty of the panegyric on a country life which closes the second book but at the same time it may be safely said that there are no marks in it of a superlative poet of invention there are surely none nor of originality for the theme has been in all ages of poetry a trite one virgil in this passage therefore as in others only displays great skill in the mechanical part of poetry but leaves the praise of a great poet to happier rivals  the description of the plague in the end of the third book is evidently in imitation of lucretius only more full and rich but facile est inventis addere and this episode may give virgil the fame of a happy imitator but never that of a true poet  the story of aristaeus in the last book displays not the powers of ovid tho superior in chastity of versification but who ever said ovid was a poet  i trust it will appear from this deduction that virgil has not in his pastorals nor in his georgics given any proofs of genius invention or that which properly constitutes a poet  the aeneid shall if you like the subject be examined some future opportunity and will i know add still less renown to virgil as a creator  yet virgil deserves all his fame a paradox you will say worthy of rousseau  letter xvii your observation that there is a fatality which attends the reputation of authors as well as other human affairs is undoubtedly just how else shall we account for miltons immortal poem lingering so slowly into fame while the most vapid productions of some of his cotemporaries acquired an instant celebrity as wide as it was illfounded  dubos has given us a curious theory of the manner in which works of merit attain their due reputation his reflections like those of other french critics are specious without value and massy without solidity let us strike against them perhaps the truth will fly out  new productions says he are at first appreciated by judges of very different characters people of the trade and the public they would be very soon estimated at their just value if the public was as capable of defending its opinion and making it weigh properly as it knows how to take the just side but it has the easiness to allow its judgment to be embarrassed by persons who profess the art to which the new production belongs these persons are often apt to make a false report for reasons which we will explain they obscure the truth in such a manner that the public remains for some time in uncertainty or in error it does not know precisely what title the new work merits the public remains undecided on the question if it is good or bad on the whole and it even sometimes believes people of the profession who deceive it but it only believes them for a very short time  that first period being elapsed the public appreciates a work at its just value and gives it the rank which it deserves or condemns it to utter oblivion it is never deceived because it judges disinterestedly and because it judges by sentiment  such are the reflections of the abbe du bos whom i will readily allow to be the most judicious of the french critics if that is any praise truth is against them let us examine their justice by an illustrious instance  paradise lost was sold by john milton to his bookseller on the twentyseventh day of april      during the witty and ingenious reign of charles ii when dryden was at the head of poetry and criticism did it instantly astonish the world as if a new sun had arisen no three years passed changes of titles and other bookselling arts were employed ere a small impression could be sold tho not one of the trade of poetry perplexed the public opinion dryden who was at the head of that trade was the first to perceive and to applaud its beauties criticism was the general pursuit of that age which was fully as enlightened on that head as the present what happened them would have happened now in the year      miltons divine poem would have met exactly the same reception as in      and why the answer is evident the work was in a style of poetry above the popular conception and the judgment of true judges tho it always prevails yet prevails with as much slowness as certainty  in this lies the grand mistake of du bos he supposes the public judges for itself it is always led by peculiar opinions and the rectitude of its sentiments depends entirely upon the superiority of its leaders being founded in truth or merely in fashion by the public i understand with him people of some knowledge and some reading a man who reads for his amusement books in his own language and can talk a little on what he reads may afford a kind of abstract idea of what is meant by the public now i will venture to compute from real observation that not    out of  00 who pretend to admire milton are capable of understanding that writer why then has he a place in their libraries because he is mentioned with high applause by writers of reputation  had not addison written his superficial criticism on milton which is indeed adapted to the meanest capacity other men of learning would have brought him into vogue for a superior poet is always the poet of the learned before he is that of the public at large  witness the comus lallegro il penseroso the exquisite productions of the same author which remained a feast for the learned alone for near a century after their publication they were published in      and were taken no notice of the comus lallegro il penseroso were taken no notice of at a period when we sometimes find the tenth edition upon masses of metrical nonsense that are now unknown to have existed let the public after this judge for itself a second edition of these divine poems did not appear till      and even then they were not republished because they were called for but because they made a sizeable volume with his paradise regained then first published  what is the reason of such poems falling into silence is it not because those learned en who happened to see and admire them  o opportunity of recommending them to  notice  at the same time it must be observed that it is the impartial uninfluenced opinion of men of learning that commands the public judgment not that of such men of learning as are friends of the author for such decisions the public however highly it may rate the abilities of him who pronounces them yet has always discernment enough to set aside  seldom does it even happen that the opinion of cotemporary men of learning influences the public which is the reason that the works of any living writer are very seldom justly appreciated yet it may so happen that a writer from a happy circumstance may acquire a reputation as just as it is instantaneous this was the case with the late mr gray who by his happening to be conversant in fashionable company gained a complete century in point of reputation for tho fashionable writers are mot justly set in opposition to good the very epithet implying that their works will not last yet fashion is now and then in the right as well as other fools  it is above observed that the opinion of cotemporary judges decides not that of the public the truth is there are works of superlative merit of which the most learned cotemporary can form no true estimate for works of uncommon excellence require to be viewed at a certain distance and in a certain light to have their due effect set a picture of raphaels against the blaze of the noonday sun and its beauties will be as little discerned as at midnight let me add that an eminent writer is seldom the writer of his own times his mature mind precedes the advancement of his art and language very often by a full century so that one hundred years and sometimes more must elapse ere the public has acquired intelligence enough to judge of him  letter xviii as i know your admiration of shakspere and your fondness for any new remarks illustrative of the works of that wonderful poet i shall make no apology for laying before you such observations as have occurred to me in reading the last edition of his plays      i shall follow the

passage informing us that shakspere may have caught this idea from the common seal of the knights templars the device of which was two riding upon one horse is truly in the spirit of a man who has lost his own ideas in the pursuit of those of antiquity for the sentence in the text which seems proverbial must have arisen to the meanest peasant from an object almost every day before his eyes  p

loves labors lost upon this couplet when for fames sake for praise an outward part we bend to that the working of the heart is this wonderful note which i need not tell you is by warburton the harmony

faults than any that has yet appeared if i find these slight notes give you any amusement they shall be continued on future occasions  letter xix i by no means agree with you that lyric poetry may almost be put among the arts known to the ancients but lost to us indeed f you consider lyric poetry in its ancient aceptation only as wedded to use miltons trong expression to music perhaps the modern ay in this view yield to the ancient tho even his i believe might be controverted by those who have heard drydens ode and miltons l penseroso and lallegro accompanied by he music of handel but divesting lyric oetry of its scenic representation and considering it solely as the amusement of the cloet i deny that the modern is inferior to the ncient and indeed the simple perusal or recital  now the only way in which any just parallel an be instituted as the ancient music is utterly st  nor do i agree with you that the modern lyric poets of any rank are less numerous than the ancient and to support my difference of opinion submit to you some short account of the former this i do the more readily as i know your studies have not been much extended on this subject  our researches on this head shall be confined to the modern lyric poetry of italy of france and of england the spanish writers in this line lopez de vega gongora etc i leave to those who have a soul lofty enough to understand bombast and grovelling enough to understand nonsense those writers who do not know the art of gilding lead may learn it of the spanish poets the works of uz the german i cannot pretend to speak of as i hope i shall never study high dutch but were they of any value i doubt not but some of them would have appeared before this in a more intelligible tongue  to begin then with the italians petrarca shines in the very first rank of honor as of age one or two of his odes or canzoni have already letter viii been said in a former letter to be excellent and one excellent ode is as much preferable to a number of middling ones those of horace for instance as a piece of gold is to a number of pieces of silver his sonnets i do not consider as lyric but as elegiac  not to speak of bembo casa or molza the odes of chiabrera have often grand passages tho he is more commonly a seicento by which name the italians understand a writer of the seventeenth century when a false taste was introduced by marini in place of the pure slyle which had reigned till that time  some of the anacreontic odes of menzini are as fine pieces as have been produced in that very delicate and difficult mode of composition  guidi sometimes catches the true lyric spirit but more often his fire is lost in smoke so that he frequently reverses the observation of horace non fumum ex fulgore etc  of the works of fulvio testi i must profess much esteem tho they seem neglected by his countrymen he appears to have attained the genuine texture of lyric thought and style more than any other italian poet i know without exception his images are frequently very rich and happy for example might he adduced the whole famous ode to montecuculli which cost the author his life particularly the beginning

is almost unknown in this country certainly if the reverence of italy secures the first place among her lyric poets to petrarch the second is due to testi but if just criticism were consulted in the affair i suspect she would divide the throne between them and place the rest at their footstool every reader i believe must confess that there are in the above extracts the grandeur and opulence of pindar the neatness beauty and elegance of anacreon mingled with the pathos which the ancients ascribe to simonides perhaps in another century the italians will begin to see and admire his merit tho what cloud should obscure his splendour from them i cannot guess yet some reason there must be for his not receiving due applause among his countrymen as i know none of their critics who have spoken of him as he deserves and very few indeed who have mentioned him at all i suppose he was a member of no academy  lest my letter should extend to an unreasonable length i shall defer my observations on the french and english lyric writers till my next  letter xx if the french have any title to a legitimate poetry it is that of the lesser lyric style their language pretty and familiar can never rise to the sublime which indeed so far as i can see their poets of any class have never yet attained not excepting corneille himself whose vaunted quil mourut is to a british reader a very trivial thought we should deny the french with their epic poems tragedies and comedies in rhyme any poetry at all were it not for such writers as la fontaine in the lesser narrative and malherbe chaulieu de la motte and the elder rousseau in the lyric  ronsard was once a fashionable lyric writer in france and nothing can be a stronger proof of the false taste of his age we have in our days seen a writer fashionable because he used a pedantic jargon of roman english ronsard was likewise fashionable in his day because he wrote in grecian french i hope by and bye the time will come when the most distant imitation of the sentiments and manner of classic writers for example boileaus of horace and juvenal will become as it deserves as ridiculous and contemptible as ronsards adoption of their verbage and idiom  malherbe has great merit as the refiner and restorer of the french language but i know of only one ode he has written which may yet be read with pleasure and that is the one addressed to the duke of bellegarde  chaulieus character and works you well know he is read more and de la motte less than he ought to be the real beauties of de la mottes odes are thicker sown than those of any other french writer  rousseaus ode to fortune has been much praised but in my opinion yields to that addressed to the marquis de la fare which has great merit witness these stanzas loin que la raison nous eclaire et conduise nos actions nous avons trouve lart den fair lorateur de nos passions cest un sophiste qui nous joue un vil complaisant qui se love a tous les fous de lunivers qui shabillans du nom

il ne regrette point la perte de ces arts dont la decouverte a lhomme a coute tant de soins et qui devenus necessaires nont fait quaugmenter nos miseres en multipliant nos besoins   the merit of gresset in some of his lyric poems you well know i need not therefore dwell upon it and as i know no other of the french lyric writers who deserve mention i shall pass to the english after just observing that boileaus noted ode so replete with tinsel and with nonsense proves that he had not the smallest spark of poetical genius and that he could not even have arisen above the meanest class of scriblers had he not been the very ape of the ancients and had the address and agility of that animal sometimes to jump on the shoulders of his masters and the impudent ignorance to look big when dressed in their clothes  the list of english lyric poets contains the names of waller milton cowley dryden collins gray and akenside not to mention the earl of surrey who is more venerable from his age than valuable from his composition waller has no merit save that of malherbe in france that of polishing and refining the language of his country he has even less merit than malherbe his pages being evident proofs of that old doubt datur vacuum i have read him over thrice to see upon what his fame stands but could not observe one image sentiment or expression that spoke the poet the fact is his fame is founded upon his estate which was of five thousand a year a wide foundation for renown his language which is by no means valuable now and of consequence no foundation for present fame was the amber that preserved his weeds from rotting but as that is no longer in price the whole editions of his works may be thrown into the fire without any diminution english poetry why should i dwell on the worth of milton in his lyric works of lycidas il penseroso lallegro or of dryden in his celebrated ode cowleys pindarics may accompany wallers works with all my heart one or two of his anacreontics are good the merit of collins lies in his tender melancholy his defects are confusion and incorrectness of style gray is the first and greatest of modern lyric writers nay i will venture to say of all lyric writers his works tho few alas how few uniting the perfections of every lyric poet both of present and former times tho akenside considered as a lyric writer wants richness of images and melody his style will ever render what he has done in this way valuable  thus i have now enumerated all the modern reputable authors of lyric poetry they are not few and i hope you are now convinced that they yield not to the ancient in number nor in merit tho the lyric muse is now almost confined to the private cell of study and seldom appears in her ancient glory attended by the richest music and graced with the audience of heroes  letter xxi that five acts should be considered as an essential division of a perfect drama rather than any other number is perhaps one of the strangest instances its which reverence for a rule laid down by an ancient poet whose infallibility has never yet been proved has totally got the better of common sense and of the superiority of modern science  i remember that vitruvius gives a reason perhaps as well grounded as any can be for this arbitrary division namely that the dramatic poets divided their fables into parts by a cubical ratio diviserunt spatia fabularum in parts cubica ratione  that is as mr dacier explains it that the four songs of the chorus between the acts joined with the prologue and exode formed the cubic number six the most perfect of numbers a reason that could only have occurred to an architect yet perhaps as well grounded as any that can be given for a custom which admits of no reason it something resembles a rule which menage in his notes on tassos aminta tells us is laid down by the signior giovan ogerio gombaldo a personage as menage takes care to inform us intelligentissimo delle cose della poesia dramnatica most expert in dramatic business this rule is that the principal ladies in dramatic poems ought not to appear at the opening of the piece when the first scenes are supposed to pass in the morning if the affair is not very important indeed for why for reason good and weighty essendo proprio delle done it levarsi tardi limpiegar molto tempo in abbellirsi a farsi aspettare it being usual for ladies to rise late to take a long time to dress and to give long expectation before they appear hear ye dramatic poets of our impolite age learn wisdom and bow with reverence to the manes of signior giovan ogerio gombaldo  jesting apart we all know that horaces rule is not authorized by the greek masters of the drama their plays being often divided into three four six seven eight but seldom if ever into five acts in the intervals between these divisions the chorus sung and interludes were performed for casaubon in his learned work de satyrica poesi will have it that between the acts the scene was often totally vacant of the tragic representation and that the satypika or farces were played to relieve the audience from the melancholy feelings of tragedy a practice we would recommend as a further improvement to those semiliterati among us who wish to revive the ancient chorus accompanied with music but who would stare were they told by somebody who had read two books that they are as far from the ancient drama as ever the whole of it being always accompanied with music i think however the taste of the ancients might be vindicated from casaubons accusation as i differ from that learned man in his interpretation of the passage on which it is founded it is of marius victorinus the grammarian and stands as follows haec apud graecos metri species iambica frequens est sub hac conditionis lege ut not heroas aut reges sed satyros inducat ludendi jocandique causa quo spectatoris animus inter tristes res tragicas satyrorum jocis relaxetur casaubon observes that the same phrase inter res tragicas is likewise used on the same occasion by diomedes another grammarian which i suppose only arises from the ones copying the other and that the phrase in both only implies inter cogitationes rerum tragicarum as a spectator may be said to be inter res tragicas occupied with tragic affairs as well immediately after the performance of a tragedy as during its representation  but to come to the point i have a great veneration for the ancients but a far greater for truth and common sense and it may i believe be safely asserted that had the ancients arrived at our perfection in the drama a subject perhaps of future discussion they would upon omission of the chorus have confined their drama to three as of modern duration as the most proper form and length douglas one of the shortest of our tragedies has upwards of   00 lines the edipus tyrannus of sophocles one of the longest of antiquity has but      with all its choruses which make no part of the proper dramatic action and only correspond to our music between the acts deduct  00 lines belonging to the chorus of edipus and douglas will exceed it by  00 lines or the length of two acts if douglas therefore had but three acts it were equal in length to the ancient tragedies  this with an admirer of the ancients may perhaps afford a strong argument for the reduction of our drama to a shorter duration but let us bring still stronger arguments from our own reason nay from that of the ancients themselves  plato has observed in his parmenides that a whole action always consists of three parts a beginning a middle and an end aristotle in his book on poetry has with great justice applied this observation but without acknowleging its author to the drama connecting it with the conduct of the fable in these words the beginning is that part which gives no room to suppose that any thing ought to have preceded it he means in the representation and which necessarily implies that something must follow the end is quite the reverse for it implies that nothing should follow it but that something must have preceded it the middle implies that something must precede it and likewise something follow this observation may be far more happily employed in the division of the drama the first act or beginning will then fix the spectators attention by opening the plot and raising his expectation the second or middle will further continue his perplexity till he is utterly at a loss to conceive how the piece will terminate and the third or end will relieve him from that embarassment and agreeable anxiety after it is carried to the utmost by an unexpected yet natural catastrophe  aristotle likewise praises the length adjudged to the ancient drama because the spectator was able clearly to recollect and compare every circumstance from beginning to end the ancient drama as we have already seen is shorter by the duration of two acts than the modern and the observation of aristotle will not apply to the modern drama for it is so long that it is not easy for the spectator to recapitulate and observe the progress of so lengthened a story perplexed and ravelled as every good drama is  another strong reason is that the authors of modern dramatic perfomances always labor so much under the duration they must extend their plot to that they are forced of necessity to have recourse to foreign and adventitious circumstances merely to eke out their pieces to a proper length hence our love episodes and under plots and many of the other glaring absurdities of the modern theater our dramatic writers never having found out that the length alloted was more than any pure unmixed single action one of the most essential attributes of the drama would admit of either according to the practice of the ancients or common reason and observation  from these arguments i look upon the division of the fable into three acts into a beginning a middle and an end as the most perfect compact and elegant that the higher drama will admit tho indeed i see not so great reason against four as against five acts when the plot requires a longer period than usual to adjust and deduce five and seven strike every mind as uncouth and heterogeneous numbers this remark you will say has no great depth nor philosophy but what have our amusements the subjects of our present examination to do with depth or philosophy five modern acts may be looked upon as almost too long a duration for any fable fit for dramatic representation four have been admitted by one of our best living writers with much success the usual division of the drama here combated is one proof among many of the power of custom above that of truth and of nature ond e dal corso suo quasi smarrita nostra natura vinta dal costume   letter xxii there is a figure of speech which i know not if you have taken notice of and yet it occurs in one or two popular writers nay writers who have some just claim to praise if as a trope it must have a greek name call it anoia in english utter absurdity  cervantes has shown no small skill in the use of this figure in book iii chapters ix xi of the history of don quesada where we find sancho had his provision safe after it was taken from him by the galley slaves and where almost in one page we read that he has lost his ass that he is riding on him and that he walks because he has no such humble convenience when the truth is that the author had so far gone to sleep as to forget that no miracles are now wrought upon asses and that if gines de passamonte had him sancho could not in book iv chap iii we also find the hero of the work draw his sword after he was robbed of it  i might enumerate one or two more instances from prose writers of repute but shall content myself with adding one instance from a roman and one from a british poet as the figure does not stand much in need of illustration  virgil in his eneid book xii v    makes latinus speak thus to turnus  recalent nostro tiberina fluenta sanguine adhuc campique ingentes ossibus albent in the name of all the profundity of dullness how could the streams be yet hot with their blood and their bones whiten the ground  james thomson in his poem called spring among his seasons has with great tenderness of heart pleaded as from his very bowels against the inhuman practice of killing oxen to make beef stakes and almost told us he would rather want his stake than have any such doings nay what is still more tender he advises us not to torment poor worms by putting them upon the hook alive  upon the hook for what purpose why to catch fish sure which he proceeds to give us cool directions for as a fine diversion  strait as above the surface of the flood they wanton rise or urged by hunger leap then fix with gentle twitch the barbed hook some lightly tossing to the grassy bank and to the shelving shore slow dragging some o jamie jamie had you no bowels for fish the poor man forgot that fish had feelings i suppose because he was fond of catching and eating them whereas killing of oxen was quite out of his way  letter xxiii i propose in this letter to continue and conclude my examination of the merits of virgil as a poet which i began on a former occasion letter xvi  this scrutiny has already been extended to his bucolics and georgics and shall in the last place be applied to his eneid which is confessed by his admirers to be much inferior to his georgics a poem before shown to have very little claim to applause let us examine this eneid with regard to its plan its characters and its language the grand divisions of epic poetry  if we take ever so cursory a view of the fable of the eneid we shall perceive it to be servilely copied from homers two immortal poems the iliad and the odyssey the last of these gives the general design of the first six books of the eneid the iliad of the six last the story of dido which is considered as the only proof that virgil gives of originality or genius in all the eneid even by his admirers themselves is a most injudicious and absurd imitation of homers circe it is injudicious because dido from her courage and manly spirit shown in leading a colony from her native realm to a remote and barbarous land and settling and ruling that colony there must in the book of human nature page first be read to have been a character very little susceptible of tender passions far less of carrying them to such excess as virgil represents it is injudicious because dido had formerly borne the loss of a husband without desperation ny had shown a spirit upon the occasion almost too heroic for a woman there is therefore no consistency in the character of dido which is certainly one of the grossest faults any writer can be guilty of it is injudicious because there is likewise in this love story an inconsistency in the character of eneas which any schoolboy would be ashamed of the character of eneas is that of perfect piety the pious eneas gratifies the irregular passions of a fond woman and then in return for the kindness she has shown to him and his followers he forsakes her without remorse because the gods command him so to do impious virgil would a greek reader have cried homer only wounded the bodies of the gods and their lesser morals but you have struck at their very vitals their essence you have made them guilty of cruelty of injustice of ingratitude itself eneas if he was pious ought to have known that his gods could not be guilty of impiety and to have disdained any imputation to the contrary tho communicated in a vision this story is lastly utterly absurd and might have been added to our instances of that figure of speech because in defiance of chronology and of propriety virgil brings characters together as living at the same period the no less than   0 years asunder what should we say of a writer who should now introduce into an epic poem alexander the great making love to julia the daughter of augustus yet this were not so absurd by near a century as the amor of eneas with dido  why should i be condemned to follow virgil through all his feeble imitations of homer in the plan and conduct of the eneid virgils storm is homers tho homer would not have begun with it the conversations of the gods are all homers virgil meets venus ulysses nausicaa the story of dido has already been spoken of homer has games virgil has games his very ships which he introduces as a novelty prove him incapable of originality for their accidents are from homers races homers ships are on fire virgils are on fire if ulysses goes to hell eneas goes to hell if homer enumerates the forces of both parties so does virgil the tale of cacus is indeed a puerility and the passage in which eneas is represented as going his own ambassador an absurdity that would not have entered even into the dreams of homer virgil indeed found the latter ludicrous invention of a prince and general leaving his army when surrounded by enemies in order to go an embassy which the faithful achates was certainly the sit person to mediate i say he found this necessary to introduce the affected and silly episode of nisus and euryalus which is wondrous pitiful homer describes the shield of achilles so does virgil that of eneas virgil then sends iris to turnus to let him know that eneas was absent from his army at a time when there was the strongest necessity for his presence and that it is a lucky hit turn quod optanti divum promittere nemo auderet volvenda dies en attulit ultro nay to increase the absurdity she tells turnus that his wise competitor is gone not to procure a proper martial aid but to arm the country collectos armat agrestes wonderful contrivance how we should have laughed at it in blackmore turnus takes the advice and attacks the trojan camp because hector had attacked that of the greeks the night scene and slaughter is a poor copy of that in the iliad ulysses and diomed were the proper personages of such an action not two boys like nisus and euryalus incredulus odi the whole scene of the camp is such a copy of homers scene at the ships as a wooden print is of a painting of corregio in the tenth book the gods come in again to fill up the story who will hint the most distant comparison of the return of eneas with that of achilles tho evidently a paltry copy achilles leaves the fight from the most potent reasons eneas leaves the camp and the conflict merely that he may return the death of pallas by the bye a most improper name for a man as it breeds an eternal confusion with the goddess pallas or minerva is that of patroclus quantum mutatus ab illo the funeral of pallas is also that of patroclus the embassies for burying the dead etc etc are all from homer not a death in the subsequent battle but from him the combat of eneas and turnus the leading feature of the twelfth and last book every one perceives at first sight to be a servile and pitiful imitation of that of achilles and hector  so much for the plan and fable of the eneid if we examine its characters we shall find it still more defective defective to a degree below contempt it has been said by virgils admirers that homer had exhausted strong and martial characters therefore virgil was forced to have recourse to gentle ones gentle characters for an heroic poem the fact is that all virgils characters such as they are consist of copies or remote imitations of homer and that homers subservient his lowest characters are virgils first and highest ones wonderful poet judicious imitator to compare all the characters were tedious and needless but be assured that upon accurate enquiry every character whatever of the eneid may be found in the iliad or odyssey in as strong a degree as the plot and leading incidents above pointed out  to conclude with the language of the eneid there is not one sentiment or image in it but may be found in homer or other greek poets and i firmly believe from the observations of macrobius on this head that there is not one phrase in it that is not stolen from preceding latin poets that writer having told us in his saturnalia and indeed proved in many instances that virgils whole poetry is only a cento taken from more ancient authors  such is the eneid which the author with good reason on his deathbed condemned to the flames and had it suffered that fate real poetry would have lost nothing by it i have said that notwithstanding all virgil deserves his fame for his fame is now confined to schools and academies and his style the pickle that has preserved his mummy from corruption is r and exquisite  letter xxiv as your young friend has interest enough to become an undergraduate in the state i have no doubt but his talents will open a way to offices of the first importance provided that his natural parts are cultivated by solid and elegant science i know that he puts no great value on erudition nay thinks it rather an impediment to a man meant for public business but depend on it he will find himself grievously mistaken he will soon perceive that a mind without learning however strong it may be in itself stands upon no basis and resembles a strong tower built upon a volcano and in perpetual danger of sinking into the abyss of ignorance as i sincerely wish him well and know his regard for my opinion i shall submit to you a few thoughts on the subject which you may communicate to him at a proper hour  lord bacon one of the wisest men that any age or country has produced speaking of political affairs observes that no kind of men love business for itself but those that are learned for other persons love it for profit as an hireling that loves the work for the wages or for honor as because it bears them up in the eves of men and refreshes their reputations which otherways would wear or because it puts them in mind of their fortune and gives them occasion to pleasure and displeasure or because it exercises some faculty wherein they take pride and so entertaineth them in good humor and pleasing conceits toward themselves or because it advances any other their ends so that as it is said of untrue valors that some mens valors are in the eyes of them that look on so such mens industries are in the eyes of others or at least in regard of their own designments only learned men love business as an action according to nature as agreeable to health of mind as exercise is to health of body tking pleasure in the action itself and not in the purchase so that of all men they are the most indefatigable if it be toward any business that can hold or detain their mind this quotation tho long is so completely to the point that no sentence of it could be spared the argument contained in it is extremely forcible and ought to weigh with the most unthinking mind for he observes that none but men of learning love business of state for itself and certainly if a man takes no delight in makes not his supreme pleasure of his business let it be of whatever kind he will never manage it well much less rise to eminence in it  a still stronger argument if possible may be brought from the superiority which wide science gives a young statesman almost equal to that of experience itself nay i even doubt whether in this particular instance learning does not exceed experience as much as it falls below it in the practice of domestic life for no statesman let his age and practice be ever so great can from his proper experience have so much skill in the incidents of government as a man of solid and extended science to whom all climes and all ages are present a mind without erudition may be bold and acute but cannot be vast and powerful by learning a man becomes an inhabitant of the world at large this idea is commonly expressed by citizen of the world is the world a city  and a cotemporary of all ages the excellent author above quoted observes elsewhere that books are like ships which pass through the vast seas of time and make the most distant ages to participate of the wisdom illuminations and inventions the one of the other shall we apply this beautiful figure to our present subject and infer how much superior must that merchant be who deals upon such boundless stores imported from all ages and from all countries to him who trades upon his own narrow homestock  prescience which is so great a quality in a statesman is only acquirable by wide knowledge of the events of former ages from that knowledge he may in very many cases foretell what will happen and of consequence use his prudence to guard against it very few accidents in political affairs are unique the seeds of most of them have been sown in the wide field of universal nature and they have produced similar fruit tho at remote periods  you will perceive that most of the above reflections apply to that kind of erudition which is to be found in history but above all in lives and memoirs these may indeed be said to contain the solid science of a statesman but if he wishes to be perfect elegant literature has likewise great utility if a man has ambition to aim at high rank in the scale of government nothing is so likely to effect that end as eloquence and cicero has shown and indeed good sense must convince us that no man can be a great orator without a large and unbounded fund of ideas such a fund is only to be acquired by study and by appropriation of the ideas of others hence the necessity of expanding the memory over the whole circle of knowledge  i shall only further observe before i conclude that the great examples to be found in ancient history operate like electrical fire when they meet with congenial minds the greatest modern statesmen have caught the flame of their inspiration from the altars which ancient greece erected to honor and to virtue and for these altars built by solid science greece was indebted to homer who stands first in the class of polite literature from homer greece derived that spirit which made her the wonder of other nations immortal bard thou alone did sound the charge at thermopylae thou alone did conquer at salamis and at marathon that a paltry corner of europe should stand first in the rolls of fame is solely owing to thy divine genius  if even the study of latin literature could inflame rienzi in      see the life of rienzi written by his cotemporary tomao fiortifiocca first printed at bracciano        mo or the pere du cerceaus history of his compiracy amst       a person of no rank or expectation so far as to operate his deliverance of rome from the papal tyranny in the darkest period of her history tho his talents were unhappily not equal to his enthusiasm and he was unable to digest a great fortune as pindar expresses it surely the study of the grecian literature to which the other is but a shadow has effected and will effect still greater things plutarch in particular is a writer that should be the constant companion of a virtuous statesman the examples to be found in his lives of persons and of actions so replete with virtue and sublimity as almost to exceed human nature must elevate every noble and generous mind to a wonderful degree sage of cheronea homer it is true kindled the flame but by thy cares only it is preserved bright for the perpetual use of mankind  letter xxv in the garden of science as in other gardens it costs more trouble to root out weeds than to plant flowers i look upon the idea commonly entertained by men of letters in respect to augustan ages to be one of these weeds and shall here show you what may be done to root it out and destroy it  velleius paterculus an affected historian was the first author of this foolish idea which other writers have taken on trust as usual without sacrificing to common sense on the occasion  we are told by french critics and you know that mr addison at the same time that he ridiculed our attention to french fashions yet held up french critics who are far worse as worthy of all our reverence i say we are told by french critics that there have been four augustan ages as they call them the first is that of greece in the time of philip of macedon in which flourished socrates plato demosthenes aristotle apelles phidias praxiteles thucydides xenophon eschylus euripides sophocles aristophanes menander philemon the second is that of rome under augustus near or under whose reign flourished laberius catullus lucretius cicero livy virgil horace propertius tibullus ovid phaedrus vitruvius the third is again that of rome after the revival of learning and contains the names of ariosto sannazaro guicciardini vida bembo sadolet macchiavel michael angelo raffaello tiziano the fourth and last is that of france under louis xiv in which stand corneille moliere racine etc etc  now you must observe my dear friend that we are gravely told that genius was during these ages carried to its greatest height in these respective countries a remark of superlative futility in the augustan age of greece for example where is the name of homer who flourished about  00 years before where is that of plutarch one of the greatest writers that greece produced and alone worth ten of these augustan authors but who unhappily came more than  00 years after in that of rome where is tacitus almost their only original writer in the age of leo x where is tasso the first of the italian poets where petrarca where dante where metastasio is not gresset yet living one of the best writers france has produced where is buffon where poor jean jaques where voltaire  the superior good sense and observation of the english has taught them to six no augustan age for their country may her augustan age be a saeculum saeculorum the names of chaucer of shakspere of milton of gray are as remote as those of bacon and newton centuries elapse between them nature it would seem according to the inventers of these augustan ages illuminates other countries by constellations of petty stars but in britain concentrates the rays of many into one which dazzles her rival nations with a luxury of light  in political events my friend i lately had occasion to observe that nature acts much in one way they depend indeed upon the passions of mankind which are always the same and upon the rules of human prudence which admit of no great variation but in respect to genius which rules nature and is not ruled by her the case is very different true genius is as much above regulation in the period of his appearance as in all his other attributes and the principal writers of any country are as seldom seen together as eagles they appear single upon the wild and losty rocks of genius basking in the noontide sun of fame  letter xxvi as i find my remarks on the

strange to see how the commentators have here mistaken the clowns character who says to malvolio are you not mad indeed or do you but counterfeit they would fain make him talk sense shakspere made him

words you will allow me to return my thanks to you sir in particular for the very remarkable countenance which you have shown us through the whole of this affair shakspere uses halffaced for halfcountenanced a fellowship to which the parties gave but half their genuine friendship and concurrence  p     wasptongued is a metaphor nothing like so hard as many used by shakspere and implies with a tongue poisonous and keen as the sting of a wasp let us with due gratitude return thanks to mr steevens for his skilful quotation to prove that shakspere knew where the sting of a wasp lies not

violent metaphor the same with terrified base base that is in fear lest the overhanging rock should fall on it who ever heard that confounded signifies worn or wasted the sand by the shore swilld with

which only darkened their own minds was not pompey stabbed in egypt at that mouth of the nile on which alexandria stands has not the nile seven mouths or outlets by which it issues into the ocean were not the inhabitants of the interstices of land between these outlets with the utmost propriety called islanders by shakspere while their respective territories are called islands by different writers of antiquity who likewise i believe give us their several names at any rate the whole space between the extreme mouths of the nile is known to every schoolboy by the name of the island of delta but even independent of this interpretation might not shakspere in the exuberance of his fancy have here meant to express that the egyptians who murdered pompey must have been natives of meroe or of the remote islands in the nile toward the cataracts who are represented by heliodorus in his admirable romance if i mistake not to have been as barbarous as the egyptians of the lower countries were

or style for i do not think any one can form a proper knowledge of his native language without being a little versant in all its stages as to reading masses of antique nonsense on purpose to illustrate any writer gratitude is certainly due by the public to him who can sacrifice his very understanding in its service  letter xxvii you remember well that the abbe du bos one of the most ingenious critics france has produced if that be any praise has in his reflections on poetry and painting employed many chapters to prove that climate has a most certain and immediate influence upon the human mind his arguments i must beg leave briefly to recapitulate as i mean to set them in opposition to those of a more eminent writer of our own and shall then offer you my own thoughts on this very curious subject since you require them  the abbe in support of his opinion first produces a beautiful quotation from fontenelle different ideas says that amiable writer are as plants and flowers which do not grow equally in all climates perhaps our territory of france is as improper for the egyptian modes of reasoning as for their palm trees and without going so far perhaps the orange trees which do not flourish here so easily as in italy denote that there is in italy a certain turn of mind which we have not in france it is however certain that by the reciprocal connection and dependence that exists among all the parts of the material world the difference of climate perceivable in its effects upon plants ought also to extend its influence to the powers of the human brain this argument fantastic as it may appear has more verisimilitude than may at first sight be attributed to it certain it is that the further natural philosophy proceeds the more connection is discovered between plants and animals and the most eminent botanists have confessed that the sur plan of attaining to perfection in that science is to allot to plants as much of the properties of animals as possible such as sleep difference of sexes and the preference of one nourishment or soil to another  to proceed with the most remarkable of the abbes arguments he attempts to show that some countries have naturally given birth to arts without receiving them of others such as egypt for instance and he might have added china whereas in others some arts would never take root tho planted by sovereign power and nurtured by golden showers of liberality he instances painting in england which had he received a prophetical glimpse of our days he would have omitted  many of his other arguments are those of a man who wishes to go ingeniously wrong and i must here beg leave to make one general remark mark on his work naturally arising from his arguments and quotations on this subject which is that the abbe throout displays woeful ignorance of the greek tongue and greek writers scarce one of which he even quotes tho they bear the same proportional value to the latin as gold does to silver hence his admiration of virgil and his seeming to forget that there is such a writer as homer in the world a defect utterly contemptible and unpardonable in a writer who pretends to instruct his readers in critical knowledge and a due estimate of works of literature to return  he proceeds to show the power of climate upon genius from the characters of nations and in the succeeding section offers his answer to such objections as may be drawn from the characters of the romans and the dutch so entirely opposite in ancient and modern times his arguments are derived from the changes which nature has made on these countries in rome by the infection of the ancient cloacae and in latium from the want of cultivation and the marshes not being kept drained as in ancient times or from the mines he means strata of alum sulphur and arsenic which nature has been forming by degrees and which exhale malignant vapors of power to affect both mind and body we see frequently says he in la compagna de roma a phaenomenen which forces us to think that the attraction of the air is owing to these mines strata formed near the surface of the ground during the heats exhalations arise which kindle of themselves and form long columns of flame if these he adds had appeared in livys days his history would have been full of the sacrifices offered for the expiation of such prodigies the changes which nature has effected in holland lie in the destruction of her ancient forests now in many places discoverable fifteen feet below the surface of the earth and the consequent elevation of the territory  in the next section he shows by many ingenious instances that the difference of climates is in many countries owing to the difference of the emanations of their respective soils tho such countries are equally distant from the equinoctial line poland for instance varies from england owing to the ground of the former being replete with salt that of the latter with lead tin coals and other minerals the abbe concludes his remarks on this subject by arguments in another section to show that the difference of talents in the same people in different ages is to be ascribed to some variation of their climate so much for du bos  the remarks of montesquieu on the influence of climate on mankind i need not rehearse as they principally tend to show the influence of climate upon manners an object quite distinct from our present which is the influence of climate upon the powers of the mind  to make the scale even with the abbe du bos i shall only recite a few verses of mr gray to be found in the fragment published of his admirable poem on the alhance of education and government necessary to produce great and useful men his own words and which by the way imply that he considered climate as deserving no notice even in the production of great men or men of genius can opener skies and suns of fiercer flame oerpower the fire that animates our frame as lamps that shed at eve a cheerful ray fade and expire beneath the eye of day need we the influence of the northern star to string our nerves and steel our hearts to war and where the face of nature laughs around must sickening virtue fly the tainted ground unmanly thought what seasons can control what fancied zone can circumscribe the soul who conscious of the source from whence she springs by reasons light on resolutions wings spite of her frail companion dauntless goes over libyas deserts and through zemblas snows she bids each slumbering energy awake another touch another temper take suspends the inferior laws that rule our clay the stubborn elements confess her sway their little wants their low desires confine and raise the mortal to a height divine i believe however my dear friend you will agree with me that the truth as usual lies in the mid of these two extremes that climate has absolute power over genius i will no more pronounce with du bos than with mr gray that it has none in the utmost extremes of climate in greenland for instance or in zaara some kinds of genius i doubt not may be found in perfection so far as adapted to the climate such as the warlike or the legislative while others such as the speculative the philosophical are totally heterogeneous to the soil when i speak of legislative genius as distinct from philosophical i mean genius capable of forming laws for a community of no implex administration a lycurgus for instance they may have but not a bacon as to other climes which are not in such extremes we are led to think that the defect of genius in some countries and the opulence of it in others is owing more to education and government producing manners incompatible with the exertions of genius or nutrition of such exertions than to a trifling variation of the skyey influence as shakspere phrases it certain it is that large countries in asia of equal or superior temperature of climate to any in europe have in no time produced men of equal genius europe has indeed for these three thousand years been the quarter of the world to which true and legitimate genius seems confined even in poetry which is the least subject to climate of any exertion of genius the asiatics have in all ages been woefully inferior to the europeans in all ages the poetry of the asiatics has been strained to bombast and glittering with all the beauties of absurdity from the most ancient epoch down to our own times as several critics have of late shown a very different sentiment with regard to holy writ in particular which they in their fondness of enthusiasm would fain find as eminent in composition as in sanctity i must beg leave to enforce my last assertion a little and shall easily show that when they attempt to debauch our taste by commenting on the beautiful and grand passages of scripture they are forced to relinquish every rule of sound sense to instance in a few of the most noted passages  let there be light and there was light has been sung upon usque ad fastidium owing to a forged addition to longinus not to be found in any authentic ms as le clerc has shown who likewise informs us that this passage is a common barbarism a common barbarism i grant may yet be sublime but did this passage ever strike any reader as sublime till he read its illuminators certainly not fine sublime that requires a label like this is a bear of the bad painter to point it out sublime that does not strike at once and strike all assumes that title falsely clothed his neck with thunder i will venture to pronounce the most consummate nonsense that ever was clothed with the thunder of bombast had it been found in some grubstreet writer of heroic panegyric we should never have done laughing at it a horse wearing a neckcloth in battle a neckcloth of thunder proh deum atqus hominum fidem dr blair in his lectures who threatens in his preface to think for himself and who i grant you has employed much thought about what he could pillage from his predecessors for his own use very gravely tells us lect xli that isaiah describes with great majesty the earth reeling to and fro like a drunkard and removed like a cottage i see you laugh yet one or two instances more the same writer who thinks for himself tells us that the comparison   samuel xxiii   he that rules over men must be just ruling in the fear of god and he shall be as the light of the morning when the sun rises even a morning without clouds as the tender grass springing out of the earth by clear shining after rain is one of the most regular and formal in the sacred books if so i wish him joy with all my heart for my part i likewise think for myself and i see two similes in this passage both totally unlike informal and irregular but i am afraid of being tedious on a subject so clear and shall return in observing that for absurd and filthy imagery witness some parts of ezekiel the best of the sacred writers the scripture yields to no composition in any language but of sublime or beautiful style i can from that work produce no proofs writers who hold it up in that ludicrous view do as great harm to religion as to good taste it resembles the dressing of a pious and worthy clergyman in the garments of a hero or of a lovely woman and then telling us he has the sublimity the one and the beauty of the other whereas it only puts him in an awkward light and brings derision and contempt upon his holy character  the eastern writings are to this day remarkably deficient in that quality which we call good sense and which must reign in an eminent degree over works even of the warmest fancy if they are meant to please the true judge the nightingales love for the rose and all the other trite and absurd imagery of their best poetry appear mere childishness to the superiority of european wisdom the vales of asia it is true teem with flowers but they are sickly and of no duration among the odorous forests that spread fragrance over the eastern countries the strong oak of sense will not flourish  climate i conclude upon the whole has some power over genius but not so much as is ascribed to it by some writers nor so little as is imputed by others to attempt to mark the boundaries of its dominion would be one of those airy speculations that serve to display the writers ingenuity at the expense of his wisdom  letter xxviii among the innumerable foolish books of memoirs which the french little heroes of their own tales have produced i believe no mean rank in absurdity is due to those of cardinal de retz lord chesterfield that profound genius has recommended them to public notice in letters which it must be confessed were not meant for the public eye but which stand in the inverse ratio of the work de rebus expetendis et fugiendis good judges always taking his recommendation as sufficient dispraise de retz and bouhours are his favorites the first an ecclesiastic who debauched women and the other an ecclesiastic who debauches taste bouhours was in fact fifty years ago known to be a true french critic who prates much by rote like a parrot of what he could not understand the fatuity of de retz is it must be owned hid with a better masque that masque is a false appearance of depth i say a false appearance for to to an eye of any penetration the sapience of de retz is fragile and transparent as glass  his memoirs are addressed to a lady political memoirs to a lady then he tells how many duels he fought and how immensely gallant he was o the pretty statesman no lady could see him without loving him because he had fine teeth as he tells us was observed of him at court he differs with mazarine about nothing and is feared before it was known that such a person existed  to be serious the talents of de retz are thought amazing because he had the mob of paris at command and his political knowledge thought superlative because he tells us with all the pomp of maxim that no mob can bear se desheurer to lose a meal for this last is the only political axiom of his that i have seen taken notice of to have a mob at command is no proof of talents as a late occasion must convince us that occasion must likewise show the futility of the axiom above recited  if ever there was a superficial egotist who had knavery just enough to save him from being a fool who tells such lies from mere vanity as carry confutation in themselves not to speak of the reprobative testimony of cotemporaries who is always the hero of a tale of a cock and a bull it is de retz if ever there was a writer who acquired a false reputation of depth from mere muddiness of affectation whose foolish gravity passes for wisdom who is in every point a mere french scribler of memoirs it is de retz  in the menagiana we are informed that de retz used to tell a story of his having seen a man catch hold of the vane of a windmill go round on it and alight on the spot of ground from which he had set out this wise tale which i suppose is another instance of his political talents always struck me as a most just emblem of the cardinal himself he caught hold of a vane of the populary windmill took a round and was just where he was saving that the height and rotation had such an effect upon his brain as he never got the better of but ever after spoke and wrote like a visionary oracle  letter xxix farce is no such modern invention as you imagine on the contrary it is i have no doubt the most ancient of theatrical exhibitions nor is pantomime much more modern as i know you pique yourself more upon using your own sense than that of others upon elegant knowledge than upon erudition i hope some little disquisition upon this point will prove an agreeable amusement to you  casaubon in his very learned treatise on the satirical poetry of the greeks and that of the romans has well established a very remote distinction between the satires of the two nations those of the first were little pieces or farces represented on the stage those of the latter were a species of poetry quite distant from such representation being merely moral poems mingled with invective against vice and vicious characters one instance only of the former is preserved in the cyclops of euripides examples of the last may be seen in the writings of horace of juvenal of persius  to proceed with the former which is the object of our present enquiry the satypika or farces of the greeks were the invention of their festival days instituted in honor of the gods for that wise and gay people rightly imagined that the joy of man is the supreme praise of the deity tzetzes tells us these entertainments were the invention of rude rustics by which casaubon understands that their origin is to be ascribed to the most ancient age before towns were built or civil society established that the satypika is the most ancient species of dramatic writing we have the authority of aristotle himself who tells us that the choruses of ancient tragedy are borrowed from them  a circumstance not attended to by any of our critical writers who universally look on the choruses as the original parts of tragedy being at first songs in honor of the deities to which dialogue was added by degrees how long will our english critics dully follow the french and tread always in the paths of each other for fear of being lost in a search after the original fountains of knowledge these satires of the greeks were so called from their actors who personified the satyrs the imaginary attendants of bacchus at whose festivals they were originally performed whereas the latin satyrae are derived from satur full as replete with variety of matter for we must observe that the ancient roman satyrae were not continued invectives against vice but sometimes treated the advantages of virtue and the like in an ethic and severe tone such is casaubons etymology but why may not the roman satyrae or saturae as more anciently written be derived from saturn the deity at whose festivals the fascenine verses the rude sketches of the roman satire were chiefly recited  to return to the greek farces their origin and etymology have been shown now for their subject in this they differed totally from our farces that they admitted of tragic subjects nay the most ancient of them knew no other yet these subjects were not completely tragic but allowed of a mixture of comic scenes even in those that bore the hue of tragedy they were in fact short tragicomedies mr addison with his usual french superficiality of science tells us that tragicomedy is the monstrous product of the english stage it was known to his admired ancients both greeks and romans as he might have known had he read athenaeus with regard to the former or the prologue to the amphitryon of plautus for we shall not expect that he would read the piece itself with regard to the latter by both nations it was applauded and admired and shakspere alone might convince us that it is the most natural and consequently the most proper way of constructing a drama tho not the most safe or artificial as requiring far greater powers in the writer than when one turn of sentiment is begun and continued from the beginning to the end of a piece  unhappily the only specimen we have of the greek farce is in the tragic style but from it we may judge of the others for even in this the shocking story of odysses or ulysses and the cyclops is apparently treated in such a ludicrous way as to produce the complete effect of tom thumb chrononhotonthologos or the like mock tragedies if such were the tragic farces the comic ones must have superabounded with broad humor and laughter the humor i however judge from the persons a mob of drunken satyrs must have been very impure and suspect that the decency of the cyclops of euripides is the great reason of its being preserved in preference to so many others  casaubon has on this subject crowded his treasures drawn from the very depths of greek and roman erudition with great profusion the learning he displays on this very curious subject amazes even the learned i shall not however attempt to string any more of his pearls but content myself with observing that in his long enumeration of eminent greek writers of farce are the names of thespis aeschylus sophocles euripides plato lycophron bion  at what time the moderns thought of annexing farces to larger dramatic pieces in order to diversify the entertainment i will not take upon me to determine but suppose the practice was not established in england till the restoration among other customs borrowed from france i take this to have been one the word farce is originally latin i suppose from farcire to fill to stuff alluding to its filling the entertainment and rendering it complete like other latin words it has passed to us through the channel of france but is not in my opinion from the french farcer to play the droll i rather think that verb is from the substantive as we may say to make a farce of a thing  the ancient farces as has been already observed on another occasion were very commonly performed between the acts of their tragedies or comedies as ballets are now danced between the acts of operas by the bye one cannot help laughing at mr addisons better attack upon the opera and his professed admiration of the ancient dramas the opera is a complete copy of the ancient drama in all its parts of recitation and song accompanied with music and dance a formal chorus it is true is not now introduced but the actors themselves form the singing chorus in a way much more natural and proper and for the  another province of the ancient chorus unknown to its modern wellwishers a real and distinct chorus of ballet dancers is preserved in all its luster  the modern farces are with more propriety brought forward at the close of more important dramas and are particularly necessary after tragedy to relieve the mind and prevent our sorrows arising from fiction to enter into real life where too many real sorrows await us  it is almost unnecessary to add that in many of our farces are to be found some of the strongest comic situations and the most genuine wit and humor that grace our stage in our farce we allow more latitude of plot broader humor and higher color of character than in comic dramas of a greater denomination comedy tho she ought always to be cheerful is generally content merely to simper and smile whereas farce ought always to laugh aloud to the eminent names of greek writers of farce mentioned above the english may add those of fielding garrick smollet colman  having spoken so much of farce let us now consider pantomime the prodigious estimation in which this art and its professors were held by the ancients appears from innumerable testimonies of their authors to quote two or three of them were ridiculous for one cannot open an ancient who takes any notice of or derives any metaphor from the theater without observing the important light in which they considered pantomime nor shall we wonder at this when we remark the high perfection to which the ancients had carried this art by the gestures merely of the pantomimic actors were the ancient audiences infinitely more affected either with tragic or comic sensations than with all the dramatic pomp of musical declamation and sympathetic force of recitative if you wish more information on this head peruse lucians treatise on pantomime  the further south we go the more do people use gesture and the more are they affected by it a frenchman uses infinitely more gesticulation than an englishman and an italian still more than a frenchman hence italy has always been the proper climate of pantomime in ancient and in modern days the sannio or harlequin with all his brethren of grimace have chosen italy for their chief theater of action italy has both in ancient and modern times been the inventress of ludicrous pantomime and i suspect also of serious which now only exists in the grand ballets of the opera lately brought almost to ancient perfection and pathos by noverre magnificence in particular the grand character of the ancient stage is in these ballets or modern serious pantomimes carried to a greater height than in any other theatrical exhibition of these times  but it is the pantomime of the english stage that now draws our attention the contempt expressed for this expensive amusement by some men of severest wisdom is itself contemptible no amusement deserves scorn that is an innocent relaxation from anxious thoughts and the cares of life no dramatic exhibition excites less thought or more ocular attention than pantomime none is of consequence more calculated for the man of study or of care  it may however be regretted that the sums expended in grecian days to place their grand tragic scenes in an exuberance of decoration are now wasted on this inferior performance the magnificence of unmeaning processions etc in present pantomimes is amazing the managers of the winter theaters commonly produce a pantomime in the course of every season and rival each other in this annual extravagance with the profusion of two rich peers contending for the return of members of parliament these pantomimes are commonly brought forward during the christmas holidays when all the world is idle and the constant succession of them shows that the managers do not form their nesteggs of gold to use a metaphor hudibrastic without making their clients lay in proportion  indeed pantomime is now the best entertainment we find in our theaters it is quite astonishing to remark how much our stage has declined within this half dozen years since the retreat of garrick it is overwhelmed with floods of irish nonsense and stuff more stupid than stupidity where not one glimmer of sense or wit appears had those irishmen female scriblers etc offered their trash to a bartholomewfair audience a few years ago they would have been hissed to scorn our poor audiences sit with dutch phlegm and take what god sends english good nature or bon hommie if you please puts us upon a level with the most stupid and barbarous of nations what the judgment of our audiences condemns their good nature with a vengeance comes in and reprieves at the very gallows however it is some consolation to know that our stage cannot possibly be worse than it is so it must mend of course  change of scene was totally unknown to the ancients in this mute display they must therefore have yielded to the wonderful mechanism of modern times the mechanic wit of modern pantomime is transcendant a lawyer is changed into a lady of billingsgate and a judge into an owl in a moment with regard to the dignity of amusement i suppose our comic pantomime yields not to that of the ancients for plutarch tells us in his symposiacs that dogs regularly bred to the stage performed parts in the ancient pantomime a perfection to which we have not yet arrived  the modern harlequin is a perfect copy of the ancient sannio or mimus the mimus had his face smeared with soot fuligine faciem obductus and wore a habit patched of many colors as we learn from apuleius in his apology quid enim si choragium thimelicum possiderem number ex eo argumentavere etiam uti me consuevisse tragaedi syrmate histrionis crocota mimi centunculo the centunculus is a diminutive of cento used by juvenal for a garment made of patches whence it is applied metaphorically to a poem composed of shreds of others as the noted cento of ausonius  the other pantomimic persons of our theater are columbine pantaloon and the clown the italians have likewise the doctor beltrame of milan scapin the italian captain the spanish captain scaramouche giangurgulo the calabrian mezzetin tartaglia punch narcisin de malabergo a grand pantomime including all the italian personages in their proper characters is yet wanting to the english stage  letter xxx i do not wonder that the praises which dr blackwall has bestowed on gravinas work della ragion poetica together with the uncommon title of the work itself have excited your curiosity the book is rather rare tho of no great price and till i can procure you a copy accept a short account of it  it is divided into two books and addressed a madama colbert principessa di carpegna an impropriety similar to that of de retz in addressing a work to a person who could never be supposed to understand it was the patroness the daughter or niece of the great colbert he mentions her ancestors as being of scotland and passing into france by the bye the scottish name is cuthbert and mr cuthbert of castlehill an old scottish title assumes as i am informed by different countrymen of his the name of labbe colbert when at paris where he has fixed his residence  in this address there is nothing remarkable save a very just remark which tho made likewise by pope is not and never will be sufficiently attended to namely that there is equal difficulty in judging perfectly well of poetry as in composing with perfection and that it is far easier to be a middling author than a just critic he proceeds in the address to show the design upon which his work is written and what he understands by the title of it della ragion poetica of the reasons or first causes of poetry and observes that as every noble edifice is built according to the rules of architecture and these rules have geometry for their ragion or first cause so the knowledge of poetry is the ragion or foundation of the rules of poetry he then proceeds to show the true knowledge of poetry to consist in an eternal idea of fitness of things and in the fifteen or sixteen succeeding sections utterly loses himself in the platonic system on which a man of great mind who gives himself up to erudition is so apt to be wrecked platonism was indeed the madness of gravina as appears from all his works and an attachment to an enthusiastic system is the grand reason why the works of the master of metastasio have been so little read  from this account of the leading idea of his work you will at first glance perceive that the fabric rests upon sand nothing indeed can well be more futile nor of falser criticism than to infer an analogy between geometry the coldest operation of the judgment and poetry the warmest exertion of the imagination the fact is that the rules of poetry have no ragion as he quaintly and abstractedly calls it but the example of former poets i beg pardon for the expression rules of poetry poetry knows no rules the code of laws which genius prescribes to his subjects will ever rest in their own bosoms rules of criticism was the expression i meaned to use and these have no ragion or first foundation at all they are drawn from homer sophocles and pindar what these masters do say the critics is right and every thing else is wrong poor judges ye slaves who judge of your masters is not nature greater than homer sophocles or pindar is not genius the supreme arbiter and lord of natures whole domain her superior her king her god bring out your candle then and teach the sun how to exert his meridian power  in these first fifteen sections there are nevertheless some remarks worth notice such as this we must study diligently to impress upon verse an appearance of negligence that the imagination may not revolt from its delusion through the force of apparent artifice that upon the native gravity of the romans is curious and he ascribes to this the defect of latin comedy he observes in another place that terence has no comic force and that volcatius sedigitus an ancient critic placed terence only in the sixth rank even of roman comic writers yet his works and those of virgil have reached us such is the power of style  many of his observations upon homer are fine such as his being the greatest poet because his works all bear the very stamp of nature none of his characters being perfect the virtuous being painted as capable of vice and the vicious as guilty of virtue perfect characters form indeed a sure mark of a middling writer who cannot copy nature but only a feeble idea of perfection in his own breast they are always insipid witness eneas the most insipid character ever drawn for the vices of eneas his dereliction of dido etc are not described as imperfections of character but are indeed mere inconsistencies  his idea of the theology and philosophic system of homer i look upon as without foundation homer i am certain had no allegory whatever in view when he wrote either of his immortal poems his only intention was to entertain and perhaps to make money by furnishing amusement to others let us not look upon the last motive as sordid it was the motive of shakspere i know of no book whatever that may not be turned into an allegory with the help of a smattering analogy which the meanest fancy is capable of forming alchymy has been found in the hypneromachia of poliphilo in all its secrets and i doubt not might likewise be discovered by an adept in the iliad or in the odyssey they who find any thing in these poems more than the entertaining narration of an interesting story are methodists in poetry and have as great a title to the inward light which always comes through a crack in the skull as the methodists in religion  after escaping these fifteen sections of platonic frenzy we happily arrive at his characters of the most eminent poets of ancient greece and rome who have all according to the authors enthusiastic theory written up to his idea of making all poetry a mystic veil of platonism he however does not always harp upon the string of his madness and when he does not his characters of the several ancient poets are admirably just and fine  he concludes the first book with characters of the modern latin poets of italy after sewing them to his system by a coarse thread of discourse for he tells us that there is now no occasion for mysticism in poetry it being the fashion for truth to appear without any covering as i hold modern latin poetry in utter contempt i need not tell you that i agree with him in no one character of any of its authors  in the second book he returns to his platonism with fresh vigor in charactersing dante on whom he dwells through many sections he afterward proceeds to value the other italian poets mostly with great justice and acuteness  this is i believe an accurate analysis of gravinas celebrated performance della ragion poetica a work which tho written by a man of fine taste and ample talents is yet only a monument of the pernicious effects of system upon any science lord bacon has observed that any faculty reduced to an art must of necessity become barren because art circumscribes it as for instance no good poetry can be written by an author who pays the smallest attention to arts of poetry which arts of poetry are indeed in my opinion so many contradictions in terms for poetry is a faculty not an art an exertion of the mind to be circumscribed by rules only when some wonderful inventor shall teach watches to think there being fully as much absurdity in the idea of giving mechanism to thought as in that of giving thought to mechanism the remark of lord bacon above quoted may justly be applied to system with attachment to which if a writer is tainted he can never acquire wide and lasting fame which is only to be attained by the productions of a soul free as the mountain winds and large as the universe  letter xxxi of the numerous writers on truth i know none who has yet observed that the truth perceivable to human reason may be reduced to two kinds truth of fact and truth of nature  before i proceed further allow me to tell you an anecdote  sir walter ralegh when confined in the tower had prepared the second volume of his immortal history for the press he was standing at the window of his apartment ruminating on the office of an historian and on the sacred regard which he ought to pay to truth when of a sudden his attention was excited by an uproar in the court into which his prospect was directed he saw one man strike another whom by his dress he judged an officer and who drawing his sword run the assailant through the body who did not however fall till he had knocked down the officer with his fist the officer was instantly seized while lying senseless and carried away by the servants of justice while at the same time the body of the man he had murdered was borne off by some persons apparently his friends who with great difficulty pierced through the vast crowd that was now gathered around  next day an acquaintance of sir walter called on him a man of whose severe probity and honor sir walter was convinced from innumerable proofs and rated his friendship accordingly ralegh after their first compliments told the story of yesterdays fray which had impressed him deeply as being a spectator of the whole affair what was his surprise when his friend told him that he was perfectly mistaken in his whole story that his officer was no officer but a servant of a foreign ambassador that this apparent officer gave the first blow that he did not draw his sword but the other drew it and it was wrested out of his hands but not till after he had run its owner through the body with it that after this a foreigner in the mob knocked the murderer down in order that he should not escape that some foreigners had carried off the servants body and that orders had arrived from court for the murderer to be tried instantly and no favor shown as the person murdered was one of the principal attendants of the spanish ambassador sir says ralegh allow me to say that tho i may be mistaken as to the officership of the murderer yet i know of a certainty that all my other circumstances are strictly true because i was a spectator of the whole transaction which passed on that very spot opposite where you see a stone of the pavement a little raised above the rest sir walter says the friend upon that very stone did i stand during the whole affair and received this little scratch in my cheek in wresting the sword out of the fellows hand and as i shall answer to god you are totally mistaken you grow warm my friend let us talk of other matters said sir walter and after some other conversation his friend departed  ralegh took up the manuscript of the second volume of his history then just completed how many falsehoods are here said he if i cannot judge of the truth of an event that passes under my eyes how shall i truly narrate those which have passed thousands of years before my birth or even those that have happened since my existence truth i sacrifice to thee the fire was already feeding on his invaluable work the labor of years and he calmly sat till it was utterly consumed and the table ghost of the last leaf flitted up the chimney  from this anecdote i illustrate an opinion which i have always held that there is no such thing as truth of fact or historical truth known to man history is merely a species of romance founded on events which really happened but the bare events as stated by chronologists are alone true their causes circumstances and effects as detailed by historians depend entirely on the fancy of the relater or other truths none are positive to man save those subject to his senses and even these are fallac ous tho the truths they affirm are positive as to us to superior beings our truths are no doubt falsehoods  from this observation however a certain species of truth which consists in the relation and connection of things must be exempted providing this may be called positive truth i mean truth of nature or that universal truth to be found in poetry and works of fiction this consists in the propriety and consistence of event of character of sentiment of language to be found in such works want of such propriety and consistence always strikes even a common reader as false and absurd were achilles instead of fighting hector to fall on his knees and beg for his life the incident would strike every one as contrary to truth of character i need not use any more instances to illustrate my meaning tho i doubt you will think it rather an uncommon remark that the whole truth known to man and not subject to his senses must be found only in works of fiction truth was not made for man nor man for truth he is the mere creature of falsehood on falsehood depend his being his passions his happiness  by the truth of nature you will perceive i mean that represented and imitated by art for when we say that an event or character drawn by a painter or poet is not true is not in nature we imply that art has relinquished nature art and nature are therefore in this instance almost synonymous terms for we refer the representations of art to that idea of universal nature which every mind acquires in a greater or smaller degree from being daily conversant in her works  a character may however be drawn out of the usual progress of nature and yet have truth as the caliban of shakspere in this fancy comparing certain ideas of utter rudeness of human nature blended with the bestial and demonic the two first drawn from real nature the latter from a continuity of similar notions of these supernatural beings handed down from ages of ignorance to ages of refinement composes from uniting these ideas a certain standard of fitness and propriety of character which is here applied instead of the grand standard of nature this singular character is true to itself offends no idea of propriety yet is not in nature  of truth of nature taken in a large sense as applicable to the grand works of nature man can only judge in so far as those concern him it is the nature of the sun to produce heat but were it in time to possess the opposite quality we could not say that nature was false but that her effects varied were we told that the rays of the sun are essentially cold but have the power to effect heat we cannot prove the proposition wrong we only judge from our feelings that the sun warms us and the wisdom that would go further is folly for any prerogative of nature that manifests not its existence to us we may boldly say has no existence the herschelian planet certainly did not exist to us till it was discovered tho it was ever an attendant of our system how fit we are to judge of the truth of the works of nature may be inferred from the sermon of the cordelier who desired his audience to admire the superlative wisdom and goodness of god who always makes the greatest rivers to pass by the greatest cities  letter xxxii your wonder at my assertion that the modern stage and drama are superior to the ancient i can only remove by supporting it with evidence to begin with the theater that of the ancients consisted like ours of a semicircle of which the chord for the stage behind which were convenience for the actors and the semicircular part contained seats for the spectators the ancient stage of the greeks comprehended four divisions the  where the reciters of the play stood the  where the actors of the play were stationed the  where the chorus was placed to dance and sing and the  where as with us the musicians held their residence the scene was always the same for each kind of drama the tragedy had a scene consisting of a view of a public place as the court of a palace or the like area surrounded with buildings of magnificent architecture the comic scene always consisted of a public place of domestic architecture and was commonly divided into three parts by two streets opening up from it so that the actors came down these streets to the audience by this mean some passages in ancient dramas are accounted for in which perhaps an actor expresses an ardent and repeated wish to see a person then on the stage that person is then in the other street and cannot be seen by the actor tho he is by the audience the scene of the  or farce was always rural as the satyrs its constant chorus were the fancied inhabitants of the woods the whole machinery of the ancient scene consisted in changing it as either of the dramas were designed for representation  the vast superiority of the modern scene for real representation the grand object of the drama is so evident that to insist on it were to affront your judgment  next to the scene was the  the proscenium or place before the scene as the name imports in this the actors or mimics of the play appeared for you must know that with the ancients the acting of a play was quite a distinct province from the speaking or recitation one set of actors spoke while another accompanied them with proper gestures as the last was thought the most important part of the drama greater honor was paid to the mimics than to the reciters  below the  was the  where the reciters abovementioned took their station in this  stood fellows with monstrous masks contrived with such large gaping mouths as if they meant to eat all the spectators man woman and child and leave none for tomorrow as lucian wittily tells us these reciters with the lungs of thersites rehearsed the piece in musical cadence while the music of the orchestra accompanied them as it did the chorus when their turn came  next to this was the  or place of the chorus whose province you well know and next the audience as with us the  where with the romans the magistrates and chief men of the city had a superb seat appointed for them the emperors seat was in the midst of the orchestra and called podium  the theater of the romans differed from that of the greeks in some respects for example the pulpitum of the former and  of the latter was sometimes in the latin theater of the same elevation with the proscenium nay i question if they were not sometimes blended in one the chorus was likewise now and then placed in the orchestra the scene of the romans was sometimes of amazing grandeur that of the theater of marius scaurus being ornamented with   0 columns and  000 statues  both in the greek and roman theater the spectators sat in uniform rows of stone seats carried all round the semicircle the multitude of their vomitoria or doors is however much to be envied as in case of accident from the number of candles fireworks etc employed in our theaters the smallness and fewness of the passages is shockingly cruel and absurd  in the ancient theater plays were always represented in broad day and sometimes four tragedies one after another all the work of one author when contending for the prize while next day was set apart for as many of an antagonist these strings of tragedies were called  and  over the theater which was open above in case of rain or intense heat of the sun a vast veil could be spread by means of easy machinery this veil was sometimes of the finest silk  some contend that the romans were accustomed to change their scenes during the representation of the same piece from a misconception of this passage of servius in his notes on the third georgic scena quae fiebat aut versilis erat aut ductilis versilis tunc erat quum subito tota machinis quibusdam convertebatur et aliam picturae faciem ostendebat ductilis tunc quum tractis tabulariis hac atque illac species picturae nudabatur interior but this only applies to the change of scene for each drama as above expressed and as may be proved from this clear and positive passage of vitruvius in the eighth chapter of his fifth book genera sunt scenarum tria unum quod dicitur tragicum alterum comicum tertium satyricum horum autem ornatus sunt inter se dissimiles disparique ratione quod tragicae deformantur beware of translating this deformed it means in the classic augustan latin of vitruvius formed of formantur de as a monk would have phrased it columnis fastigiis et signis reliquisque regalibus rebus comicae autem aedificiorum privatorum et menianorum habent speciem perspectusque fenestris dispositos communium aedificiorum rationibus satyricae vero ornantur arboribus speluncis montibus reliquisque agrestibus rebus in topiarii operis speciem deformatis from this you see that there were only three changes of scene in every ancient theater and these adapted solely to the different grand kinds of the drama  need i descend to particulars to evince the superiority of the modern stage to the ancient after this genuine description of the latter drawn from its cotemporaries must not the whole representation of the ancients have heaped absurdity upon absurdity the mute action of the mimics guided by the voice of the reciters conveyed through tubes of brass and set off with a masque the one side of which expressed grief and the other complacency so that the actor must remember to turn his sad side to the spectators at the proper minute the unnatural declamation accompanied with music the chorus dancing and singing at the intervals etc etc etc how superior is the natural neatness of our dramatic exhibitions which represent life itself to the uncouth magnificence of the ancients to dwell longer on this were needless so i shall pass to the consideration of the drama itself to begin with tragedy  the fable of ancient tragedy is in comparison with ours amazingly barren and jejune miltons sampson is a true picture of most ancient tragedies and we all know what a yawning figure this would make on our stage in most of their pieces there is but one incident and that contrived with little art as in the edipus coloneus where the personages exchange a number of speeches and then one of them dies the only art of the author lies in summoning topics of verbal commiseration the edipus tyrannus is indeed an exception but the horror of the events is too strong and disgusts the mind instead of attracting its sympathy this remark affects not however the art of the author which must be allowed great notwithstanding that the tradition or narrative upon which his piece stands must have helped him in every particular but if art is the chief merit of tragedy then is the mourning bride the first of modern tragedies as indeed it is pronounced by a scottish critic who in poetry knew not the best from the worst nothing spoils a tragedy more than an intricate plot for no passion can be raised where the judgment always intervenes  in contrast the modern tragedies seldom have an implex fable but abound with life action incident they interest without perplexing and never push the tragic passions to horror and disgust the chorus likewise destroyed the whole moral effect of tragedy by thinking for the spectators who in that case never think for themselves modern tragedies are far better calculated to mend the heart and manners than the ancient domestic tragedies the most moral and pathetic of all bring utterly unknown to the ancients who thought that we could not cry except when her majesty was a blubbering the characters and language of our tragedies must of consequence be more various and interesting  if in tragedy we excel the ancients still more in comedy and farce of the greek comedy of aristophanes let those speak who have discovered that dung ceases to stink because it is athenian certainly a meaner or dirtier scribbler never disgraced any country than that ancient buffoon he is so totally without merit that to take the trouble of expressing supreme contempt for him is paying him too great honor what has preserved his pitiful works style almighty style of the comedies of philemon and menander we have many fragments which show the insipid morality with which they were fraught our sentimental comedy is a mere joke to them for soporification the comedies of terence are translations from theirs and we see how totally destitute they are of the vis comica so much so as even to disgust the ancients themselves witness these verses of the great caesar preserved by suetonius tu quoque tu in summis o dimidiate menander poneris et merito puri sermonis amator lenibus atque utinam scriptis adjuncta foret vis comica ut aequato virtus polleret honor cum graecis neque in hac despectus part jaceres unum hoc maceror et doleo tibi deesse terenti intricate plot and artificial ligature of scenes we find in terence but every thing else is wanting character situation incident wit humor laughter gaiety indeed the whole of that by which comedy is comedy his dramas in short are dramas for mathematicians  the superiority of our farce to the ancient need not be remarked after the account i lately sent you of the latter the chorus its consisting always of satyrs etc are manifest shackles which bound down the ancient farce in the dungeon of dullness  the duration of the ancient tragic drama i have already pointed out as shorter and preferable to ours perhaps you will say that the want of incident authorized the brevity of the greek tragedy but you will remember that i took my instance from the edipus tyrannus a play that has sufficient incident for a modern drama since i wrote to you on the duration of the drama i have found the following passage in cicero which leads me to think that the ancients considered the drama as restricted to three acts it is in the first book of his letters ad quintium fratrem and runs thus illud te ad entremum oro et bortor ut tanquam poetae boni et actores industrii solent sic tu in extrema part et conclusione muneris ac negotii tui diligentissimus sis ut hic tertius annus tanquam tertius actus perfectissimus atque ornatissimus fuisse videatur i think this proof positive and sincerely believe that little horace like a sabine puppy was impudent enough to prescribe an absolute rule of poetry from his own skull and that we poor moderns are so weak as to reverence his ipse dixit as an oracle which for foundation has not the shadow of a dream  gravina in his book della tragedia to which i am much obliged has well shown that aristotles work on poetry is a crude and indigested performance written by the author in his silly vanity of dictating in every science then known to man indeed both victorius and castelvetro agree with him that this treatise of aristotle is full of gross improprieties and absurdities that could only proceed from an authors writing on a subject he knew nothing of the book of longinus on the sublime is the second ancient work of criticism that has reached us and in it the sublime is confounded with the beautiful and the tender qualities of writing directly opposite so that little can be said of the perfection of ancient criticism  you see i use the privilege of epistolary writing and give you my thoughts as they rise without studying arrangement i hope however i do not go to play till after i have done my business and you know that of this letter was to show the superiority of the modern drama to the ancient a point which i hope i have proved to a demonstration almost mathematical  letter xxxiii boileau a writer of the meanest talents whose genius was imitation and whose taste was envy has said in some one of his feeble labors that he prefers the gold of virgil to the tinsel of tasso now the joke is that boileau did not understand one word of italian as voltaire tells us in le siecle de louis xiv admire the fellows impudence how impudent ignorance always is as france at that period led the fashions of england both mental and corporeal it is no wonder that addison one of the best writers and worst critics in the world shut his eyes and followed the french petitmaitre en critique  addison i am convinced never read tassos gierusalemme as i think it has lately been pretty well proved that he never read the aminta had he perused the works of that wonderful writer he would have blushed to challenge him for a fault which be never once is blameable of tasso has instances of speech too figurative but as little tinsel as homer he might with equal propriety have said that miltons works teem with atheism  in tasso i remember scarce one false ornament the palace of armida tho the scene of enchantment is not adorned with decorations of glass but of diamond as strong as it is brilliant the bird which sings an amatory ditty that image of the gierusalemme which approaches nighest to the bounds of false ornament has in this view nothing unnatural it is enchantment it is beyond nature and of consequence vindicable nay modest when considered in its proper point of light virgils trees that groan and drop blood without such an excuse i allow tinsical and futile to the last degree as to the language of tasso tho he wrote in a stanza which must have compelled him to redundance yet i pronounce it as grave and proper with all its riches as that of almost any greek classic whatever tho the greeks labored under no such inconvenience it is the latins those apes clad in grecian clothes whom we may safely accuse of tinsel or false ornament both of images and language let us consider a few passages of virgil allowed their most judicious writer in this view i have never read his eneid with this intent as would be necessary to give a detail of all the tinsel of it so can only give such passages as at present occur to my memory indeed i never look into virgil but with utter disgust while homer always gives me fresh rapture  i must premise that we are not to wonder at virgils tinsel for we know that mecenas whom we look upon as a model of taste and who was virgils patron was fond of tinsel to excess augustus used to rally him always on it as we learn from suetonius and macrobius has preserved a part of a letter from augustus to mecenas running thus vale mel gemmeum medulliae ebur ex etruria laser aretinum adamas supernas tiberinum margaritum cilniorum smaragdae jaspi figulorum berylle porsennae carbunculum italiae  moecharum ah mecenas what a poor mecenas thou must have been  in the eneid book ii the expression ferit aurea sidera clamor may justly be arraigned as tinsical and of false brilliance a cry striking the golden stars approaches much to glorious nonsense a cry a sound cannot strike save organs of hearing or of reverberation striking the stars is a puerile hyperbole the golden stars a yet more puerile epithet on an occasion in which their boundless altitude should have been the idea if an epithet was necessary the sidera lambit in the bombast description of vesuvius is of the same family  the story of polydorus in the third book is perhaps the most unnecessary piece of empty decoration to be found in the works of any writer ancient or modern  in book viii virgil gives the following receipt to make thunder tres imbris torti radios tres nubis aquosae addiderant rutili tres ignis et alitis austri fulgores nunc terrificos sonitumque metumque miscebant operi flammisque sequacibus iras r three rays of a wreathed shower three of a watery cloud add three of red fire and of the winged south wind mix them up with terrible flashes and with sound and fear and with anger and following fires  had this stood in any writer on whom our timid critics dared to exert their judgment what laughter what derision of that tinsical author who could affront the judgment of his readers with such a caput mortuum of empty nonsense  in book xii the horses qui candore nives anteirent cursibus auras furnish another proof of bad ornament as does the tree in book ii which threatens its fellers and threatens them by shaking its hair at them illa usque minatur et tremefacta comam concusso vertice nutar perhaps at a leisure hour i may send you more instances but these already adduced will i believe prove that tinsel was a quality of writing very well known to the roman imitator  letter xxxiv any observation or discovery which tends to the improvement of our language gives me particular pleasure i therefore agree with you in your applause of mr sheridans remark that the s which abounds so much in the english orthography has very often the power of z why should it not be written accordingly why not spell hiz uz herz enclozez arizez etc etc etc i long to see that hissing letter as scarce in the language as possible  the english tongue is sufficiently strong rich and universal musicalness and softness are the only qualities it wants the greatest praise is therefore due to any writer who attempts to improve its melody upon many years accurate attention bestowed on our language it appears to me that it is to the consonant terminations that the harshness of our speech may be imputed some words of frequent occurrence are also very rude and twenty words of very common use will if harsh destroy the tone of a language and if uncouthly spelt will to the eye which ought to be consulted in orthography full as much as the ear injure the form of a whole language such foreigners find our though through enough rough tough and all other words in ugh ughlyheaded monsters to use miltons orthography which of themselves are sufficient to make our tongue pass for a dialect of the high dutch how are they surprised to find us pronounce tho through enuf ruf tuf and be at the expense of horrible gutturals to make our language have a hottentot air which gutturals we cannot pronounce in poetry for many a century we have written tho through and so they ought always to be spelt in prose by every person who has any reverence for the eyes of his readers the o in through having the same sound as in to do but if any one chooses to spell throu i have no objection we should certainly write ruf enuf tuf brote thote nite etc why write so many towns with burgh do not we pronounce bura a little ridicule of sciolists always attends the first introduction of a novelty into language tho it should be infinitely for the better but this one must put up with in sure expectation of the praise of posterity and that of enlightened judges of ones own time  the chief fault of our language is that almost all its words end in consonants the great point is to throw out every final consonant which we can always for instance is the old spelling of always and is better also is for the same reason superior to likewise which has the sound of a consonant in its termination i could also wish to see the old fro substituted in lieu of from the old ne for nor is better than its substitute if the consonant cannot be rejected we should at least soften it if possible and never for example write has does but has does the th is frequent in the greek and is quite melodious instead of draws views plays throws or even draws etc i believe a wellwisher to the tune of our tongue will write does draw does play etc to preserve such very few words as we have ending in vowelsounds the greek and latin and the modern italian and french have not so many words ending in consonants as we by a great deal a matter of regret to every admirer of the english language and indeed had not fortunately our adverbs for the most part been taken from the french with the fine vowel termination of y but far better in the old spelling ie as namely boldly etc our tongue must have been still more sadly hurt by consonantterminations the great secret of writing melodious english is surely to draw into view every possible word which may terminate with a vowel  common phrases which are ungrammatical a good writer should ever avoid tho they have high authority to support them such are methinks today and the like dr armstrong in his sketches by lancelot temple esquire has given us some just observations on our language how the nonsensical phrase subject matter should be still used in spite of the ridicule he has entailed on it i cannot conceive he observes that betwixt should never be used for between to which let me add that it is quite amazing to see an author who has ears and eyes write amongst gray tho he writes with melody has amidst are not among and amid english words besides for beside is liable to the same objection the diphthongs ae and oe are now unknown to our tongue being transformed into e and with great propriety to words spoilt in our spelling may be added the preterite etc of some verbs i read i have read your book do not we pronounce redd and an eminent writer in his familiar letters spells it read the preterite of no verb should be the same with the present else inexplicable confusion will arise but barbarians have formed our tongue and men of science are afraid to meddle with it else why not write hurted as well as parted etc etc etc however a writer of any precision or elegance will ever write did hurt etc at least why should we spell vanities etc when the singular is vanity the plural stood so when the word was spelt vanity and we retain it tho the laziness merely of substituting one letter for two made some blockhead very improperly write vanity such is the progress of our language  dr lowth in his grammar seems not to know what to make of himself if we say he came himself it is nonsense if he came his self it is not sense i wish each of our gothic ancestors themselves had a drubbing to himself for inventing such words we use yourself in every case it would seem we should also say their selves his self in all cases if we say you yourself of yourself to yourself yourself o you yourself by or with yourself we must of course say they theirselves of theirselves to theirselves theirselves o they theirselves by or with theirselves and he his self of his self to his self his self o he his self by or with his self self in old english is synonymous with same as selve day selve color  it is mortifying to every judge of language who must know that the melody and elegance of a tongue depend altogether upon its vowel terminations to reflect that in english not above a dozen common words end in a as villa idea piazza era quota stanza and one or two more lea plea sea etc do not sound as if they ended in a in e not one word ends nor in i in o about two dozen as go to so woe lo stucco tobacco calico portico do cargo echo tho who intaglio ratio solo etc whosoever i would recommend to succeed whosoever as it preceded in antiquity whereto hitherto are better than any substitutes in u we have no word whatever and the romans had very few in ou we have only two thou you in y we have no less than   00 words about an eighth of our language our words amounting to about   000 of this number i would propose that the e be restored to all the substantives for instance we should write beauty treat ivore etc as from the french in w as a vowel we have a few of the most sonorous words in our language as flow blow new saw law etc  it is shocking to remark that we have      words ending in ess the most horrid of all terminations this is owing to the qualified substantives in ness as holiness happiness etc most of which may be regarded as obsolete with all my heart for we have sanctitude felicity etc so that almost every one may be avoided as they always are by good writers but the negative less the great cause of our other terminations in ess cannot be so easily thrown out yea a double ss is now necessary for we can never write endless needles without confusion what shall we say to hopelessness fearlessness and other delicious words they may be in the language but will never be in that of a master of it by the way if we wrote z in stead of s in many instances we might even spell needlez without confusion arising from the plural of needle  every country schoolmaster and compiler of grammars or dictionaries will tell us that our language is classic and perfect for lo grammars have been written of it within these twenty years so that it is stationary and quite the thing and a very pretty thing it is my dear friend you know that our language is not yet one century old as to orthography the most essential point of any speech look into miltons mss or his own editions and you will see this at once now i will hazard a bold opinion namely that our language is now infinitely more barbarous in all respects than it was in the days of chaucer for melody there is no comparison the e always pronounced as in spoke shake etc was alone sufficient to render it much more melodious it is truly risible to hear how we talk of our language did you never read of that village of spanish aborigines discovered by the duke of alvas hawk who being quite enclosed with rocky mountains thought there was no world beyond their barriers this is a lively type of our predilection for our native tongue while compared with the italian or spanish it is harsh to excess the emperor charles v we are told said he would talk french to his friend italian to his mistress and english to his horse i suppose by the bye that in observance of this apophthegm our senators so much frequent the academy of newmarket in order that by much conversation with their horses they may be qualified to speak good english  however it must be allowed that if the english is too harsh the italian is too soft and it will be easier to soften the english than to harden the italian the spanish is not so rich as the english and therefore is inferior for the french i know not what to call it if we call it a language it is as we call the droning of a bagpipe music in pronounciation it is a nasal redundancy of gibberish in writing  it must not be pronounced silent consonants a phenomenon of nonsense unknown to any other tongue under heaven either ancient or modern have such an effect on it that not above twenty words in the whole language are pronounced as they are written in short it is a language which shocks the eye and the ear is incapable of poetry and disagreeable in prose and yet the french have their classies how this pitiful tongue has become so prevalent i cannot account unless it be in accomplishment of the scripture blessed are the poor in spirit for they shall be exalted the contest for superiority among the modern tongues i speak without any shadow of prejudice lies between the english and italian  of these the english especially has vast defects and is capable of great improvements but how shall these defects be removed and how shall these improvements be given very easily we know from the pillar of duillius that the latin was in the time of the second punic war as barbarous as the english is now yet in little more than a century afterward the language of cicero appeared here is the point in greece and rome men of science refined and fixed the tongues in england the barbarous blockheads of the lowest mob have corrupted and degraded the language and it is ridicule for a man qualified to judge of it even to give a new spelling in france the speech which was thought fixed has gone through innumerable changes even in the tenses of verbs such as etait avait etc used within these twenty years for the old etoit avoit etc milton in most of his works adopted the old orthography of english in contempt of the mob of sciolists as he calls them men who know nothing yet judge of every thing without being capable of examining or going further than they did at school but since his time no writer has had courage to bear up against the vulgar and the consequence is that the head follows the tail  the plan would be my friend that the king should incorporate one hundred or indeed all of the most learned men in the kingdom or they should associate themselves under the name of the academy for improving the language the great intent should be to soften and tune the english speech as much as possible new modes of spelling and new uses of vowels ought to be adopted the academy should publish a grammar and dictionary in which the new orthography should be used and all the members and indeed all the literati in the kingdom should unite to assert their proper power over the mob i am convinced that in rome the written language of the vulgar was quite different from that of the learned till a century after cicero in ancient greece and in modern italy the colloquial dialects varied in journeying over every ten miles in both countries the written language of the literati consists of flowers taken from all these dialects had we a scientific language also it were an admirable institution and perhaps a thousand years hence when the british power may be no more the language would survive an event which it may be feared cannot be effected even by milton and shakspere if the speech remains in its present rude state i do not mean that our scientific language should be indebted to our different dialects as the greek and italian for i know not of one scoticism iricism or provincialism which would contribute in the least to the elegance of our tongue the sole intention should be to improve our orthography and give us a number of vowelterminations the e should in particular be always pronounced as in the the germans pronounce it and were not their speech full of gutturals the consequence would be that it would from this very circumstance prove more melodious than the english i look upon the greek as the most perfect language both for strength and melody that ever was known now in greek i have found that the vowel terminations of words taken as they run in any book are equal to one third of the language in english the vowel terminations amount but to one fourth of the language it follows that we want vowel terminations for about  000 words how are they to be supplied suppose  a for all plurals instead of the s pena for pens papera for papers etc this would alone furnish us with a sufficiency in a this seems the islandic plural in many cases skipa for ships etc and is thus quite consonant to the genius of our language which is of northern parentage  e should be given to all substantives n y as beauty bounte etc and should always be pronounced in finals as fame spare more grace etc as of old the ie should go to all verbs in y as beautify etc  i is a termination unknown to our present tongue tho anciently common give it to all adjectves in y as healthi weari etc the adverbs in y ought alone to retain it as freely fully etc  o is a fine close and is very rare in our tongue suppose it given to all substantives ending in harsh consonants such as those in b crabo stabo webo and in c the publico etc to all substantives in d as commando etc we have a vast number of terminations in d and a great part will yet remain and may for it is not a very harsh close the f is the greek ph and we have not many words ending in it so that no alterations need be made g is a harsh close save in the very musical ing of our participle present etc substantives in g should take the o as flago eggo etc the ch is shocking and chocking and throwing out the h is entitled to o even in adjectives as beeco for beech rico for rich etc our other words in h may stand the ish in particular is pleasing as standish a flourish etc the ck is horrid and must omit the k it every instance and take the o in all adjectives and substantives as quaco saco etc the rk must take the o the l is an exquisite final and we have happily a great number the m is bad let all substantives take the o as epigramo etc the n is not unpleasing the ion in particular is excellent all substantives in p must take the o as carpo cupo etc to r and s nothing should be given that can be avoided give all substantives the o substantives in t should all take the o as facto etc  by these alterations and giving the plurals in a great melody might be produced which tho uncouth at first would in half a century become familiar and elegant the possessive s one of the greatest disgraces of our language ought to be kicked out but how supply its place the of or the belongs may supplant it in every possible instance for examples it is hers it belongs to her horaces works the works of horace in fact the of alone is known to other modern languages as a possessive  on the consonants i have no more to observe save that our lexicographers are shockingly mistaken about the ck which they call quite english tho it is unknown till the latest times in old writers we have lak for lack loc for lock etc but never ck that man need never go to a concert or look at a picture who can write public gallick gothic etc and i would praise him who should begin to write roc for rock tric for trick etc our dictionarymongers are still more grossly ignorant with regard to z the name of which they say is izard that is s hard this dream must have occurred to some schoolboy at the very bottom of his form and merits pity the english name in every mouth is ezed and well expresses the sound of that fine consonant which every reader of italian knows to be delicious and superior to that of any consonant save l it even bears repetition with more softness than l itself as grandezza bellezza morbidezza what shall then be said to those teachers who have discovered that it was s hard harder than s itself if such be the barbarism of writers on our language what must be the barbarism of the language itself if charles v talked of speaking english to his horse when it had infinitely more vowels and only one s in words to which the french stupidity of last century gave two such as happiness etc because the french forsooth wrote grandesse etc what would he say of it now he would certainly say he would only talk it to its lexicographers  the z in fact is as much superior to the s in sound as the soothing buz of a be is to the horrid hiss of a serpent the sound made by the be is an eternal continuation of that of z and has been reckoned very pleasing by all poets from those who listened to the bees of hymettus down to milton while the be with honied thie that at her flowery work does sing and the waters murmuring with such concert as they keep entice the dewey feathered steep il pensoroso the hiss of a serpent or goose which has the s hard is quite the reverse of pleasing  the division of inanimate objects into male and female genders is an absurdity from which our tongue is happily free tho it pervades almost all other languages ancient and modern but to render our speech quite perfect the very natural and necessary accommodation of the adjective to the substantive in plural and singular ought to be adopted such as sing a bad pen plur bada pena bad pens  as i know that it is impossible to tire you in treating a subject which is so very interesting to every englishman i shall beg leave to subjoin a paper of the spectator in the improved language which i would propose  spectator no      when i waz ato grand cairo i picked up several orientala manuscripta whica i have still by me among othera i met with one entitulen thea visiona of mirza whica i have redd ove with great pleasure i intend to give ito to the publico when i have no other entertainmento so them ando shall begin with the first vision whico i have translaten wordo so wordo az follows  on the fifth day of the moon whico according to the customo of mya forefathera i always keep holy aftero having washen myself ando offeren up mya morninga devotiona i ascended thea hia hilla of bagdat in ordero to pas the resto of the day in meditation ando prayero az i waz here airing my self on thea topa of thea mountaina i fell into a profound contemplation on the vanite of human life ando passing fro one thote to anothero surely said i man iz buto a shadow ando life a dreamo while i waz thuso muzing i cast mina eyea towardo the summito of a roco tha waz noto faro fro me where i discovered one in the habito of a shepherdo with a litel musical instrumento in hiz hando az i looked upon him he applied ito to hiza lipa and began to play upon ito the soundo of ito waz exceeding sweet and wrote into a variete of tuna tha were inexpressibly melodiouza ando alto differenta fro any thing i had eve heard they put me in mindo of those heavenlia aira tha are playen to thea departen soula of good men upon their first arrival in paradise to wear out thea impressiona of theira lasta agonea and qualify them so thea pleasurea of tha happi place my hearto melted away in secreta rapturea  i had been often told tha the roco befo me waz the haunto of a genius ando tha several had been entertainen with musico who had pasen by ito buto nevero heard tha the musician had befo maden his self visibel when he had raisen mya thotea by those transporting aira whica he played to taste thea pleasurea of hiz conversation az i looked upon him

this bridge consisted ato first of a thousand archea buto tha a great flood sweeped away the resto ando left the bridge in the ruinouz condition i now beheld ito buto tell me further said he wha thou discoverezt on ito i see multitudes of peopel passing ove ito said i ando a blac cloud hanging on eaco endo of ito az i looked more attentively i saw several of the pasengera dropping through the bridge into the great tide tha flowed underneath ito ando upon further examination perceived there were innumerabela trapodora tha lay concealen in the bridge whica thea pasengera no sooner trod upon buto they fell through them into the tide ando immediately disappeared these hidden pitofalla were set very thica ato the entrance of the bridge so tha thronga of peopel no sooner broke through thea

fell ou of site multitudea were very busia in the pursuito of bubbela tha glittered in theira eyea ando danced befo them buto often when they thote theirselva within the reaco of them their footing

so the eye to penetrate i saw the valley opening ato the further endo ando spreading forth into an immense ocean tha had a huge roco of adamanto running through the mido of ito ando dividing ito into two equala parta thea clouda still rested on one half of ito insomuco tha i could discover nothing in ito buto the other appeared to me a vast ocean planten with innumerabela ilanda tha were coveren

those darka clouda whica cover the occan on the other side of the roco of adamanto the genius making me no answero i turned abou to addres myself to him second time buto i found tha he had left me i theno turned again to the vision whico i had been so long contemplating buto instead of the rolling tide the archen bridge ando thea happia ilanda i saw nothing buto the long hollow valley of bagdat with oxen sheep ando camela grazing upon they sidea of ito  i am sensible that the uncouth appearance of many of the newmodified words in this specimen will make you smile but as themistocles said to the spartan general strike but hear me so say i smile but hear me had chaucer obtained a prophetic glimpse of our present language perfect as we think it how he would have laughed ridicule is indeed so far from being the test of truth that no person or object in nature is not capable of being viewed in a ridiculous light montesquieu observes that women whose understandings are generally weak are the supreme and immediate judges of ridicule indeed we all know that women and children are the very first to perceive any thing ridiculous in a person or incident which is of itself a certain proof that ridicule may be defined to be the effect of an odd sensation produced in very weak minds by the grotesque representation of things which their own feeble or distorted faculties occasion and it is a certain fact that the weaker and the more minute any mind is the more it is prone to ridicule for we always observe that one fool is the readiest to find out and expose another  i make these remarks merely to guard you against trying me by the laws of ridicule for if so you may laugh and i will think and let us see who will get the better in the end for nothing is so manly as to ridicule ridicule which is itself the most ridiculous thing in the world and i even admire mr grays plan of wearing mustachios for a considerable time to show that he despised every possibility of ridicule  after this protestation i shall beg leave to offer a few observations more on this very interesting subject  the number of words in the greek language is about  0000 in the latin about the same by words i understand those put as distinct words in dictionaries  of modern languages the italian has about   000 the french about   000 the spanish about  0000 the english has about   000 johnsons dictionary has upwards of  0000 but of these  000 are obsolete or never used and all his words from sir thomas brown and other pedants ought to have been omitted the joke is that with him every body is an authority  the greek language has of vowel terminations onethird or    words in a  00  the latin the same  the italian ninetenths or  0 in  00  the spanish    in  00 or twothirds  the english    in  00 or onefourth  of all these you see the english comes highest the greek and roman even now in vowel terminations and in initial and medial vowels they may be regarded as equal the english is therefore at present the most perfect of modern languages even in sound  but to give a language more perfect in melody than any yet seen the number of consonant and vowel terminations ought to be equal this the plan i have just proposed would effect to every possible degree  did you ever observe that n r and t are so frequent in our tongue as in a fount of letters to require triple the number of almost any other consonant the r is very harsh and wherever any of them can be turned out the better tho the t be a very soft vowel and the n has a fine silver sound  it may strike you that the plural in a might have an effect like the supernumerary a in burlesque songs as he was a gallant knighta etc but this very singularity of a superfluous vowel unknown to other languages proves that we want terminating vowels to the melody of our tongue and that a is chiefly wanted  lastly most of the alterations in the specimen are not innovations but restorations of ou ancient language  since i am treating the improvement of language give me leave to add a very few remarks on the present greek characters used in printing which are in a shocking state indeed  aldus and the other printers who first printed greek adopted at once the most barbarous characters then used by the greek amanuenses hence the first greek characters are worse than the roman tho the later are very unshapely by a singular fatality the roman character has been improved and brought to supreme elegance while the greek has got worse and worse the abominable contractions which appear in almost every word of the first editions of latin books are now no where to be found the more abominable contractions and distorted letters of the early greek editions still exist in all their glory  common sense common sense what an uncommon thing art thou  the strange letters and contractions now used in the greek are no older than the tenth century as may be seen in montfaucons palaeographia graeca they were introduced by most barbarous monks in the most barbarous age and we more barbarous than the most barbarous retain them before that period of deep ignorance the greek was all written in elegant and formal capitals of which fine specimens exist such as the alexandrian old and new testament in the british museum and others after that the greek amanuenses  as they called themselves began to use small characters in imitation of the copiers of latin as would seem and to study to unite them they were ignorant that the genius of the greek and roman written character is quite distinct and that he who attempts to bind the greek letters to one another will totally destroy any shadow of their form this they might have learned from the very first attempts as we observe in the epistle of a byzantine emperor to a king of france given in fac simile by montfaucon which resembles the arabic much more than the greek modern greeks find it impossible to give a ligature to more than two letters in writing and even then the form is injured to write three without quite annihilating the character i will venture to pronounce an impossibility some of these contractions and ligatures have been of shocking consequence to the sense of authors as montfaucon shows and even now it takes a keen eye to discern between s and st this strange jumbling of characters together has been one grand cause of the total barbarism in which we now see the greek another grand cause arises from the horrible contractions now the joke is that all these contractions are elongations it will take a man far longer to write them than the letters they represent they put me in mind of and for  and of a contraction i have seen on a signpost in a village alexandere brown yet to these blessed contractions and ligatures is it owing that the present greek character is more ugly than that of any language whatever tho at first it was as distinct and elegant as the roman  the restoration of the greek characters were very easy and yet a printer would gain immortality by it let us see  the present greek capitals are  of these i only object to two the th and x both of which hurt the eye very much because the parts of them are detached and broken asunder they occur of several forms in old greek inscriptions and manuscripts but i prefer those marked   and   in the little sketch annexed which are much more pleasing to the eye the o is far better in the form of fig   as marking o long  but it is in the small greek alphabet that supreme improvements may be made and i subjoin such a one as i think the best after consulting many mss etc on the occasion the present z and x in particular are horrible apothecaries marks for both i give their capitals with a slight variation in the former it must be remarked that the small greek letter never admits of what letterfounders call a ceriph or line across the terminations as the roman  in some books printed at basil by curio and others about    0 an italic greek characte appears with much elegance allowing for contractions and ligatures this if the printers please may be called basil greek as i think this variety would be as elegant and useful in the greek as in the latin and modern tongues i have likewise given an alphabet of it the twentyfour small greek characters which i have given i need hardly add will answer every possible use fully as well as the twentyfour common large greek characters or as all the contractions and ligatures in the world tho as an eminent letterfounder informs me they amount to about three hundred even now in daily use  as to the greek accents every one knows that they are more useless if possible than the ligatures and contractions the mark of aspiration ought alone to be retained and made of some body and apart as what is called a superior letter in whatever form is most agreeable for mss and printed books differ but the best seems to be a small roman h turned backward as that marked   in the alexandrian bible thought to be of the  th or  th century the only note like an accent is a dot over the g nor can accents be traced higher than the  0th or   th century when they appeared along with contractions and ligatures true it is that a greek manuscript was lately found at herculaneum with accents that is the acute accent was put upon every vowel a practice just as rational as any other in this way the germans alone of all modern european nations read the greek by the accents and say for instance not  so that the power of the omega is lost and it is confounded with omicron nay the modern greeks all read by the accents in which they show total ignorance of the greek nor let this be wondered at for who of us knows how chaucer pronounced english the slender a so common in our language is not fo old as elizabeths time le maurier in his memoires de la hollande tells us that elizabeth pronounced french ill saying maa foi and paar dieu a sensible antiquary observes that now she would have said may foi and per dieu dance france with a thousand more words in which the a slender now appears were formerly written as pronounced dance france etc nothing fluctuates so much as language and he that looks for ancient greek among the modern greeks will find himself mistaken they have altered the sound of almost every vowel nay have gone so far as to give the eta the sound of epsilon and the reverse they say  for  and  for  etc  by the bye it is surprising that not one englishman save milton seems to have discovered that the english pronounciation of the latin is improper the a in latin is always broad as is the e the i has the power of our e slender the romans did not pronounce satyetas but sachietas etc etc etc milton ordered his daughters to read to him accordingly as we find in his life by birch indeed it is as absurd to read latin in english as to read french so  before i give you my greek alphabet which is not new i assure you but very ancient i shall just observe that one or two of the latin characters might be improved or rather restored such is the a which would be far more elegant if given in the form used in writing see that marked  the small belly is very disagreeable to the eye and the other would be far more round and beautiful the g is still worse and hurts the eye very much it should be given as that marked or that with the other characters are very neat and pleasing the dot over the i might however be spared as quite unnecessary and only serving to injure the beauty and regularity of the line printers seem at a loss for marks of annotation and even those they use are getting more and more ugly particularly the cross and double cross which have unfortunately been called dagger and doubledagger and some learned letterfounders have now begun to form them accordingly the is not a proper notationmark as it implies section and is daily used in the true sense the  is the only decent mark left and this like all the others is made four times the size it should be it is impossible to make those marks too small for it is only necessary to see them and every eye can see even a point they ought always to be very minute and superior as i look upon the smallest parts of this superlative art as important i annex some new marks of annotation and the proper form of the cross and double cross  tho i wish to see variations for the better in the english language yet be assured that there cannot be a variation even for the better in the sincere speech of friendship with which i am etc             th    o       g g  heart diamond circlet

and that is where an author writes in a style that might well give delight to the learned and yet by some strange chance or other his reputation is only in the mouths of common readers i have a singular instance of this to produce in a poem which i am confident you never heard of but which yet possesses a merit superior to that of many pieces of the very first celebrity it has passed through eight editions from the year      when it was published to the present time yet has never been mentioned in any critical work whatever the style is so much that of shakspere that had he written in this species of poetry he could have adopted no other to detain your curiosity no longer this wonderful production is called the grave a poem and is written by robert blair who was all episcopal clergyman in edinburgh  as i am sure you have never seen it i beg leave to lay before you some of its most beautiful passages in order to raise your expectation to the highest ere i send you the poem itself i admire this poem so much that i have procured most of the editions of it from the first to the last they have various readings and i will send you a copy with the most remarkable written on the margin in the mean time in copying my extracts i have preferred the readings which i thought best  soon after a proper introduction the following striking passage appears see yonder hallowed fane the pious work of names once famed now dubious or forgot and buried midst the wreck of things which were there lie interred the more illustrious dead the wind is up hark how it howls methinks till now i never heard a sound so dreary doors creak and windows clap and nights foul bird rookd in the spire screams loud the gloomy aisles black plastered and hung round with shreds of scutcheons and tattered coats of arms send back the sound laden with heavier airs from the low vaults the mansions of the dead roused from their slumbers in grim array the grizly specter rise grin horrible and obstinately sullen pass and repass hushed as the foot of night again the screechowl shrieks ungracious sound i will hear no more  it makes my blood run chill   the following picture is a very natural and fine one often in the lone churchyard at night i have seen by glimpse of moonshine chequering through the trees the schoolboy with his satchel in his hand whistling aloud to bear his courage up and lightly tripping over the long flat stones with nettles skirted and with moss oergrown that tell in homely phrase who lie below sudden he starts and hears or thinks he hears the sound of something purring at his heels full fast he flies and dares not look behind him till out of breath he overtakes his fellows who gather round and wonder at the tale of horrid apparition tall and ghastly that walks at dead of night or takes his stand over some newopend grave and strange to tell evanishes at crowing of the cock this pleasing picture is finely contrasted by the following affecting one which immediately follows it the newmade widow too i have sometimes spied  sad sight slow moving over the prostrate dead listless the crauls along in doleful black while bursts of sorrow gush from either eye fast falling down her now untasted cheek prone on the lowly grave of the dear man she drops while busy meddling memory in barbarous succession musters up the past endearments of their softer hours tenacious of its theme still still she thinks she sees him and indulging the fond thought clings yet more closely to the senseless turf nor heeds the passenger who looks that way   in the above description there are many minute strokes that infer the superior poet her now untasted cheek she drops to adopt the sound to the action busy meddling memory an expression so perfectly shaksperian yet not of shakspere  the following passage is equal to any of the most admired moral parts of shakspere and in the true manner of that wonderful dramatist dull grave thou spoilst the dance of youthful blood strikest out the dimple from the cheek of mirth and every smirking feature from the face branding our laughter with the name of madness where are the jesters now the men of health complexionally pleasant where the droll whose every look and gesture was a joke to clapping theaters and gaping crowds and made even thicklippd musing melancholy to gather up her face into a smile before she was aware ah sullen now and dumb as the green turf that covers them   this description is likewise purely and perfectly shaksperian but see the wellplumd hearse comes nodding on stately and slow and properly attended by the whole sable tribe that painful watch the sick mans door and live upon the dead by letting out their persons by the hour to mimic sorrow when the hearts not sad how rich the trappings now they are all unfurled and glittering in the sun triumphant entries of conquerors and coronation pomps in glory scarce exceed great gluts of people retard the unwieldy show while from the casements and houses tops ranks behind ranks close wedged hang bellying over live upon the dead is a pitiful antithesis but shakspere would have used it  admire this masterly passage beauty thou pretty plaything dear deceit that steals so softly over the striplings heart and gives it a new pulse unknown before the grave discredits thee thy charms expunged thy roses faded and thy lilies soiled what have thou more to boast of will thy lovers flock round thee now to gaze and do thee homage methinks i see thee with thy head laid low while surfeited upon thy damask cheek the highfed worm in lazy volumes rolled riots unscard   contrast the above description with the following what groan was that i heard deep groan indeed with anguish heavy laden let me trace it from yonder bed it comes where the strong man by stronger arm now vanquished gasps for breath like a hardhunted beast how his great heart beats thick his roomy chest by far too scant to give the lungs full play what now avail the strongbuilt sinewy limbs the wellspread shoulders see how he toils for life and lays about him mad with his pain eager he catches hold of what comes next to hand and grasps it hard just like a creature drowning hideous sight oh how his eyes stand out and stare full ghastly while the distempers rank and deadly venom shoots like a burning arrow through his bowels and drinks his marrow up  heard you that groan it was his last   the passage on the death of the philosopher is exceeding well as is that on the physician but i need not repeat every beauty this stroke in the last is quite miltonic from stubborn shrubs thou wrungst their shy retiring virtues out and vexed them in the fire   the sexton i must not forget he is a brother of him in hamlet but far from a servile imitator see yonder maker of the deadmans bed the sexton hoaryheaded chronicle of hard unmeaning face down which never stole a gentle tear with mattock in his hand he digs through rows of kindred and acquaintance by far his juniors scarce a sculls cast up but well he knew its owner and can tell some passage of his life thus hand in hand the sot has walked with death twice twenty years and yet no youngster on the green laughs louder or clubs a smuttier tale when drunkards meet none sings a merrier catch or lends his hand more willing to his cup poor wretch he minds not that soon some trusty brother of the trade shall do for him what he has done for thousands this comparison applied to time is shakspere again yet treads more soft than ever did midnight thief who slides his hand under the misers pillow and carries off his prize no simile can exceed the following for pastoral and elegant simplicity among the various tenants of the grave he enumerates the longdemurring maid whose lonely unappropriated sweets smiled like you knot of cowslips on the cliff not to be come at by the willing hand   i shall conclude with another simile of equal merit near the close of the poem which consists of about  00 lines he is mentioning the aversion even of the good to death tho they place eternal happiness as a certainty beyond it  so have i seen upon a summers eve close by the rivulets brink a youngster play how wishfully he looks to stem the tide this moment resolute next unresolved at last he dips his foot but as he dips his fears redouble and he runs away from the inoffensive stream unmindful now of all the flowers that paint the further bank and smiled so sweet of late i cannot close my letter without remarking that there is no poem in which the verse and phrase of shakspere are so well followed in their very spirit as this the diction is frugal and chaste yet upon occasion highly poetical without any appearance of research in short i recommend it to you without hesitation as one of the very first poems in the english language  letter xxxvi a poet may doubtless be too much an antiquary when treating an ancient subject but he may likewise be too little so and the last fault is the most common tho both extremes are equally prejudicial if a poet has too little science of antiquity his ignorance disgusts and if he has or rather shows too much his pedantry is nauseous  the study of antiquity has always appeared to me very uncertain more especially that relating to the ages before the greek classics flourished and after the roman period of literature was succeeded by long centuries of gloomy ignorance the strong light which the greek and roman authors cast around them serves to expose the most minute custom to the eye but in the night that succeeded any object must be very large indeed if it strikes our view till the morning of science again broke toward the beginning of the sixteenth century  the period preceding the greek classics is left to the full flight of the poets imagination providing he errs not against the costume of such nations as are described by ancient historians the latter period which is indeed the period of chivalry when the feudal system gave new forms to society confines the poet more yet leaves a vast field for bold fiction  the customs and manners of feudal times were perfectly similar in most countries the knight who traversed the wild heaths and mountains of scotland was the same in his armor his manners his pursuits with him who paced over the fragrant valleys of spain they had traveled to the same courts fought in the same tourneys and perhaps adored the same mistress their castles were built much in the same manner and alike situated on an insulated rock surrounded by a gloomy torrent or on a commanding hill the manners of the spanish knight might be imputed by any poet with strict propriety to the scottish and the contrary if such poet were to describe a castle in england or scotland and it turned out to be upon the french italian or spanish model might it not be said with great justice that there must have been many such castles actually existing the founders of them having preferred such models to those of their own country are there not many peers in great britain at this moment who build their houses and live in every point after foreign fashions hence you see the absurdity of a poets restricting himself too much to mere local antiquity when fashion caprice and accident are as ancient as any antiquities in the world  indeed no science whatever proceeds upon such uncertain grounds as that of the antiquities of the respective countries of the world during the middle ages our authorities are those of romances in which for aught we know customs may be described which had no real existence on purpose to increase the mavelous and those of historians of credulous faith and mean information much scope is therefore left to the poet and if he errs not against the costume of greater notoriety he is as likely to be right as any historian or romancewriter of the times for one will see objects more distinctly with a good telescope tho at some miles distance than a person with bad natural organs of vision can upon the spot if a poet for instance were to describe english cuirassiers at the battle of azincour tho some monkish historian were positively to say that there were none i should prefer the poets testimony to that of the cotemporary dunce because we have no relation of that battle by any writer who was present if there was such relation the writer might have omitted the circumstance from spite at some officer of those cuirassiers or from forgetfulness or the relation itself might be altered and corrupted if no faith is due on such a particular point to an eye witness what is due to a monkish historian who heard it from an old woman who heard it from a sergeant who was at the battle if a poet were even to describe the french king as charging our troops on that occasion with his men drawn up in the grecian phalanx who shall confute him is it not at least as probable as that there is in the british army a regiment of cavalry who wear helmets of greek form yet the last is a fact fortune delights to blend times and circumstances as much as to alter them  nothing can be more risible than to see a professed antiquary from some scrap of an ancient writer deciding upon the manners and customs of a whole country and century when perhaps the particular custom mentioned was confined to a dozen of people and totally vanished in six weeks i wish the memoirs of scriblerus had extended to the feudal times that the vapid studies of the mere antiquary might have been as much exposed to ridicule in respect to those as to the times of greece and rome  letter xxxvii your detestation of modern latin poetry cannot well exceed mine yet were all the works of it to be thrown into the fire as you propose there are one or two that i would risk burning my fingers to redeem the basia of secundus would be one of these and indeed the only entire work in other authors i should be content with two or three select leaves these leaves should be torn only from the poems of casimir sorbiewsky with one leaf from those of menage tho not written by that author being the fable of love and folly by the pere commire i would transcribe it but it is rather long and menages poems are not uncommon so shall content myself with recommending it to your perusal after observing that it is in the simple style of phaedrus which you so deservedly admire by the way here is a pretty french poem with the same title tho of a very different subject it is by the noted piron and if you have not seen it you will thank me for it lamour et la folly javois jure detre sage mais

happened to light upon him at some dull hour when insipidity itself appears bright liked him and praised him to the skies in his essay on criticism that work became popular and there is the whole of the mystery you know pope loved modern latin poetry so much as to publish the selecta poemata italorum in two volumes a work that does still less credit to his critical abilities than his edition of shakspere  i have said that in my opinion i will not say humble for that is a proud word the basia of secundus two or at most three odes of casimir and the fable of commire constitute all the modern latin poetry that merits preservation and i have read the poems of fracastorius amaltheus buchanauus grotius heinsius and all the men in us as moliere calls them that ever scribbled together with those of all the names in any other syllable whatever to the number of many hundreds they are all so many carcases of the respective countries dressed in roman habits behold a tolerable epigram upon those of italy  in italos poet as recentiores latin scribentes vatibus hic mos est italis ut mill smaragdos ut mill intexant versibus astra suis nil praeter flores aurum marmorque loquuntur nil radios

rate allow me to send you one of his odes indeed the very best insornuch that upon reading it i do not wonder at the high opinion grotius expresses of the author namely that he always equals and often surpasses horace i shall beg leave to subjoin to it a translation of my own upon a new plan syllable for syllable a little in the manner of miltons translation of quis te puer gracilis sub antro save that milton and his followers in this stanza have only adopted the mechanic form not the syllabication which i shall religiously preserve read and admire  ad suam testudinem sonori buxi filia sutilis

pliant boxen stem on the high poplar o my harp thou shall depend while laughs the sky and the gale softly revives the listless leaves the western wind will solicit with gentlest breath the music of thy charming strings i the mean while lost in sweet ease will recline along the green of this fair bank alas what sudden clouds invade the sunny sky what unexpected showers in sounding haste descend let us be gone ah how soon will happiness still pass away in the original i do not like testudinem shell when it appears from the first line to be made of box nor the epithet sutilis which implies patched or sewed together not capable of being wrought into musical or other instruments which must have been the authors idea and which perhaps i have not strongly expressed by pliant sibilantis is unhappy so i think is collum the last stanza is faultless  his sixteenth ode of the second book is likewise fine but not equal to this how do you like this passage in ode ix book iii it is addressed to a lady  non indecorae nube modestiae extinguis aurum vilius aspici gemmasque nolentes latere moribus ingenioque celas hinc inde rubris creta coralliis illinc smaragdis fulguret india cum pura virtus fulsit omnes in tenebris latuere gazae the   th ode of the same book ad apes barberinas is extremely pretty here it is for it is very short breve plerumque quod elegans i deny the apophthegm however if applied ad genus foemininum cives hymetti gratus atticae lepos virgineae volucres flavaeque veris filiae gratum fluentis turba praedatrix thymi nectaris artifices bonaeque ruris hospitae laboriosis quod juvat volatibus crure tenus viridem perambulare patriam si barberino delicata principe secula melle fluunt parata vobis secula need i tell you that the arms of urban viii of the house of barberini then the reigning pontiff were three bees urban was himself no mean poet in the latin way and must have been much pleased with this fine allusion to his armorial bearing indeed the happiest of the kind which i remember to have read  the eighteenth ode of the fourth book ad rosam has been quoted by james hervey of religious memory the full address is ad rosam quotannis kal junii divae virginis caput coronaturus the two first stanzas are exquisite if you except one line the second of the second stanza chariots with four horses by the way seem a favorite inage of this writer and spoil many of his personifications siderum sacros imitata vultus quid laces dudum rosa delicaum effer e terris caput o tepentis filia coeli jam tibi nubes fugiunt aquosae quas fugant albis zephyri quadrgis jam tibi mulcet borean jocantis aura favoni i moreover dont like e terris roses never spring from the ground but fron the rosier the rest containing the religious part is as usual foolish enough  the twentythird of this book ad cieadam is likewise elegant but the idea s too similar to that of the superlative ode first produced  we may with propriety conclude our little treat from this writer with these lines of ode    book iv after a prophecy of the future happiness of poland his naive country he tenderly closes thus  tunc mea carmina discenda grandaevi parents virginibus puerisque dicent frustra nam in urna surdus et immemor jacebopulvis me tamen integrae laui coronabunt jacentem et cirum hederae violaeque serpent in a word had the judgment of casimir sorbiewsky equaled his imagination he would have been one of the fist lyric poets in the world  do not think however that when in my enumeration of the very few modern latin poems that merit praise i omitted mr grays ode oh t severi religio loci i meant to leave it in the flames on the contrary i know you would burnyour horace ere you would put it there but leigh ho i wish it had been in english which would have saved me the trouble of putting t in a poor english dress after the manner of my former translation of an alcaic ode of casmir however such as it is you shall have i  oh thou the stern religion of this severe place for sure by whateername thou love to be called no mean dty must hold these native streams and ancient groves and more is seen the presence of some awful god amid those pathless rocks and uplands wild broken cliffs and raging streams and horrors of the woody night than beneath the citron roof if pomhously shrind in luxury of gold he shone and phidian art all hail hear my revrent vows indulge with rest my weary youth oh if cruel fortune forbids me to enjoy tho much i wish in vain thy seats of calm delight and law of holy silence resorbing me in violent waves at least oh father grant me in some nook remote to wear away the free hours of my peaceful age secure from vulgar tumult concealed by thee and human cares this exquisite ode is by no means in the alcaic measure which mr gray seems to have intended it for the alcaic measure as used by horace consists of six feet or twelve syllables in the two first lines three feet and a half or seven syllables in the third and four feet or eight syllables in the fourth but what occasion is there to restrict modern poets to ancient measures tho writing in a ancient tongue when they may use what measures they please in modern languages are not the stanza and construction of mr gray fully as harmonious to our ears as those of horace the rest is pedantry yet i remember to have once had a dispute with the first of our living poets upon this very topic but as we could not use the ratio ultima regum and thought it below us to lay wagers having the fear of hudibras before our eyes the fire went out after we had exhausted our fuel

literature i confess commonly go hand in hand in proportion as the mind becomes refined the manners become so likewise the contrary is also true for in proportion as the manners become luxurious the mind grows refined as liquors after fermentation run off pure this was known to marivaux a great master in the science of mental luxury he tells us i think in his marianne que lesprit sepure a proportion quil se gate  luxury my friend is an invidious name but is in itself the perfection of human nature i mean not however the luxury of a beast but that of a man temperance is the highest luxury under heaven in every sense of the word if luxury consists in the free use of the most exquisite pleasures temperance is luxury luxury in the extreme luxury without satiety but this luxury is only known to the wise and the good the learned are not always wise and good the luxury of a learned age is very frequently that luxury which confounds every sense by saturating all luxury in the penal acceptance of the word  this luxury is merely comparative the luxury of ancient times is barbaric penury to the present i speak of the ancient times of our own country britain will probably never arrive at the luxury of ancient greece or rome  the common idea that luxury is a sure mark of a declining state is puerile and worthy to be embraced by those only who as lord bacon somewhere says are not learned beyond certain common places luxury is commonly a token of the progress and vital health of a state in so much that when luxury declines the state declines as the decline of spirits in the human body accompanies the decline of health few states ever achieved any thing great till they were luxurious  what a paradox you will say was ancient greece luxurious when the fields of marathon were dyed with the blood of the persians  yes it was ancient greece was luxurious in the extreme when the fields of marathon were dyed with the blood of the persians read athenaeus and you will learn that at that period the very mob of athens walked the streets in robes of silk and with grasshoppers of gold glittering in their hair their generals and officers were abandoned to a sensuality that disgraces the name of man and wallowed in all the beastliness of vulgar luxury and riot  the learned men of greece those perpetual wonders of the world as they transcended humanity in some things fell below it in others pindar eschylus euripides sophocles and others we know for certainty were given up entirely to a vice too black to mention socrates himself had different catamites beside alcibiades tho his passion for the last was the most notorious they who look upon their infamous loves as platonic only show their total ignorance of grecian learning and of grecian manners athenaeus whose curious work every man should read with diligent attention who wishes to form a personal acquaintance if i may so speak with the illustrious men of greece is a sure voucher of these facts for he gives the words of cotemporary witnesses his work being indeed only a compilation grecian manners as shown in the writings of their authors did not regard this vice as of the slightest moment sophocles and euripides practiced it we know in the open fields around athens as we learn from their own epigrams preserved by athenaeus anacreons odes show that the passion was looked upon as equally innocent with legitimate love tho perhaps you may reject this last testimony for of late some wiseacres have discovered that anacreons odes are not genuine because forsooth they are in a different style from the fragments of some cotemporary of his i forget whom if you have not heard of this discovery i know you will laugh but it is serious oh oh well said dan chaucer the gretest clerks been not the wisest men what should we say to him who told us that waller could not be cotemporary with milton because their style is quite dissimilar so dissimilar that ten centuries must have elapsed between them did you ever hear of one pere hardouin a madman of learning a common character who tells us that homer virgil and horace were forged by monks in the twelsth century this discovery he made from their style in fact no ancient can be known from his style for he is a poor writer who cannot command a hundred different styles  to return such was greece in the day of her glory need i produce other instances to evince that luxury in its vulgar acceptance is the parent of great atchievments  the reason may happily be this contempt of life must produce any of these actions in which life is evidently set down by its possessor as a mere trifle now this contempt is more certainly produced by luxury than by the ferocious spirit of barbarism how you will say does not luxury enervate a man and make him a coward the very contrary it makes him brave  to explain this paradox only consider what a taedium vitae an ennui luxury breeds and you will not wonder that no man despises life so much as the disciple of luxury who has drunk of life till he is sick men of temperance alone enjoy life and feel its delight men of luxury are the most likely to be those who smile on death and glory in the grave  personal courage indeed depends totally upon the animal spirits as the spirits are in perpetual fluctuation we need not wonder at a brave man on one occasion being a coward on another yet luxurious living which ferments and exalts the spirits is certainly more likely to produce courage than the parsimony of temperance falstaff you know tells us that warm blood begets warm thoughts  these warm thoughts my dear friend will sometimes do wonders in literature as well as in war and there are poets whose pages have much of the true flavor of burgundy but corporeal luxury may beget works that flash for a moment temperance the mother of mental luxury is the supreme parent of great and wise productions  i have said that britain can never rival the luxury of ancient greece or rome the climate forbids it a country where the means of luxury are natives of the soil will certainly be more luxurious when a just and equal government permits the enjoyment of her own blessings than a country in which these means are the produce of commerce  it follows not however that britain must yield to greece in science tho science is never widely diffused till luxury is so likewise tho luxury is never carried to a height till science refines it the reason is evident science relates to the mind but luxury to the body the mind acquires ideas of every luxury of every climate tho its grosser companion cannot enjoy them  it is indeed absurd to lay down general rules upon any subject luxury may attain its height after the decline of a state as well as during its greatest elevation perhaps we are now more luxurious than during the age of george the second the period of the widest extension and fame of our empire  tho literature has in the most celebrated countries attended with equal steps the progress of luxury yet there are climates in which they have not appeared together nature loves to vary all her operations the little folly of man only would confine her his modes of acting are few those of nature insinite he delights in systems nature knows no systems  letter xl lord bacon in his admirable work on the advancement of learning published   0  has with his usual amplitude of mind pointed out in what parts human science was at that time deficient from his hints many deficiencies have been supplied since that period by writers of the first merit others still remain in the state they were in that age it will i flatter myself be an enquiry of infinite curiosity and importance to show wherein knowledge partly from that great mans ideas partly from chance and the natural advancement of the arts has been enriched since the publication of lord bacons treatise and wherein it may still be pronounced to be deficient and in order to this it will be first necessary to review lord bacons plan  he divides learning into three parts correspondent to the three grand attributes of the mind history to the memory poesy to the imagination and philosophy to the judgment  history he divides into natural civil ecclesiastical and literary the three first he allows as extant the last as deficient  he however afterward subdivides natural history into three sorts that of nature in course that of nature erring or varying and that of nature altered or wrought that is says he history of creatures history of marvails and history of arts the first he notes as extant in perfection the two latter are so weakly treated that he remarks them as deficient  civil history he divides into memoirs perfect histories and antiquities which last he denominates remnants of history that have escaped the shipwreck of time in the first and last he can report no deficience as being imperfect in their very nature  the second species or perfect history he subdivides into history of a time or chronicle of a person or lise what we now call biography and of an action or relation all of these classes he allows deficient in his own country  ecclesiastical history which is indeed that of human madness need not be insisted on  he then enumerates what he calls appendices to history these are apothemes orations and letters his remark on the last i must beg leave to quote such letters as are written for wise men are of all the words of men in my judgment the best for they are more natural than orations and public speeches and more advised than conferences or present speeches in these he has no deficiencies to propound  in poetry he can report no defect it having no progress  philosophy he divides into divine natural and human leaving the frist to supernatural heads we shall proceed to the second which he says consists in natural science and natural prudence natural science he subdivides into physic and metaphysic the first the knowledge of matter of all that has only being and metion the last that of spirit mind abstract idea in physic he can find no defect for many authers had written on it tho with what truth he pretends not to determine  metaphysic relates to forms and qualities as colors vegetation gravity levity tenuity density hear cold etc and secondly to final causes as if the leaves of trees are meant to protect the fruit etc the first he brands as deficient the latter he allows extant but wishes it confined to its prober place  he adds to natural science that of mathematics in which he observes no deficience  natural prudence or the practical part of natural philosophy he divides into experimental philosophic or that arising from a knowledge of physical causes and magical which he seems so to denominate as from prosound discovery being capable of operations thought supernatural as the prolongation of life beyond the natural term etc this he reports as defective  in treating of natural prudence he recommends an inventory of the estate of man containing all the inventions extant from which will follow a just idea of what is not yet invented  he adds to natural philosophy a division of doubts or problems general and particular the first consisting of opinions of philosophers not yet fully established or refuted the last of problems like those of aristotle after from experiments etc only doubt and not clear truth could arise in this he recommends a calendar of popular errors  we are now happily arrived at what he improperly calls human knowledge by which he means the knowledge of ourselves a part of science of the highest use and dignity and to which all the rest are but trifles this he divides into two grand heads the knowledge of man segregate or considered as an individual and civil knowledge or the science of society and government  the desiciencies noted in the first are medicinal history or narrations of cases omissions in anatomy rash pronounciations by physicians upon diseases impropriety of receipts etc all mere trifles in comparison of what might be expected from such an author  knowledge of the mind he divides into two parts that of the nature and that of the faculties of the soul the first he confesses beyond the sphere of human science divination and fascination he adds to this as small appendices foolishly enough for there are without doubt no such things in being they should have fallen under the head of poetry  the knowledge of the faculties of the mind he likewise subdivides into two kinds that of the understanding and that of the passions or rational and moral  the first contains the four intellectual arts that of enquiry or invention that of examination or judgment that of custody or memory and that of elocution or tradition invention relates to arts and to speech and arguments or rhetoric and logic over which the province of judgment likewise extends he considers memory then passes to tradition which is either by speech or writing to it therefore belong grammar and rhetoric he here treats of the methods of communicating knowledge and recommends the socratic plan of leaving every thing in doubt this he calls methodus sincerus sive ad filios scientiarum after some hints on rhetoric he passes to two appendices to the tradition of science one of which he calls critical and the other pedantic knowledge the first he divides into five points   editing and correcting books   annotations explaining them   knowledge of the times in which the books were written   judgment on authors pointing out what books deserve reading what not   the disposition of studies or in what order books ought to be read   pedantic knowledge or that of a schoolmaster admits four divisions   timing of knowledge   progress from easy authors to difficult   knowledge of the difference of talents   exercise under which head he includes manners and education in general   moral philosophy he considers at sore length and with his usual strength and accuracy except in some compliments to james i to whom his work is addressed and who was the most foolish and base prince who ever disgraced a throne  social science he next considers with great wisdom under the heads of conversation and of business his thoughts on this most important head are happily given in no very contracted bounds and are almost worth the whole large work of charron i look upon this as by far the most valuable part of his most valuable performance  the other head of civil knowledge or that of government and laws he treats with timid brevity and it is no wonder when writing to a king and to an idiot king  divine learning or divinity is the final part of his work and on this he writes mere nonsense like milton and other great men whose prejudices were too strong for all their talents or who thought loquendum ut vulgus sentiendum ut sapientes  such is the analysis and very soul of this great work let us now proceed to what was proposed in the beginning of this letter and endeavor to point out in what parts science has been improved since its publication and in what parts it is yet deficient an undertaking which if executed in its due extent would be worthy of some bacon of this age if such there can arise and were of the very first importance to mankind of any literary labors whatever this is meant as an apology for the slight attempt to be made in this letter which it is hoped you will receive with your usual indulgence of friendship for even superficial hints on such a subject are of no small daring yet literary courage and spirit of discovery you have not seldom imputed to your friend rinaldo indeed you told him lately was his model when you quoted e volge intorno gli occhi e quella strada sol gli piace tentar chaltri dispera let him plead in excuse these equal lines in the very next stanza ogni rischio al valor sempre e securo tutte le vie son piane a gli animosi courage if he fails write on his epistolary essay magnis tamen excidit ausis  without further presace the first subdivision of natural history tho considered as extant by lord bacon he means in pliny gesner and aldrovandus has received such vast improvements since his time by the labors of buffon and other eminent naturalists that it evidently appears that he had been rash in marking it as not deficient botany in particular has acquired a new and scientific form by the universal adoption of the linnaean or sexual system  the second subdivision on history of wonders in nature is yet wanting tho in the philosophic transactions and elsewhere are funds properly evidenced for at least a first volume of such a work than which nothing could well be more interesting even to the idle and the ignorant  in the history of arts france has done so much as almost to move me to assume lord bacons authority and put it down as no longer defective the history of most arts may now be found either in the encyclopedie or published separately by men of skill  in civil history the article of memoirs was defective in england in lord bacons time france indeed had joinville froissart commines italy guicciardini there are no ancient memoirs of classic times save those of xenophon and caesar but the article was deficient and is still in this country the scottish authors in this way are pretty numerous melville has vast merit in every view burnets memoirs or as he calls them history of his own time may be pronounced the very best work on our history yet extant his talents and honesty are so great that i agree with henry fielding that he is the chief of our historical writers tho he be sometimes too credulous as for instance in relating the death of james the seconds son whom he thought supposititious the laughers who are wits to fools and fools to men of wit were against him pope and bolingbroke and the whole of that detestable jacobite set united their strongest efforts to depress the work with too much success and some pitiful curs of our own time have joined in the cry but if burnets memoirs are not very soon universally read and admired this country will speedily become a province of france dr johnson has justly praised his fine style that of his history is excellent and has all the strength and clearness of hume without his barbarisms you will observe that i do not look upon the work of thuanus as memoirs but as universal history it is not in the style of memoirs as burnets history is chronological abridgments of history are highly valuable but must be written with quite different talents from those of henault whose work is without taste and without knowledge it has sold however  because he was a president  antiquities in lord bacons acceptance relate as he expresses it solely to fragments that have escaped the shipwreck of time such are the parts of diodorus siculus and of polybius that have reached us antiquities in our modern phraseology imply all that is properly the province of an antiquary the science of ancient customs manners buildings dresses coins etc etc etc this science when applied to man and manners is very amusing and entertaining and as it has escaped lord bacon allow me to put it down as an appendix to civil history and only desicient in lord bacons sense when speaking of what he calls antiquities that is as imperfect in its very nature and always admitting of further discovery  the science of medals forms another appendix to civil history and that of the first importance as they afford the strongest collateral evidence of its truth that can be given it is surprising this elegant study is not more general for it certainly stands very high in the class of scientific amusements nay the philosopher who writes or peruses history for that greatest of purposes the knowledge of human manners will learn more from medals than from the best histories  another appendix to civil history let me mark in parochial and county history and that of particular towns and villages which like the former will always be defective many ingenious men have however labored very much in it of late  travels ought to have been noted as a small appendix to memoirs being indeed memoirs of a persons life for the time he was upon his journey the credulity and ignorance of ancient travelers are now fallen into deserved contempt and men travel who carry philosophy and taste and knowledge of hurnan nature along with them many excellent books of voyages and travels now grace the english tongue in particular the travels of brydone are even full of sublime description and would have been the first book of the kind had not the publisher forced him to make two volumes of what he had written in one hence his letter on comets is as contemptible as his letter on etna is admirable  lord bacon well marks perfect history as deficient in his own country in all its branches of what we call general history biography and history of a particular event he regrets in particular the want of a history of england and another of scotland the first is yet wanting for all histories yet written will mislead and not instruct any friend to the liberties of his country the rhapsody of mrs macaulay being no exception the latter is not much better for robertson is only a biographer on a larger scale  british biography is a province susceptible of much improvement tho we have the biographia britannica a work unhappily confined by its size to great libraries  we have no event related on the plan of salust tho the french have in the history of the spanish conspiracy at venice by the abbe de st real  mr gibbon has perhaps given birth to a new kind of history comprehending all lord bacons divisions of perfect history for the history of the decline and fall of the roman empire is the relation of a vast event extending to the form of a chronicle and comprizing biography as the life of a roman emperor is in fact the history of the roman world during his reign his two first volumes are well written tho not without small faults such as his seeming utterly to forget that there was such a writer as plutarch and such a prince as titus in the world and the chapters on christianity which not to say they are foreign to his work are vastly too long his four last volumes i speak of the octavo edition betray a jaded attention he is evidently fatigued with his subject and of consequence imagines the reader must be so to relieve him he gravely tells stories of miracles etc thinking to amuse but nonsense does not amuse the style is rather incorrect likewise in these four volumes which are evidently written for sale as the first two are for fame it is even sometimes puerile as where he speaks of an emperor being distinguished no less by the preeminence of his rank than by the preeminence of his fear of a barbaric invasion in the next page however is to be found the most sublime metaphor i have observed in any historian his conclusion is pitiably unfortunate and more worthy of an old woman who had been frighted into hysterics by reading a sixpenny history of the sack of rome by alaric than of a man of science he seems even to forget that america teems with more barbarians his bugbears than all the rest of the world put together let him revise his history and it will stand among the very first in the world above all things let him be less a geographer and more a chronologer geography and chronology have well been called the two eyes of history but he has extinguished the latter as hoping the other would shine more brightly  such are the faults that have occurred to me in that grand work which when completed in its utmost extent will with all its blemishes be a noble accession to the treasures of english literature nothing but my high regard for the work and its author could have induced me to so particular a discussion for none but works of the first order deserve to have their errors pointed out for those of others will not mislead  a most important accession has lately been made to the province of history by the philosophic spirit that is daily spreadiug to every corner of the world and every branch of science this has induced latter historians to blend the interesting history of society and manners with the dry detail of true facts and imaginary causes this is an improvement which even the prophetic genius of bacon could not forsee and shows that time is the greatest of philosophers  a book of apothemes and even an excellent collection of jests and strokes of wit are yet wanting in our language tho the latter would if executed by a man of taste and selection be as amusing as the former would be instructive plutarch has collected the apothemes of the ancients caesar had collected a book of jests as poggius has done since in latin dominichi in italian and melchior de santa cruz in spanish the amusements of julius caesar cannot be unworthy of a man of the first fame and talents and it lies with the collector and not with the subject that our jestbooks are confined to the stall  in the epistolary style we have howel a writer of wonderful merit and by no means so much esteemed as he ought to be and mr melmoth who in his letters of sir thomas fitzosborne has merit and has met with proportionable esteem in spite of his greek names which make the work look like a romance of queen elizabeths time i need not speak of lady m w montague whose letters are in my opinion much superior to those of the marchioness de sevigne tho both have the very first claim to public praise that any womans work can have that of not being written for public praise the letters of our professed authors published with their other works i need not mention but shall barely observe that those of mr gray leave the others far behind  of poetry i shall say nothing but that we still want in england a comic epic poem in the style of the morgante and the ricciardetto  the improvements and advances both of what lord bacon calls the physical and metaphysical parts of natural philosophy have since his time been amazing and mostly in consequence of the hints of this profound writer mr walpole in his admirable catalogue of royal and noble authors calls bacon the prophet of arts which newton was afterward sent to reveal yet bacon was not merely a vox clamantis in deserto as a wag said a preacher to empty benches was but actually made many experiments to ascertain his own philosophy to one of which he fell a martyr the system of des carts has risen and sallen since bacon that of newton has risen and keeps its ground galileo has improved astronomy and others have almost perfected it till a new planet concomitant of the earth has been within these very few years discovered why should i speak of the thermometer the barometer and a thousand such inventions or of electricity and electric fire a new power and new element if i may so call it tho it is in fact the element of fire before only known materially why should i mention all the minute inventions arising from experimental philosophy of which lord bacon is the father and to be found in the philosophic transactions and memoirs of innumerable foreign academies this you know is a letter not a treatise i shall content myself with observing that natural science and natural prudence tho separated by lord bacon have been since wedded and have produced a great number of very fine and healthy children  the inventory of the estate of man than which nothing could well be more curious and interesting is yet wanting to the world tho its plan does not seem of extremely difficult execution  brown has happily executed a calendar or catalogue of vulgar errors tho in a most pedantic style of latin english and which has to the great credit of our taste been revived in england after being dead a whole century  under the article of mathematics it might have been noted that the invention of logarrithms about five years after the publication of lord bacons book has greatly facilitated the solution of questions in this science navigation geometry etc have likewise received many improvements both minute and important tho it would extend this letter to too great a length to enumerate these improvements i hasten therefore to the most important part of lord bacons work and of human science which is  the knowledge that immediately relates to man himself considered as an individual and as a member of society  let me make one prefatory observation on this greatest branch of human knowledge which is that it has ever moved my highest wonder that while sir isaac newton and other men of the largest genius and most severe faculties have pointed the whole ardor of their minds to theories of worlds of gravitation colors and other baubles of no more consequence to man than a collection of butterflies this almost the only part of science that is of importance to human kind should remain desert and uncultivated surely nothing can be a more humiliating instance of human folly than that men and men of talents should neglect the only province of wisdom that immediately interests mankind and should seem to prefer a parcel of idle and airy speculations to the grandest part of human knowledge that which tends to make man wiser better and happier to improve society and government and institute a paradise upon earth  to descend to the smaller divisions of this only true knowledge some of which however are trifling in respect of others  the deficiencies of medicine need not be noted as it is all one defect  lockes treatise upon human understanding is a most acute work but tends not to increase the practical wisdom of man the nature progress and exertion of ideas are merely speculations and have a great chance of falsity for we confessedly know nothing of the nature of the mind which is their productor it is the proper application of ideas that man needs to be instructed in what is it to me from what rarifications of earth the gold of this guinea is formed the point is how am i to use it with propriety so as to benefit myself and others  the whole divisions of rational knowledge are still deficient and will be till some men of vast talents apply to them and not with a speculative but with a practical bent of mind  the appendices of rational knowledge being critical and pedantic science have received great improvements especially in england since the publication of the work on the advancement of learning yet deficiencies may still be noted a general collection of critical observations would be of much utility where a system were ridiculous elements of criticism form a good title but a woeful book full of false elements and false criticism blairs lectures on the belles lettres are no better he being the mere ape of the french critics and never venturing beyond his leadingstrings it is indeed the great fault of our critics that they so seldom think for themselves the two wartons are almost the only critics we have who have shown a genuine taste  pedantic knowledge has however made slower advances than criticism tho it is of infinitely more consequence when will man acquire wisdom enough to leave the pursuit of big trifles for that of small things that most import him  the system of education is still foolish rousseau has pointed out some improvements but a defect almost inseparable from great views is that they are always wasted in speculation hence few of his remarks can be of any practical use  one of the most glaring defects in the present state of pedantic science is the great time wasted in acquiring dead languages which in nine cases out of ten are of no use to the child but in fact are quite neglected and forgotten by him in a few months after he has left school perfection of folly to waste the most precious years of human life in acquiring useless languages and languages that are to be forgotten o caecas hominum mentes where a boy is intended for any of the learned professions or is heir of an easy fortune the study of languages is proper but in this order one year for the english one year for the greek one year for three other tongues the latin italian and french but while studying these languages they should be considered as amusements and relaxations as learning the french is now while the art of being a man should be considered as the business of a boys education domestic and social wisdom virtue and hanpiness all the honest arts of making life delightful respectable and important to society these ought to form the essence and great object of education it is a trite observation that girls arrive sooner at womanly manners and knowledge than boys do at the manners and knowledge proper for their sex this is ascribed to nature having assigned a previous maturity to females the fact is it is the consequence of the different modes of education a girl is doing the honors of the table and winning every body by her polished conversation while a boy is blubbering over an useless book his being a man all his life is of no consequence provided he is a scholar for a few years  prejudice prejudice when will the happy period arrive that humankind shall break thy detestable shackles only strong from the weakness of the wearers when will the awful voice of nature sound to the human mind be free  in moral philosophy and social science these greatest divisions of this grand part of knowledge few or no advances have been made the lesser morals have perhaps been improved by the spectator and other works of the kind being universally read and the importance even of the least points of morality is so great that i believe every man of a sound and benevolent mind will agree that there is more real glory in having written two pages that have actually taught mankind how to be virtuous and happy than in composing whole systems of speculation more illustrious fame arising from one of mr addisons papers in the spectator than from the whole works of sir isaac newton even tho he had demonstrated an acute and stupendous theory of deity itself  civil knowledge or that of government and laws has certainly admitted no small improvements since lord bacons age not only books of merit have been written upon these points but what is of far higher moment the practical operation of government and laws has in most kingdoms been rendered more beneficial it is amazing indeed to consider how widely philosophy has spread the light of liberty and happiness over great part of the world within a short period of time the reduction of the papal power in many of the kingdoms where it was most predominant is in particular a grand epoch of the triumph of science over folly and fanaticism what may we not hope when such is the beginning of the reign of philosophy a perpetual peace among all the powers of europe in which every useful and elegant art shall be carried to a perfection unknown even to the dreams of visionaries might almost no longer be regarded as an idle imagination  with regard to theoretical knowledge of laws and government the work of montesquieu deserves mention tho its brief and apparently deep and dictatorial style has acquired it infinitely more fame than it deserves the treatises of millar and ferguson on civil society have merit tho by no means of the first kind the last author in particular being the dryest whom i ever remember to have read insomuch that the most interesting subjects lose all interest in his frigid pages  can i pass the subject of government and laws without expressing an ardent with for a reform of those of our yet happy country for tho her sun be set as statesmen tell us yet it is a very fine evening and promises a future bright day that a code of english law should never yet be thought of by the legislature is one of the strangest instances of the melancholy truth that human affairs are governed by chance and not by wisdom but god forbid that it should be attempted during this tory reign in which we behold judges carrying politics into the bench of impartial justice as violently as in the reign of james ii in spite of the infamy of jeffries which awaits them indeed it may safely be said that the laws of this country are either a disgrace to the constitution or the constitution to the laws for it is a certain fact however paradoxical it may seem that they are often in direct opposition to each other to instance in one point it is a maxim in the law as tories tell us that the king can do no wrong by the constitution of this country according to two precedents the king can not only do wrong but be put to death as charles i or banished as james ii according to the offense but i forget that i am talking of our liberties after they are actually lost from this very cause of the laws being destructive of the constitution for cases of libel or of treason are the most delicate and chief objects between prince and subject and thanks to our jacobite judges an information is lodged ex officio by the attorney general a special jury is packed by the judge and must obey his commands if they fail in any point they are browbeaten and taught to know better and thus every subject who steps forth to defend the rights of his brethren is the slave of the slave of the king thus it is in the power of any prince who shall even want common faculties to overturn our constitution and enslave us by our own laws montesquieu has observed that no state can be free in which the laws of treason are not most accurately defined in every point because upon them the very existence of liberty depends now in our happy and glorious constitution the laws of treason are quite inaccurate indeed whoever will examine our constitution and laws together will pronounce both to be very imperfect and if we are not slaves the cause is in our breasts and hands not in our constitution nor our laws before our constitution can be called perfect the king must by law resign one half of his present power and patronage which he may do without the slightest danger of an aristocracy rising on his ruins that this was not done on the accession of william iii or of george i to the throne is an eternal disgrace to the judgment of our national councils in the later event especially if the very title of king was given nothing was too great to ask or rather to keep  supposing the laws rendered perfect who can afford to pay for them sweet laws that cannot be administered without ruining the oppressed it is to he hoped that in the course of a century or two we shall have wisdom enough to reduce the fees of courts and lawyers to one tenth of what they are now and when reformation once begins it precipitates so that whenever that event takes place we may venture to prophesy that in the course of a year thereafter these fees will be reduced to onethirtieth part of the present which would yet be too high  let me add that police in particular a word unknown to the english language and to the english laws is woefully deficient in this enormous metropolis why is not the price of meat for instance regulated as that of bread our wise senators are so much occupted with gamelaws that they cannot bestow the most trifling attention on the lives and properties of their constituents when god knows it matters not the tossing up of a straw if there were not a bird of game in the three kingdoms or beast of game except the hunters the criminal laws of britain are much too murderous and seem utterly to forget that there are punishments more dreadful than death even to the meanest mind  such are my hasty thoughts on this grand subject of the progress of knowledge sensible of their defects i even submit them with anxiety to the judgment of your affectionate friendship  p s you will perhaps think a former assertion of this letter extravagant namely that the study of burnets history is connected with the welfare of our state but it only means that the true and old whig principles are essential to that welfare and that if these prevail burnet will be read with admiration as for the new whig principles they have done as much harm to the constitution as toryism an old whig wishes a reduction of prerogative a new whig wishes to extend it if it will serve his faction    letter xli you rightly observe that the fewness of original writers is greatly owing to the unjust esteem in which imitation is held imitation is in fact only a decent and allowed plagiarism when it appears in a certain degree it is pronounced literary theft and justly held infamous in other degrees and in certain forms and dresses it is called honorable but in fact it only differs in the degree of disirepute  imitation i define such evident copying from a former author in whatever language as evinces that the imitator meaned to appropriate the merit of the thoughts language or other perfections of his model to himself if such imitation can have any claim to praise it must arise from the originality of the copy if i may use an expression that sounds a little boeotian when the copy is inferior to the original neglect is certainly its proper reward if superior it merits no praise for facile est inventis addere it is an casy matter to improve on the inventions of others  our idea of imitation must not however be extended too far else we shall pronounce every author who writes a poem in twentyfour books an imitator of homer it is only imitation of general design in its distinct divisions of episodes etc imitation of incidents of characters of sentiments images style manner that is properly imitation for instance  milton writes an epic poem as homer has done for i call miltons paradise lost an epic poem in every sense of the word critics who scruple this appellation seem to forget that epic only means narrative and may with great justice be applied to a tale of fontaine tho generally ascribed to narrative poems of the highest order by way of excellence i say milton writes an epic poem as homer has done but wherein does he imitate homer in not one point the general plan of his poem his incidents etc are totally different from those of homer or any other writer milton is therefore an original poet  virgil writes an epic poem likewise as homer has done wherein does he imitate homer in every thing he has nothing of his own all is stolen stolen without acknowlegement it follows that he is an infamous plagiary  yet the world has not dared so to arraign him the enormity of his crime precluded due punishment you know what the pirate said to some great conqueror that the victor because he slaughtered whole nations and plundered whole empires was called a hero whereas he who only killed a few persons and rifled a paltry treasure was called a thief so it has fared with virgil  mr gibbon somewhere expresses a surprise that no greek writer whatever tho many are posterior to virgil ever thought him worth mention the cause is evident the greeks looked upon him as a paltry translator and what is worst of all an epitomizing translator of their own immortal poet had a greek mentioned him it must have been with utter scorn as we would mention any writer who should publish in french the paradise lost and the paradise regained frittered down into a foppish production in six books and desire the world to look upon it as an epic poem  i have said that an imitation may be original and that in this point only the very minute merit of imitation consists mr popes imitations of horace are original and happy boileaus poor copies which he has had the impudence to call satires are constrained and feeble he has gone behind the ancients like a menial not like a king with his attendants before him  all kinds of imitation and all imitations whatever sink into that class of poetry which we read to ladies at a teatable and then give to the servant that he may not burn his hands in carrying off the teaurn no man of real genius can be an imitator supposing that he made the attempt originality is coessential with genius as milton tells us that light is coeternal with the deity  yet with us there is likewise a god of theft as lucian phrases it   and we seem to venerate lucian in cum qui dixit prometheus es in verbis imitations as much as originals goods got by theft as much as those honestly acquired nay we bestow upon the thief of sublime inventions the deification only due to the first inventor  we all know that painters of little or no merit have yet made such perfect copies of the works of the greatest masters that even in some cases these masters themselves could not distinguish them from their own productions yet the copiers acquired no reputation from those imitations why should it be otherewise in poetry imitations of the very verbage and manner of chaucer spenser milton we see daily performed by writers of slender talents and such imitations i will venture to pronounce the easiest of literary labors and in no respect more entitled to praise than copies of paintings  speaking of imitation in painting i cannot help adding a remark on the complete folly of instituting academies of painting or any other art or science that is schools of imitation did ever any one good painter arise from an academy never not even one of the slightest reputation the moment the french academy was instituted painting ceased in that country no more claudes or poussins arose it was reserved for the ideotic counsels of this gothic reign to crush all hopes of the progress of painting at once by founding an academy in our academy as in others all imitate none invent the art is of course at a stand soon to fall if other means do not foster it  i know of no service which our royal academy does but to spoil many good tailors by converting them into artists as they call themselves it is to be hoped some future prince will just have sense enough to dissolve this lump of regal solly and to say to art and science be free we already see its effects in the odd productions of its members in the hall of the society for the encouragement of arts manusactures and commerce john street adelphi is now exposed to public view such a series of daubings by a royal academician nay professor of painting to the royal academy as would both for design and execution have disgraced lapland in the twelfth century had they appeared on sign posts they would only have arraigned the taste of the innholders but as the painter is so impudent as to hold them out as a national work the most public contempt and censure is due to them what must foreigners think of us upon reading the puffs and seeing the productions posterity posterity indeed we are not quite so barbarous as thou will take us to be should these academical exercises reach thy notice this artist i am informed has written a treatise on painting in which he is always quoting many classics god help us a man must bring a classic sense to the classics else their high ideas will confound and not enlighten  to young writers especially imitation cannot be held out in too just in too contemptible a light they ought even to be told that there is more applause due to a bad original than to the best of copies by these means they will at leass endeavor to be original and this they cannot accomplish without trying to think for themselves and to dig diamonds from the mines of invention by their own labor a point of the utmost consequence to every kind of science for were the clouds which imitation and prejudice raise in the mind dispersed knowledge of every denomination would diffuse its benignant light with redoubled rapidity  to very young writers i allow imitation is proper as a task but it ought only to be regarded as such and abandoned with other academical occupations even this can only be permitted from the consideration that many minds are like wildings and will neither bear flowers nor fruit till they are grafted  postscript  since my letter on improving the language it has occurred to me from the hints of some very learned and ingenious men who much approve of the other ideas that the final th however soft to an english ear cannot be pronounced by foreigners at all and is therefore by no means laudable the final h had better be always omitted except in interjections as ah oh and its the word breath where it is very expressive substantives in th should take the e omitting the h as trute faite etc in verbs etc both the t and h ought commonly to be cut off or else altered according to the genius of the language by giving plurals in a and a few substitutions of z perhaps a sufficient number of the letter s will be thrown out and the present tense of verbs may very well retain that letter certain it is that were we to give the th and the still worse eth  begineth etc the language would only be rendered more barbarous and horrible nothing being so feeble and uncouth as that termination eth the h is extremely frequent in our tongue and ought to be omitted whenever it can even the final sh had far better be altered  i forgot to mention that the plural in a is perfectly anglosaxon and homogeneous to our language there being two declensions in a out of the six declensions of substantives in the anglosaxon grammar drawn from hickes the instances are iln ancilla ilna ancillae and sunu filius suna filii so that you see both male and female substantives admitted of it originally and the neuter may certainly take it with at least equal propriety    letter xlii i grant you that mr grays censure of david hume is the most exceptionable part of his letters but it is very vindicable being written in confidence to a friend and with no intention that the public should see it his trite application of the remark that muddy rivers seem deep shows that it was written in an unlucky moment when thought is absent and perhaps in the fluster of evening wine which last is indeed the only apology that can be made for the remainder of the stricture no writer can be more clear and manly than hume i mean as to his sense nay what is wonderful his style is always easily intelligible tho full of solecisms and every species of barbarity his gaiety is always that of an innocent and truly wise man his history of england nay his essays display talents very far superior to any that gray has ever shown mr hume might have ruled a state grays utmost views would only have ruled a college humes reputation in france was only the echo of his fame in england mr gray showed himself less than a child when he called hume one such mad calumnies recoil upon their authors judgment and crush it to nothing yet all this censure lights upon the editor for gray would have called upon mountains to cover his shame if he had seen his name publicly branded with throwing dirt from billingsgate upon a cotemporary lord of fame because his envy saw that he was richer dressed and of far higher rank than himself  the history of mr hume is indeed very far from being laudable it is a mere apology for prerogative from beginning to end and tho the best apology which has been offered is yet very weak which shows the cause must be desperate when even so great an advocate utterly fails in its defense at the same time that his political principles led him to exalt the prerogative his philosophic opinions forced him to depress the church while every body knows that no church no king hence his work is one chaos of heterogeneous axioms and misrepresented events his opinions even combated his natural sensibility for i remember that in narrating some of the most flagitious acts of cruelty of the blessed reign of charles i or ii he displays due sense of the atrocity of such calm deeds of tyranny as make the frenzies of nero or domitian mere jests but when he has got through them and his opinion begins to resume cooler operation he gravely begins his next paragraph thus these acts of severity if they can be called such  what was the reason do you think that could induce a writer of such talents to prostitute them so basely that could induce such a philosopher to suppose that millions of human beings were to hold their life and happiness at the nod of one of them of a thing called a king perhaps in corporeal and in mental powers less than the least of his subjects  this is easily accounted for hume was poor and wished to be rich the king is the surest fountain of wealth and to flatter him is the path to preferment and to opulence hence public spirit is almost unknown in monarchies for one man centers in himself the wealth and praise of his subjects hume tells us himself chap lx      though the established government was but the mere shadow of a commonwealth yet was it beginning by proper arts to encourage that public spirit which no other species of civil polity is ever able fully to inspire hear him hear him then your history mr hume wishes to extinguish public spirit that is to destroy the most laudable principle of society  i know not how it is that the whole late scottish writers of any eminence have been on the tyrannic side if we except dr stuart a man of real abilities but strangely misapplied in pulling down those of others yet presbytery the religion of that country has always been considered as necessarily connected with whig principles and the common people of scotland are almost universally whigs the peers are however almost all tories owing to the feudal spirit of tyranny and slavery not being wholly extinguished in that kingdom till      when heretable jurisdictions were abolished the court can only judge of scotland by the nobility the fathers of whom having been tyrants to slaves the sons are willing to be slaves to tyrants for such is the spirit of the feudal system a later emancipation from which has thrown scotland a whole century behind england in point of civil liberty now the writers in general naturally adapt their principles to those of their superiors and the court unto whom they look for their reward  hence in our times junius wilkes churchill and other men of talents have judged of that ancient and warlike kingdom very unjustly a scot is with them synonymous with a tory a slave nothing can be more opposite to the spirit of the nation however it may apply to the noble scum on the top or the dregs of mercenary writers at the bottom but the nation is full of generous liquor and has nothing to do either with its scum or its dregs which are always worst when the liquor is best indeed churchills works have passed through more editions and are more read in scotland than here which shows that the love of that country for liberty is superior even to the most inveterate national prejudices  by a necessary chain scottish tories and jacobites are now court favorites they taste the sweets of this saturnian reign epistle to sir w chambers while the real nation and its real interests are neglected and despised it is certainly fortunate that scotland has not been free above forty years as to that circumstance we are indebted for its happy quiet at a time when every province of the british empire evinces in commotion or in rebellion the odious and most deplorable but natural and unavoidable effects of those tory principles of government which have prevailed through this pitiful and miserable reign and have made it one blot in the british annals  it is no less wonderful than true that ever since the name of whig has been known the nation has been indebted for all its glorious events to men of that description and for its miseries to the tories indeed my friend if any one will show me that a tory ministry ever did the least good to this country or even did not do it great injury i shall turn tory instantly but if from the reign of james i to this hour tory ministers have by every measure brought calamity and disgrace on their country then must every briton view such principles as the seeds of death in our constitution and on those who profess them and foster them in the chief magistrate as deserving of the execration of every good man and in fact of the highest punishment which the laws of society can ordain for those who meditate the utter perdition of the community  a king of great britain who knows that by the present constitution he is only elective chief magistrate of the country and will comply with his station it is a glorious one has it in his power to appropriate to himself all the fame rising from the public spirit of the greatest of modern nations but if he wishes to extend his prerogative that is to extinguish that public spirit he is a suicide and the jury of posterity will bring it in lunacy for he is the enemy of his own power not to say of his own existence the power of an english king being directly opposite to his prerogative for his power is drawn only from the confidence of the nation which his prerogative will infallibly destroy if displayed and not kept as a sword in the scabbard never to be drawn by a brave man but upon most urgent occasion if he makes himself little he will be great indeed but if he bites the curb which our fathers have put in his mouth it is of steel and he will only spoil his teeth if he wishes to be an ox he will feel himself only the frog in the fable  you will know that i mean still less to defend the philosophic tenets of david hume tho he be a great and elegant writer of philosophy but i detest the principles of any man who writes popularly against the religion of his country let it be what it will if it does not injure political freedom the first of human blessings i say popularly because if treated in an high and abstract or in a poetical style as lucretius has done it will not injure the vulgar faith but only afford speculation to the learned religion is the only bond of society for the mob and they ought not even to suspect that their superiors despise it as they will in that case from their ignorance of moral theory imagine that their superiors have no laws and consequently that they ought to have none philosophy will never do for the vulgar they must be bound in the chains of prejudice and so led through the road of life and not trusted to themselves after proper information  besides my friend the consolations of human life are by no means too numerous religion is one of the chief of these consolations to thousands of people and among these to many possessed of qualities superior to genius knowledge or philosophy qualities that constitute the good the first order of society shall i with rash and sacrilegious hand burst open the temple of their happiness and steal away the palladium of their peace forbid it humanity forbid it even philosophy the philosophy that is not benevolent is false and destructive it is impossible for man to know the truth but it is of no importance whether his felicity be founded on truth or on delusion  letter xliii i know not how an opinion has been propagated among several relaters of the life of torquato tasso which has no foundation in fact it is that tassos madness originated from his presumptuous and disappointed love for leonora da este sister of duke alfonso of ferrara the fact is his madness arose from the various troubles of a dependant and perplexed life operating with unceasing violence upon a melancholy temperament and a morbid tenderness of feeling but before we trace it let us discuss this same tale of leonora the materials for this discussion shall be drawn from the only authentic life of tasso that written by his friend giovanni battista manso lord of bisaccio and pianca this long and curious narrative is so extremely rare that it is no wonder latter biographers only speak of it from report the edition used is that of venice        mo     pages  manso tells that there were three ladies of the name of leonora at ferrara all of whom are celebrated by his friend in different sonnets etc and that it is impossible to say which of them stood highest in his affections or even if any of them was mistress of his heart these were the princess leonora abovementioned leonora countess of san vitale and leonora one of the maids of honor to the princess manso seems to incline to think the latter was the lady really beloved by tasso which indeed is so probable that one may safely pronounce it the truth  the beginning of tassos madness is dated by manso about the thirtysecond year of his age two years after publishing the immortal gerusalemme when he was tyrannically confined by order of duke alfonso on pretense that he wished no whim of tasso should deprive his court of so great a character the violent opposition to his great poem and the contempt which the invidious tried to throw upon it are put by his biographer as one great cause of his alienation of mind the increase of it he marks as owing to these causes   the falsehood of a friend who published what was confided to him as an inviolable secret the amori of tasso   the base suspicions raised against him by his enemies   his several confinements   the loss of the duke his patrons favor   let me add as the strongest cause of all his being so heated at the bad reception of the gerusalemme a reception in all ages given to works surpassing common expectation as to rewrite that poem under the title of la gerusalemme conquistata nay to compose many books of a third alteration to be like a medium between the two former such long compositions written with heat and rancour must certainly have impaired the most exuberant brain and carried off the whole spirits of the mind till lees alone were left  it may not be incurious to examine the nature of a shock that could lay so vast a soul in ruins the enquiry will resemble that of the philosopher who visits a delicious country desolated by an earthquake calabria the native realm of tasso now presents too lively an image of his situation in his latter days all that is grand all that is beautiful mingled in horrible confusion  the qualities of tassos disease are described by manso to have been these   melancholy this seems to have been inherited from his father there is a pleasing melancholy which is always the concomitant of genius and which whoever has not felt he need not woo the muse he is her scorn but tassos melancholy was a torment to him i must always be an object of your compassion says he in a letter to mauritio cataneo because the melancholy which torments me is infinite and the worst i could say of it would exceed all belief and yet would not be so bad as the truth   delirium owing to hypocondriac causes which increased to   madness accompanied with a belief of his being   under the influence of witchcraft and   attended by an apparition such are mansos divisions which cannot be called very proper on the two last he gives us some curious details which may be worth taking brief notice of tasso speaks thus of his enchantment and supposed spiritual attendant folletto in a letter to mauritio cataneo you must know that i was bewitched and have never been cured and perhaps have more need of an exorcist than of a physician because my disease proceeds from magical art i would likewise write a few words respecting my demon the rascal has lately robbed me of many crown pieces i know not the amount as i am by no means a miser in reckoning my money but i dare say they amount to twenty he has likewise turned all my books topsyturvy opened my chests robbed me of my keys which i could not keep from him i am at all times unhappy but especially in the night i know not whether my disease proceeds from frenzy or not this was written when he was confined at st anns and after his deliverance from confinement he still writes thus to the same cataneo this day the last of the year the brother of the reverend signior licino has brought me two of your letters but one of them was taken from me as soon as i had read it and i believe the folletto must have carried it off because it is that in which he is mentioned and this is one of the miracles which i have seen often in the hospital st anns at ferrara where the duke sent him and appointed skilful physicians to attend him these things i am certain are done by some magician and i have many arguments of it particularly of a loaf visibly stolen from me one afternoon and a plate of fruit taken from before me the other day when a polish gentleman gentil giovane polacco came to see me worthy indeed to be witness of such a wonder etc  manso afterward tells us that tasso would frequently in company be quite abstracted in his frenzy would talk to himself and laugh profusely and would fix his eyes keenly upon vacancy for a long time and then say that he saw his familiar spirit and describe him as under the semblance of an angelic youth such as he paints him in his dialogue of le messagiero manso particularly mentions that once tasso angry at his incredulity told him that he should see the spirit with his own eyes accordingly next day when they were talking together and sitting by the fire tasso suddenly darted his eyes to a window in the room and sat so intent that when manso spoke to him he returned no sort of answer at last he turned to him and said behold the friendly spirit who is courteously come to converse with me look at him and perceive the truth of my words manso immediately threw his eyes toward the spot but with his keenest vision could see nothing but the rays of the sun shining through the window into the chamber while he was thus staring tasso had entered into lofty discourse with the spirit as he perceived from his share of the dialogue that of the spirit was not audible to him but he solemnly declares that the discourse was so grand and mavelous and contained such lofty things expressed in a most unusual mode that he remained in extacy and did not dare to open his mouth so much as to tell tasso that the spirit was not visible to him in some time the spirit being gone as manso could judge tasso turned to him with a smile and said he hoped he was now convinced to which manso replied that he had indeed heard wonderful things but had seen nothing tasso said perhaps you have heard and seen more than  he then paused and manso seeing him in silent meditation did not care to perplex him with further questions  the high things which manso heard doubtless originated from tassos warm attachment to the platonic philosophy that sublime tissue of dreams and visions i would remark upon the whole subject of this letter that it is a woeful proof of the weakness of the most exalted mind when it lays the rein upon the neck of imagination a man of genius cannot take too much care to prevent his supernatural fancy from assuming any power over common life the effect of imagination upon the mind is like that of lime upon a fruittree a little buried at the root will make it healthy and flourishing but too much will totally destroy it  before i conclude it may be proper to observe that the genuine life of tasso by manso was to the best of my knowledge never published this now quoted which is generally called mansos life of tasso is in fact only transcribed from his as we may judge from the title which is vita di torquato tasso scritta da gio battista manso etc al sereniss sig duca d urb etc the dedication is signed by the publisher evangelisto deuchino and i know not if he be not the author the work is however equally valuable as if it had been written by manso the author calling him his intimate friend and being entrusted by him with tassos ms correspondence i suppose mansos life was brief it seems in this work to be transcribed with great additions  letter xliv on different late occasions the subject of literary forgery has been mentioned without any enquiry ever being made into its propriety or impropriety some wise writers have pronounced it ridiculously enough to partake of the crime of penal forgery and have said that he who will publish a new production as ancient would forge an obligation others with great justice assert that nothing can be more innocent that the fiction of ascribing a piece to antiquity which in fact does not belong to it can in no sort be more improper than the fiction of a poem or novel that in both the delight of the reader is the only intention  indeed those innocents who call such forgery criminal forget that they are blaspheming their savior and their religion for the whole parables of jesus christ which are narrated with circumstances that most strongly imply them to be true yet are allowed fictitious fall under this head nor is there more falsehood in marivauxs telling us that one of his novels was found in pulling down an old partition in mr walpoles account of his castle of otranto being a translation from an italian romance in macphersons ossian if you will than in any of the sacred fables wherein strict truth is sacrificed to the pleasure of the hearer  perhaps in fact nothing can be more heroic and generous in literary affairs than a writers ascribing to antiquity his own production and thus sacrificing his own fame to give higher satisfaction to the public it certainly partakes of that nobility of soul which is content with its own suffrage and ranks the author among those who do good by stealth and blush to find it fame people of shallow understandings are always the most suspicious of being made dupes and are the most clamorous when they find they are so those of deeper minds are not deceived by the fiction as to their judgment yet their fancy admits the deceit and receives higher pleasure from it than it possibly could were no deceit used  magnanima menzogna or quando e il vero si bello che si possa a te preporre there are however certain kinds and even certain modes of literary forgery that may justly be held improper for that is the highest reproach that can be applied to the worst kinds of them none being in the least injurious to society of the improper kind is forgery of histories as those of berosus and manetho by annius of viterbo or works of instruction as the book of dominico flocci de magistratibus romany ascribed to fenestella and in short of all the sorts of writing in which truth is the object poetry and romance are sacred to fiction and it can never be pushed too far pictoribus atque poetis quidlibet audendi semper fuit aequa potestas yet with one exception as to the mode for instance had muret when he forged the verses ascribed to afranius so exquisitely sent them to joseph scaliger not in common writing but transcribed on vellum and fumigated with art so as to appear part of an ancient manuscript i doubt of its propriety tho it would have been even in that case an imposition only worthy of laughter to men of sense but to weak minds every thing is a crime  i shall close my letter with an applicable quotation from mr addison upon this subject to be found in no     of the spectator some observes he say an author is guilty of falsehood when he talks to the public of manuscripts which he never saw or describes scenes of action or discourse in which he was never engaged but these gentlemen would do well to consider there is not a fable or parable which ever was made use of that is not liable to this exception since nothing according to this notion can be related innocently which was not once matter of fact  letter xlv it would doubtless be going too far to say that the romans had no original writers and if you look into my former letters you will find that i made no such assertion  yet their original authors are very few and if you please this letter shall briefly recapitulate their eminent writers and distinguish those that may justly receive the high distinction of original an order nearly chronological shall be followed and they only mentioned whose works have reached us  plautus a poet too much neglected his works having infinitely more merit than those of terence is however not original except perhaps in one or two plays  terence need not be mentioned his plays being mere translations had only one of those been preserved his fame would have stood six degrees higher according to the number of his dramas the perfect similarity of which evinces that he was possessed of not one speck of genius even as a translator  lucretius was not altogether original there being greek philosophic poems of the same kind by empedocles and others which are lost but as we know not that he took any thing from them as his episodes in particular and his whole poem in general breathe a bold spirit of apparent originality put him down in the middle rank between originals and imitators  cicero nor caesar cannot be called original in any view  sallust is an evident imitator of thucydides and livy of herodotus yet they are both superior to their originals still they are imitators  virgil is the most pitiful imitator of the whole roman writers as was shown on a former occasion  catullus appears to me not original the hendecasyllabi his favorite vehicle being grecian two or three of his pieces are known to be translations without acknowlegement a strong proof against the rest  tibullus appears to have the first claim to originality of perhaps all the roman writers callimachus and philetas wrote elegies but they were not amatory nor plaintive athenaeus tells us that callimachus wrote an elegy on a victory and i learn from no ancient that any one of them was on the subject of love his hymns which have reached us say little for his talents the elegies of philetas are sometimes quoted by obscure ancient writers but from these quotations we judge that their subjects were remote from those of tibullus upon the whole i set down this exquisite poet as original  propertius is not because tibullus wrote before him he is very inferior to tibullus in every respect and is in fact a mere pedant in love i must remark on the beginning of the first elegy of his third book callimachi manes et coi sacra philetae in vestrum quaeso me sinite ire nemus primus ego ingredior puro de font sacerdos itala per graios orgia far choros that the reference to callimachus and philetas only points at the elegiac stanza used by them not at the subject and that we need not wonder at the boast in the last couplet when we reflect that virgil has the impudence to say the same tho twenty latin poets had stolen from the greeks before he was born  i doubt much if horace be original in any of his odes but they are his worst work for he is certainly a very middling lyric poet we must estimate him by his chief works his satires and his epistles and in them especially in the last heavens what an original what an exquisite writer in the satires he is happy in the epistles superlatively so tha to the pisos when properly understood which we of this age are now happily enabled to do from mr colmans most ingenious and acut translation and commentary is full of as much good sense and lucid order as the epistolar plan can require by the way let me add from mr colmans just idea of this epistle that the magisterial rule of not making a drama shorter or longer than five acts seems to be addressed to him of the younger pisos who had written a play and who had probably extended it beyond that number as sophocles has sometimes done horace as an argument to persuade him to suppress his piece which is the intention of his epistle fixes it as an absolute rule tho indeed from no authority that no drama should exceed or fall short of five acts this rule would he say you have not complied with therefore your piece is unfit for public view  to return from his grand works of the satires and epistles put horace as an original writer  ovid was doubtless original in his metamorphoses and fasti but his originality is futile and of no value  celsus has high merit in every view and may i believe be even entitled to the praise of originality upon the whole a classic edition of him is much wanted the late dr brisbane of middlesex hospital author of the anatomy of painting had made large ms collections with this view which i happened to purchase of a bookseller and if you know any man of learning who would use them with their authors intention they should be at his service  to phaedrus the merit of being original cannot be denied as a fabulist he is preferable to every writer not excepting fontaine himself terse polite facetious most elegantly brief he does honor even to the age of augustus his language in simple beauty exceeds that of terence and the language of terence is his sole merit that of phaedrus is not his merit but his dress the best fables are i   iii     iv      the   th of book iv is a disgrace to his work as well as some others ubi plura nitent etc where is the human work that is perfect  juvenal and persius have each an original style in their satires their thoughts are also original it would be mere cavil then to deny their praise of originality the first is a writer of amazing moral sublimity his satires i suspect are superior to those of horace if sublimity be a quality of writing superior to grace as for my own part i have no doubt but it is the obscurity of persius throws him quite out of the rank of good writers  lucan is original but it is the originality of ovid an originality of no price his grand and stoic diction deserves however much praise and even considered as a poet i agree with heinsius and corneille that he is infinitely superior to virgil  the natural history of pliny is an original of vast design and masterly execution  quintilian is the only sensible critic of antiquity the only one who knew method or distinction but he cannot be called original  statius martial valerius flaccus silius italicus have no claim to originality  to tacitus let us bend the knee as the greatest of the original roman writers as the first historian who wrote with philosophy for his guide as one whose judgment and talents were infinite and shall never be rivalled i am not unaware that milton in his familiar letters calls salust the very first of all historians and tacitus his imitator tho i revere milton i revere the truth more and think that salust imitates thucydides and tacitus imitates none salust deals merely in general reflections tacitus in deep and political knowledge  boethius the last roman writer has a fair claim to originality and that not of the meanest kind  such is the list of the more eminent latin writers among them we have found only eight original namely tibullus horace celsus phaedrus juvenal pliny the elder tacitus boethius and i suppose if weighed in the scales of critical justice their various powers of genius would rank them in this order  i tacitus as a profound historian none having arisen before or since his genius must necessarily be of wonderful rarity and value ii tibullus as the first writer of elegy in the world iii juvenal a satyric writer of the sublime or first class as satire is an inferior province of poetry to elegy he stands after tibullus but as the sublime is superior to the elegant he precedes iv horace v pliny the elder vi celsus vii phaedrus viii boethius letter xlvi the distinction between learning and reading is very just a man may read all the books ever sent into the world were it possible and yet have no title to the appellation of learned a man of true learning by the digestion of a strong mind converts all literary food into wholesome nourishment whereas when the receptacle is disordered or feeble the more it is crammed the worse such is miltons idea but knowledge is as food and needs no less her temperance over appetite to know in measure what the mind may well contain oppresses else with surfeit and soons turns wisdom to folly as nourishment to wind for a long time after the revival of learning it was confounded with reading an author could not call snow white without a long quotation from aristotle in the margin this plan having fallen into just contempt we have now adopted the other extreme voltaire an ape who looks big by getting upon the shoulders of giants after dirtying them all over in getting up writes history without ever quoting his authorities and tells us anecdotes as ancient which are not to be found in any ancient author in print yet he quotes no ms shall we believe him no they are the offspring of his own brain even for apparent facts he produces no authority yet history cannot be too well authenticated as he made his poetry history so he has made his history poetry he is an historical poet and a poetical historian this is an instance that there are works in which it is absolutely necessary to show ones learning by quotations and not by the essence of the discourse  for a mans writing on learned subjects with no display of erudition we can only account by pronouncing him ignorant the more a man has read upon any subject he will doubtless write the better supposing him a man of any capacity is not a rich man better qualified to furnish a banquet that will delight every palate than one whose poverty frustrates his intention  none i confess are so fond of showing their learning as those who have little of it parson adams you remember when showing his half guinea all he had says he does it not from ostentation of riches have you never heard a man quote horace in company and then with many apologies for being a man of learning translate the passage in such a manner as to evince that he had not even the rudiments of erudition swift has well observed that what a man wants in sense is supplied in vanity the observation is equally just when applied to learning for sound learning may be defined to be an appropriation of the sense of others  suetonius in his books de illustribus grammaticis tells us that cornelius nepos to whom the work of victor de viris illustribus read in schools in spite of its bad latin is ascribed wrote a treatise de discrimine literati et eruditi and one poiret has written a book de eruditione solida et falsa i have not read it but the title is a good one solid science i think may be defined that which is useful to man either individually or socially this definition includes elegant learning for what pleases a man is highly useful to him the dispute whether poetry for instance is meant to be useful or pleasing is idle what is pleasing is useful poetry is only useful by amusing the time is past when it preserved laws and gave social manners to savage nations the harp of orpheus sounds no more this unexpected metaphor brings to my mind a droll anecdote told by lucian in his treatise against an ignorant man who bought a number of books which i shall beg leave to lay before you as a lively picture of the futility of any science when canvassed by inadequate powers of mind  when the thracian bacchanals tore orpheus to pieces they say that his harp was thrown into the river hebrus with his bleeding head upon it while the head sung a lamentable elegy on the fate of its late proprietor the harp touched by the wind accompanied it with a solemn strain till swimming down the egean sea the mournful concert arrived at lesbos the lesbians taking them up buried the head in the spot where in lucians time stood the temple of bacchus and hung up the lyre in the temple of apollo neanthus the son of pittacus the tyrant who had heard the wonderful qualities of this harp that it tamed wild beasts and moved even trees and rocks and that since the time of orpheus it had never been touched had a violent desire to try its effects with this view he bribed the priest who had it in keeping to give it to him and hang up one quite similar in its place neanthus wifely thought it was not proper to use it by day nor in the city lest he should bring the houses about his ears but hiding it under his robe went by night to try it in the environs being quite ignorant of music he began scraping upon it at a strange rate but with no small pride and satisfaction as deeming himself the worthy heir of the music of orpheus the town dogs who i suppose were all turned loose into the streets at night as is now the custom in turkey came to the sound in crowds neanthus in transport imagined now the beasts had come the other effects would follow and looked sharp around to see if a rock and a tree were coming toward him dancing a minuet poor man he was woefully deceived the dogs had only come thinking the strange noise proceeded from a wolf or a wild hog and enraged by the horrid din tore its unfortunate author to pieces  to return for i am wandering like montaigne tho with a juster title to wander there is no doubt but elegant literature forms a great branch of true learning being in fact nearly as useful to man as the most solid parts of it for poetry may be regarded as of almost equal utility with philosophy the one amuses life and diverts care by that sweet pliability of mans spirit which stern speaks of the other instructs us to lessen our care the effect is almost the same  useful learning may often be distinguished from false by the congenial delight which the first affords to the human mind nature has exquisitely contrived that the true pleasure and the interest of man should walk hand in hand as she covers the fruit with the flower to this purpose i must again beg leave to quote lucian for an observation as extensive as it is beautiful in his excellent work on writing history he tells us that  in the propriety of any thing lies its greatest beauty he is speaking of false ornaments but take his own words for they should be written with letters of gold in the temple of criticism  this sentiment may likewise be applied to pleasure and utility nature having seldom separated them and having in particular sprinkled the paths of false science with thorns and those of the true with roses  the inveterate antipathy of ignorance to science and of those possessed of false learning to those inheriting the true is well known and is easily accounted for by the analogical aversion of owls bats and other nocturnal monsters to the light of the sun you cannot imagine how easy it is for a blockhead to sneer at erudition it is sometimes very diverting to see ingenious and profound arguments detailed by a man of learning upon any point turned against him in high triumph by dunces who could never have thought of those arguments had not they been dug from the mines o science with great labor and presented to them forged into weapons  true science we have defined to be that which is useful to man it follows that false science is that which is useless to him to this last kind many more branches of what is called knowledge may be referred than is generally imagined but to point them out without adducing reasons for classing them under false science were unjust and absurd and the production of reasons would form a treatise and not a letter  as i began with a quotation from milton so i shall close with another ut pes et caput uni reddantur formoe  who reads incessantly and to his reading brings not a spirit and judgment equal or superior and what he brings what need he elsewhere seek uncertain and unsettled still remains deep verst in books and shallow in himself crude or intoxicate collecting toys and trifles for choice matters worth a sponge as children gathering pebles on the shore   letter xlvii when i lately gave you my thoughts upon the advancement of learning since the time of lord bacon i believe i did not speak of moral philosophy and social science at so great length as the vast importance of those the grandest parts of knowledge would require the reason was that my letter had before i came to these points exceeded all bounds and i was willing to make all the haste to a conclusion which i decently could but as i look upon these two articles as forming the very essence of human wisdom and to be of themselves more weighty than all its other branches put together i now request your permission to present you with a few thoughts upon them expecting as usual to be favored with yours in return that by the collision of our thoughts in this other species of conversation the flame of truth may be struck out  moral philosophy considers man as an individual principally but as his transactions as an individual are of necessity blended with those of other individuals social science mingles with moral philosophy by imperceptible shades they had therefore better be united under the common title of the art of life  how surprising is it my friend what a mortifying instance of the blindness of man to his prime interest that while other arts are so diligently explored by many penetrating minds this transcendent art the sovereign of all arts the art of life should be almost with propriety to be regarded as an undiscovered continent in the globe of science yet how wide how noble a subject for didactic poetry and for the keenest and most diligent examination of philosophy  lord bacon well observes that life consists not in novelties or subtleties it is indeed a trite observation that when a man has seen one family he has seen the world it follows that the art of life may with the greatest propriety be defined and reduced to a science  to do this with ease the middling rank the happiest and best of all cannot be described with too minute a detail this may be considered as the subject of the concerto to use a musical metaphor remarks and examples from the extremes of life may to pursue the figure be regarded as airs  the art of life can never be examined with too scrupulous a minuteness every trifle is important to man himself a trifle and his life a trifle you cannot therefore expect that this letter should enter into any detail it can only just hint at the chief divisions each of which deserves the acute investigation of a different author an author too out of the common run of authors an author who is a man of the world  the chief heads of this art would i suppose be found to be these first man as an individual considered with regard to i his body in   its structure   the natural history of man   the art of preventing   the art of curing diseases ii his mind leaving the metaphysic part out of all question and only examining it by its palpable faculties so to speak of   judgment and reason   memory   imagination  secondly man in society i history of the progress of society ii particular description of the civilized state of society iii advices for the further improvement of society iv domestic society considered in these subdivisions   duties and affections of   husband   wife children   of parents   of friends etc   rules and most minute details of economy and the conduct of life   pleasures and amusements of life with hints for their improvement v civil society or the art of conducting every kind of business including the science of polished manners and what is called knowledge of the world   such i imagine ought to be the general idea of this grand art some of its branches have been already cultivated but by no means with sufficient care charron and nettleton are perhaps the most important authors whose works in this way deserve any mention the first of these in particular is a very valuable writer but neither of them come up to the idea proposed the grand reason why the practical happiness of man is so desert a field of observation is that he he has never yet discovered that important things as theories of worlds etc are trifles to him and trifling things as domestic pleasures etc are to him matters of the last importance the happiness of man is compounded of a variety of minute particles of wisdom and pleasure it is an exquisite concert produced by a variety of instruments most of them very minute in themselves yet of great effect upon the whole now no writer has thought of laying down the art of tuning these several instruments no that were beneath the dignity of philosophy it is judged enough to lay down rules for the concert without enquiring whether the instruments are in proper tune or not hence to drop the metaphor the general titles of books on this subject on virtue and happiness on wisdom the writers did not know that their very titles were presumptuous to madness and that one hundredth part of their plan was far beyond the cultivation of any one author this affectation of being important destroys the merit of all writers on this subject they did not know that they would have been infinitely more important had they been less so the saying of parmenio to philotas my son make thyself less may with great truth be applied to all practical writers on human wisdom with this implied addition that thou may be greater man proud man must thy pride be for ever the destruction of thy real knowledge and of thy happiness  i have dwelt so long upon this preliminary part because it forms the very basis and foundation of the art now spoken of till authors can be persuaded to drop generalities and minutely examine particulars not upon theoretical but upon experimental principles it is in vain to expect any progress in this great science  mans happiness which is the only final purpose of this art has been already observed to be an aggregate composed of many minute parts perhaps nothing contributes more to it than the knowledge of economy yet not one book has ever been written upon this point tho nothing is more capable of being illustrated by details and examples  this may serve as an explanation of my meaning when recommending the art of life to be treated by philosophers at length in its minute heads not taken in gross i speak of examples because it is a trite observation that example goes further than precept and because without examples the several divisions of this knowledge will be more dry and far less instructive  these examples ought always if possible to be be taken from real life or to bear as strict a resemblance of it as possible at any rate they ought to be related in the simplest manner indeed the whole works upon any branch of this science ought to be written in the most simple style imaginable being intended for the instruction of all ranks of society  any further remarks on this head i shall not venture upon i cannot however omit observing that in all well regulated governments a domestic tribunal should be instituted composed of respectable fathers of families who should have power to regulate in a mild manner all serious disputes between father and son or the like the vast power that parents have over the happiness of their children gives many depraved parents an unlimited tyranny and the worst species of it for this always attacks the very vitals of domestic life whereas tyrannic government seldom or never goes so far many parents make their children useless and miserable for life and disinherit them in the end for no cause but their own diabolical caprice if children are disobedient the parents can always punish them but if parents are tyrannical there is no redress for their unfortunate offspring the want of such a tribunal is a disgrace to the legal prudence of every modern country for i think something like it actually existed in one or two of the states of antiquity  i must not conclude without remarking further that lord bacons own hints upon civil society and business are very valuable as every sketch of such a master is they may be regarded with justice as forming a model of a series of documents upon this subject  letter xlviii nobody will deny that in some few passages of the gerusalemme liberata and those very minute tasso has admitted a style a little too figurative yet it may with great justice be asserted that there are more blemishes in the iliad than in the gerusalemme and i question not but there are even very near as many instances of excessive figure and false decoration or in short what our critics call tinsel but if tasso should be found to exceed homer in this which i very much doubt he has many excuses which homer had not such as the platonic or metaphysical style introduced into italian poetry by petrach tassos own fondness for platonism and the very spirit of refinement which pervades italian minds italian thoughts and italian language  there is no human work however perfect upon the whole that can be pronounced to be faultless nay a faultless work is commonly an insipid one that is has the greatest of faults is all one fault without particular faults where a writer rises to uncommon excellence his mind feeble from the lofty flight will be apt to sink beneath even its common level this remark is as old as the time of longinus who well marks the vast preference to be given to an author who with great faults has great beauties over him who has neither fault nor beauty i do not however mean to apply it to tasso whose faults are scarce and minute and his excellencies great and numerous  in estimating the defects of a valuable author we should make ourselves his cotemporaries if homer deserves pardon for the simplicity of the manners he paints because in his time manners were quite of primitive simplicity does not tasso in like manner deserve favor for his style being now and then too figurative while we all know that the italian style of his age was figurative to excess do not we pardon to shakspere his quibbles and to milton his religion let us only make half the allowance for tasso whose faults are not so numerous nor his merits of so high a rank and it is enough  the worth of the gerusalemme i may perhaps be led to estimate on a future occasion the subject of my present letter shall be an equitable enumeration of what are called the conceits to be found in it i have just finished a perusal of it made with a view to mark every one that arose and i doubt not but i have done it with a severe eye you shall have my list which i believe will be found neither incurious nor unuseful after i have observed that in eleven of the twenty books of the gerusalemme there is not the smallest shadow of too figurative a style these eleven books are the i iii v vi viii ix xi xiii xiv xv xvii the passages that are suspicious in the other books are as follow  no   move fortezza il gran pensier larresta poi la vergogna el virginal decoro vince fortezza anzi saccorda e face se vergognofa e la vergogna audace canto ii stanza    to this he seems to have been induced with a view to fill up his stanza another apology for some of his concetti not before mentioned no   questo e quel fuoco chio credea che i cori ne dovesse infiammar deguali ardori canto ii stanza    this is platonic and might have been written by petrarch no   e fra le selve fera a gli uomini parve uomo a le belve ii  0 no   ma il chiaro umor the di si spesse stille le belle got el seno adorno rende opra effetto di foco il qual in mill petti serpe celato e vi sapprende o miracol damor che le faville tragge del pianto e i cor ne lacqua accende iv    petrarca again no   ma di piu vago sol piu dolce vista misero in perdo vii     this would likewise have been written by petrarch and to accuse tasso of petrarchisms would sound as impious in italian cars as to arraign a writer of miltonisms would in ours both being in such admiration that imitations even of their faults are thought meritorious in canto viii   lalba con la front di rose e co pie doro is rather bold but not to excess fairfax well translates it with roses crowned and buskined high with gold homers rosyfingerd morn etc are as bold to the full  no   ch apollo inaura le rose che laurora ha colorite canto x stanza    this just criticism would pronounce false ornament tho homer has passages as glittering no   o sasso amato et onerato tanto che dentro has le mie fiamme e fuori il pianto xii    this is justly regarded as the most exceptionable passage in the whole poem yet it still goes not beyond the model of petrarca the story of tassos affection for this couplet i recommend to your supreme contempt with that of miltons admiration of paradise regained and other popular tales which are believed without vouchers and without probability no   specchio te degno il cielo e ne le stelle puoi riguardar le tue sembianze belle canto xvi stanza    this may justly be excused from the cruel necessity of completing a stanza no   o tu che port part teco di me part ne lassi xvi  0 this likewise smells of petrarca no  0 e in lui trova impedita amor lentrata it lagrimar luscita xvi    no    e gli sorgeva a front fatta gia dauro la vermiglia aurora xviii    front fatta dauro for coronata dauro is bold but i believe not too much so and i think it might be excused from the example of homeric diction  no    che rendendomi a me da me mi tolse xix    on the same footing with no   the warrior who dies with laughter because the spleen is wounded i suspect loses his life by mistake the passage is xx     no    che l cadavero pur non resta a i morti canto xx stanza    no    vestirebbe may forse i membri sui di quel diaspro ond ei lalma ha si dura xx    such is the list of all the passages in the gerusalemme that can lie under the least imputation of too much art is it long  the rest of his style to the vast amount of about sixteen thousand lines is so well sustained and rises frequently to such exquisite beauty as almost to confute the opinion of longinus above adduced with regard to the necessity of great excellencies being accompanied with equal blemishes his composition taken on the whole is most majestically grave and of itself sufficiently arraigns its accusers of calumny and falsehood mere conceits and tinsel may be found in guarini but they who look for them in tasso must bring them along with them else they will not find them  it is risible to observe boileau the first to cry out thief with regard to tasso when the only time he ever attempted poetry for his satires and epistles his imitations as he ought to have called them are only prose lace put in starch i mean in his ode sur la prose de namur he has written such pitiful tinsel as any italian schoolboy would have blushed at being even suspected of  at the same time let the apology of temporary influence which has power over the greatest writers be made for addison himself a prose writer of the first rank for in his age french criticism was quite the vogue as i am afraid it is too much till this day as we now lead the french fashions in dress let us attempt to lead them in literature to attempt is to succeed  letter xlix in the course of our correspondence i believe more than one occasion has arisen of placing the critical abilities of mr addison in no high estimation but as perhaps stronger proofs may be required in the most innocent attack upon the slightest talents of a writer so deservedly eminent i shall if you please in this letter produce these stronger proofs there is another reason which induces me to this disagreeable task and it is that the most minute failings of such an author deserve animadversion for the rocks that have injured a vessel of such supreme rate would doubtless if not avoided with caution prove of immediate fatality to critical adventurers of small size  the only writings of mr addison worthy to be considered as pieces of criticism occur in the spectator this view of his critical errors shall therefore be restricted to that work an taken in the order in which they arise i might be made ten times as long but i hurry through it being sensible that the task is invidious and feeling it disagreeable  spect no   addison has given more proofs than one of his very slight acquaintance with the italian language armida is in the opera of rinaldo called an amazonian enchantress or more properly an enchanting amazon taking enchanting in rather an uncommon acceptance not from her being of the nation of the amazons as addison strangely misunderstands it but from her being an enchantress and virago the remark on the christian magician is equally absurd the magician does not deal with the devil as addison misrepresents it much in the spirit of an old woman but with angels the demons of platonism who were thought the servants of good men and none but the good before such criticisms no work can stand the critic totally misrepresents the meaning and then writes criticisms upon his own misrepresentations the noted attack on tasso which follows these odd blunders is dismissed in pity and silent contempt tasso is innocent of the charge and must be honorably acquitted the english of mr addisons violent hatred of the opera is that he wrote for the english theater and was mortified to see it neglected for the italian  no    phaedra and hippolitus is so woeful a tragedy that i know no italian opera that would not prove a far higher entertainment  no    a perfect tragedy the noblest production of human nature where is epic poetry but addison was writing cato and his rules of criticism are always for his own advantage  his praise of lee on this occasion and of blackmore on another proves sufficiently the depth of his critical abilities  no  0 the tragicomedy is the most natural and of consequence the most proper style of the drama very little learning is required to know that it is not the product of the english stage but of every stage ancient and modern except the french which is sacred to sleep  no    orestess plea for not killing the usurper instantly i believe strikes every reader as futile and a mere ancient stagetrick  no    the praise of bouhours by addison and chesterfield will never rescue him from the contempt of every man who has read or thought much good stomachs cannot be satisfied with syllabubs the critique on gothic architecture shows the pitiful gout de comparaison addison did not know that every art admits of infinite modes of beauty and that to confine it to one of these modes is the reverse of an attempt to enlarge human knowledge and enjoyment  no   0 this essay on genius cannot be read without laughter and a certain assurance that the author knew not what it was  no     what critic ever heard of an heroic poem why examine a poem upon principles utterly inanalagous to it  i remember not that aristotle allows that homers fable wants unity if he does he is a poor critic if he does not addison is a poorer  the perpetual quotations of aristotle give disgust why does he never quote nature  no     a greeks regard for achilles must have been very small like the regard of a spaniard for a portuguese  no     that the names of figures of speech were invented to palliate defects of speech is perhaps the only new critical remark addison has ever made and it is unhappily quite void of foundation mr addison forgot that grammar was invented for speech not speech for grammar  no     there is no occasion in nature for an epic poem always ending happily if such a rule existed in the foolish axioms of criticism milton knew to despise it addison should have drawn new rules from milton and not have pretended to judge him by foreign laws as he does all along  no     the criticism on the third book of paradise lost is not sufficiently severe it is all beneath the middling from beginning to end  no     the device of uriels descent on a sunbeam is almost praised in milton in tasso it would have been tinsel tasso has nothing so tinsical but thus it is when critics are ruled by prejudice and not by investigation  no     the golden compasses ought to have been reprobated all metaphors applied from art to nature are the very reverse of sublime  no  0  the first original of the drama was a religious worship consisting only of a chorus which was nothing else but an hymn to a deity there are rather more errors in this sentence than words as i believe you will judge from former letters the deity was bacchus yet we are told in the next sentence of innocence and religion was mr addison so very entire a stranger to greek science as not to know that the worship of bacchus was utterly inconsistent with innocence and religion  no     we are now arrived at the greatest critical effort of addison that on the pleasures of imagination one of the three causes which he lays down as productive of these pleasures is of no foundation novelty never pleases except when accompanied with the other causes grandeur or beauty the first sight of an ugly object only makes it more disgusting than when use has in some measure reconciled us to it dr akenside you will observe from a communication i made to you some time ago had struck it out of his poem very justly upon more mature consideration  it is not novelty but beauty that makes natural objects more pleasing in the spring beside they are new to no man mr addison surely did not mean his criticisms for those who had never seen the beauties of spring before  no     mr addison is the first writer who discovered that final causes lie bare to our observation bacon would have said that final causes are utterly unknown to man such is the difference between deep and superficial science ignorance is always rash knowledge doubts and trembles  no     for every thing that is majestic imprints an awfulness and reverence on the mind of the beholder and strikes in with the natural greatness of the soul bravissimo cheese is cheese this is a lively instance of what they call criticism  i question if it was phidias who proposed to cut mount athos into a statue of alexander but i beg pardon for such a remark for nothing is more pardonable than a slip of this kind indeed they who remember names and dates seldom remember any thing else  no   0 mr addison tells us of the most agreeable talents of an historian and seems to think they consist in entertaining his reader if so fabulous historians are best the most agreeable talent of an historian is to instruct this is done by discussion of human actions and of the characters who were their agents  such are the brief remarks which at present occur to me upon the critical errors of addison volumes might have been written to refute several of them but i know that to you they need only be hinted besides i was quite impatient to get rid of this ungrateful task for addison is one of my most favorite writers and nothing but my sacred love of critical equity could have been an inducement to its execution  the best writers are perhaps the most liable to faults of a certain kind in like manner as fertile ground is where no grain is sown fertile of weeds strong weeds speak a rich soil nearly as much as strong corn yet they ought to be rooted up that they may not injure the harvest  letter l according to your desire i now send you the confessions of rousseau perhaps the most singular production that ever saw the light nothing can more strongly prove the near alliance of great genius with madness  i know of no work that can be mentioned as parallel to rousseaus except cardans account of his own life i know not indeed which is the most extravagant cardans account of his seeing little brazen armies combat round his feet as he lay in bed of a morning and the like prodigies to be found in the very curious work de vita propria or rousseaus visions of his future happiness with madame warens and other day dreams  a parallel in the manner of plutarch might i think with ease be instituted between the two works rousseau was of great reputation so was cardan rousseau superabounds with extravagant egotism as well as the other rousseau is sometimes almost sublime so is cardan witness this passage of the ix chapter of the latter on fame scribes inquam quomodo legenda et de qua re praeclara et adeo tibi nota ut desiderare legentes possint quo stylo qua sermonis elegantia ut legere sustineant sic ut legant nonne aevo praeterlabante in singulos dies fiet auctio ut prius scripta contemnantur nedum negligantur at durabunt aliquot

habuit et finem accepturus est nil interest an post decimam diem an december millia myriadum annorum nihil utrumque et ex aequo ad eternitatis spatium etc  some of cardans proecepta ad filios subjoined to his life are likewise very good such as  laete vivite quando licet curae enim hominem atterunt non liberant p      nolite opes effundere nec contemnere sunt enim instrumenta omnium bonorum p      quae facturus es nemini dixeris ne impediaris vel invidearis p      letter li among our translations from the eastern languages i am surprised that none has yet appeared in english of the two great works of musladin sadi the orchard and the rosary or flowergarden as they are quaintly entitled the original persian i must confess my ignorance of but the latter translated into latin by a georgius gentius in      now lies before me and considered as an eastern production of the thirteenth century has no small merit i know not if the first be yet translated  the author of les saisons poem paris      i believe ms lambert has well translated a number of sadis apologues as i cannot find all his translations in the rosary i take it that he has given some of them from the other work called the orchard knowing your fondness for the eastern apologue i enclose my translations of a number of them from both works for your amusement  apologue i a king had condemned one of his slaves to death the slave in the anguish of his despair knew no bounds but abused the prince his master with the most bitter reproaches what does he say said the monarch to his favorite who stood near

forgivenness said the king  a courtier who had been a long time the enemy of the favorite had heard the real words of the slave you are grossly deceived sir said he to the monarch that wretch reviles you in the most bitter terms the king answered the lie is the lie of humanity thy truth is the truth of cruelty then turning to his favorite he said oh my best friend thy words shall be the truth  apologue ii i walked with my friend during the great heat of the day under an avenue of lofty trees which afforded a shade impregnable to the blaze of the sun a rivulet ran by through banks of the freshest and greenest turf i saw the visir karoun stretched upon that turf he was asleep  great god said i does not the remembrance of the evil he has done prevent karoun from enjoying the blessings of repose does the soft murmur of the sighs of the unhappy only sooth him to profound slumber  my friend understood me and said god sometimes gives sleep to the wicked that the good may be at rest  apologue iii a blind man had a wife whom he loved to excess tho he was told that she was very ugly a physician offered to cure him h would not consent to it i should lose said he the love which i feel for my wife that lov is my happiness  the troops of cosroes were vanquished the day of an eclipse of the sun the persians adorers of the sun imagined that phenomenon denounced destruction to the empire this imagination extinguished every spark of their courage  error may constitute the happiness of an individual but it is always the source of misery to a nation  apologue iv one day i went home with a mind filled with chagrin after having in my heart satirized all conditions of men and even myself i fell into a profound sleep and had a dream i imagined myself transported to a solitude remote from the vices and follies of mankind i walked with tranquil joy in a large forest which i thought protected my cottage from the violent winds of arabia and forgot in its shades the caprices of life  the sun arose his rays gilded the verdure over my head with feeble transparency i heard the songs of a multitude of birds i was attentive to all their accents i observed the diversity of their forms of their plumage of their flight  heaven lent me of a sudden the power of understanding their several dialects the eagle railed at the owl on her weakness of sight the turtle dove spoke very ill of the hawk who expressed contempt for his weakness the blackbird was very jocose on the cry of the eagle the jay and the magpie mocked each other they reproached the crow with his melancholy appearance and said that the sparrow had a vulgar look  there suddenly descended from heaven a most extraordinary apparition it was a youth whose color resembled roses sprinkled over pure snow by some playful virgin of circassia his wings were of the most delicate azure and their edges streaked with gold as the beams of the morning streak the summer sky his locks were black as ebony his eyes were blacker than ebony no hypocrite could bear their piercing radiance which went to the bottom of the soul he alighted on a lofty planetree whose height surpassed the cedars of the forest he called the different birds by their names they obeyed and flocked around him perching on the branches of the surrounding cedars they trembled in silence he spoke  hear what i reveal to you by command of the most high ye are all equal in merit in his sight ye only differ in qualities because ye are destined to different functions  thou the eagle art born for war thy cry expressive of force cannot have harmony the owl could not have caught reptiles and insects of which she was made to clear the earth if her eyes of minute and nocturnal vision could have met the blaze of the meridian sun the nightingale and linnet it is true are of delicate constitution but how else could they possess delicacy of song the turtle is made for love the hawk for rapine remain in your respective conditions without regret and without pride there are differences in your kinds but there are no faults  at these words i saw the birds disperse through the forest and the genius flew to heaven darting at me a look that spoke  i waked and said shall i then expect from the cadi the mildness of the courtier from the iman the freedom of the warrior from the merchant the disinterestedness of the sage from the sage the activity of the ambitious o heavenly spirit it is sadi whom thou have instructed thy lessons shall be engraven on my heart and my lips shall repeat them to the sons of men  o my brethren we depart together but on different voyages some to the north and others to the regions of the sun we require not the same clothes nor the same provisions we live in a family of which the father has furnished us with very different accoutrements why should he who prunes the vines hold the instruments of tillage  apologue v three inhabitants of balck traveled in company they found a treasure and divided it among them then continued their journey conversing together on the use which they meaned to make of their riches the victuals which they had brought along with them were consumed they agreed that one of them should go to the city for more while the other two waited his return in a pleasant spot where they intended to dine the youngest accepted the commission and departed  he said to himself on the way i am rich but i would have been much more so had i been alone at the time of finding this treasure  these men are the robbers of my riches  can i not resume them yes with ease i have only to poison the victuals which i am about to buy at my return i will say i have dined in the city my companions will eat and die without suspicion i have now only the third of the treasure i will then have all  meanwhile the two other travelers said to each other it was foolish to allow that younker to associate with us we have been obliged to share the treasure with him his part would have much augmented ours and we should without him have been rich indeed  but he returns and we have swords   the young man returned with the poisoned provisions his companions were his assassins they eat they died the treasure was again to find again to be the source of crimes  apologue vi a king of chorazan said to his visir the people of bactriana are commanded by a prince of feeble talents and without experience they have no allies and the conquest is easy assemble my forces and march against them  i obey answered the visir but by what right will you ravish their liberties from a nation who are not your foes  that conquest said the king will increase my power is it a crime to signalize my courage and extend my empire  can it be innocent replied the visir to give your subjects and the world an example of injustice  apologue vii cosroes caused this inscription to be engraven on his diadem many have possessed this many will possess it o posterity thy steps will be imprinted on the dust of my tomb  apologue viii in proportion as time has made to pass before my eyes a larger number of events and since the color of my hair is that of the swans who sport in the waters of the garden of the great king i have thought that the supreme arbiter of our lot who made man and virtue never leaves without pleasure the heart of the good nor a benevolent action without reward hear sons of men hear this faithful recital  in one  hese fertile valleys which intersect the chain of the mountains of arabia lived for a long time a rich and ancient shepherd i knew him well they called him happy he was content one day that he walked on the brink of a torrent through an alley of palm trees the brown foliage of which diversified the verdure of the cedars that crowned the surrounding hills he heard a voice which sometimes filled the vale with piercing cries and of which the melting murmurs were at other intervals not distinguishable from the sound of the stream  the old shepherd ran to the spot from whence the voice arose he beheld at the foot of a rock a young man halfreclined upon the sand his clothes were torn his locks fell in disorder over his face in which beauty shone through the thick shade of grief as the sun from a morning cloud his cheeks wet with tears his head bent on his bosom he resembled a rose dashed with the summer storm the rich shepherd was moved he accosted the youth and said son of misery come to my arms let me press to my bosom the man of grief he is my brother his sorrow is mine  the young man lifted his head in profound silence he looked upon the ole man as asonished that benevolence and pity were yet existing on earth the sole appearance of the venerable shepherd inspired immediate confidence his moist eyes were full of softness and sympathetic fire they had that tenderness which makes the unhappy speak  rising from the ground the youth threw himself into the arms of the shepherd calling with a voice that made all the circling hills resound o father o more than father when he was calmed a little by the conversation and caresses of the old man he thus answered his repeated questions  behind these lofty cedars at the foot of the highest of these mountains stands the house of sheladar father of fatme the hut of my father is not far from thence fatme is the most beautiful of the daughters of the hills i offered myself to guide the flocks of her father and he consented to it he is rich the father of fatme is rich  and my father is poor i love fatme fatme returns my affection her father perceived it we confessed our loves to him and he wishes to constrain me to leave the country in which his daughter dwells i threw myself at his feet and said o father of fatme let me at least reside with my father i consent never more to speak to fatme i will never enquire of her heart i will promise that i will not but give me to conduct one of thy most remote flocks o permit me at least to serve the father of fatme sheladar has refused me all he has treated me with harshness while i had not strength to fly from his house even before his violence he threatens fatme alas i am now distant from her habitation fatme is unhappy my father is infirm my mother is no more i have two brethren so small that they could hardly reach the lowest branches of these palm trees my father and my brothers received all their subsistence from me the bounty of sheladar is no longer my support can misery be equal to mine  my son said the old man let us go together to the pastures of sheladar i will assist thee to walk come the youth consented to it he dragged his steps along with much difficulty drawing near to the residence of sheladar they beheld his daughter she was lost in melancholy the young man said to the aged behold fatme the shepherd without reply entered the house of sheladar and spoke to him thus  a dove of aleppo was carried to damascus she lived there with a mate of the country their master fearing the dove of aleppo would one day return and entice the other with her had them put them asunder they no longer would eat the grain which he held to them from his own hand they both sickened they died  o sheladar divide not those who only live because they live together this young man whom thou have driven from thy house is he a son of virtue  sheladar answered the prophet be my witness in what i am about to speak as the white lily in a bed of narcissuses is that youth among the faithful he surpasses all the young shepherds in piety goodness and vigilance but  he is poor  ah said the old shepherd i and my sons have flocks without number i possess all the rich valley of horafa the riches of the young man shall be my care a large portion of my slocks shall be at thy door on the morrow providing thou will give him fatme  sheladar knew the fame of the old shepherd he promised his daughter the venerable ancient retired  on the morrow he sent to the residence of sheladar a number of flocks more white than the snow on the tops of the mountains in winter and herds of horses more beautiful and nimble than those that carried the prophet  some days after this worthy action the rich and good shepherd went toward the cedars beneath which stood the dwelling of sheladar attend o sons of men attend  the good shepherd was leaving a grove and entering on a meadow through which ran a stream bordered with fig trees he saw upon the grast sheladar who held the hand of an old man whose countenance expressed wisdom and gaiety the old shepherd saw them and stopped to enjoy all the pleasure which the sight of the happiness of his brethren in age could afford the old men had a number of youths about them among whom were two children who sometimes played on the grass and then would come to caress the two fathers they were wellclad they had all the health vivacity and gaiety of their age the good shepherd easily understood that these children were the brothers of the young husband of fatme and that the old man who held sheladar by the hand was their father  nigher to the good shepherd by the shade of the grove fatme and her husband sat on the grass in motionless rapture they often looked upon each other with intense eagerness they smiled so sweetly that it seemed that pleasure alone had ever printed its vestige on their faces often the young couple interrupted their delicious silence by lively but modest caresses one might see that they were restrained by the presence of their fathers often they looked around them and appeared intoxicated with the felicity of all that was dear to them more than even with their own their joy which inspired all the company manifested itself equally in all their faces as the same sap produces like flowers on all the branches of the orangetree  the good shepherd looked on each of them by turns he then chanced to turn his eyes toward the neighboring meadows he beheld the flocks which he had given to sheladar they surpassed those of sheladar among which they were mingled and were distinguishable by their superior whiteness and beauty their guides sung the happiness of their masters and their own own  sons of men ye have heard my faithful recital be virtuous ye poor that the rich may be benevolent be benevolent ye rich that the poor may be virtuous  apologue ix nourshivan the just being one day a hunting would have eaten of the game which he had killed but from the consideration that after dressing it his attendants had no salt to give it a relish he sent at last to buy some at the next village but with severe injunctions not to take it without paying for it

aaron alraschid thou art about to be thyself the worst slanderer of thy mother by persuading the world that she has not taught thee to forgive  apologue xii a man had quitted the society of the dervises and entered into that of the philosophers what difference do you find said i to him between a philosopher and a dervise he answered both swim across a great river with their brethren of men the dervise keeps at a distance from the company that he may swim at ease and arrive alone on the opposite shore the philosopher on the contrary swims with the rest and often stretches forth his hand in their assistance  apologue xiii nourshivan the just being but prince of chorazan and subject of the king of kings loved pleasures and lived splendour his riches were bounteously disposed far and near the most excellent singers the most skilful musicians came to entreat his audience and the first audience made them opulent when he at length sat upon the throne of the world they flocked from all parts of the earth he heard them with pleasure but paid them with far less liberality than when he was a subject prince one of the musicians dared to complain may heaven said he be propitious to nourshivan empire has enlarged his wealth and contracted his mind ye kings write the answer of the just in letters of gold and while ye read it every day after your morning devotions again bend the knee in adoration for the deity spoke by his mouth nourshivan sail formerly i gave my own money now i give that of my people  apologue xiv a king of persia had extended an hand of iniquity over his people he held them in abject slavery and augmented their misery by open scorn impatient of the harsh and humiliating yoke the greater part of his subjects left their country and sought a refuge among strangers the revenues of the prince diminished with the number of his subjects his neighbors profited by his folly his states were attacked and the discontented soldiers defended them feebly he was dethroned  a king ought to nourish his people even with his own substance because he holds his kingdom of his people every subject is the soldier of a just king  apologue xv a king on his coming to the throne had found immense wealth in the coffers of his father the hand of magnificence was opened and the riches of the prince were diffused among the people a visir reproached the prince upon this if an enemy said he attacks your frontiers how will you defend yourself after having distributed your money among your subjects then replied the king i will borrow it of my friends  apologue xvi a

said pray god for me great god said the religious lifting his hands to heaven take haschas joseph from this world wretch thou cursest me said the tyrant i ask of heaven replied the pious the greatest

the visir sourac zirvan beheld himself stripped of his wealth and employments his wife died of sorrow his son would have comforted him  his son was in chains  zirvan with eyes full of tears went every day into the garden of the great dachelim there he lay at the foot of a palm tree and related to it his innocence and his misfortunes  a young man of the court saw and heard him what said he do thou complain to that tree do thou think it sensitive  as man is answered zirvan and it does not interrupt me  apologue xviii a young king gave himself up to dissipation and to all the pleasures prepared for him by those infamous courtiers who build their hopes on the weakness of their master one day he sung at a feast these words i have enjoyed the past i enjoy the present and am not solicitous of the future a beggar sitting under the hallwindow heard the king and exclaimed if thou art not solicitous about thy own lot thou ought to be about ours  the king was struck with the speech he approached the window looked upon the poor man with attention and without speaking to him ordered him a large sum of money then left the hall in silence he reflected upon his past life it had been opposite to all his duties he was ashamed of himself he assumed the reins of government which he had till then entrusted to his favorites he labored assiduously and in a little time he reestablished the order and happiness of the empire  complaints were in the mean while often made to him about the licentious life of the poor man whom he had enriched at last he came one day to the gate of the palace covered with his old rags and begging alms the king showed him to one of the wise men of the court for he had loved wise men since he had loved virtue and said behold the effects of my goodness i loaded that wretch with wealth and my benevolence has only corrupted him riches have been to him the source of new vices and of new misery it is true said the sage because thou have given to poverty the rewards of labor  apologue xix i found one day on the sea shore a virtuous labourer whom a tiger had almost devoured he was on the point of expiring and in great agony great god said he i thank

notions of severe piety i used to rise in the night to watch pray and read the holy koran one night that i had never slept but was wholly employed in those exercises my father a man of practical virtue awaked while i was reading the koran with silent devotion behold said i to him thy other children are lost in religious slumber while i alone wake to praise god son of my soul he answered it is better to sleep than wake to remark the faults of thy brethren  letter lii a promise is with me a matter of most a religious consideration and as you are pleased to remind me of one i made to you on a former occasion with regard to tassos gerusalemne i hasten to fulfill it by submitting to you anestimate of the merits of that work  to proceed on this after the manner in which mr addison has treated the paradise lost vill be most eligible that is first to consider the faults of the work then to examine is worth under the distinct heads of fable with its incidents persons and language  the faults of language have already been discussed in a former letter to which i refer those that remain for present animadversion belong to the incidents and characters and the defects of both are happily minute and rare  the only incident which i can condemn in the whole fable is to be found in the thirtythird and following stanzas of the fourteenth canto and a few stanzas of the fifteenth the story of the old magician his connection with peter the hermit his dwelling xv   etc are all unnatural to excess ineredulus odi to a good christians being a magician in lord bacons sense i cannot confirm mr addisons objection the popular superstition has white wizards and black wizards magicians who deal with the demons of platonisin and with devils the eastern creed makes solomon a magician and pious prince without suspicion of dissonancy it is not therefore to this persons being a pious magician that i object but to the unnecessary miracles that are diffused around him not to the character but to the incidents which attend it  with regard to the faulty characters in the gerusalemme i think that there are far too many female warriors in it we are obliged to virgil for the first personage of this sort the vere sense of homer admitted no such dreams dacier has well observed that a circumstance that is positive fact in real life might yet be much too improbable for poetry we know from history that vermina the daughter of syphax was in the field fighting in assistance of hannibal when he received his last defeat from scipio a circumstance which being so recent probably suggested camilla to virgil we know from history the martial spirit of bonduca of many scandinavian ladies and the like yet all these will not vindicate the admission of female warriors into poetry where the grand truth of nature is the object not the paltry truth of fact tasso has however a very strong apology to offer for his sometimes making the word warrior of the feminine gender and that is the coincidence of his story with the times and manners of chivalry times and manners which presented so many instances of this solecism in costume as almost to elevate truth of fact into truth of nature  so much for the faults of the gerusalemme they are not many yet the eye of critical justice will never be able to find more the beauties fortunately present themselves at more length  the fable is certainly one of the very best for epic poetry that ever was chosen it is superior to that of the iliad as much as the sepulcher of christ was thought at the period of the action and to which in all poetry we must ever accommodate our minds to exceed the value of a strumpet as much as the object of the most zealous adoration of half the globe was superior to the teterrima belli causa  the fable was so grand and general had tasso managed it to its utmost advantage as to interest every nation in europe by the detail of the exploits of its own warriors it may indeed be noted as a blemish in the conduct of the fable that tasso is always an italian and not an european he never dwells with apparent satisfaction but upon the glorious deeds of his own countrymen who had in fact the smallest share in the enterprise homers fable only nationally interested the greeks and neighboring states tassos might have nationally interested every country of europe had he used it with proper liberality as it stands it is a great and interesting fable to every reader tho it must at the same time be confessed that it might have been rendered more so to an infinite degree  most of the incidents must be allowed to have great novelty and merit none of them are foreign to the work or can properly be called episodes like virgils of dido which has no sort of relation to his fable the incident of olindo and sophronia tho one of the most detached is infinitely more a part of the gerusalemme than the adventure with dido is of the eneid and were it much less so its eminent beauty must preclude it from all censure if we condemn it we must crown it with laurel most of the incidents have moreover that pleasing air of miracle which offends not probability and affords the genuine pleasure of poetry to the reader those incidents around which this fairy light is not cast maintain their native force with great dignity and interest the grand incident of armidas intervention with its consequences is masterly to a supreme degree the miraculous is throout carried to all its height yet with the constant preservation of a severe probability the departure of rinaldo from the camp is artfully managed had he left it with the herd of warriors who followed armida the dignity of his character would have suffered violation a stronger cause and worthy of the effect presents itself to us and saves the fame of rinaldo and of tasso  the subsequent amorous adventures of rinaldo and armida tasso appears to me to have taken the hint of from those of mars and venus as beautifully painted by the celebrated agnolo poliziano in his stanze written upwards of half a century before the gerusalemme if you have not read the italian poetry of poliziano you have a great pleasure yet to come his stanze are exquisite and his dithyrambic ode beginning ognun sequa baccho te baccho baccho evoe chi vol bever chi vol bevere vegna a bever vegna qui etc to be found at the end of his orfeo deserves high praise the best edition of his stanze etc is that of padua       to return the pastoral incident in the seventh book is a delicious relief from the scenes of war and horror which precede it nothing can have a more pleasing effect on the imagination than such contrasts when managed with artificial propriety the return to prosspects of the greatest horror and sublimity in nature which the after part of this seventh book presents is still an example of the happy effect of contrast of incident which is never perceived but by a reader of some taste whereas contrast of character is glaring and of no art or effect it is always a sure mark of a writers inexperience in portraits when he is obliged to set them off by foils  the incident of the death of sueno and his host in the eighth book seems to me more of an unnecessary episode than the tale of olindo and sophronia so much objected to by small critics it may be historic truth for aught i remember for i have not now the gesta dei per francos at hand but i fear it is not poetic truth cui bono what purpose does it serve yet after all he must be a severe critic who would range it with the faults of the gerusalemme it bears a general connection with the piece in different minute after relations which is surely enough for its vindication can so much be said for the ghost of dido  to dwell on all the incidents of the geruselemme were inconsistent with my purpose i shall therefore content myself with proceeding to hint at only the principal solimans introduction to aladin in the tenth book is a very great improvement on that of ulyses to alcinous in the seventh book of the odyssey the whole adventure with ismeno is masterly and superlatively pleasing to the imagination tassos very imitations are in that original style which i think you before agreed is the only possible merit which imitation can have and in fact none but original writers can imitate in this way  the story of clorinda is evidently built upon the ethiopic history of heliodorus a work of the very first merit the incident of her dying by the hands of tancred her lover is artfully wrought up and has no small claim to the pathetic  in the thirteenth book the enchanted wood and apparition of the city of fire are incidents of miracle speciosa miracula which approach to the sublime the principal incident of the next canto has already been mentioned in terms of reprobation  in the fifteenth canto the voyage of the two warriors is exquisitely pleasing to the imagination tasso in the first edition of his poem made them go to america and beyond but well altered this and confined their voyage to the length of the canary or fortunate islands indeed it was violation of probability to suppose that three persons natives of europe were in america in the eleventh century and yet that continent remain undiscovered till the fifteenth tho these europeans returned in safety to a whole army of their countrymen and must have been supposed to have related this adventure to them in terms of due admiration the fifteen rescinded stanzas are however well worthy of tasso and as i dare say you have not seen them i shall give you one or two  the first describes the cross a constellation of the southern hemisphere  miran quasi duo nuvoli di molte luci in un congregate e in mezzo a quelle girar con angustissime rivolte due pigre e brune e picciolette stelle e sovra lor di croce in forma accolte quattro piu grandi luminoze e belle eccovi i lumi opposti al freddo plaustro che qui segnano disse il polo d austro miran due merghi indi con l ale molli quasi radendo andar l onda marina la fatal donna a i duo guerrier mostrolli per segno the la ripa e gia vicina et ecco di lontano oscuri colli scopron de lumil terra peregrina lor nel petto un desio subito viene di lasciar l acque e di calcar l arene these two describe the pacific ocean and the isles on one of which armidas station was at first placed by tasso  escon del breve stretto al oceano vasto et immenso il qual co venti ha tregua si ch onda pur non dissaguaglia il piano cui stabil calma a quasi eterna adegua or perch l corso che da senno umano retto non e rapidamente segua spinge sempre soave e sempre eguale gli avventurosi erranti aura fatale a destra e lungo tratto e quivi e il guito e col ricco peru laurea castiglia ma la nave seguendo it manco lito ver la terra anco ignota il cammin piglie e trova un mar si d isole fornito che l egeo con le cicladi somiglia e gia da che lasciar l arene ibere eran dieci albe scorse e dieci sere in the sixteenth canto the incident of rinaldos immediate assent to the persuasions of the two warriors is much too rapid as it was the hinge upon which the crisis of the poem turned no art should have spared to render it interesting by many difficulties and solutions the warriors inducing rinaldo to listen to the expostulations of armida is an article still more unfortunate it was their part to hurry him off his to delay  the circumstance in the next book of the sultan of egypt giving the command of his vast forces to a lieutenant is very ill imagined it is being conformable to history were no excuse had the sultan led them himself and fought himself with godfrey and fallen by his hand more grandeur and more interest would have accrued to the catastrophe of this immortal poem not to mention that a lieutenant was an improper personage to be the commander of so many auxiliary kings  the incidents in the eighteenth canto are as usual with tasso very well ordered the scenes in the next are an exquisite relief from the repetition of general battles which is so apt to disgust erminias meeting with tancred is most artfully contrived and wrought up to no mean share of pathos the adventures of vafrino have all that interest which extreme danger such as must always attend the most dishonorable office of a spy never fail to raise  in the twentieth and last book tasso has drawn from history the most grand and interesting catastrophe of any epic poem in the world without exception the city of jerusalem is taken the sepulcher of christ freed in the eighteenth book what then remained history tells us that four or five days after the taking the holy city the vast forces of the sultan of egypt amounting to near  00000 infantry and  0000 horse came to assail the victors now weakened by repeated conflicts to about   000 men if i remember right victory however declared in favor of the christians with a slaughter of the enemy almost unparalleled what a glorious catastrophe a catastrophe at the same time absolutely necessary to fulfill the event tasso has availed himself of it as indeed a writer of half his talents must have done it has already been remarked that it might have been heightened but as it stands i do not hesitate to pronounce it the grandest close that an epic poem can possibly have  not to intrude too much on your patience the further consideration of this wonderful poem shall be deferred till a future occasion  letter liii the hypocrisy you laugh at is very common literature has its hypocrisies as well as religion that which you mention in terms of just derision is one of the most frequent where a man who is sensible that he has studied a branch of science much and knows the value of his opinions concerning it yet pretends to submit with modest deference to the sentiments of people whose ignorance he knows to conviction can any hypocrisy be more gross were it not much more manly to assume that noble confidentia sui one of the best of the ancient virtues the parent of many other virtues but now unknown to us or unknown as a virtue is sincerity that noblest attribute of the moral character of man to be sacrificed on the altar of false modesty  from principles of the same hypocrisy we often see opinions contrary to truth but which happen to be affirmed by writers of established reputation assented to in silence by others of equal talents who know their falsity but dare not set their judgment against that of authors of celebrity not from modesty for that man cannot be found who will confess the mind of another to be superior to his own but from base hypocrisy of modesty independent of this vice of simulation science would advance in the world with double rapidity names and pretended deference to them have been the great barriers in every age that have confined knowledge to half its proper bounds  a yet more glaring literary hypocrisy is that by which an ignorant man assumes the garb of science as the worst hypocrisy in the moral world is that by which a vicious man assumes the mask of religion in the latter a hypocrite may often be discovered by pushing his simulation too far and in the like manner a literary impostor is apt not to display too much learning for he has got none but to use the character of a learned man in the extreme he shakes his head at the most trivial question and with many hems and has says it is a difficult point a very difficult point indeed and would require very mature examination when any person present says the point is very easy takes it in hand and solves it to the satisfaction of every body the hypocrite of learning shakes his head says that solution is trivial and perhaps is polite enough to hint that it equals the understanding of the audience but that he upon proper occasion and to a learned company could have given a much more profound account of the matter  you cannot imagine my dear friend what an important thing a shake of the head is it makes a man look so wise i have known people get fame pleasure opulence only by shaking their heads tho god knows to use a trite witticism there was nothing in them a shake of the head from an ignorant man is learning from a mean man greatness from a dull man wit from a stupid man genius from a poor man wealth from a fool wisdom i wonder no wit should have written a treatise on the art of shaking the head it were surely capable of much illustration and no writer need be ashamed of handling it when he has the example of mr addison before him who has written at some length on the art of furling the fan an instrument of equal ventosity but least you should be shaking your head at me all this while i shall here close my letter  letter live i have heard it seriously debated in conversation that it is impossible for any writer to obtain a false fame and that celebrity must ever be the fruit of some proportion able merit this opinion as false as it is plausible deserves a confutation at some length from its important consequences to the interests of literature  the fame of a good writer resembles the descent of a pyramid most minute at first but swelling to an enormous base which stands firm as the earth and defies every tempest and even the silent waste of time false fame resembles the pyramid likewise in every thing but its durability but in another view for it rises from a broad base and tapers to nothing hence that applause which is wide at first is very seldom lasting and durable reputation almost always springs from very minute beginnings  a good writer is seldom or never popular at first his ideas are so much out of the common line that he is not understood much less tasted by the mob of his day true judges men of real science are always his first admirers from congeniality of mind and his fame when swelled to a vast river is yet of the utmost purity because its scources are clear the applause of true judges is the only living fame which a writer of true taste can relish when popular acclamation rises around him he will be ready to say with that ancient greek upon hearing an unexpected roar of praise from the populace whom he was addressing have i said a foolish thiug  the opinion of men of learning always leads the mob when it has had a proper period to operate the opinion of the mob is seldom or never that of men of learning and in no instance can lead it  the fame of the most superlative writers is even after thousands of years always confined to superior minds the popular acclaim is only an unmeaning echo of it du bos has well observed that the true reputation of homer is at this day confined to those who can read and admire him in the original perhaps amounting to two hundred persons in the world his other pretended admirers disgrace his genuine fame and are the mere babbling echoes of the former  the like may be said of every superlative writer is pindar is tacitus the minion of the populace our own milton our shakspere universal as he is are not understood or the least relished by one person in a thousand who echo their celebrity with open mouth were the genuine sentiments of the million enquired into it would be discovered that any fashionable bauble of the diurnal kind is of far more estimation in their sight that the immortal labors of these glorious writers what is the use of diamonds to them can they eat them no with the cock in the fable grains of corn were better and where corn is not to be had even chaff  but before the breeze of time that chaff vanishes while diamonds remain and blaze to eternity  men of superior talents have it not in their power to adjust the reputation of a work at once they must have time to consider it perhaps the author is known to many of them and they tremble at the suspicion of partiality perhaps they are careless perhaps they are invidious perhaps they are foes of the author  meanwhile a work of real merit is sure to be neglected for where shall the cattle go when there is no guide the little craft are coasting round their own paltry shores and know not that a new world is discovered if they did how shall they sail to it without powers and without a compass the small fishes they find at home are enough for them they leave the exploration of the treasures of other climates to those who are in possession of superior means of navigation  the fame of few writers whose works are not of a more temporary kind can be estimated in the century in which they live one hundred years of purgatory may with great justice be looked upon as assigned to most authors before they pass to paradise or damnation  rousse au i think observes that the path to true fame like that to the temple of virtue is most arduous and difficult and it may be added that where this difficulty is not found it is much to be doubted that the path is not the true one  i know not however if living fame which is almost always false be not of more real moment to any writer or artist than posthumous and eternal the latter will never buy him a great coat whereas the former heaps wealth and honors upon his happy head living fame is sweet music to the ears tho one were even certain that it will die with us posthumous fame is unenjoyable by us is of no existence to us the false prescience of it affords high satisfaction to the vainglorious fool but the true prescience of it slightly affects the great and the wise  it has already been observed that legitimate celebrity is only to be found in the mouths of true judges who are sully as rare as good writers in so much that for fifty years after miltons comus was published nobody knew its worth but sir henry wotton the delay which true judges always adopt in pronouncing upon superior works has also been stated the public in the mean time led by caprice or fashion bestow their applause which they ought carefully to hoard for real merit upon every gewgaw that comes in their way hence the number of false reputations is almost infinite and in proportion to the true about one thousand to one  any person whodoubts if fame may ever be surreptitiously acquired need only to look into the title pages and cotemporary productions of a thousand works of the last and present century in the first he will see sometimes the twelfth edition of some poetical or other work which disgraces the human mind in the last he will observe the vain and transitory praises bestowed on it by writers of equal minuteness of intellect for one instance in a thousand of these facts cottons virgil travestie had fourteen editions miltons poems hardly two and see the praises of the matchless orindas poems in cowley and others who was she can there be a stronger illustration of my position that false reputations actually exist nay i know that i could from this very century muster up complete evidences of my position that they surpass the true in the proportion of at least one thousand to one  i know not how it is but it is certainly a more favorable symptom of a work to have enemies at first than admirers the ingenious author of the book de l esprit a work in which great talents are exerted to support bad principles observes with truth that superiority is sure to create enemies the maxim of most people is that of the ephesians if any one excells among us let him go and excel elsewhere m helvetius has aptly distinguished the esteem professed for writers of repute into two sorts an esteem of prejudice taken up upon the word of others and an esteem of sentiment the last i call the only foundation of true fame when it is the sentiment of a superior soul he marks corneille as a writer whose esteem stands wholly upon prejudice and not sentiment  when i mention popular fame as of no account in forming our judgment of the worth of a modern writer i do not mean to speak but of works out of the common class works that give new forms to human talents works of themselves merely popular as novels and the like need not stand the test of their century before their fame may be called permanent a table of periods that must pass over different works before the stamp of lasting worth is put upon them might be curious let us try it suppose epic poetry  00 years dramatic poetry  0 years history  00 years lyric poetry  00 years novels  0 years satiric poetry  0 years didactic poetry  0 years philosophy natural  000 years moral  0 years criticism  00 years miscellanies  0 years panegyrics   hour pastoral poetry   minutes  the reason of the short space allowed for the two last is their putrescent quality which makes it not safe to keep them long before they are eaten  letter lv the examination of the merits of tassos gerusalemme shall now with your permission be concluded the fable with its incidents has been the subject of former discussion there now remain the characters the language the particular beauties all which shall be illustrated with as much brevity as possible  to begin then with the characters tasso yields only to homer for the variety of his persons of their strength i cannot say so much most of the characters in the gerusalemme might certainly with much ease have permitted great heightening of additional colors his warriors are by no means ill diversified rinaldo is a most distinct personage from tancred or godfrey and the like may with justice be said of his other warriors but to be a little more explicit  godfrey the chief commander is described as a character of the first value prudent with courage pious with generosity perhaps it may be justly said that he is too perfect homer the secretary of nature draws no perfect characters gravina with great ingenuity and truth observes that he almost alone of all writers paints the true manners and natural passions of men as they are as in life itself his virtuous characters have vice and the vicious virtue a writer without experience thinks the more perfect his characters are in vice or virtue the more perfect they are in poetry the reverse is the truth mixed characters are alone fit for the purposes of fable milton knew this so well that he paints satan himself as a dubious character  rinaldo perhaps the next in importance is an admirable character and new to epic poetry his extreme youth for if i remember right he is not eighteen at the period of the poem makes his part extremely interesting he is as different from achilles as may be tho the general idea of his part in the poem is evidently hinted by homer  tancred again is a most distinct personage from any other in the poem tho to deduce the marks of distinction might require more room than we can now spare  the old warrior raymond has nothing to do with nestor his old age makes his part fully as interesting as the youth of rinaldo does his  the hermit peter is a very fine and new personage and might have given occasion for admirable painting had tasso but known how to avail himself of his fable to the utmost  dudon guelfo sueno vafrino and others are all characters which at least atone for their want of strength by their variety and the like may justly be said even of the most inferior characters in the poem so much for the christian persons  if we pass to the mohammedan we shall find equal variety with much more strength tasso seems to have thought that the christian system prevented any deep shades of discrimination being thrown round a character while the mohammedan more indulgent to human frailty left ample scope for the natural man to show himself in this view aladin soliman altamore ismeno argantes emireno tisiphernes are all characters of as much strength as variety  that of soliman the dethroned king of the turks of asia minor combating against the christians who had dethroned him is particularly strong new and interesting  the part of ismeno the magician is no less strong and new to epic poetry tasso has in this and other parts of his poem admirably availed himself of the system of the middle ages and of chivalry to diversify his machinery magic is certainly the most fit for the purposes of poetry of any supernatural assistance in the world nothing is so delightful to the imagination and the imagination is the sole judge of poetry  of the female characters on both sides i have already spoken but even in their condemnation must confess that they have a fine variety  the language of the gerusalemme has in general all that exquisite melody which is the grand characteristic of the italian tongue it has not the simplicity of homer because it was not written   00 years ago and they who look for pears upon an elmtree will as sancho observes only find sore eyes jesting apart nothing can well be more absurd and ridiculous than to estimate one writers language or other talents by comparison with those of another nature knows no comparisons tassos language may boldly be pronounced as perfect in its kind as that of homer the first is a monarch in laced cloths the latter a monarch in plain is the first less a king than the other  the language of tasso i allow to be figurative but contend that it is with all its exquisite figures much more correct and to me more pleasing than the elegant negligence of ariosto the dress of the gerusalemme is most artfully inwoven but it is inwoven with gold and with all its richness is yet as easy and becoming as the simple attire of some other poems every reader must allow miltons style to be much more inverted and figurative than that of tasso yet this has never been laid to miltons charge so mad is prejudice  the stanza used by tasso must be allowed melodious but its melody is uniform and uniformity the very worst fault versification can have is only to be avoided by using blank verse it is therefore to be wished that he had followed trissino and not ariosto in his versification the question with regard to blank verse and rhyme is reducible to this proposition is pleasure the greater for being diversified  tassos stanza has disadvantages it obliges the writer thrice to use the same rimes and to adopt tautology or unnecessary addition that his stanza may be completed without passing to another subject it has also advantages the set rimes of themselves often introduce thoughts that would not otherwise have arisen the completion of the stanza will often occasion more minute description one of the chief qualities of poetry  to consider the language of tasso at more length were inconsistent with my present purpose it remains to point out a very few of the particular beauties of the poem  in canto i this description of the young rinaldo is delicate ma il fanciullo rinaldo e sovra questi e sovra quanti in mostra eran condutti dolcemente feroce alzar vedresti la regal front e in lui mirar sol tutti l eta precorse e la speranza e presti pareano i fior quando n usciro i frutti sel miri fulminar ne l arm avvolto mart lo stimi amor se scopre il volto this simile is fine non e si grato a i caldi giorni il tuono che speranza di pioggia al mondo apporte come fu caro a le feroci genti l altero suon de bellici instrumenti no description can surpass this of the army on their march in tanto it sol che da celesti campi va piu sempre avanzando e in alto ascend l arm percote e ne trae fiamme e lampi tremuli e chiari onde le viste offend l aria par di faville intorno avvampi e quasi d alto incendio in forma splende e co fieri nitriti il suono accorda del ferro scosso e le campaign assordo this maxim is amost just one e l aspettar del male e mal peggiore forse che non parebbe il mal present in the ii book this brief description of a timid lover well deserves all the admiration it has gained brama assai poco spera a nulla chiede in the next stanza save one this line le negligenze sue sono artifici in one of the most happy antitheses ever written  such lines as pur maggior sent il duol per chi non duolse and lalte non temo e l umili non sdegno are worth whole pages of common poetry sentimental axiomatic beauties are certainly the moft difficult of any of the smaller graces of poetry and ought to be highly valued tasso is full of them take two more from the same canto gran fabbro di calunnie adorn in modi novi the sono accuse e pajon lodi ma verace valor benche negletto e di se stesso a se fregio assai chiaro in the iii canto this simile of the christian armys joy upon the first sight of jerusalem must not be omitted cosi di naviganti audace stuolo che nuova a ricercar estranio lido e in mar dubbioso e sotto ignoto polo provi l onde fallaci el vento infido sal fin discopre il disiato suolo lo saluta da lunge in lieto grido e luno al l altro il mostra e in tanto obblia la noja el mal de la passata via this description of the appearance of the christian host from the towers of jerusalem is wonderful da la cittade in tanto un ch a le guarda sta d alta torre e scopre i monti e i campi cola giuso la polve alzarsi guarda si che par the gran nube in aria stampi par che baleni quella nube e arda come di fiamme gravida e di lampi poi lo splendour de lucidi metalli scerne e distingue gli uomini e i cavalli the sudden discovery of clorinda in her combat with tancredo may with justice be ranked among the beauties of the poem e le chiome dorate at vento sparse giovane donna in mezzo l campo apparse and lampeggiar gli occhi e folgorar gli suardi dolci ne lira or che sarian nel riso with others are strokes which the minute speak the master the death of dudon is worthy of tasso gli occhi apri tree volte e i dolci rai del celo cerco fruire e sovra un braccio alzars e tree volte ricadde e fosco velo gli occhi adombro che stanchi al fin serarsi si dissolvono i membri el mortal gelo irrigiditi e di sudor gli ha sparsi   in canto iv satans speech is very elquent and it may here be observed of all the peeches in the gerusalemme that they are of he very first eloquence finely adapted to the characters and the occasions they may therefore e justly regarded as some of the most striking beauties of the poem  this sentiment in satans speech i sublime and miltonic ebbero i piu felici allor vittoria rimase a noi d invitto ardir la glora   the description of armida is exquisitely beautiful the forte of tasso is beauty that of miltor sublimity  but  proceed even at this rate would prolong thi letter too much you will therefore excuse me if i hasten to a close and enumerate any other particular graces of this poem as briefly as possible were the whole beauties of the gerusalemme narrated a vast volume and n a letter ought to be the vehicle  taso has often made excellent use of ancientapophthegms as in this instance of a thousand i gradi primi in meritar che conseguir desio c v he is likewise full of political wisdom take this aiom for another instance of a thousand ce spesso avvien che ne maggior perigli so i piu audaci gli ottimi consigli   thee reproaches made by tancred to argante ae most spirited and much in homers style fassi innanzi gridando anima vile ch arcor ne le vittorie infame sei etc c vi this image in stanza    of the same canto is admirable good amor ch e present e tra se ride  in canto vii tancreds adventure at the castle of armida is a fine instance of the advantages which the system of chivalry confers on poetry the battle of old raimond with argante is extremely interesting this comparison of argante almost disarmed and vanquished is admirable e par senza governo in mar turbato rotte vele e antenne eccelsa nave from canto viii take this instance of a fine climax ch aneor ve chi sospetti e che di frodo goffredo accusi e chi le accuse approve and from the next canto this yet finer climax of the comparative kind he speaks of the sultan soliman fiume ch arbori insieme a case svella folgore the le torri abbatta ed arda terremoto chel mondo empia d orrore son picciole sembianze al suo furore   this couplet on the death of a young warrior is perhaps the most exquisitely beautiful to be found in poetry l alma lascio mesta laure soavi de la vita e i giorni de la tenera eta lieti e adorni   in the xi canto this circumstance descriptive of the decline of a battle toward evening is very picturesque  e de le trombe istesse il suono langue the tears of aladin in canto xii almost equal those of satan in paradise lost book i the first are as strong and unexpected marks of extreme joy as the latter of uttermost despair sollevo il re le palm e un lieto pianto giu per le crespe guancie a lui cadette etc the address to night in the same canto has been justly admired  in book xiii the horrible sounds that issue from the enchanted forest are described with great strength of fancy esce all or de la selva un suon repent che par rimbombo di terren che treme el mormorar de gli austri in lui si sense el pianto d onda the fra scogli geme come rugge it leon fischia il serpente come urla il lupo e come l orso freme vodi e vodi le trombe e vodi il tuono tanti e si fatti suoni esprime un suono a variation of the same sound in stan  0 is alike dreadful to the imagination e trarne un suon che flebile concento par dumani sospiri e di singulti e un non so che confuso instilla al core di pieta di spavento e di dolor the gate of dreams in canto xiv surpasses the two of homer so poorly copied as usual by virgil non lunge a lauree port ond esce il sole e christalina porta in orient che per costume innanzi aprir si suole che si dischiuda luscio al di nascente da questa escono i sogni i quai dio vuole mander per grazia a pura e casta mente da questa or quel ch al pic buglion discende lali dorate inverso lui distende in book xv the simile of the doves neck is exquisite but to quote similes were endless for i know not one in the poem that is not superlative in its kind the description of the sailing in stan    must delight every reader the comparisons in stan  0 are so fine as to demand particular remark in spite of the general praise of tassos similes which i have just expressed  the reproaches of armida to rinaldo in canto xvi are of exquisite spirit vattene pur crudel con quella pace che lasci a me vattene iniquo omai me tosto ignudo spirto ombra seguace indivisibilmente a tergo avrai nova furia co serpi e con la face tanto tagitero quanto tamai etc   this stroke tho minute speaks the master mill affetti in un guardo appajon misli  cant xviii  tasso very often attains the moral axiomatic sublime here is another instance from book xix ove signor la tua virtute antica disse il sultan tutto crucciso all ora tolgaci i regni pur sort nemica  chel regal pregio e nostro en not dimora and yet another instance from the same canto prese i nemici han sol le mura e i tetti el vulgo umil non la cittade han presa che nel capo del re ne vostri petti ne le man vostre e la citta compresa   in the last book the description of godfreys appearance before the decisive battle is wonderful vassene e tale e in vista il sommo duce ch altri certa vittoria indi presume novo favor del cielo in lui riluce el fa grande e augusto oltra il costume gli empie donor la faccia e vi riduce di giovinezza il bell purpureo lume e ne latto de gli occhi e de le membra altro che mortal cosa egli rassembra   these minute touches are excellent e di mezzo la tema esce il dilletto e nel cadere egli ode dar gridendo i nemici al colpo lode la via donor de la salute e via   nothing but the contracted limits of a letter can excuse my making so diminutive a selection of beauties from a performance so rich in them indeed you will easily perceive that my aim through the whole has been rather to avoid noticing the innumerable beautiful passages that presented themselves than to search for them as a critic of less contracted province ought to do  letter lvi lord bacon in his essays has given us what he calls the true marshalling of the degrees of sovereign honor in the following order i founders of states as romulus etc ii lawgivers as lycurgus solon etc iii deliverers of their country iv enlargers and defenders of their country and dominion v fathers of their country as just kings and rulers   the names of several great men whom he classes under these heads i cannot approve for instance in the i he classes cyrus caesar ottoman in the iii augustus caesar vespasian aurelian theodoric our henry vii and henry iv of france he seems to forget that he might have had from greece immaculate examples of all his ranks of celebrity however the degrees cannot be objected to in any point but this that he ought to have placed his iid rank first for it is certainly a more difficult and a more glorious work to give laws to a state than to found it the latter is a work of chance the former of labor and profoundest science of every kind  i have often thought that it might be a matter of some curiosity not to say importance to attempt a similar scale of literary and scientific fame the great branches of human art and science are if i remember right i natural and moral philosophy ii poetry iii history iv painting v music vi architecture vii sculpture viii criticism and other lesser kinds of prose writing there is an infinite number of more minute discriminations of science but upon examination we shall find that true celebrity has only sprung from one or other of these greater sources or their divisions the greater sources are formed from a numerous variety of springs upon any of which if a candidates bark is properly launched he may be carried into the universal ocean of fame with swelling sails for example in natural philosophy are contained medicine chemistry botany astronomy geometry etc eminence in any of which is a sure path to lasting reputation and the like is applicable to the other larger divisions  common sense would lead us to think that the arts and sciences which are of most utility to man ought to be the highest objects of his esteem in this view to determine the proportion of legitimate applause which a superlative performance of any kind ought to have we would only need to class it according to its real utility experience however is against this for a capital poet or painter has always larger and more lasting fame than an inventor of the most useful art this is easily accounted for the inventor of an useful art is soon forgotten because any art that is merely useful ceases almost with its invention to raise any admiration its daily use of itself precludes all gratitude to the inventor men in their ingratitude instead of wondering at the inventtion only wonder why the art was not discovered before besides the most useful art if of trivial use tho it may require the utmost power of mind to form the first idea of it yet can be improved by almost every body and these additional improvements totally stifle the first fame of the inventor not to mention that the name of the artist never appears on products of useful art nor do their products themselves last how then can his fame be preserved if it is it must be in writing the only immortal art we know but he who preserves the fame of others in writing of any kind is certainly the more immediate heir of fame than those whose names he preserves hence authors themselves are the surest possessors of celebrity and next to them those whom they condescend to applaud hence we should know nothing of the ancient painters musicians and other artists did not we read of them in ancient volumes hence homer will always inherit more renown than the inventor of the windmill tho i suspect a rigid philosopher would decide that the reputation of the latter ought to stand highest because he deserves best of mankind  it is from facts then and not from theory that we should form an estimate of the degrees of scientific fame one who accurately weighs the estimation in which the respective arts and sciences are held by men of erudition who are their only genuine judges will find the scale to be much of this tenor  i epic poetry ii dramatic poetry iii moral philosophy iv natural philosophy in general v history vi lyric poetry vii medicine viii smaller epic poetry or tale writing ix architecture x painting xi music xii sculpture xiii fables xiv novels xv satiric poetry xvi didactic poetry xvii criticism and other small prose writing xviii mathematics xix astronomy xx geometry chronology geography the other arts if i rightly recollect are so minute that they form a galaxy of stars in which no difference of magnitude appears to the eye  letter lvii nothing can be more just than your strictures on the folly and presumption of moss critics criticism which is indeed only the ladys maid of ability like all those of that description is fond of aping her mistress dresses herself in her cast cloths and looks upon herself as being as good as her lady criticism is at best only the pilot of genius only knows shores already explored with the face of the coast and soundings when the captain commands the vessel upon an expedition to undiscovered isles this poor pilot condemns his rashness with bitter exclamations and despair of safety while the captain is obliged to take the helm himself attend to every rock and shoal and conduct his daring ship into a port from which he is to return with treasures yet unknown when he has done this with a safety which valor always ensures you cannot imagine how proud mr pilot is like the fly upon the coachwheel it was he and he alone whose cautious conduct guided the vessel into harbor now that he knows the road he can instruct others and does it with all the insolence of advice but his instructions are always of the timid kind and analogous to his own littleness of intellect he derives from the success of this expedition not arguments of enterprise for others of like adventure but chilling dissuasions and tales of danger insomuch that very much owing to his cowardly information voyages to new latitudes of art are very rare and the man who attempts them with success may well be pronounced to have talents superior to those which found a state or shake a potent empire to its inmost foundations  criticism may be defined to be that science by which we are taught to form proper judgments of the merits and defects of the other arts and sciences i have called criticism a science and not an art because it is theoretical and not practical because there can be no art where there is no room for invention because criticism is merely a science and rests solely upon knowledge in the points of which it treats and that knowledge if you will is not even a science per se but arises from the mental exertion of others yet does not ascend to analogy like other human sciences for instance were a critic to judge from analogy that because the beginning of the iliad is simple that of every epic poem ought to be so he would judge wrong for this reason that a man of genius his master would tell him that there ought to be no analogy in poetry and that the simplicity of homers beginning is a fault not a beauty for the great point of opening an epic poem is to raise the very utmost expectation and allowing it a beauty it is a beauty to be avoided by other writers because any appearance of imitation never fails to disgust a superior judge  criticism if i mistake not originated with aristotle who was as sond of subduing the mental world as his pupil alexander was of conquering the habitable after that this aristotle by dint of many a base trick and cavil to be found in athenaeus elian and other writers of antiquity had usurped a tyrannical power over almost every branch of science he was like his mad disciple weeping for other worlds to vanquish after conquering the earth in his political and moral works he had upon the airballoon of presumption to use a metaphor which smells a little of anachronism visited mercury in his topics the moon in his treatise on the soul venus in his natural history mars in his treatise on rhetoric jupiter in his treatise on heaven saturn in his other works the planet of poetry like herschels discovery was then rolling in new radiance through the wastes of ether to it goes mr aristotle upon his air balloon and returning tells us all about it to drop the allegory ere it grows stale to an impartial reader who is able to judge for himself it must be matter of infinite surprise how the authority ofaristotle should ever be any thing in poetry all he has done is to give a parcel of metaphysical names his common trick to different points of poetry which points he draws without any invention or addition from homer and sophocles he then sits down with as much satisfaction as that indian chief who gets up every morning before sunrise steps to the door of his cabin marks with his finger the course the sun is to pursue in his days journey which he always takes care shall be the usual one and then returns in the glory of having given his directions to the sun his brother  the only thing aristotle did in criticism was to give some names almost as unentelligible as that entelecheia which has cracked the brains of all his commentators to different articles he seems only to have strutted into the theater of poetry to drop the curtain of obscurity over the scene of nature a demerit which the meanest menial belonging to the house could have had sufficient ability to incur the blame of as well as himself perhaps you will think this censure of aristotle severe but do not imagine it singular the awful shades of vittorius castelvetro gravina the two last names in criticism superior to that of aristotle rise around me in its defense  this mention of the earliest ancient critic might induce a review of the other critical writers of antiquity by which indeed we should be better enabled to judge of the nature of criticism than by theoretic reasoning but to give this at proper length would require other bounds and deeper disquisition than the brief style of a letter will authorize the other critics of antiquity you know are dionysius of halicarnassus the author of the treatise under the name of demetrius phalereus hermogenes longinus among the greeks  and among the latins instar omnium quintilian the only critic who ever deserved the name to the three first may with justice be applied the noted distich turpe est dissciles habere nugas stultus et labor est ineptiarum of longinus the fourth i shall only repeat the just verdict of an italian critic of the first repute namely that he wrote on the sublime in a total ignorance of what it was his work is in fact more applicable to the beautiful than to the sublime a sure proof that he knew not what he was writing about his praise of neptunes horses leaping like so many fleas in a blanket is one instance of at least twenty of his false taste if it be sublime to make the gods hoses go so far at two or at three leaps were it not far more so to describe them as leaping the whole space at once can there be a sublime beyond which in its kind the most common mind may form conceptions surely not homers idea is burlesque and an instance of the false sublime for this plain reason that it presents a risible and not a great image  to quintilian the highest reverence is due as the only ancient writer in prose who knew how to criticize with sound sense and integrity of mind  what quintilian is in prose horace is in poetry his remarks for the very term of critical precepts which i was about to use implies derision are those of a master yet like those of all critics are to be strongly discussed by the readers own judgment and in this view many of them will lie prostrate on the ground like so many false idols before the deity of truth this will always be the case with such criticisms as have no reasons alleged in their support which are ever fully as absurd in the eyes of a reader of science as the verdict of a judge would be ere he had lent an ear to the pleadings and recapitulated the cause  from the great rarity of good critics of antiquity those of modern days ought to judge of the extreme difficulty of writing with such propriety as to secure the fame of future ages just criticism itself is a dangerous province upon the very boundaries of the empire of science where because of its distance from the capital the renown is by no means proportioned to the greatness of ability and enterprise absolutely necessary to be exerted to form a proper critical estimation of any work the iliad for instance in all its parts would i must assert require talents double the size of the authors for if they are only equal the mind of the critic will be homogeneous with that of the poet he will consequently be capable of conceiving nothing beyond the work and his performance will consist only of slight efforts of admiration and of blame not of such superior critical disquisition as may improve the art of which he treats and which alone forms the essence of just criticism suppose even that a critic should arise with twice the mental powers of homer an event that will never happen suppose that his work had every perfection of criticism wide views profound research boundless treasures of erudition suppose it displayed a mind that like a telescope could magnify distant worlds of genius and show them to the common eye and at the same time with microscopic powers could examine the most minute particle of phrase what with all these supernatural attributes would be the proportion of his fame very small the man of genius like the sun would dazzle nations while he a little planet of borrowed light would only glitter in obscurity  in speaking of criticism i have avoided treating of systematic because the ancients knew no such thing it was left for the folly of the moderns to frame elements of universal criticism an attempt than which nothing can be more absurd for if no critic has yet arisen able fully to discuss one particular branch of this science what shall we say of him who boldly undertakes to examine and illustrate the whole  the only work that could prove of real advantage in criticism would be a selection of all the remarks made by illustrious writers relative to this study accompanied with a modest explanation and commentary supported by examples such a work would go further to be of genuine utility to the arts and sciences than any species of system tho digested by a critic of the most uncommon powers of mind  the end
