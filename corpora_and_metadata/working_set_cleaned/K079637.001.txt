remarks on forest scenery and other woodland views  remarks on forest scenery and other woodland views relative chiefly to picturesque beauty illustrated by the scenes of newforest in hampshire  in three books   happy he whom what he views of beautiful or grand in nature from the broad majestic oak to the green blade that twinkles in the sun prompt with remembrance of a present god coopers  vol i  by william gilpin a m prebendary of salisbury and vicar of boldre in newforest near lymington  london printed for r blamire strand  mdccxci  to william mitford esquire lieut col of the southern battalion of hampshiremilitia and one of the verderors of newforest vicarshill march        dear sir when your friendship fixed me in this pleasing retreat within the precincts of newforest i had little intention of wandering farther among it is scenes than the bounds of my own parish or of amusing myself any more with writing on picturesque subjects but one scene drew me on to another till at length i had traversed the whole forest the subject was new to me i had been much among lakes and mountains but i had never lived in a forest i knew little of it is scenery every thing caught my attention and as i generally had a memorandumbook in my hand i made minutes of what i observed throwing my remarks under the two heads of forestscenery in general and the scenery of particular places thus as small things lead to greater an evening walk or ride became the foundation of a volume  in methodizing my remarks i divided them into three books in the first i have considered trees which are the foundation of all scenery as single objects i have endeavored to investigate their general picturesque qualities  in their several kinds  and in the specific character of each concluding the book with a short account of some of the most celebrated trees which have been noticed  the second book considers trees under their various modes of composition from the clump to the forest it considers them likewise under the several picturesque circumstances of permanent and accidental beauty in which we often find them as the first book concluded with an account of distinguished trees the second concludes with a short view of foresthistory and of the several forests that may be traced in great britain  this leads me directly to newforest which is the subject of the third book it opens with a few observations on this celebrated tract of country the scenery of it is next described in a series of journeys through it is several divisions and lastly the modes and habits of life are remarked of such animals as inhabit and embellish it  it is now my dear sir above ten years since you first saw this work in ms during which time it has received frequent revisal and much addition as new occurrences and observations arose to many of my friends likewise i owe obligations who have assisted me with their criticisms and to you in particular who are so well acquainted with these scenes and have furnished me with many judicious remarks and entertaining forestanecdotes  i am desirous you see to engage you with me in this work you are as fond of these amusements as i am and when we trifle we like to have the sanction of those we esteem to trifle with us  i hope however that while you showing the world how herodotus and thucydides would have written in english are throwing the colors of truth on the crimes of antiquity and while i am humbly endeavoring to point out as my profession leads that greater advantages should be attended with more virtuous conduct  the world will not be so cynical as to find fault with our amusements which tho certainly innocent and rational i believe neither of us considers as the principal employment of our lives  how far the following work may be an amusement to others i know not you will i am sure accept it with indulgence and as a mark of that esteem affection and friendship with which i am my dear sir  your very sincere and obliged humble

are found chiefly in the northern parts rabbits too abound every where you every where meet with vast forests where these wildbeasts range at large or with parks secured by pales hunting is the principal amusement of all the people of distinction observations on forest scenery book i section i it is no exaggerated praise to call a tree the grandest and most beautiful of all the productions of the earth in the former of these epithets nothing contends with it for we consider rocks and mountains as part of the earth itself and tho among inferior plants shrubs and flowers there is great beauty yet when we consider that these minuter productions are chiefly beautiful as individuals and are not adapted to form the arrangement of composition in landscape nor to receive the effects of light and shade they must give place in point of beauty  of picturesque beauty at least which we are here considering  to the form and foliage and ramification of the tree thus the splendid tints of the insect however beautiful must yield to the elegance and proportion of animals which range in a higher class  with animal life i should not set the tree in competition the shape the differentcoloured fur the varied and spirited attitudes the character and motion which strike us in the animal creation are certainly beyond stilllife in its most pleasing appearance i should only observe with regard to trees that nature has been kinder to them in point of variety than even to its living forms tho every animal is distinguished from its fellow by some little variation of color character or shape yet in all the larger parts in the body and limbs the resemblance is generally exact in trees it is just the reverse the smaller parts the spray the leaves the blossom and the seed are the same in all trees of the same kind while the larger parts from which the most beautiful varieties result are wholly different you never see two oaks with an equal number of limbs the same kind of head and twisted in the same form  however as variety is not alone sufficient to give superiority to the tree we give the preference on the whole to animal life  sect ii trees when young like striplings shoot into taper forms there is a lightness and an airiness in them which is pleasing but they do not spread and receive their just proportions till they have attained their full growth  there is as much difference too in trees i mean in trees of the same kind in point of beauty as there is in human figures the limbs of some are set on awkwardly their trunks are disproportioned and their whole form is unpleasing the same rules which establish elegance in other objects establish it in these there must be the same harmony of parts the same sweeping line the same contrast the same ease and freedom a bough indeed may issue from the trunk at rightangles and yet elegantly as it frequently does in the oak but it must immediately form some contrasting sweep or the junction will be awkward  all forms that are unnatural displease a tree lopped into a may pole as you generally see in the hedgerows of surry and some other countries is disgusting clipped yews lime hedges and pollards are for the same reason disagreeable and yet i have sometimes seen a pollard produce a good effect when nature has been suffered for some years to bring it again into form but i never saw a good effect produced by a pollard on which some single stem was left to grow into a tree the stem is of a different growth it is disproportioned and always unites awkwardly with the trunk  not only all forms that are unnatural displease but even natural forms when they bear a resemblance to art unless indeed these forms are characteristic of the species a cypress pleases in a conic form but an oak or an elm trimmed into that appearance would disgust in the cypress nature adapts the spray and branches to the form of the tree in the oak and elm the spray and branches form a different character    lightness also is a characteristic of beauty in a tree for tho there are beautiful trees of a heavy as well as of a light form yet their extremities must in some parts be separated and hang with a degree of looseness from the fullness of the foliage which occupies the middle of the tree or the whole will only be a large bush from position indeed and contrast heaviness tho in itself a deformity may be of singular use in the composition both of natural and of artificial landscape  a tree also must be wellbalanced to be beautiful it may have form and it may have lightness and yet lose all its effect by wanting a proper poise the bole must appear to support the branches we do not desire to see it supporting it is burden with the perpendicular firmness of a column an easy sweep is always agreeable but at the same time it should not be such a sweep as discovers one side plainly overbalanced  on bleak seacoasts trees generally take an unbalanced form and indeed in general some foreign cause must operate to occasion it for nature working freely is as much inclined to balance a tree upon it is trunk as an animal upon it is legs  and yet in some circumstances i have seen beauty arise even from an unbalanced tree but it must arise from some peculiar situation which gives it a local propriety a tree for instance hanging from a rock tho totally unpoised may be beautiful or it may have a good effect when we see it bending over a road because it corresponds with it is peculiar situation we do not in these cases admire it as a tree but as the adjunct of an effect the beauty of which does not give the eye leisure to attend to the deformity of the instrument through which the effect is produced  without these requisites therefore form lightness and a proper balance no tree can have that species of beauty which we call picturesque    sect iii besides these requisites of beauty in a tree there are other things of an adventitious kind which often add great beauty to it and here i cannot help lamenting the capricious nature of picturesque ideas in many instances they run counter to utility and in nothing more than in the adventitious beauties ascribed to trees many of these are derived from the injuries the tree receives or the diseases to which it is subject mr lawson a naturalist of the last age thus enumerates them how many forests and woods says he have we wherein you shall have for one lively thriving tree four nay sometimes twentyfour evil thriving rotten and dying trees what rottenness what hollowness what dead arms withered tops curtailed trunks what loads of mosses drooping boughs and dying branches shall you see every where see lawsons orchard   now all these maladies which our distressed naturalist bemoans with so much feeling are often capital sources of picturesque beauty both in the wild scenes of nature and in artificial landscape  what is more beautiful for instance on a rugged foreground than an old tree with a hollow trunk or with a dead arm a drooping bough or a dying branch all which phrases i apprehend are nearly synonymous  from the withered top also great use and beauty may result in the composition of landscape when we wish to break the regularity of some continued line which we would not entirely hide  by the curtailed trunk i suppose mr lawson means a tree whose principal stem has been shattered by winds or some other accident while the lower part of it is left in vigor this is also a beautiful circumstance and it is application equally useful in landscape the withered top just breaks the lines of an eminence the curtailed trunk discovers the whole while the lateral branches which are vigorous and healthy in both hide any part of the lower landscape which wanting variety is better veiled  for the use and beauty of the withered top and curtailed trunk we need only appeal to the works of salvator rosa in many of which we find them of great use salvator had often occasion for an object on his foregrounds as large as the trunk of a tree when the whole tree together in it is full state of grandeur would have been an encumbrance to him a young tree or a bush might probably have served his purpose with regard to composition but such dwarfs and striplings could not have preserved the dignity of his subject like the ruins of a noble tree these splendid remnants of decaying grandeur speak to the imagination in a style of eloquence which the stripling cannot reach they record the history of some storm some blast of lightening or other great event which transfers it is grand ideas to the landscape and in the representation of elevated subjects assists the sublime  whether these maladies in trees ever produce beauty in adorned nature i much doubt kent was hardy enough even to plant a withered tree but the error was too glaring for imitation objects in every mode of composition should harmonize and all we venture to assert is that these maladies are then only sources of beauty either in the wild scenes of nature or in artificial landscape when they are the appendages of some particular mode of composition  the last and most beautiful of those diseases which mr lawson ascribes to trees is moss this it is true is one of natures minutiae and in painting touches not the great parts composition and effect nor is it of use in mere drawing but in colored landscape it is surely a very beautiful object of imitation  the variety of mosses  the green which tinges the trunk of the beech the brimstone colored and black which stain the oak and the yellow which is frequently found on the elm and ash are among the most beautiful of those tints which embellish the bark of trees  i have often stood with admiration before an old forestoak examining the various tints which have enriched it is furrowed stem the genuine bark of an oak is of an ash color tho it is difficult to distinguish any part of it from the mosses that overspread it for no oak i suppose was ever without a greater or a less proportion of these picturesque appendages the lower parts about the roots are often possessed by that green velvet moss which in a still greater degree commonly occupies the bole of the beech tho the beauty and brilliancy of it lose much when in decay as the trunk rises you see the brimstone color taking possession in patches of this there are two principal kinds a smooth sort which spreads like a scurf over the bark and a rougher sort which hangs in little rich knots and fringes i call it a brimstone hue by way of general distinction but it sometimes inclines to an olive and sometimes to a light green intermixed with these mosses you often find a species perfectly white before i was acquainted with it i have sometimes thought the tree whitewashed here and there a touch of it gives a luster to the trunk and has it is effect yet on the whole it is a nuisance for as it generally begins to thrive when the other mosses begin to wither as if the decaying bark were it is proper nutriment it is rarely accompanied with any of the more beautiful species of it is kind and when thus unsupported it always disgusts this white moss by the way is esteemed a certain mark of age and when it prevails in any degree is a clear indication that the vigor of the tree is declining we find also another species of moss of a dark brown color inclining nearly to black another of an ashy color and another of a dingy yellow we may observe also touches of red and sometimes but rarely a bright yellow which is like a gleam of sunshine and in many trees you will see one species growing upon another the knotted brimstonecoloured fringe clinging to a lighter species or the black softening into red  strictly speaking many of these excrescences which i have mentioned under the general name of mosses should have been distinguished by other names all those particularly which cling close to the bark of trees and have a leprous scabby appearance are classed i believe by botanists under the name of lychens others are called liverworts but all these excrescences under whatever names distinguished add a great richness to trees and when they are blended harmoniously as is generally the case the rough and furrowed trunk of an old oak adorned with these pleasing appendages is an object which will long detain the picturesque eye  but besides the appearance of moss upon the trunks of trees it creeps among the branches and sometimes takes possession not only of the larger boughs but even of the smaller spray in winter this has often a fine effect when the whole tree turned into a beautiful piece of strawcoloured coral appears against a dark wood or some other background which gives it relief in a strong sunshine too it is beautiful when the light strawcoloured tints contrast with the shadows formed by the twisting of the boughs which are sometimes still further deepened by some of the darker mosses  thus the maladies of trees are greatly subservient to the uses of the pencil the foliage is the dress and these are the ornaments  even the poet will sometimes deign to array his tree with these picturesque ornaments i am always glad of his authority when i can have it and i have seen a poetical oak garnished in a way that the painter might copy from in general however the poet is not like the painter uniform in his admiration of these pleasing appendages if at one time he admires them with the painter and ranks them among the picturesque beauties of nature at another he sides with the woodman and brushes them away nay i have known him conjure up some mighty agent as guardian of his woods who cries out  from jove i am the power of this fair wood and live in oaken bower i nurse my saplins tall and cleanse their rind from vegetating filth of every kind and all my plants i save from nightly ill of noisome winds and blasting vapors chill   besides mr lawsons catalogue of maladies we might enumerate others which are equally the sources of beauty the blasted tree has often a fine effect both in natural and in artificial landscape in some scenes it is almost essential when the dreary heath is spread before the eye and ideas of wildness and desolation are required what more suitable accompaniment can be imagined than the blasted oak ragged scathed and leafless shooting it is peeled white branches athwart the gathering blackness of some rising storm    ivy is another mischief incident to trees which has a good effect it gives great richness to an old trunk both by it is stem which often winds round it in thick hairy irregular volumes and by it is leaf which either decks the furrowed bark or creeps among the branches or hangs carelessly from them in all these circumstances it unites with the mosses and other furniture of the tree in adorning and enriching it but when it gathers into a heavy body which is often the case it becomes rather a deformity in summer indeed it is bushiness is lost in the foliage of the tree but in winter naked branches make a disagreeable appearance staring from a thick bush  and yet in autumn i have seen a beautiful contrast between a bush of ivy which had completely invested the head of a pollardoak and the dark brown tint of the withered leaves which still held possession of the branches but this was a mere accidental effect for you may see many pollardoaks with withered leaves and covered with ivy and yet not see the tints so happily arranged as to produce an effect  in the spring also we sometimes have a pleasing appearance of a similar kind about the end of april when the foliage of the oak is just beginning to expand it is varied tints are often delightfully contrasted with the deep green of an ivy bush which has overspread the body and larger limbs of the tree and the contrast has been still more beautiful when the limbs are covered as we sometimes see them with tufts of brimstonecoloured moss  all these plants are parasitical as the botanist expressively calls them the tribes of mosses lychens and liverworts make no pretense to independence they are absolute retainers not one of them gets his own livelihood nor takes the least step toward it the ivy indeed is less dependent he has a root of his own and draws nourishment from the ground but his character is misrepresented if his little feelers have not other purposes than merely that of showing an attachment to his potent neighbor shakespeare roundly asserts he makes a property of him  he was the ivy which had hid my princely trunk and sucked my verdure out    besides this parasitical tribe the painter admires another class of humble plants which live entirely on their own means yet spreading out their little tendrils beg merely the protection of the great whom if they encumber as they certainly do in a degree they enrich with a variety of beautiful flowers and scarlet berries many of these tho classed among weeds have great beauty among them the black and white brionies are distinguished the berries also of many of these little plants are variously colored in the different states of their growth yellow red and orange all these rich touches however small produce their effect there is another elegant climber called travellers joy which produces indeed no berries but it is feathered seeds are ornamental the wild honeysuckle also comes within this class and tho in winding it is spiral coil it may compress the young tree too tightly and in some degree injure it is circulation yet it fully compensates the injury by the beauty and fragrancy of it is flowers with clasping tendrils it invests the branch else unadorned with many a gay festoon and fragrant chaplet recompensing well the strength it borrows with the grace it lends   under warm suns where vines are the offspring of nature nothing can be more beautiful than the forest tree adorned with their twisting branches hanging from bough to bough and laden with fruit  the clusters clear half through the foliage seen    among the most beautiful appendages of this hanging kind which we have in england is the hop in cultivation it is disagreeable but in it is rude natural state twisting carelessly round the branches of trees i know not whether it is not as beautiful as the vine it is leaf is similar and tho the bunches of hop beautiful as they are and fragrant are not equal to the clusters of the vine yet it is a more accommodating plant hangs more loosely and is less extravagant in it is growth  in artificial landscape indeed where the subject is sublime these appendages are of little value such trifling ornaments the scene rejects the rough oak in the dignity of it is simple form adorns the foreground better but in festive or bacchanalian subjects if such subjects are ever proper for description when the sportive nymphs and satyrs take their repose at noon or gambol in the shade of evening nothing can more beautifully adorn their retreat or more characteristically mark it than these pendent plants particularly the mantling vine hanging as i have here described it in rich festoons from bough to bough  the rooting also of trees is a circumstance on which their beauty greatly depends i know not whether it is reckoned among the maladies of a tree to heave his root above the soil old trees generally do but whether it be a malady or not it is certainly very picturesque the more they raise the ground around them and the greater number of radical knobs they heave up the firmer they seem to establish their footing upon the earth and the more dignity they assume an old tree rising tamely from a smooth surface as we often find it covered with earth in artificial ground loses half it is effect it does not appear as the lord of the soil but to be stuck into it and would have a still worse effect on canvas than it has in nature  pliny gives us an account of the roots of certain ancient oaks in the hercynian forest which appears rather extravagant but which i can easily conceive may be true these roots he says heave the ground upwards in many places into lofty mounts and in other parts where the earth does not follow them the bare roots rise as high as the lower branches and twisting round form in many places portals so wide that a man and horse may ride upright through them not hist book xvi chap     this indeed is somewhat higher than picturesque beauty requires it borders rather on the fantastic in general however the higher the roots are the more picturesque they appear  to the adventitious beauties of trees we may add their susceptibility of motion which is capable at least of being a considerable source of beauty the waving heads of some and the undulation of others give a continual variety to their forms in nature the motion of trees is certainly a circumstance of great beauty  shakespeare formerly made the observation  things in motion sooner catch the eye than what stirs not    to the painter also the moving tree affords often a piece of useful machinery when he wishes to express the agitation of air in this light it may even be considered as an objection to trees of firmer branches as the oak that their resistance to every breath of air deprives them at least of one source of beauty and subjects them to be sooner gotten by heart if i may so phrase it than other trees which yielding to the pressure are every instant assuming new modifications  from the motion of the tree we have also the pleasing circumstance of the chequered shade formed under it by the dancing of the sunbeams among it is playing leaves this circumstance tho not so much calculated for picturesque use as it is beauty arises chiefly from it is motion is yet very amusing in nature and may also be introduced in painting when the tree is at rest but it is one of those circumstances which requires a very artful pencil in it is very nature it opposes the grand principle of massing light and shade however if it be brought in properly and not suffered to glare it may have it is beauty but whatever becomes of this circumstance in painting it is very capable of being pleasingly wrought up in poetry  the chequered earth seems restless as a flood brushed by the winds so sportive is the light shot through the boughs it dances as they dance shadow and sunshine intermingling quick and darkning and enlightening as the leaves play wanton every part  sect iv having thus examined trees in a general view i shall now particularize and endeavor to explain the beauties and defects of their several kinds as they regard landscape i shall first consider them as individuals and afterward in composition  trees range under two general heads deciduous and evergreen in this order i shall take them confining my remarks to those only of both kinds which are of english growth whether native or naturalized  among deciduous trees the oak presents itself first it is a happiness to the lovers of the picturesque that this noble plant is as useful as it is beautiful from the utility of the oak they derive this advantage that it is every where found in the choice indeed of it is soil it is rather delicate for tho it is rather undistinguishing during it is early growth while it is horizontal fibers straggle about the surface of the earth yet when it is taproot begins to enter the depths of the soil perhaps no tree is nicer in it is discriminations if it is constitution be not suited here it may multiply it is progeny indeed and produce a thriving copse but the puny race will never rise to lordly dignity in the forest nor furnish navies to command the ocean  the particular and most valued qualities of the oak are hardness and toughness shakespeare uses two epithets to express these qualities which are perhaps stronger than any we can find  thou rather with thy sharp and sulfurous bolt splitst the unwedgeable and gnarled oak than the soft myrtle  many kinds of wood are harder as box and ebony many kinds are tougher as yew and ash but it is supposed that no species of wood at least no species of timber is possessed of both these qualities together in so great a degree as british oak almost all arts and manufactures are indebted to it but in shipbuilding and bearing burdens it is elasticity and strength are applied to most advantage i mention these mechanic uses only because some of it is chief beauties are connected with them thus it is not the erect stately tree that is always the most useful in shipbuilding but more often the crooked one forming short turns and elbows which the shipwrights and carpenters commonly call kneetimber this too is generally the most picturesque  nor is it the strait tall stem whose fibers run in parallel lines that is the most useful in bearing burdens but that whose sinews are twisted and spirally combined this too is the most picturesque trees under these circumstances generally take the most pleasing forms  now the oak perhaps acquires these different modes of growth from the different strata through which it passes in deep rich soils where the root meets no obstruction the stem we suppose grows stately and erect but when the root meets with a rocky stratum a hard and gravelly bed or any other difficulty through which it is obliged in a zigzag course to pick it is way and struggle for a passage the sympathetic stem feeling every motion pursues the same indirect course above which the root does below and thus the sturdy plant through the means of these subterraneous incounters and hardy conflicts assumes form and character and becomes in a due course of centuries a picturesque tree  virgil has given us the picture of an oak in which it is principal characteristics are well touched  esculus imprimis quae quantum vertice ad auras aethereas tantum radice in tartara tendit ergo non hiemes illam non flabra neque imbres convellunt immota manet multosque per annos multa virum volvens durando secula vincit tum fortes late ramos et brachia tendens huc illuc media ipsa ingentem sustinet umbram georg ii   0  i shall not enter into a criticism on the word esculus which cannot on any good authority i think signify the beech and plinys authority which i insert below pliny speaking of the different kinds of trees which were dedicated to different deities tells us jovi esculus apolloni laurus etc lib xii c   now we know that the oak was jupiters tree on this point i need only quote phaedrus olim quas vellent esse in tutela sua divi legerunt arbores quercus jovi et myrtus veneri placuit  pliny also in another place lib xvi c   plainly distinguishes between the fagus and the esculus fagi glans triangula cute includitur folium tenue populo simile celerrime flavescens etc glandem quae proprie intelligitur ferunt robur quercus esculus continetur hispido calyce folia sinuosa lateribus nec cum cadunt flavescentia ut fagi glans optima in quercu et grandissima mox esculo from this quotation it is plain that pliny considers the esculus as a variety of the oak  may be decisive in favor of it is being the oak but were it not so virgils description is so strongly marked with the characters of the oak that it seems to put the matter out of dispute and i introduce the quotation merely to bring together in few words the most obvious qualities of this noble plant in one point of view  the first characteristic which virgil mentions is it is firmness or the power and strength with which it takes hold of the ground driving it is taproot in the poets language even into the infernal regions no tree resists the blast so steadily we seldom see the oak like other trees take a twisted form from the winds media ipsa ingentem sustinet umbrum that is i apprehend it preserves it is balance which we have seen is one of the grand picturesque beauties of every tree the oak no doubt like other trees shrinks from the seaair but this indicates no weakness the seaair like a pestilential disease attacks the strongest constitutions  a second characteristic of the oak of which virgil takes notice is the stoutness of it is limbs it is fortes ramos we know no tree except perhaps the cedar of lebanon so remarkable in this respect the limbs of most trees spring from the trunk in the oak they may be rather said to divide from it for they generally carry with them a great share of the substance of the stem you hardly know which is stem and which is branch and toward the top the stem is entirely lost in the branches this gives particular propriety to the epithet fortes in characterizing the branches of the oak and hence it is sinewy elbows are of such peculiar use in shipbuilding whoever therefore does not mark the fortes ramos of the oak might as well in painting a hercules omit his muscles but i speak only of the hardy veterans of the forest in the effeminate nurslings of the grove we have not this appearance there the tree is all stem drawn up into height when we characterize a tree we consider it in it is natural state insulated and without any lateral pressure in a forest trees naturally grow in that manner the seniors depress all the juniors that attempt to rise near them but in a planted grove all grow up together and none can exert any power over another  the next characteristic of the oak taken notice of by the poet is the twisting of it is branches brachia tendit huc illuc examine the ash the elm the beech or almost any other tree and you may observe in what direct and strait lines the branches in each shoot from the stem whereas the limbs of an oak are continually twisting huc illuc in various contortions and like the course of a river sport and play in every possible direction sometimes in long reaches and sometimes in shorter elbows there is not a characteristic more peculiar to the oak than this  another peculiarity of which virgil takes notice in the oak is it is expansive spread media ipsa ingentem sustinet umbram by ingentem umbram i do not suppose the poet means a thick compact closewoven foliage like that of the beech which the oak seldom exhibits in general except in very luxuriant soils the foliage of the oak is light and thin i should therefore suppose that instead of a closewoven shade the poet means an extended one which indeed is implied in the expression just before used ramos late tendens this indeed is a just characteristic of the oak for it is boughs however twisted continually take a horizontal direction and overshadow a large space of ground indeed where it is fond of it is situation and has room to spread it extends itself beyond any other tree and like a monarch takes possession of the soil  the last virgilian characteristic of the oak is it is longevity which extends i suppose beyond that of any other tree multa virum volvens durando secula vincit perhaps the yew may be an exception i mention the circumstance of it is longevity as it is of a nature singularly picturesque it is through age that the oak acquires it is greatest beauty which often continues increasing even into decay if any proportion exists between the stem and the branches when the branches rot away and the forlorn trunk is left alone the tree is in his decrepitude  the last stage of life and all beauty is gone  spenser has given us a good picture of an oak just verging toward it is last state of decay   a huge oak dry and dead sill clad with relics of it is trophies old lifting to heaven it is aged hoary head whose foot on earth has got but feeble hold and half disbowelled stands above the ground with wreathed roots and naked arms and trunk all rotten and unsound i have dwelt the longer on the oak as it is confessedly both the most picturesque tree in itself and the most accommodating in composition it refuses no subject either in natural or in artificial landscape it is suited to the grandest and may with propriety be introduced into the most pastoral it adds new dignity to the ruined tower and gothic arch by stretching it is wild mossgrown branches athwart their ivyed walls it gives them a kind of majesty coeval with itself at the same time it is propriety is still preserved if it throw it is arms over the purling brook or the mantling pool where it beholds it is reverend image in the expanse below milton introduces it happily even in the lowest scene hard by a cottage chimney smokes from between two aged oaks   after the oak let us examine the ash this tree in point of utility is little inferior to the oak it is uses are infinite to the ashen spear the heroes of antiquity were indebted for half their prowess in the arts of peace as well as of war in architecture tillage and manufactures the ash objects to business of no kind while even it is very refuse spars are accounted the best fuel in the forest in some parts of the continent of europe the ashen billet sells for one half more than any other wood except beech  the ashen billet produces a steady bright lambent flame and as mr evelin tells us may be reckoned among the  fuel with little smoke  i have sometimes heard the oak called the hercules of the forest and the ash the venus the comparison is not amiss for the oak joins the idea of strength to beauty while the ash rather joins the ideas of beauty and elegance virgil marks the character of the ash as particularly beautiful  fraxinus in sylvis pulcherrima  the ash generally carries it is principal stem higher than the oak and rises in an easy flowing line but it is chief beauty consists in the lightness of it is whole appearance it is branches at first keep close to the trunk and form acute angles with it but as they begin to lengthen they generally take an easy sweep and the looseness of the leaves corresponding with the lightness of the spray the whole forms an elegant depending foliage nothing can have a better effect than an old ash hanging from the corner of a wood and bringing off the heaviness of the other foliage with it is loose pendent branches and yet in some soils i have seen the ash lose much of it is beauty in the decline of age it is foliage becomes rare and meagre and it is branches instead of hanging loosely often start away in disagreeable forms in short the ash often loses that grandeur and beauty in old age which the generality of trees and particularly the oak preserve till a late period of their existence  the ash also on another account falls under the displeasure of the picturesque eye it is leaf is much tenderer than that of the oak and sooner receives impression from the winds and frost instead of contributing it is tint therefore in the wane of the year among the manycoloured offspring of the woods it shrinks from the blast drops it is leaf and in each scene where it predominates leaves wide blanks of desolated boughs amidst foliage yet fresh and verdant before it is decay we sometimes see it is leaf tinged with a fine yellow well contrasted with the neighboring greens but this is one of natures casual beauties much oftener it is leaf decays in a dark muddy unpleasing tint and yet sometimes notwithstanding this early loss of it is foliage we see the ash in a sheltered situation when the rains have been abundant and the season mild retain it is green a light pleasant green when the oak and the elm in it is neighborhood have put on their autumnal attire  another disagreeable circumstance attends the ash which is indeed it is misfortune rather than it is fault it is leaf and rind are nutritrive to deer and much used in browzing them in summer the keepers of the forest therefore seek out all the ashtrees they can find which are for this purpose mangled and deformed  one thing more i should mention with regard to the ash as it is of a picturesque nature and that is the beauty of it is roots which are often finely veined and will take a good polish dr plot in his natural history of oxfordshire chap vi sec  0  speaks of certain knotty excrescences in the ash called the brusca and mollusca which when cut and polished are very beautiful he particularly mentions a dining table made of the latter which represents the exact figure of a fish  with regard to these exact figures of animals and other objects which we meet with both in stone and wood i cannot say i should value them much as objects of beauty they may be whimsical and curious but in my opinion the roots and veins of wood and stone are much more beautiful when they are wreathed in different fantastic forms than when they seem to aim at any exact figures in the former case they leave the imagination at liberty to play among them which is always a pleasing exercise to it in the latter they are at best awkward and unnatural likenesses which often disgust the picturesque eye and always please it less than following it is own fancy and picking out resemblances of it is own  another curiosity in the ash which is likewise of the picturesque kind is a sort of excrescence which is sometimes found on a leading branch called a wreathed fascia the fasciated branch is twisted and curled in a very beautiful form which form it probably takes as dr plot supposes from too quick an ascent of the sap see not hist oxf chapter vi sec     or as other naturalists imagine from the puncture of some insect in the tender twig which diverts the sap from it is usual channel and makes the branch monstrous the wreathed fascia is sometimes found in other wood in the willow particularly and in the holly but most commonly is an excrescence of the ash i have a fasciated branch of ash found in the woods of beaulieu in newforest which is most elegantly twisted in the form of a crozier i have seen a holly also twisted like a rams horn we have this appearance sometimes in asparagus  it is not uncommon for the seeds of trees and particularly of the ash to seize on some faulty part of a neighboring trunk and there strike root dr plot see not hist oxf chapter vi sec    speaks of a piece of vegetable violence of this kind which is rather extraordinary an ashkey rooting itself on a decayed willow and finding as it increased a deficiency of nourishment in the mother plant it began to insinuate it is fibers by degrees through the trunk of the willow into the earth there receiving an additional recruit it began to thrive and expand itself to such a size that it burst the willow in pieces which fell away from it and what was before the root of the ash being now exposed to the air became the solid trunk of a vigorous tree  as a beautiful variety of the tree we are now examining the mountainash often called the roan tree should be mentioned it is name denotes the place of it is usual residence inured to cold and rugged scenes it is the hardy inhabitant of the northern parts of this island sometimes it is found in softer climes but there it generally discovers by it is stunted growth that it does not occupy the situation it loves  in ancient days when superstition held that place in society which dissipation and impiety now hold the mountainash was considered as an object of great veneration often at this day a stump of it is found in some old burying place or near the circle of a druid temple whose rites it formerly invested with it is sacred shade it is chief merit now consists in being the ornament of landscape in the scottish highlands it becomes a considerable tree there on some rocky mountain covered with dark pines and waving birch which cast a solemn gloom over the lake below a few mountainashes joining in a clump and mixing with them have a fine effect in summer the light green tint of their foliage and in autumn the glowing berries which hang clustering upon them contrast beautifully with the deeper green of the pines and if they are happily blended and not in too large a proportion they add some of the most picturesque furniture with which the sides of those rugged mountains are invested  after the oak and ash we examine the elm the oak and the ash have each a distinct character the massy form of the one dividing into abrupt twisting irregular limbs yet compact in it is foliage and the easy sweep of the other the simplicity of it is branches and the looseness of it is hanging leaves characterize both these trees with so much precision that at any distance at which the eye can distinguish the form it may also distinguish the difference the elm has not so distinct a character it partakes so much of the oak that when it is rough and old it may easily at a little distance be mistaken for one tho the oak i mean such an oak as is strongly marked with it is peculiar character can never be mistaken for the elm this is certainly a defect in the elm for strong characters are a great source of picturesque beauty  this defect however appears chiefly in the skeleton of the elm in full foliage it is character is better marked no tree is better adapted to receive grand masses of light in this respect it is superior both to the oak and the ash nor is it is foliage shadowing as it is of the heavy kind it is leaves are small and this gives it a natural lightness it commonly hangs loosely and is in general very picturesque  the elm naturally grows upright and when it meets with a soil it loves rises higher than the generality of trees and after it has assumed the dignity and hoary roughness of age few of it is forestbrethren tho properly speaking it is not a forester excel it in grandeur and beauty  the elm is the first tree that salutes the early spring with it is light and cheerful green  a tint which contrasts agreeably with the oak whose early leaf has generally more of the olivecast we see them sometimes in fine harmony together about the end of april and the beginning of may we often also see the elm planted with the scotch fir in the spring it is light green is very discordant with the gloomy hue of it is companion but as the year advances the elmleaf takes a darker tint and unites in harmony with the fir  in autumn also the yellow leaf of the elm mixes as kindly with the orange of the beech the ocher of the oak and many of the other fading hues of the wood  a species of this tree called the wichelm is perhaps generally more picturesque than the common sort as it hangs more negligently tho at the same time with this negligence it loses in a good degree that happy surface for catching masses of light which we admire in the common elm we observe also when we see this tree in company with the common elm that it is bark is somewhat of a lighter hue the wichelm is a native of scotland where it is found not only in the plains and valleys of the lowlands but is hardy enough to climb the steeps and flourish in the remotest highlands tho it does not attain in those climates the size which it attains in england naturalists suppose the wichelm to be the only species of this tree which is indigenous to our island  there is another variety also of this tree called the weeping elm whether it is timber is less useful or it is propagated with greater difficulty i know not but i have rarely met with it the finest of this species i have seen grow in st johns walks at cambridge an eye accustomed to the tree will easily perceive that it is branches are more pensile and it is leaves of smaller dimensions than those of the common elm  an old elm which grew formerly in the grove at magdalen college in oxford was by some accident disbarked entirely round a malady of this kind is generally reckoned fatal to all the vegetable race but this tree flourished after it as well as any tree in the grove the probable reasons of this uncommon appearance are given us by the learned author of the natural history of oxfordshire in a long philosophical enquiry which may be found in the    th page of that work i have heard also but i know not on what authority of another disbarked elm growing at this time vigorously at kensington  the oak the ash and the elm are commonly dignified in our english woods as a distinct class by the title of timber trees but the picturesque eye scorns the narrow conceptions of a timbermerchant and with equal complacency takes in the whole offspring of the wood tho it must be owned the three species already characterized are both the most useful and the most picturesque we esteem it fortunate when the idea of picturesque beauty coincides with that of utility the two ideas are often at variance when they are so we cannot help it but must feel it with regret  after timber trees the beech deserves our notice some indeed rank the beech among timber trees but i believe in general it does not find that respect as it is wood is of a soft spungy nature sappy and alluring to the worm  in point of picturesque beauty i am not inclined to rank the beech much higher than in point of utility it is skeleton compared with that of the trees we have just examined is very deficient it is trunk we allow is often highly picturesque it is studded with bold knobs and projections and has sometimes a sort of irregular fluting about it which is very characteristic it has another peculiarity also which is sometimes pleasing that of a number of stems arising from the root the bark too wears often a pleasant hue it is naturally of a dingy olive but it is always overspread in patches with a variety of mosses and lychens which are commonly of a lighter tint in the upper parts and of a deep velvetgreen toward the root it is smoothness also contrasts agreeably with these rougher appendages no bark tempts the lover so much to make it the depository of his mistresss name it conveys a happy emblem  crescent illae crescetis amores  but having praised the trunk we can praise no other part of the skeleton the branches are fantastically wreathed and disproportioned twining awkwardly among each other and running often into long unvaried lines without any of that strength and firmness which we admire in the oak or of that easy simplicity which pleases in the ash in short we rarely see a beech well ramified in full leaf it is equally unpleasing it has the appearance of an overgrown bush virgil indeed was right in choosing the beech for it is shade no tree forms so complete a roof if you wish either for shade or shelter you will find it best  patulae sub tegmine fagi  this bushiness gives a great heaviness to the tree which is always a deformity what lightness it has disgusts you will sometimes see a light branch issuing from a heavy mass and tho such pendent branches are often beautiful in themselves they are seldom in harmony with the tree they distinguish however it is character which will be seen best by comparing it with the elm the elm forms a rounder the beech a more pointed foliage but the former is always in harmony with itself  sometimes however we see in beeches of happy composition the foliage falling in large flocks or layers elegantly determined between which the shadows have a very forcible effect especially when the tree is strongly illumined on the whole however the massy fullgrown luxuriant beech is rather a displeasing tree it is made up of littlenesses seldom exhibiting those tufted cups or hollow dark recesses which dispart the several grand branches of the more beautiful kinds of trees  contrary to the general nature of trees the beech is most pleasing in it is juvenile state as it has not yet acquired that heaviness which is it is most faulty distinction a light airy young beech with it is spiry branches hanging as i have just described them in easy forms is often beautiful i have seen also the forestbeech in a dry hungry soil preserve the lightness of youth in the maturity of age  after all however we mean not to repudiate even the heavy luxuriant beech in picturesque composition it has sometimes it is beauty and oftener it is use in distance it preserves the depth of the forest we call the forest deep when we cannot see through it so that at a distance a thin wood of beeches will have the effect of a large one  and even on the spot in contrast it is frequently a choice accompaniment in the corner of a landscape when we want a thick heavy tree or part of one at least which is often necessary nothing answers our purpose like the beech  but at present we are not considering the beech in composition but only as an individual and in this light it is in which we chiefly conceive it as an object of disapprobation  we should not conclude our remarks on the beech without mentioning it is autumnal hues in this respect it is often beautiful sometimes it is dressed in modest brown but generally in glowing orange and in both dresses it is harmony with the grove is pleasing about the end of september when the leaf begins to change it makes a happy contrast with the oak whose foliage is yet verdant some of the finest oppositions of tint which perhaps the forest can furnish arise from the union of oak and beech we often see a wonderful effect from this combination and yet accommodating as it is leaf is in landscape on handling it feels as if it were fabricated with metallic rigor in it is autumnal state it almost crackles  leni crepitabat bractea vento for this reason i suppose as it is rigor gives it an elastic quality the common people in france and switzerland use it for their beds  i have dwelt the longer on the beech as notwithstanding my severity it is a tree of picturesque fame and i did not choose to condemn without giving my reasons it has acquired it is reputation i suppose chiefly from it is having a peculiar character and this with all it is defects it certainly has i may add also that if objects receive merit from their associated as well as from their intrinsic qualities the dry soil and salubrious air in which the beech generally flourishes give it a high degree of estimation  very nearly allied to the beech in a picturesque light is the hornbeam it grows like it when it is suffered to grow but it is generally seen only in clipped hedges where it is very obedient to the knife and with a little care will never presume to appear out of form it is wood is white tough and flexible  the deciduous trees which i have described hold certainly the first rank i shall however touch on a few others which tho neither so beautiful nor so characteristic are however worth the notice of the picturesque eye  among these the first place is due to two noble trees of the same kind both naturalized in england  tho from different extremes of the globe  the occidental and the oriental plane  the occidental plane is a native of america but has long been known in england where it attains a considerable growth tho inferior no doubt to what it attains in it is native soil it is stem is very picturesque it is smooth and of a light ash color and has the property of throwing off it is bark in scales thus naturally cleansing itself at least it is larger boughs from moss and other parasitical encumbrances this would be no recommendation of it in a picturesque light if the removal of these encumbrances did not substitute as great a beauty in their room these scales are very irregular falling off sometimes in one part and sometimes in another and as the underbark is immediately after it is excoriation of a lighter hue than the upper it offers to the pencil those smart touches which have so much effect in painting these flakes however would be more beautiful if they fell off in a circular form instead of a perpendicular one they would correspond and unite better with the circular form of the bole  no tree forms a more pleasing shade than the occidental plane it is fullleafed and it is leaf is large smooth of a fine texture and seldom injured by insects it is lower branches shooting horizontally soon take a direction to the ground and the spray seems more sedulous than that of any tree we have by twisting about in various forms to fill up every little vacuity with shade at the same time it must be owned the twisting of it is branches is a disadvantage to this tree as we have just observed it is to the beech when it is stripped of it is leaves and reduced to a skeleton  it has not the natural appearance which the spray of the oak and that of many other trees discovers in winter nor indeed does it is foliage from the largeness of the leaf and the mode of it is growth make the most picturesque appearance in summer  one of the finest occidental planes i am acquainted with stands in my own garden at vicarshill where it is boughs feathering to the ground form a canopy of above fifty feet in diameter  the oriental plane is a tree nearly of the same kind only it is leaf is more palmated nor has it so great a disposition to overshadow the ground as the occidental plane at least i never saw any in our climate form so noble a shade tho in the east it is esteemed among the most shady and most magnificent of trees lady craven speaks of some she saw in the turkish dominions of a size so gigantic that the largest trees we have in england placed near them would appear she says only like broomsticks letter      this tree i believe sheds it is bark like the occidental plane and the catkins of both are round spicated balls about the size of walnuts and fastened together often in pairs like chainshot from this circumstance the occidental plane is called in america the buttontree it flourishes there commonly by the sides of creeks and rivers and is of quick growth the oriental plane i believe loves the same soil at least both trees in england are fond of moist ground  kempfer tells us see p      that at jedo the capital of japan he found a species of this tree the leaves of which were beautifully variegated like the tricolor with red green and yellow an appearance of this kind is so contrary to natures usual mode of coloring the leaves of foresttrees that i should rather suspect kempfer saw it either when the leaves were in the wane or blasted or in some other unnatural state  i may add with regard to the occidental plane and indeed i believe with regard to both the trees of this species that their summer leaf wears so light a hue as to mix ill with the foliage of the oak the elm and other trees i have seen them on the skirts of a plantation forming during the summer a disagreeable spot in autumn their leaves receive a mellow tint which harmonizes very well with the waning color of the wood  the poplar tribe shall be considered next they are numerous and some of them i have thought picturesque they are at least stately trees but their thin quivering foliage is neither adapted to catch masses of light like that of the elm nor has it the hanging lightness of the ash it is chief use in landscape is to mix as a variety in contrast with other trees  within these few years the lombardypoplar which graces the banks of the po has been much introduced in english plantatations it seems to like a british soil and it is youth is promising but i have never seen it in full maturity it is conic form as a deciduous tree is peculiar among evergreens we find the same character in the cypress and both trees in many situations have a good effect the cypress often among the ruins of ancient rome breaks the regularity of a wall or a pediment by it is conic form and the poplar on the banks of the po no doubt has the same effect among it is deciduous brethren by forming the apex of a clump tho i have been told that in it is age it loses it is shape in some degree and spreads more into a head the oldest poplars of this kind i have seen are at blenheim they are not old trees but are very tall and i believe still preserve their spiry form  one beauty the italian poplar possesses which is almost peculiar to itself and that is the waving line it forms when agitated by wind most trees in this circumstance are partially agitated one side is at rest while the other is in motion but the italian poplar waves in one simple sweep from the top to the bottom like an ostrichfeather on a ladys head all the branches coincide in the motion and the least blast makes an impression upon it when other trees are at rest i have mentioned among the adventitious beauties of trees their susceptibility of motion see page  0 but in painting i know not that i should represent any kind of motion in a tree except that of a violent storm when the blast continues for some time when the black heavens are in unison with it and help to tell the story an oak straining in the wind is an object of picturesque beauty but when the gentle breeze pressing upon the quivering poplar bends it only in easy motion while a serene sky indicates the heavens to be at peace there is nothing to act in concert with the motion of the tree it seems to have taken it is form from the influence of a sea air or some other malign impression and exhibiting an unnatural appearance disgusts  one thing more i should mention with regard to the italian poplar which is that although it sometimes has a good effect when standing single it generally has a better when two or three are planted in a clump  the walnut is not an unpicturesque tree the warm russet hue of it is young foliage makes a pleasing variety among the vivid green of other trees about the end of may and the same variety is maintained in summer by the contrast of it is yellowish hue when mixed in any quantity with trees of a darker tint but it opens it is leaves so late and drops them so early that it cannot long be in harmony with the grove it stands best alone and the early loss of it is foliage is of the less consequence as it is ramification is generally beautiful  the lime is an elegant tree where it is suffered to grow at large but we generally see it in strait bondage clipped into shape and forming the sides of avenues and vistas in it is best state however it is not very picturesque it has a uniformity of surface without any of those breaks and hollows which the foliage of the most picturesque trees presents and which is always beautiful  one circumstance should recommend the lime to all lovers of the imitative arts no wood is so easily formed under the carvers chissel it is the wood which the ingenious gibbon used after making trial of several kinds as the most proper for that curious sculpture which adorns some of the old houses of our nobility  the maple is an uncommon tree tho a common bush it is wood is of little value and it is therefore rarely suffered to increase we seldom see it employed in any nobler service than in filling up it is part in a hedge in company with thorns and briars and other ditch trumpery yet the ancients held it in great repute pliny see plin not hist lib xvi chapter    speaks as highly of the knobs and excrescences of this tree called the brusca and mollusca as dr plot does of those of the ash see page    see also plin not hist lib xiii chapter     the veins of these excrescences in the maple pliny tells us were so variegated that they exceeded the beauty of any other wood even of the citron tho the citron was in such repute at rome that cicero who was neither rich nor expensive was tempted to give ten thousand sesterces for a citron table the brusca and mollusca pliny adds were rarely of size sufficient for the larger species of furniture but in all smaller cabinet work they were inestimable but indeed the whole tree was esteemed by the ancients on account of it is variegated wood in ovid we find it thus celebrated  acerque coloribus impar met lib x v    how far at this day it may be valued for cabinet work i know not i have here and there seen boxes and other little things made of it which i have thought very beautiful  in the few instances i have met with of this tree in a state of maturity it is form has appeared picturesque it is not unlike the oak only it is more bushy and it is branches closer and more compact one of the largest maples i have seen stands in the churchyard of boldre in the newforest but i have not met with specimens enough of this tree to form an opinion of it is general character  the great maple commonly called the sycamore is a grander and nobler tree than the smaller maple but it wants it is elegance it is coarse in proportion to it is bulk it forms however an impenetrable shade and often receives wellcontrasted masses of light it is bark has not the furrowed roughness of the oak but it has a species of roughness very picturesque in itself it is smooth but it peels off in large flakes like the planes to which in other respects it bears a near alliance leaving patches of different hues seams and cracks which are often picturesque  the chestnut in maturity and perfection is a noble tree and grows not unlike the oak it is ramification is more straggling but it is easy and it is foliage loose this is the tree which graces the landscapes of salvator rosa in the mountains of calabria where salvator painted the chestnut flourished there he studied it in all it is forms breaking and disposing it in a thousand beautiful shapes as the exigences of his composition required i have heard indeed that it is naturally brittle and liable to be shattered by winds which might be one reason for salvators attachment to it  but although i have many times seen the chestnut in england old enough to be in a fruitbearing state yet i have seldom seen it in a state of full picturesque maturity the best i have seen stand on the banks of the tamer in cornwall at an old house belonging to the edgecumbe family i have heard also that at beechworthcastle in surry there are not fewer than seventy or eighty chestnuts measuring from twelve to eighteen or twenty feet in girth and some of them of very picturesque form but i saw them only at a distance in kent also the chestnut is frequently found  it is said indeed that this tree was once very common in england and that beams of it are often seen at this day in churches and old houses in the belfry particularly of the church at sutton near mitcham in surry i have seen beams which are like oak yet plainly appear to be of a different kind of timber and are supposed to be chestnut i have often heard also that the timber of the old houses of london was of the same kind whether the chestnut was ever indigenous to this country seems to be matter of much speculation as it is timber is said to be serviceable and as it is fruit tho rarely of perfect growth in this climate might however be of some use we are at a loss to conceive if it had once gotten footing amongst us how it should ever be as it now is almost totally exterminated some have endeavored to account for this by showing that it is not so good a timbertree as is supposed for it decays at the heart and will continue decaying till it become merely a shell and for this reason it has been less sought after and encouraged how far this may be true i know not i rather suspect it is truth some years ago mr daines barrington read a paper to the royal society in which he endeavored to prove that the chestnut was not indigenous to this country dr ducarel answered him and alleged from ancient records and other evidenees that chestnut formerly abounded in many woody scenes in england and was certainly a native of this island among the ancient records to which he appeals one is dated in the time of henry ii it is a deed of gift from that prince to flexley abbey of the tithe of all his chestnuts in the forest of dean see four letters on chesnuttrees read before the royal society        the horsechesnut is a heavy disagreeable tree it forms it is foliage generally in a round mass with little appearance of those breaks which we have so often admired and which contribute to give an airiness and lightness at least a richness and variety to the whole mass of foliage this tree is however chiefly admired for it is flower which in itself is beautiful but the whole tree together in flower is a glaring object totally unharmonious and unpicturesque in some situations indeed and among a profusion of other wood a single chestnut or two in bloom may be beautiful as it forms an admirable shade it may be of use too in thickening distant scenery or in skreening an object at hand for there is no species of foliage however heavy nor any species of bloom however glaring which may not be brought by some proper contrast to produce a good effect  the weeping willow is a very picturesque tree it is a perfect contrast to what we have just observed of the lombardy poplar the light airy spray of the poplar rises perpendicularly that of the weeping willow is pendent the shape of it is leaf is conformable to the pensile character of the tree and it is spray which is still lighter than that of the poplar is more easily put into motion by a breath of air the weeping willow however is not adapted to sublime subjects we wish it not to skreen the broken buttresses and gothic windows of an abbey nor to overshadow the battlements of a ruined castle these offices it resigns to the oak whose dignity can support them the weeping willow seeks a humbler scene  some romantic footpath bridge which it half conceals  or some glassy pool over which it hangs it is streaming foliage  and dip it is pendent boughs stooping as if to drink in these situations it appears in character and of course to advantage  i have heard indeed that the weeping willow is not naturally an aquatic plant but it is being commonly believed to be so is ground enough to establish it as such in landscape at least tho not in botany  the weeping willow is the only one of it is tribe that is beautiful botanists i believe enumerate sixteen species of the willow but tho i have seen some of them attain a very remarkable size yet in general they are trees of straggling ramification and without any of that elegant streaming form which we admire in the weeping willow i should rarely therefore advise their use in artificial landscape except as pollards to characterize a marshy country or to mark in a second distance the winding banks of a heavy lowsunk river which could not otherwise be noticed some willows indeed i have thought beautiful and fit to appear in the decoration of any rural scene the kind i have most admired has a small narrow leaf and wears a pleasant light sea green tint which mixes agreeably with foliage of a deeper hue i am not acquainted with the botanical name of this species but i believe the botanists call it the salix alba  the withy or salix fragilis is the most inconsiderable of it is tribe like others of it is kindred it will grow in any soil tho it loves a moist one it is of little value in landscape and yet there is something beautiful in it is silvercoated catkins which open as the year advances into elegant hanging tufts and when the tree is large and in full bloom make a beautiful variety among the early productions of the spring  nearly related to the willow tribe tho in nature rather than in form is the alder they both love a low moist soil and frequent the banks of rivers tho it may be alleged in favor of both that they will flourish in the poorest forest swamps where nothing else will grow the alder is however the more picturesque tree both in it is ramification and in it is foliage perhaps indeed it is the most picturesque of any of the aquatic tribe except the weeping willow he who would see the alder in perfection must follow the banks of the mole in surry through the sweet vales of dorking and mickleham into the groves of esher the mole indeed is far from being a beautiful river it is a silent and sluggish stream but what beauty it has it owes greatly to the alder which every where fringes it is meadows and in many places forms very pleasing scenes especially in the vale between boxhill and the high grounds of norburypark  some of the largest alders we have in england grow in the bishop of durhams park at bishopaukland the generality of trees acquire picturesque beauty by age but it is not often that they are suffered to attain this picturesque period some use is commonly found for them long before that time the oak falls for the greater purposes of man and the alder is ready to supply a variety of his smaller wants an old tree therefore of any kind is a curiosity and even an alder such as those at bishopaukland when dignified by age makes a respectable figure  the birch may have several varieties with which i am not acquainted the most common species of it in england are the black and the white the former is a native of canada the latter of britain of the white birch there is a very beautiful variety sometimes called the ladybirch or the weepingbirch it is spray being slenderer and longer than the common sort forms an elegant pensile foliage like the weeping willow and like it is put in motion by the least breath of air when agitated it is well adapted to characterize a storm or to perform any office in landscape which is expected from the weeping willow  the stem of the birch is generally marked with brown yellow and silvery touches which are peculiarly picturesque as they are characteristic objects of imitation for the pencil and as they contrast agreeably with the dark green hue of the foliage but only the stem and larger branches have this varied coloring the spray is of a deep brown which is the color too of the larger branches where the external rind is peeled off as the birch grows old it is bark becomes rough and furrowed it loses all it is varied tints and assumes a uniform ferruginous hue  the bark of this tree has the property perhaps peculiar to itself of being more firm and durable than the wood it invests of this the peasants of sweden lapland and other northern countries where birch grows in abundance take the advantage and shaping it like tiles cover their houses with it  how very durable it is we have a remarkable instance in monsieur maupertuiss travels when that philosopher traversed lapland to measure a degree of latitude he was obliged to pass through vast forests consisting entirely of birch the soil in some parts of these wastes being very shallow or very loose the trees had not a sufficient footing for their roots and became an easy prey to winds in these places maupertuis found as many trees blown down as standing he examined several of them and was surprised to see that in such as had lain long the subtance of the wood was entirely gone but the bark remained a hollow trunk without any signs of decay  among elegant pendent trees the acacia should not be forgotten tho the acacia which we have in england called by the botanist the robinia is perhaps only a poor substitute of this plant in it is greatest perfection and yet even ours when we have it full grown is often a very beautiful tree whether it feathers to the ground as it sometimes does or whether it is adorned with a light foliage hanging from the stem but it is beauty is very frail it is of all trees the least able to endure the blast in some sheltered spot it may ornament a garden but it is by no means qualified to adorn a country it is wood is of so brittle a texture especially when it is encumbered with a weight of foliage that you can never depend upon it is aid in filling up the part you wish the branch you admire today may be demolished tomorrow the misfortune is the acacia is not one of those grand objects like the oak whose dignity is often increased by ruin it depends on it is beauty rather than on it is grandeur which is a quality much more liable to injury  i may add however in it is favor that if it be easily injured it repairs the injury more quickly than any other tree few trees make so rapid a growth  in one of the memoirs published by the agricultural society at paris the virtues of this tree are highly extolled it is shade encourages the growth of grass it is roots are so tenacious of the soil and shoot up such groves of suckers that when planted on the banks of rivers it contributes exceedingly to fix them as barriers against the incursions of the stream acaciastakes too are as durable as those of any wood in north america this tree is much valued in proof of which the memorialist tells a story of a farmer in long island who planted an ordinary field of fourteen acres with suckers of this plant in the year of his marriage as a portion for his children his eldest son married at twentytwo on this occasion the farmer cut about three hundred pounds worth of timber out of his acacia wood which he gave his son to buy a settlement in lancaster county three years after he did as much for a daughter and thus he provided for his whole family the wood in the mean time repairing by suckers all the losses it received  i shall conclude my account of deciduous trees with the larch which is a kind of connecting species between them and the race of evergreens tho it sheds it is leaf with the former it bears a cone is resinous and ramifies like the latter it claims the alps and apennines for it is native country where it thrives in higher regions of the air than any tree of it is consequence is known to do hanging over rocks and precipices which have never been visited by human feet often it is felled by the alpine peasant and thrown athwart some yawning chasm where it affords a tremendous passage from cliff to cliff while the cataract roaring many fathoms below is seen only in surges of rising vapor  in ancient times the larch was employed in still more arduous service when hannibal laid the cliffs bare and heaped up piles of timber to melt the rocks so livy tells us the larch was his fuel it is unctuous sides soon spread the flame and as the gloom of evening came on the appendages of a numerous host elephants and floating banners and gleaming arms formed terrific images through the night while the lofty summits of the alps were illumined far and wide  strabo speaks of alpine trees which most probably were larches of a very great size many of them he says would measure eight feet in diameter lib iv p  0   and at this day masts of single larches measuring from one hundred and ten to one hundred and twenty feet in length have been floated from valais through the lake of geneva and down the rhone to toulon tho i have heard they are in no great esteem among the contractors for the french dockyards  in the memoirs of the royal society of agriculture at paris for the year      there is an essay by m le president de la tour daigues on the culture of the larch in which it is celebrated as one of the most useful of all timber trees he tells us that in his own garden he has rails which were put up in the year      partly of oak and partly of larch the former he says have yielded to time but the latter are still sound and in his castle of tour daigues he has larchen beams of twenty inches square which are sound tho above two hundred years old the finest trees he knows of this kind grow in some parts of dauphiny and in the forest of baye in provence where there are larches he tells us which two men cannot fathom  i have often heard that old dry larch will take such a polish as to become almost transparent and that in this state it may be wrought into very beautiful wainscot  in my encomium of the larch i must not omit that the old painters used it more than any other wood to paint on before the use of canvas became general many of raphaels pictures are painted on boards of larch  the larch we have in england compared with the larch of the alps is a diminutive plant it is little more than the puny inhabitant of a garden or the embellishment of some trifling artificial scene the characters of grand and noble seldom belong to it it is however an elegant tree tho in our soil at least too formal in it is growth among it is native steeps it is form no doubt is fully picturesque when the storms of many a century have shattered it is equal sides and given contrast and variety to it is boughs  from deciduous trees we proceed to evergreens  of these the cedar of lebanon claims our first notice to it preeminence belongs not only on account of it is own dignity but on account of the respectable mention which is every where made of it in scripture solomon spoke of trees from the cedar of lebanon to the byssop that springs out of the wall that is from the greatest to the least  the eastern writers are indeed the principal sources from which we are to obtain the true character of the cedar as it is an eastern tree in the sacred writers particularly we are presented with many noble images drawn from it is several qualities it is generally employed by the prophets to express strength power and longevity the strength of the cedar is used as an emblem to express the power even of jehovah the voice of the lord breaks the cedars of lebanon david characterizes the palm tree and the cedar together both very strongly the righteous shall flourish like a palm tree and spread abroad like a cedar of lebanon the flourishing head of the palm and the spreading abroad of the cedar are equally characteristic  but the prophet ezekiel has given us the fullest description of the cedar  behold the assyrian was a cedar in lebanon with fair branches and with a shadowing shroud and of an high stature and his top was among the thick boughs his boughs were multiplied and his branches became long the fir trees were not like his boughs nor the chestnut trees like his branches nor any tree in the garden of god like unto him in beauty ezekiel xxxi   in this description two of the principal characteristics of the cedar are marked  the first is the multiplicity and length of his branches few trees divide so many fair branches from the main stem or spread over so large a compass of ground his boughs are multiplied as ezekiel says and his branches became long which david calls spreading abroad  the second characteristic is what ezekiel with great beauty and aptness calls his shadowing shroud no tree in the forest is more remarkable than the cedar for it is closewoven leafy canopy  ezekiels cedar is marked as a tree of full and perfect growth from the circumstance of it is top being among the thick boughs almost every young tree and particularly every young cedar has what is called a leading branch or two which continue spiring above the rest till the tree has attained it is full size then the tree becomes in the language of the nurseryman clumpheaded but in the language of eastern sublimity it is top is among the thick boughs that is no distinction of any spiry head or leading branch appears the head and the branches are all mixed together this is generally in all trees the state in which they are most perfect and most beautiful  but tho ezekiel has given us this accurate description of the cedar he has left it is strength which is it is chief characteristic untouched but the reason is evident the cedar is here introduced as an emblem of assyria which tho vast and widespreading and come to full maturity was in fact on the eve of destruction strength therefore was the last idea which the prophet wished to suggest strength is a relative term compared with opposition the assyrian was strong compared with the powers on earth but weak compared with the arm of providence which brought him to destruction so his type the cedar was stronger than any of the trees of the forest but weak in comparison with the ax which cut him off and left him as the prophet expresses the vastness of his ruin spread upon the mountains and in the valleys while the nations shook at the sound of his fall  such is the grandeur and form of the cedar of lebanon it is mantling foliage or shadowing shroud as ezekiel calls it is it is greatest beauty which arises from the horizontal growth of it is branches forming a kind of sweeping irregular penthouse and when to the idea of beauty that of strength is added by the piramidal form of the stem and the robustness of the limbs the tree is complete in all it is beauty and majesty  in these climates indeed we cannot expect to see the cedar in such perfection the forest of lebanon is perhaps the only part of the world where it is growth is perfect yet we may in some degree conceive it is beauty and majesty from the paltry resemblances of it at this distance from it is native soil in it is youth it is often with us a vigorous thriving plant and if the leading branch is not bound to a pole as many people deform their cedars but left to take it is natural course and guide the stem after it in some irregular waving line it is often an object of great beauty but in it is maturer age the beauty of the english cedar is generally gone it becomes shrivelled deformed and stunted it is body increases but it is limbs shrink and wither thus it never gives us it is two leading qualities together in it is youth we have some idea of it is beauty without it is strength and in it is advanced age we have some idea of it is strength without it is beauty the imagination therefore by joining together the two different periods of it is age in this climate may form some conception of the grandeur of the cedar in it is own climate where it is strength and beauty are united  the best specimen of this tree i ever saw in england was at hillington near uxbridge the perpendicular height of it was fifty three feet it is horizontal expanse ninety six and it is girth fifteen and a half when i saw it in      it was about one hundred and eighteen years of age and being then completely clumpheaded it was a very noble and picturesque tree  in the high winds about the beginning of the year    0 this noble cedar was blown down it is stem when cut was five feet in diameter  after the cedar the stonepine deserves our notice it is not indigenous to our soil but like the cedar it is in some degree naturalized tho in england it is rarely more than a puny halfformed resemblance of the italian pine the soft clime of italy alone gives birth to the true picturesque pine there it always suggests ideas of broken porticos ionic pillars triumphal arches fragments of old temples and a variety of classic ruins which in italian landscape it commonly adorns  the stone pine promises little in it is infancy in point of picturesque beauty it does not like most of the firspecies give an early indication of it is future form in it is youth it is dwarfish and roundheaded with a short stem and has rather the shape of a fullgrown bush than of an increasing tree  as it grows older it does not soon deposit it is formal shape it is long a bush tho somewhat more irregular and with a longer stem  but as it attains maturity it is picturesque form increases fast it is lengthening stem assumes commonly an easy sweep it seldom indeed deviates much from a strait line but that gentle deviation is very graceful and above all other lines difficult to imitate if accidentally either the stem or any of the larger branches take a larger sweep than usual that sweep seldom fails to be graceful  it is also among the beauties of the stonepine that as the lateral branches decay they leave generally stumps which standing out in various parts of the stem break the continuity of it is lines  the bark is smoother than that of any other tree of the pinekind except the weymouth tho we do not esteem this among it is picturesque beauties it is hue however which is warm and reddish has a good effect and it obtains a kind of roughness by peeling off in patches  the foliage of the stonepine is as beautiful as the stem it is color is a deep warm green and it is form instead of breaking into acute angles like many of the pinerace is molded into a flowing line by an assemblage of small masses  as age comes on it is round clumphead becomes more flat spreading itself into a canopy which is a form equally becoming and yet i doubt whether any resinous tree ever attains that picturesque beauty in age which we admire so much in the oak the oak continues long vigorous in his branches tho his trunk decays but the resinous tree i believe decays more equally through all it is parts and in age oftener presents the idea of vegetable decrepitude than of the stout remains of a vigorous constitution and yet in many circumstances even in this state it may be an object of picturesque notice  thus we see in the form of the stonepine what beauty may result from a tree with a round head and without lateral branches which requires indeed a good example to prove when we look at an ash or an elm from which the lateral branches have been stripped as is the practice in some countries we are apt to think that no tree with a head placed on a long stem can be beautiful yet in natures hands which can mould so many forms of beauty it may easily be effected  nature herself however does not always follow the rules of picturesque beauty in the production of this kind of object the cabbagetree i suppose is as ugly as the stone pine is picturesque  the best specimen of the stonepine i ever saw grows in the botanical garden at oxford  the most beautiful succedaneum of the stonepine which these climates afford is the pinaster the sweep of it is stem is similar it is broken lateral branches likewise and it is clumphead both trees also are equally irregular in their growth but the pinaster is perhaps more picturesque in the roughness of it is darkgrey bark on no trees have i seen broader and better varied masses of light and shade but the closeness of the pinasters foliage makes it is head sometimes too heavy  the cluster pine also is a beautiful tree and approaches perhaps as near the stonepine as the pinaster does but i scarce recollect ever to have seen it in a state of full maturity and perfection if we may judge however from a growth of thirty or forty years at which age i have often seen it it shoots in so wild and irregular a manner so thick rich and bushy that we may easily conceive how picturesque a plant it must be in a state of full perfection it is cones too which it bears in clusters from whence it derives it is name are a great ornament to it in composition indeed such minutiae are of little value but we are now considering trees as individuals  the weymouthpine has very little picturesque beauty to recommend it it is admired for it is polished bark the painters eye pays little attention to so trivial a circumstance even when the tree is considered as a single object nay it is polished bark rather depreciates it is value for the picturesque eye dwells with more pleasure on rough surfaces than on smooth it sees more richness in them and more variety but we object chiefly to the weymouthpine on account of the regularity of it is stem and the meagreness of it is foliage it is stem rises with perpendicular exactness it rarely varies and it is branches issue with equal formality from it is sides it is foliage too is thin and wants both richness and effect  if i were speaking indeed of this tree in composition i might add that it may often appear to great advantage in a plantation contrast we know produces beauty even from deformity itself opposed therefore to the wildness of other trees the regularity of the weymouthpine may have it is beauty it is formality may be concealed a few of it is branches hanging from a mass of heavier foliage may appear light and feathery while it is spiry head may often form an agreeable apex to a clump  having thus considered the pinerace we next take a view of a tribe nearly allied to them  that of firs in what the distinction between these two tribes consists tho i apprehend it consists in little more than in that between genus and species the botanist will explain i profess myself an observer only of outward characters what we usually call the scotch fir appears to me to approach nearer the pine in it is manner of growth than it does any of it is nominal class as this tree therefore seems to be of ambiguous nature at least as to it is form i shall place it here  that is immediately after the pines and before the firs that it may with facility join one party or the other as the readers botanical principles incline  the scotch fir in perfection i think a very picturesque tree tho we have little idea of it is beauty it is generally treated with great contempt it is a hardy plant and therefore put to every servile office if you wish to skreen your house from the south west wind plant scotch firs and plant them close and thick if you want to shelter a nursery of young trees plant scotch firs and the phrase is you may afterward weed them out as you please this is ignominious i wish not to rob society of these hardy services from the scotch fir nor do i mean to set it in competition with many of the trees of the forest which in their infant state it is accustomed to shelter all i mean is to rescue it from the disgrace of being thought fit for nothing else and to establish it is character as a picturesque tree for myself i admire it is foliage both the color of the leaf and it is mode of growth it is ramification too is irregular and beautiful and not unlike that of the stone pine which it resembles also in the easy sweep of it is stem and likewise in the color of the bark which is commonly as it attains age of a rich reddish brown the scotch fir indeed in it is stripling state is less an object of beauty it is pointed and spiry shoots during the first years of it is growth are formal and yet i have sometimes seen a good contrast produced between it is spiry points and the roundheaded oaks and elms in it is neighborhood when i speak however of the scotch fir as a beautiful individual i conceive it when it has outgrown all the improprieties of it is youth  when it has completed it is full age  and when like ezekiels cedar it has formed it is head among the thick branches  i may be singular in my attachment to the scotch fir i know it has many enemies but my opinion will weigh only with the reasons i have given  the great contempt indeed in which the scotch fir is commonly held arises i believe from two causes  people object first to it is color it is dark murky hue is unpleasing  with regard to color in general i think i speak the language of painting when i assert that the picturesque eye makes little distinction in this matter it has no attachment to one color in preference to another but considers the beauty of all coloring as resulting not from the colors themselves but almost entirely from their harmony with other colors in their neighborhood so that as the fir tree is supported combined or stationed it forms a beautiful umbrage or a murky spot  a second source of that contempt in which the scotch fir is commonly held is our rarely seeing it in a picturesque state scotch firs are seldom planted as single trees or in a judcious group but generally in close compact bodies in thick array which suffocates or cramps them and if they ever get loose from this bondage they are already ruined their lateral branches are gone and their stems are drawn into poles on which their heads appear stuck as on a center whereas if the tree had grown in it is natural state all mischief had been prevented it is stem would have taken an easy sweep and it is lateral branches which naturally grow with as much beautiful irregularity as those of deciduous trees would have hung loosely and negligently and the more so as there is something peculiarly light and feathery in it is foliage i mean not to assert that every scotch fir tho in a natural state would possess these beauties but it would at least have the chance of other trees and i have seen it tho indeed but rarely in such a state as to equal in beauty the most elegant stonepine  all trees indeed crowded together naturally rise in perpendicular stems but the fir has this peculiar disadvantage that it is lateral branches once injured never shoot again a grove of crowded saplins elms beeches or almost of any deciduous trees when thinned will throw out new lateral branches and in time recover a state of beauty but if the education of the fir has been neglected he is lost for ever  some of the most picturesque trees of this kind perhaps in england adorn mr lenthalls deserted and ruinous mansion of basilsleigh in berkshire the soil is a deep but rich sand which seems to be a soil adapted to them and as they are here at perfect liberty they not only become large and noble trees but they expand themselves likewise in all the careless forms of nature no man therefore has a right to depreciate the scotch fir till he has seen it here or in some other place in a perfect state of nature  the spruce fir is generally esteemed a more beautiful and elegant tree than the scotch fir and the reason i suppose is because it often feathers to the ground and grows in a more exact and regular shape but this is a principal objection to it it often wants both form and variety we admire it is floating foliage in which it sometimes exceeds all other trees but it is rather disagreeable to see a repetition of these feathery strata beautiful as they are reared tier above tier in regular order from the bottom of a tree to the top it is perpendicular stem also which has seldom any lineal variety makes the appearance of the tree still more formal  it is not always however that the spruce fir grows with so much regularity sometimes a lateral branch here and there taking the lead beyond the rest breaks somewhat through the order commonly observed and forms a few chasms which have a good effect when this is the case the spruce fir ranks among picturesque trees sometimes it has as good an effect and in many circumstances a better when the contrast appears still stronger  when the tree is shattered by some accident has lost many of it is branches and is scathed and ragged a feathery branch here and there among broken stumps has often an admirable effect but it must arise from some particular situation in all circumstances however the spruce fir appears best either as a single tree or unmixed with any of it is fellows for neither it nor any of the spearheaded race will ever form a beautiful clump without the assistance of other trees  the silverfir has very little to boast in point of picturesque beauty it has all the regularity of the spruce but without it is floating foliage there is a sort of harsh stiff unbending formality in the stem the branches and in the whole economy of the tree which makes it disagreeable we rarely see it even in the happiest state assume a picturesque shape assisted it may be in it is form when broken and shattered but it will rarely get rid of it is formality in old age it stands the best chance of attaining beauty we sometimes see it under that circumstance a noble shattered tree finely adorned with ivy and shooting out a few horizontal branches on which it is meagre foliage and tufted moss appear to advantage  i may add that the silver fir is perhaps the hardiest of it is tribe it will outface the southwest wind it will bear without shrinking even the seaair so that one advantage at least attends a plantation of silver firs you may have it where you can have no other and a plantation of silver firs may be better than no plantation at all  i know of no other species of fir in england that is worth mentioning the hemlockspruce is a beautiful loose plant but it never i believe attains any size and the newfoundland or black spruce is another dwarfish tree in that character however it is often beautiful and it is small red cones are an ornament to it  in the vast pineforests of north america and in those which hang beetling over the cliffs of the baltic the picturesque eye might probably see many a grand production of the fir kind which is hitherto little known or if known would appear there in so improved a character as to seem wholly new in the northern parts of asia also and in the southern parts of africa i doubt not but the fir may be found in great variety and perfection in philips voyage to botanybay we are told of pines in norfolkisland one hundred and eighty feet high as i recollect but i have not the book by me strabo indeed tells us that the fir is wholly a european plant  that it is never to be met with in any part of asia  and that it may even be considered in all those places where europe and asia border on each other as a distinguishing mark of european ground on the asiatic side of the tanais he tells us it is never found tho on the european side it is so common that the scythians who inhabit those parts use it always in making arrows he treats eratosthenes with some contempt for asserting that when alexander was in india he used fir in constructing his navy see lib ii p   0 edit cause  strabos accuracy is generally much respected but in this instance his observations seem to have been confined there is little doubt i think that the fir abounded in many parts of asia it was probably as much a native of mount lebanon as the cedar itself after all however it is probable that the word  which the latins translate abies and we translate fir might appear to be somewhat very different from the tree which we call a fir if we had a grecian botanist to consult   after the pine and fir tribes the yew deserves our notice the yew is a pure native of britain and was formerly what the oak is now the basis of our strength of it the old english yeoman made his longbow which he vaunted nobody but an englishman could bend in shooting he did not as in other nations keep his left hand steady and draw his bow with his right but keeping his right at rest upon the nerve he pressed the whole weight of his body into the horns of his bow hence probably arose the english phrase of bending a bow and the french of drawing one  nor is the yew celebrated only for it is toughness and elasticity but also for it is durable nature where your paling is most exposed either to winds or springs strengthen it with a post of old yew that hardy veteran fears neither storms above nor damps below it is a common saying amongst the inhabitants of newforest that a post of yew will outlast a post of iron  thus much for the utility and dignity of the yew as to it is picturesque perfections i profess myself contrary i suppose to general opinion a great admirer of it is form and foliage the yew is of all other trees the most tonsile hence all the indignities it suffers we every where see it cut and metamorphosed into such a variety of deformities that we are hardly brought to conceive it has a natural shape or the power which other trees have of hanging carelessly and negligently yet it has this power in a very eminent degree and in a state of nature except in exposed situations is perhaps one of the most beautiful evergreens we have indeed i know not whether all things considered it is not superior to the cedar of lebanon itself  i mean to such meagre representations of that noble plant as we have in england the same soil which cramps the cedar is congenial to the yew  it is but seldom however that we see the yew in perfection in newforest it formerly abounded but it is now much scarcer it does not rank among timber trees and being thus in a degree unprivileged and unprotected by forestlaws it has often been made booty of by those who durst not lay violent hands on the oak or the ash but still in many parts of the forest some noble specimens of this tree are left one i have often visited which is a tree of peculiar beauty it immediately divides into several massy limbs each of which hanging in grand loose foliage spreads over a large compass of ground and yet the whole tree forms a close compact body that is it is boughs are not so separated as to break into distinct parts it cannot boast the size of the yewtree at fotheringal near taymouth in scotland which measures fiftysix feet and an half in circumference nor indeed the size of many others on record but it has sufficient size for all the purposes of landscape and in point of picturesque beauty it probably equals any of them it stands not far from the banks of lymington river on the left bank as you look toward the sea between roydonfarm and boldrechurch it occupies a small knoll surrounded with other trees some of which are yews but of inferior beauty a little stream washes the base of the knoll and winding round forms it into a peninsula if any one should have curiosity to visit it from this description and by the help of these landmarks i doubt not but he may find it at any time within the space of these two or three centuries in great perfection if it suffer no external injury if such trees were common they would recover the character of the yewtree among the admirers of picturesque beauty  but tho we should be able to establish it is beauty with respect to form and foliage there remains one point still which we should find it hard to combat it is color unfortunately gives offense it is dingy funerial hue people say makes it fit only for a churchyard  this objection i hope i have already answered in defending the color of the scotch fir see page     an attachment to color as such seems to me an indication of false taste hence arise the numerous absurdities of gaudy decoration in the same manner a dislike to any particular color shows a squeamishness which should as little be encouraged indeed when you have only one color to deal with as in painting the wainscot of your room the eye properly enough gives a preference to some soft pleasant tint in opposition to a glaring bold one but when colors act in concert as is the case in all scenery red blue yellow light green or dingy green are all alike the virtue of each consists solely in it is agreement with it is neighbors  i have only to add in commendation of this tree that it is veins exceed in beauty those of most other trees tables made of yew when the grain is fine are much superior to mahogany and it is root vies in beauty with the ancient citron  the ilex or evergreen oak presents a character very different from that of the yew the yew is a close bodied compact tree the ilex is generally thin and straggling tho we sometimes see it in soils which it likes form a thicker foliage both the yew and the ilex are beautiful but in different ways as an individual the yew is greatly superior it is an object to admire the beauty of the ilex arises chiefly from situation and contrast  under this head may be classed another oak nearly an evergreen a late production of singular origin called the luccamoak from the person who raised it it was produced from an acorn of the common turkeyoak from which all the luccamoaks have been grafted as i understand the seed of accidental varieties never produce the same plant i have heard much of the beauty of this tree and of the acquisition it will be to winterscenery by the introduction of a new and beautiful evergreen it may be so it is growth i am told is rapid but from the few plants i have seen of this stock and those but young no judgment can well be formed  the holly can hardly be called a tree tho it is a large shrub it is a plant however of singular beauty mr evelin in his sylva cries out with rapture is there under heaven a more glorious and refreshing object of the kind than an impenetrable hedge of about four hundred feet in length nine feet high and five in diameter which i can show in my gardens at sayscourt at any time of the year glittering with it is armed and varnished leaves the taller standards at orderly distances blushing with their natural coral  shorn and fashioned into columns and pilasters architectionally shaped at due distance  tho we cannot accord with the learned naturalist in the whole of this rapturous encomium on the hedge at sayscourt yet in part we agree with him and admire as much as he does the holly glittering with it is armed and varnished leaves and blushing with it is natural coral but we could wish to recommend it not in a hedge but in a forest where mixed with oak or ash or other trees of the wood it contributes to form the most beautiful scenes blending itself with the trunks and skeletons of the winter or with the varied greens of summer  but in it is combined state we shall have occasion hereafter to mention it at present we shall only observe that as far as an individual bush can be beautiful the holly is extremely so it has besides to recommend it that it is among the hardiest and stoutest plants of english growth it thrives in all soils and in all situations at dungeness in kent i have heard it flourishes even among the pebbles of the beach  the hawthorn should not entirely be passed over amidst the minuter plants of the forest tho it has little claim to picturesque beauty in song indeed the shepherd may with propriety  tell his tale under the hawthorn in the dale but when the scenes of nature are presented to the eye it is but a poor appendage  it is shape is bad it does not taper and point like the holly but is rather a matted round heavy bush it is fragrance indeed is great but it is bloom which is the source of that fragrance is spread over it in too much profusion it becomes a mere white sheet  a bright spot which is seldom found in harmony with the objects around it in autumn the hawthorn makes it is best appearance it is glowing berries produce a rich tint which often adds great beauty to the corner of a wood or the side of some crowded clump  sect v we have thus endeavored to mark the principal characteristics of picturesque beauty in the most common trees we have in england but to have a more accurate idea of their nice peculiarities and distinctions we should examine their smaller parts with a little more precision  their ramification in winter as well as the mass of foliage which they exhibit in summer  their ramification in part we have already considered but it has only been that of the larger boughs which support the foliage and such as we commonly see under the masses of it when in full leaf winter discovers the nicer parts of the ramification  the little tender spray on which the hanging of the foliage and the peculiar character of the tree so much depend  the study is certainly useful it is true it has none of the larger parts of painting for it is object  composition  or the massing of light and shade but we consider the spray as a kind of sylvan anatomy which is very necessary for those to understand who wish either to be acquainted with the particular character of each tree or to represent it is general effect with any degree of exactness  nor is it an unpleasing study there is much variety in the ramification of each species and much also in that of each individual we see every where so many elegant lines so much opposition and rich intersection among them that there are few more beautiful objects in nature than the ramification of a tree for myself i am in doubt whether an old rough interwoven oak merely as a single object has not as much beauty in winter as in summer in summer it has unquestionably more effect but in point of simple beauty and amusement i think i should almost prefer it in winter  if a man were disposed to moralize the ramification of a thriving tree affords a good theme nothing gives a happier idea of busy life industry and activity pervade every part wherever an opening how minute soever appears there some little knot of busy adventurers push in and form a settlement so that the whole is every where full and complete there too as is common in all communities are many little elbowings justlings thwartings and oppositions in which some gain and others lose as a continuation of this moralizing strain the following short allegory ventures to appear in a note  ut sylvae foliis pronos mutantur in annos prima cadunt ita  debemur morti nos nostraque  as i sat carelessly at my window and threw my eyes upon a large acacia which grew before me i conceived it might aptly represent a country divided into provinces towns and families the larger branches might hold out the first  the smaller branches connected with them the second  and those combinations of collateral leaves which specify the acacia might represent families composed of individuals  it was now late in the year and the autumnal tint had taken possession of great part of the tree  as i sat looking at it many of the yellow leaves which having been produced earlier decayed sooner were continually dropping into the lap of their great mother here was an emblem of natural decay  the most obvious appearance of mortality  as i continued looking a gentle breeze rusled among the leaves many fell which in a natural course might have enjoyed life longer here malady was added to decay  the blast increased and every branch that presented itself bowed before it a shower of leaves covered the ground the cup of vengeance said i is poured out upon the people pestilence shakes the land nature sickens in the gale they fall by multitudes whole families are cut off together  among the branches was one entirely withered the leaves were shrivelled yet clinging to it  here was an emblem of famine the nutriment of life was stopped existence was just supported but every form was emaciated and shrunk  in the neighborhood stretched a branch not only shrivelled and withered but having been more exposed to winds was stripped almost entirely of it is leaves here and there hung a solitary leaf just enough to show that the whole had lately been alive ah said i here is an emblem of depopulation some violent cause has laid waste the land towns and villages as well as families are desolated scarce ten are left to bemoan a thousand  how does every thing around us bring it is lesson to our minds nature is the great book of god in every page is instruction to those who read mortality must claim it is due death in various shapes hovers round us  thus far went the heathen moralist he had learned no other knowledge from these perishing forms of nature but that men like trees are subject to death  ita debemur morti nos nostraque  better instructed learn thou a nobler lesson learn that that god who with the blast of winter shrivels the tree and with the breezes of spring restores it offers it to thee as an emblem of thy hopes the same god presides over the natural and moral world his works are uniform the truths which nature teaches as far as they go are the truths of revelation also it is written in both these books that that power which revives the tree will revive thee also like it with increasing perfection     in examining the spray of trees i shall confine myself to the oak the ash the elm and the beech it would be endless to run through the whole forest nor is it necessary the examination of these few principal trees will show how consequential a part the spray is in fixing the character of the tree there is as much difference in the spray as there is in the foliage or in any other particular at the same time if a painter be accurate in a certain degree in his delineation of some of the more capital trees in others his accuracy is of little consequence nay an endeavor at precision would be stiff and pedantic  in the spray of the four species of trees just mentioned and i doubt not in that of all other trees nature seems to observe one simple principle which is that the mode of growth in the spray corresponds exactly with that of the larger branches of which indeed the spray is the origin thus the oak divides his boughs from the stem more horizontally than most other deciduous trees the spray makes exactly in miniature the same appearance it breaks out in right angles or in angles that are nearly so forming it is shoots commonly in short lines the second years shoot usually taking some direction contrary to that of the first thus the rudiments are laid of that abrupt mode of ramification for which the oak is so remarkable when two shoots spring from the same knot they are commonly of unequal length and one with large strides generally takes the lead very often also three shoots and sometimes four spring from the same knot hence the spray of this tree becomes thick close and interwoven so that at a little distance it has a full rich appearance and spray of the oak  ramification of the oak  spray of the ash  ramification of the ash  more of the picturesque roughness than we observe in the spray of any other tree the spray of the oak generally springs from the upper or the lateral parts of the bough and it is this which gives it is branches that horizontal appearance which they generally assume  the spray of the ash is very different as the boughs of the ash are less complex so is it is spray instead of the thick intermingled bushiness which the spray of the oak exhibits that of the ash is much more simple running in a kind of irregular parallels the main stem holds it is course forming at the same time a beautiful sweep but the spray does not divide like that of the oak from the extremity of the last years shoot but springs from the sides of it two shoots spring out opposite to each other and each pair in a contrary direction rarely however both the shoots of either side come to maturity one of them is commonly lost as the tree increases or at least makes no appearance in comparison with the other which takes the lead so that notwithstanding this natural regularity of growth so injurious to the beauty of the spruce fir and some other trees the ash never contracts the least disgusting formality from it it may even receive great picturesque beauty for sometimes the whole branch is lost as far as one of the lateral shoots and this occasions a kind of rectangular junction which forms a beautiful contrast with the other spray and gives an elegant mode of hanging to the tree  this points out another difference between the spray of the oak and that of the ash the spray of the oak we observed seldom shoots from the undersides of the larger branches and it is this together with the strength and firmness of the branches which keeps them in a horizontal form but the spray of the ash as often breaks out on the underside of the branch as on the upper and being of a texture weaker than that of the oak it generally as the bough increases depends below the larger branch and rising again forms in full grown trees especially very elegant pendent boughs  the branch of the elm has neither the strength nor the various abrupt twistings of spray of the elm  spray of the beech  ramification of the beech  the oak nor does it shoot so much in horizontal directions such also is the spray it has a more regular appearance not starting off at right angles but forming it is shoots more acutely with the parent branch  neither does the spray of the elm shoot like that of the ash in regular pairs from the same knot but in a kind of alternacy it has generally at first a flat appearance but as one years shoot is added to another it has not strength to support itself and as the tree grows old it often becomes pendent also like the ash whereas the toughness and strength of the oak enables it to stretch out it is branches horizontally to the very last twig  the spray of the beech observes the same kind of alternacy as that of the elm but it shoots in angles still more acute  the distance between each twig is wider and it forms a kind of zigzag in it is course  we esteem the beech also in some degree a pendent tree as well as the ash but there is a wide difference between them the ash is a light airy tree and it is spray hangs in elegant loose foliage but the hanging spray of the beech in old trees especially is often twisted and intermingled disagreeably and has a perplexed matted appearance the whole tree gives us something of the idea of an entangled head of bushy hair from which here and there hangs a disorderly lock while the spray of the ash like hair neither neglected nor finically nice has nothing squalid in it and yet hangs in loose and easy curls  the spray of trees puts on different appearances as the spring advances when their buds begin to swell most of them push out a bloom which overspreads them with great richness but of all others the ash presents the most singular and beautiful aspect about the end of march or the beginning of april it throws out a knotty bloom which opening gradually not only inriches the spray but is in itself one of the most beautiful among the minuter appearances of nature the feminal stems are of an olive tint and each of them tipped with a black seed  often too the spray of the ash is enriched by the ragged remnants of the keys and tongues of the last year which mixed with the bloom has a good effect  the elm too throws out a beautiful bloom in form of a spicated ball about the higness of a nutmeg of a dark crimson color this bloom sometimes blows in such profusion as to thicken and enrich the spray exceedingly even to the fullness almost of foliage it is not however often seen in such perfection in the spring of the year      it was more than commonly profuse indeed the bloom of foresttrees in general is rarely annual it appears in profusion only every second or third year and even then seldom all the trees of the same kind bloom at once thus when you look into a grove of oaks about the beginning of may you will suppose perhaps that some are much forwarder in leaf than others whereas in fact this appearance chiefly arises from their being in bloom their little pensile catkins hanging in knots adorned with tufts of young leaves  having thus made a few observations on the forms of trees their different modes of growth and other peculiarities i should add that i am far from supposing nature to act always in exact conformity to the appearances which i have here marked in the general mode of growth which each species observes no doubt she is uniform but in the particular manner in which the stem rises the branches shoot the foliage hangs and indeed if i may so speak in the specific character of each individual many circumstances will make a difference soils and climate especially these have the same effect on the form of trees which they have on the form of animals we not only see distant parts of the earth but even contiguous countries exhibit varieties in the same species of animals the english and scotch horse are very different creatures and as climates and soils are still more connected with trees than with animals we may observe a greater difference produced in them within a smaller distance the oak of one country differs in form from the oak of another in one it carries commonly an erect stem for many yards from the ground in another it is branches begin very quickly to divide and straggle in the former situation the foliage may be thick and interwoven in the latter it may be thin and meagre but in both situations you may easily distinguish it from the oak or the beech the observations therefore which we have made on the form of trees cannot in many minute circumstances be supposed to suit the individuals of every country tho i have endeavored as well as i could to adapt them to the species they were chiefly made on the trees of newforest in hampshire the soil of which in general is a hungry gravel or a cold clay  sect vi i should now dismiss the subject of trees as individuals and hasten to consider them in a combined state in which they will appear to most advantage but as many trees as well as men have distinguished themselves in the world it seemed proper to dedicate a few pages to the particular mention of such celebrated characters before i conclude that part of my treatise which is professedly written to do honor to single trees  but first it cannot be enough lamented by the lovers of landscape that we meet with so few of these noble characters trees indeed sufficient for all the purposes of distant scenery we often find but a tree in full perfection as a grand object to grace a foreground is rarely seen wherever trees can be turned to profit they are commonly cut down long before they attain picturesque perfection the beauty of almost every species of tree increases after it is prime and unless it have the good fortune to stand in some place of difficult access or under the protection of some patron whose mansion it adorns we rarely see it in that grandeur and dignity which it would acquire by age  some of the noblest oaks in england were at least formerly found in sussex they required sometimes a score of oxen to draw them and were carried in a sort of wain which in that deep country is expressively called a tugg two or three years was not an uncommon space of time for a tree to spend in performing it is journey to chatham one tugg carried the load but a little way and left it for another tugg to take up if the rains set in it stirred no more that year and sometimes no part of the next summer was dry enough for the tugg to proceed so that the timber was generally pretty well seasoned before it arrived at the kings yard i suppose the same mode of carriage still continues  in this fallen state alone it is true the tree becomes the basis of englands glory tho we regret it is fall therefore we must not repine but address the children of the wood as the gallant oak on his removal from the forest is said to have addressed the scion by his side  where thy great grandsire spread his awful shade a holy druid mystic circles made myself a sapling when thy grandsire bore intrepid edward to the gallic shore me now my country calls adieu my son and as the circling years in order run may thou renowned the forests boast and pride victorious in some future contest ride nobody that i know has more pathetically lamented the fall of trees than the elegant vanier whoever has a taste for the subject will be gratified by the following quotation   neque enim villis accedere major possit honos densa quam nubilus arbore lucus sylvarum studiosa suos cum gallia quondam vix aleret cives patria migrare relicta atque

rusticum lib v  as it is thus a general complaint that noble trees are rarely to be found we must seek them where we can and consider them when found as matters of curiosity and pay them a due respect  and yet i should suppose they are not so frequently found in a state of nature as in more cultivated countries in the forests of america and other scenes where boundless woods have filled the plains from the beginning of time and where they grow so close and cover the ground with so impervious a shade that even a weed can scarce rise beneath them the single tree is lost unless it stand on the outskirts of the wood it is circumscribed and has not room to expand it is vast limbs as nature directs when we wish therefore to find the most sublime sylvan character  the oak the elm or the ash in perfection we must not look for it in close thick woods but standing single independent of all connections as we sometimes find it in our own forests tho oftener in better protected places shooting it is head wildly into the clouds and spreading it is arms toward every wind of heaven   the oak thrives by the rude concussion of the storm he seems indignant and to feel the impression of the blast with proud disdain but deeply earthed the unconscious monarch owes his firm stability to what he scorns more fixed below the more disturbed above if i chose to lengthen my catalogue of celebrated trees i might produce an innumerable host of such as have been mentioned casually by historians and travelers in all ages as the planetree hanging over the temple of delphos which theophrastus supposes was as ancient as the times of agamemnon  that also by which socrates used to swear  the olive tree at linturnum planted by scipio africanus  the tilia of basil under which the german emperors used to dine  the malus medica at the monastery of fundi reverenced by thomas aquinas  the oak at bruges which francis the first immured  the limetree in sweden which gave name to the family of the celebrated linnaeus  trees which captain cook found in the western parts of california measuring sixty feet in circumference and rising to the height of one hundred and fifty feet without a single knot  solid trees which have been scooped into canoes capable of holding thirty or forty men particularly one on record at congo which held two hundred i might add also arthurs table in the town hall of winchester which has been cut out of a tree of immense girth the cheltenhamoak also might be introduced which as near it is roots as you can walk exceeds twenty paces round  the cawthorpe oak also which at the ground exceeded twentysix yards  the bentlyoak in holtforest which at seven feet from the ground was thirtyfour feet in circumference  the swilteroak in needwoodforest which i believe was equal to any of them many of these trees are mentioned by mr evelin and the rest are collected from the topographical remarks of travelers and historians  with an innumerable list of this kind i might swell my page but i reject all such trees as have either been only casually mentioned  or have had their value merely ascertained by a timbermerchants rule  and yet all these have been trees famous in their day some of them are still alive and if i were writing a biographical history of trees i should be glad to insert them having a reverence for them all where one tree attains this noble growth and makes itself conspicuous thousands and ten thousands reach only the ordinary size of nature the few pages however at present on my hands i should wish to allot to such trees only as have somewhat more of history and anecdote annexed to them  one of the most celebrated trees on ancient record was an oriental plane which grew in phrygia it is dimensions are not handed down to us but from the following circumstances we may suppose them to have been very ample when xerxes set out on his grecian expedition his rout led him near this noble tree xerxes it seems was a great admirer of trees amidst all his devastations in an enemys country it was his particular order to spare the groves this wonderful plane therefore struck his fancy he had seen nothing like it before and to the astonishment of all his officers ordered his mighty host to halt three days during which time he could not be drawn from the phrygian plane his pavilion was spread under it and he enjoyed the luxury of it is delicious shade while the greeks were taking measures to seize the pass at thermopyle  the story may not speak much in favor of the prince but it is my business only to pay honor to the tree this account is taken from elian   in arcadia at the foot of the mountains bounding the stymphalian plains famous for one of the labors of hercules stood the little town of caphiae and just above it rose a fountain called the menalaid fountain by the side of which pausanias tells us paus arcad c     grew a planetree of extraordinary size and beauty called the menalaidplane it was generally believed in the country he tells us that menelaus coming to caphiae to raise forces for the trojan war planted this tree with his own hands pausanias traveled through greece in the reign of antoninus pius who succeeded to the empire a d     so that the age of the tree when pausanias saw it must have been about one thousand three hundred years  i shall next exhibit another planetree of great celebrity which flourished in lycia during the reigns of the roman caesars from a vast stem it divided into several huge boughs every one of which had the consequence of a large tree and at a distance the whole together exhibited the appearance of a grove it is branches still flourished while it is trunk decayed this in process of time mouldered away into an immense cave at least eighty feet in circumference around the sides of which were placed seats of pumice stone cushioned softly with moss this tree was first brought into repute by licinius mutianus governor of lycia licinius was a curious man and not unversed in natural history pliny from whom we have the account of the tree has thought proper to quote him frequently mentioning particularly his remarks on egyptian paper lib xiii c     and also on that kind of wood of which the statue of diana at ephesus was made lib xvi c  0  with the lycianplane licinius was exceedingly pleased and often enjoyed the company of his friends under it is shade it was great luxury he would say to dine in it is trunk on a sultry summerday and to hear a heavy shower of rain descending through the several stages of it is leaves as a naturalist he left it on record that himself and eighteen other persons dined commodiously around the benches in the body of it  caligula had a tree of the same kind at his villa near velitrae but caligulas tree appears to have been more complex than the lycian plane it had not only a hollow cave in it is trunk which was capable of holding fifteen persons at dinner with a proper suit of the emperors attendants but if i understand pliny rightly lib xii c    it had stories also probably artificial flooring in the boughs of the tree caligula used to call it his nest  from the same author we have an account of four holm trees lib xvi c     still existing in his time which were of great antiquity three of them he says stood upon the site of the ancient tybur which was a city older than rome and these trees were not only older than tybur but were trees of consequence in the days of tiburtus who founded it for tradition assures us says pliny they were the very trees on which that hero observed an ominous flight of birds and was determined by them in the site of his town as tiburtus was the son of amphiareus who died at thebes a hundred years before the trojan war these trees at the lowest calculation must have been fourteen or fifteen hundred years old in the time of pliny tho this is far from being incredible yet as it rests wholly on tradition we pay it the less attention what pliny says in the favor of the fourth tree however has more weight this tree he tells us grew in the vatican and had it is age inscribed in old tuscan characters upon it is trunk from which inscription it appeared that before the city of rome had it is existence this holm was a celebrated tree  when tiberius built his naumachia and had occasion for large beams in several parts of his work he endeavored to collect them from the various forests of the empire among other massy pieces of timber which were brought to rome on this occasion the trunk of a larch was of so prodigious a size that the emperor instead of using it in his works ordered it to be laid up as a curiosity it measured one hundred and twenty feet in length and carried a diameter of two feet to the very end plin not hist l xvi c 0  when this larch was alive with all the furniture of it is vast top and gigantic limbs in proportion to such a trunk it must have been an astonishing tree  the largest tree that ever was known to be brought into britain formed the main mast of the royal sovereign in queen anns time it was ninety feet long and thirtyfive inches in diameter sylva p       mr evelin from whom we have this account mentions in the same place a still larger tree which formed the keel of the crown a french ship of the last century it was one hundred and twenty feet long which is the length of tiberiuss larch tho it had not probably the circumference of that tree  the masts of our ships of war at present are never made of single trees it is the method to lay two or three trees together and fitting them tight to each other to bind them close at proper distances with pitched ropes but a very noble fir was lately brought into england which was not spliced in the common mode but was converted in it is full dimensions into the bowsprit of the britannia a new ship of one hundred and ten guns in which capacity i have heard it serves at present this fir was ninetysix feet in length and had i believe the full diameter of tiberiuss larch  maundrel tells us that when he traveled into the east a few of the old cedars of lebanon were still left he found them among the snow near the highest part of the mountain i measured one of the largest of them says he and found it twelve yards six inches in girt and yet sound and thirtyseven yards in the spread of it is boughs at about five or six yards from the ground it divided into five limbs each of which was a massy tree  a later traveller van egmont who visited the scenes of mount lebanon seems also to speak of the same trees which maundrel mentions he observed them he says to be of very different ages the old standards had low stems growing like fruit trees whereas the younger made a much more stately appearance not a little resembling pines of the ancient trees he saw only eleven those of younger growth far exceeded that number some of these old cedars were four or five fathoms in circumference under one of them was erected an altar where the clergy of tripoly and the neighboring convent of massurki sometimes celebrated mass from this tree spread five limbs resembling substantial trees each being about an hundred feet in length and inserted into the main trunk about fourteen or fifteen feet from the ground  these are noble dimensions tho it is probable that the best of the trees now left upon mount lebanon are only the refuse of the ancient race as we may well suppose the best were occasionally taken first if solomons botanical works had still been preserved it is probable we should have met with trees of much larger dimensions than these which maundrel and van egmont measured  one of the noblest trees on record is a chestnut upon mount aetna called the castagna de cento cavalli it is still alive but has lost much of it is original dignity many travelers take notice of it brydone was the last who saw it his account is dated about sixteen or seventeen years ago it had then the appearance of five distinct trees the space within them he was assured had once been filled with solid timber when the whole formed only one tree the possibility of this he could not at first conceive for the five trees together contained a space of two hundred and four feet in diameter at length however he was convinced not only by the testimony of the country and the accurate examination of the canon recupero a learned naturalist in those parts but by the appearance of the trees themselves none of which had any bark on the inside this chestnut is of such renown that brydone tells us he had seen it marked in an old map of sicily published a hundred years ago see brydones trav vol i p       among other authors who mention this tree kircher gives us the following account of it is condition in his day which might be about a century before brydone saw it ostendit mihi viae dux unius castaniae corticem tantae magnitudinis ut intra eam integer pecorum grex a pastoribus tanquam in caula commodissima noctu intercluderetur from this account one should imagine that in kirchers days the five trees were more united than when brydone saw them  at newstadt in the duchy of wirtemberg stood a lime which was for many ages so remarkable that the city frequently took it is denomination from it being often called newstadt ander grassen linden or newstadt near the great lime scarce any person passed near newstadt without visiting this tree and many princes and great men did honor to it by building obelisks columns and monuments of various kinds around it engraved with their arms and names to which the dates were added and often some device mr evelin see ev sylva page      who procured copies of several of these monumental inscriptions tells us there were near two hundred of them the columns on which they were fixed served also to bear up the vast limbs of the tree which began through age to become unweildy thus this mighty plant stood many years in great state the ornament of the town the admiration of the country and supported as it were by the princes of the empire at length it felt the effects of war newstadt was surrounded by an enemy and the limbs of this venerable tree were mangled in wantonness by the besieging troops whether it still exist i know not but long after these injuries it stood a noble ruin discovering by the foundations of the several monuments which formerly propped it is spreading boughs how far it is limits had once extended  as a parallel to the lime of newstadt i shall next celebrate the lime of cleves this also was a tree of great magnificence it grew in an open plain just at the entrance of the city and was thought an object worthy to exercise the taste of magistracy the burgomaster of his day had it surveyed with great accuracy and trimmed into eight broad pyramidal faces each corner was supported by a handsome stone pillar and in the middle of the tree was cut a noble room which the vast space contained within easily suffered without injuring the regularity of any of the eight faces to crown all the top was curiously clipped into some kind of head and adorned artificially but in what manner whether with the head of a lion or a stag a weather cock or a sundial we are not told it was something however in the highest style of dutch taste  this tree was long the admiration and envy of all the states of holland and mr evelin from whom we have the relation seems to have thought it a piece of excellent workmanship i needed not says he have charged this paragraph with half these trees but to show how much more the limetree seems disposed to be wrought into these arborious wonders than other trees of slower growth sylva p       the oaks of chaucer are celebrated in the annals of poetry as the trees under which  the laughing sage carolled his moral song  they grew in the park at donningtoncastle near newbery where chaucer spent his latter life in studious retirement  the largest of these trees was called the kingsoak and carried an erect stem of fifty feet before it broke into branches and was cut into a beam five feet square  the next in size was called the queensoak and survived the calamities of the civil wars in king charless time tho donningtoncastle and the country around it were so often the scenes of action and desolation it is branches were very curious they pushed out from the stem in several uncommon directions imitating the horns of a ram rather than the branches of an oak when it was felled it yielded a beam forty feet long without knot or blemish perfectly strait four feet square at the butend and near a yard at the top  the third of these oaks was called chaucers of which we have no particulars in general only we are told that it was a noble tree tho inferior to either of the others see evelins sylva p      none of them i should suppose from this account was a tree of picturesque beauty a strait stem of forty or fifty feet let it is head be what it will can hardly produce a picturesque form when we admired the stonepine we supposed it is stem to take a sweeping line and to be broken also with stumps or decayed branches  close by the gate of the waterwalk at magdalen college in oxford grew an oak which perhaps stood there a saplin when alfred the great founded the university this period only includes a space of nine hundred years which is no great age for an oak it is a difficult matter indeed to ascertain the age of a tree the age of a castle or abbey is the object of history even a common house is recorded by the family that built it all these objects arrive at maturity in their youth if i may so speak but the tree gradually completing it is growth is not worth recording in the early part of it is existence it is then only a common tree and afterward when it becomes remarkable for it is age all memory of it is youth is lost this tree however can almost produce historical evidence for the age assigned to it about five hundred years after the time of alfred william of wainfleet dr stukely tells us expressly ordered his college to be founded near the great oak itiner curios  and an oak could not i think be less than five hundred years of age to merit that title together with the honor of fixing the site of a college when the magnificence of cardinal wolsey erected that handsome tower which is so ornamental to the whole building this tree might probably be in the meridian of it is glory or rather perhaps it had attained a green old age but it must have been manifestly in it is decline at that memorable era when the tyranny of james gave the fellows of magdalen so noble an opportunity of withstanding bigotry and superstition it was afterward much injured in charles iis time when the present walks were laid out it is roots were disturbed and from that period it declined fast and became reduced by degrees to little more than a mere trunk the oldest members of the university can scarce recollect it in better plight but the faithful records of history see dr plots hist of oxf chapter vi sect    have handed down it is ancient dimensions through a space of sixteen yards on every side from it is trunk it once flung it is boughs and under it is magnificent pavilion could have sheltered with ease three thousand men tho in it is decayed state it could for many years do little more than shelter some luckless individual whom the driving shower had overtaken in his evening walk in the summer of the year      this magnificent ruin fell to the ground alarming the college with it is rushing sound it then appeared how precariously it had stood for many years it is grand taproot was decayed and it had hold of the earth only by two or three roots of which none was more than a couple of inches in diameter from a part of it is ruins a chair has been made for the president of the college which will long continue it is memory  near worksop grew an oak which in respect both to it is own dignity and the dignity of it is situation deserves honorable mention in point of grandeur few trees equalled it it overspread a space of ninety feet from the extremities of it is opposite boughs these dimensions will produce an area capable on mathematical calculation of covering a squadron of two hundred and thirtyfive horse  the dignity of it is station was equal to the dignity of the tree itself it stood on a point where yorkshire nottinghamshire and derbyshire unite and spread it is shade over a portion of each from the honorable station of thus fixing the boundaries of three large counties it was equally respected through the domains of them all and was known far and wide by the honorable distinction of the shireoak by which appellation it was marked among cities towns and rivers in all the larger maps of england see evelins sylva p       in the garden at tortworth in glocestershire an old familyseat belonging to lord ducie grows a spanish chestnut of great age and dimensions traditional accounts suppose it to have been a boundarytree in the time of king john and i have met with other accounts which place it in the same honorable station in the reign of king stephen how much older it may be we know not considerably older it probably was for we rarely make boundarytrees of saplins and offsets which are liable to a thousand accidents and are unable to maintain with proper dignity the station delegated to them  this tree is at present in hands which justly value and protect it is age it was barely included within the gardenwall which bore hard upon it lord ducie removed the encumbrance and at the same time applied fresh earth to the roots of the tree which seems to have inlivened it so late as in the year      it produced great quantities of chestnuts which tho small were sweet and wellflavoured  in the great chesnutcause mentioned a little above see page  0  between barrington and ducarel this venerable tree was called upon as an evidence and gave a very respectable testimony in favor of the chestnuts  after mentioning this chestnut which has been celebrated so much i cannot forbear mentioning another which is equally remarkable for having never been celebrated at all tho it is one of the largest trees that perhaps ever existed in england if it had ever been noticed merely for it is bulk i should have passed it over among other gigantic plants that had nothing else to boast but as no historian or antiquarian so far as i have heard has taken the least notice of it i thought it right from this very circumstance to make up the omission by giving it at least what little credit these papers could give  this chestnut grows at a place called wimley near hitchinpriory in hertfordshire in the year      at five feet above the ground it is girth was somewhat more than fourteen yards it is trunk was hollow and in part open but it is vegetation was still vigorous on one side it is vast arms shooting up in various forms some upright and others oblique were decayed and peeled at the extremities but issued from luxuriant foliage at their insertion in the trunk on the other side the foliage was still full and hid all decay  in a glade of hainhaultforest in essex about a mile from barkingside stands an oak which has been known through many centuries by the name of fairlop the tradition of the country traces it half way up the christian era it is still a noble tree tho it has now suffered greatly from the depredations of time about a yard from the ground where it is rough fluted stem is thirtysix feet in circumference it divides into eleven vast arms yet not in the horizontal manner of an oak but rather in that of a beech beneath it is shade which overspreads an area of three hundred feet in circuit an annual fair has long been held on the  d of july and no booth is suffered to be erected beyond the extent of it is boughs but as their extremities are now become sapless and age is yearly curtailing their length the liberties of the fair seem to be in a very desponding condition the honor however is great  but honors are often accompanied with inconveniences and fairlop has suffered from it is honorable distinctions in the feasting that attends a fair fires are often necessary and no places seemed so proper to make them in as the hollow cavities formed by the heaving roots of the tree this practice has brought a speedier decay on fairlop than it might otherwise have suffered  not far from blanford in dorsetshire stood very lately a tree known by the name of damorys oak about five or six centuries ago it was probably in a state of maturity at the ground it is circumference was sixtyeight feet and seventeen feet above the ground it is diameter was four yards as this vast trunk decayed it became hollow forming a cavity which was fifteen feet wide and seventeen feet high capable of holding twenty men during the civil wars and till after the restoration this cave was regularly inhabited by an old man who sold ale in it in the violent storm in the year   0  it suffered greatly many of it is noblest limbs having been torn from it but it was still so grand a ruin above forty years after that some of it is branches were seventyfive feet high and extended seventytwo in the year      when it was fit for nothing but firewood it was sold for fourteen pounds see hutchinss acc of dorsetshire vol i with a print of it   in torwood in the county of sterling upon a little knoll stand at this time the ruins of an oak which is supposed to be the largest tree that ever grew in scotland the trunk of it is now wholly decayed and hollow but it is evident from what remains that it is diameter could not have been less than eleven or twelve feet  what it is age may be is matter only of conjecture but from some circumstances it is probably a tree of great antiquity the little knoll it stands on is surrounded by a swamp over which a causeway leads to the tree or rather to a circle which seems to have run round it the vestiges of this circle as well as the causeway bear a plain resemblance to those works which are commonly attributed to the druids so that it is probable this tree was a scene of worship belonging to those heathen priests  but the credit of it does not depend on the dubious vestiges of druid antiquity in a later scene of greater importance if tradition ever be the vehicle of truth it bore a great share  when that illustrious hero william wallace roused the spirit of the scotch nation to oppose the tyranny of edward he often chose the solitude of torwood as a place of rendezvous for his army here he concealed his numbers and his designs sallying out suddenly on the enemys grrisons and retreating as suddenly when he feared to be overpowered while his army lay in those woods the oak which we are now commemorating was commonly his headquarters here the hero generally slept it is hollow trunk being capacious enough to afford shelter not only to himself but to several of his officers this tree has ever since been known by the name of wallacetree by which name it may easily be found in torwood to this day see nimmos hist of sterlingshire p       among these celebrated trees we must not forget herns oak in windsor forest shakespeare tells us  an old tale goes that hern the hunter sometime a keeper here in windsor forest does all the winter time at still of midnight walk round about this oak with ragged horns and then he blasts the trees destroys the cattle makes the milchcow yield blood and shakes a chain in hideous dreadful manner  this tree as far as we can pay credit to tradition and general opinion still exists in the little park at windsor is a walk known by the name of queen elizabeths walk it consists of elms among which is a single oak taken into the row as if particularly meant to be distinguished at the time when the walk was laid out this tree is supposed to be herns oak it is a large tree measuring about twentyfour feet in circumference and is still in great vigor which i think chiefly injures it is historical credit for tho it is evidently a tree in years and might well have existed in the time of elizabeth it seems too strong and vigorous to have been a proper tree in that age for hern the hunter to have danced round fairies elves and that generation of people universally chose the most ancient and venerable trees they could find to gambol under and the poet who should describe them dancing under a saplin would show little acquaintance with his subject that this tree could not be called a venerable tree two hundred years ago is evident because it hardly can assume that character even now and yet an oak in a soil it likes will continue so many years in a vigorous state that we must not lay more stress on this argument than it will fairly bear  it may be added however in it is favor that a pit or ditch is still shown near the tree as shakespeare describes it which may have been preserved with the same veneration as the tree itself  there is an oak in the grounds of sir gerrard van neck at heveningham in suffolk which carries us likewise into the times of elizabeth but this tree brings it is evidence with it  evidence which if necessary might carry it into saxon times it is now falling fast into the decline of years and every year robs it more of it is honors but it is trunk which measures thirtyfive feet in circumference still retains it is grandeur tho the ornaments of it is boughs and foliage are much reduced but the grandeur of the trunk consists only in appearance it is a mere shell in queen elizabeths time it was hollow and from this circumstance the tree derives the honor of being handed down to posterity that princess who from her earliest age loved masculine amusements used often it is said in her youth to take her stand in this tree and shoot the deer as they passed from that time it has been known by the name of queen elizabeths oak  after celebrating the grandeur of these sons of the forest i should wish to introduce in due subordination two or three celebrated fruit trees  in the deanerygarden at winchester stood lately so lately as the year      an ancient fig tree through a succession of many deans it had been cased up and shielded from winds and frost the wall to which it was nailed was adorned with various inscriptions in hebrew greek and latin alluding to such passages of the sacred writings as do honor to the fig tree after having been presented with several texts of scripture the reader was informed by way of climax that in the year      king james i tasted of the fruit of this fig tree with great pleasure  at lambeth likewise are two celebrated fig trees which on good grounds are supposed to have been planted by cardinal pole they are immense trees of the kind covering a space of wall fifty feet in height and forty in breadth the circumference of the stem of one of them is twentyeight inches and of the other twentyone they are of the white marseilles kind and have for many years furnished the tables of the archbishops of canterbury with very delicious fruit  among other remarkable fruit trees may be reckoned a vine belonging to the late sir charles raymond at valentinehouse near ilford in essex it was planted a cutting in the year      of the black hambrugh sort and as this species will not easily bear the open air it was planted in the hothouse tho without any preparation of soil which is in those grounds a stiff loam or rather clay the hothouse is a very large one about seventy feet in front and the vine which i understand is not pruned in the common way extends two hundred feet part of it running along the south wall on the outside of the hothouse in the common mode of pruning this species of vine is no great bearer but managed as it is here it produces wonderfully sir charles raymond on the death of his lady in      left valentinehouse at which time the gardener had the profits of the vine it annually produces about four hundred weight of grapes which used formerly when the hothouse i suppose was kept warmer to ripen in march tho lately they have not ripened till june when they sell at four shillings a pound which produces about eighty pounds this account i had from mr eden himself the gardener who planted the vine  with regard to the profits of it i think it probable from the accounts i have had from other hands that when the grapes ripened earlier they produced much more than eighty pounds a gentleman of character informed me that he had it from sir charles raymond himself that after supplying his own table he has made one hundred and twenty pounds a year of the grapes and the same gentleman who was curious inquired of the fruit dealers who told him that in some years they supposed the profits have not amounted to less than three hundred pounds this does not contradict mr edens account who said that the utmost he ever made of it that is i suppose when the grapes sold at four shillings a pound in june was eightyfour pounds at the lowest calculation the profits were prodigious  the stem of this vine was in the year      thirteen inches in circumference  but the vine even as a timbertree has it is place in history mr misson a traveller of whom mr addison speaks with particular respect tells us see missons travels in italy  that the gates of the great church at ravenna in italy were made of vine planks twelve feet long and fourteen or fifteen inches broad the vine from which these planks were taken must have been an enormous vegetable of it is kind indeed if the account had not been well attested it would have exceeded credit  misson adds that the soil about ravenna on the side next the sea was remarkable for the enormous growth of vines and he supposes it was owing to the rich manure left by the sea for tho the town of ravenna in his day stood a league from the adriatic yet it is an undoubted fact that the sea formerly washed it is walls and that the present ravenna occupies the site of the ancient ravenna which we know was one of the best ports the romans had on the adriatic  having thus given the history of some of the most celebrated trees on record i cannot help subjoining an account of a few particular species which are remarkably singular  in the memoirs of the french academy we find a description of a very curious tree by mr adanson called the boabab it is a native of senegal and has been taken notice of by prosper alpinus and other botanists but mr adanson who spent several years in those parts seems to have had the best opportunities of being acquainted with it  as to it is botanical peculiarities which are great and it is physical uses which are many we enter not into them we have only to do with it is external form which is very singular it is supposed to be the largest of natures vegetable productions  the behemoth of the forest from mr adansons account one should suppose the boabab to be a kind of natural pollard he tells us it is trunk seldom rises higher than twelve feet tho it is diameter exceeds seventy from this amazing trunk spring a number of massy branches the center branch rises perpendicularly sixty or seventy feet the lateral branches shoot in angles less and less acute till the lowest series form right angles with the trunk and so become quite horizontal in this direction they stretch fifty or sixty feet till their weight brings them to the ground with which the extremities of many of them are in contact so that the whole tree has the appearance of a woody hemisphere whose radius including the thickness of the trunk must be about eighty or ninety feet  whatever may be said for the peculiarity of such a tree we cannot say much in favor of it is picturesque form it seems to be little more than a monstrous bush the bark of this tree is of an ashcolored tint it is leaves are oval pointed at the end and about five inches long  tho the boabab is a native of africa yet a small one was found growing in the island of martinico it is supposed however to have been brought thither by some of the negroeslaves among whom it is common to carry seeds of different kinds as charms and remedies and it is certain that many african plants have been propagated in the west indies in this accidental manner  mr evelin gives us the description of another curious tree called the arbor de rays which is sound chiefly in the east indies and is remarkable for the manner in which it propagates from the end of it is boughs it distills in a continued viscous thread a kind of gummy matter which increases like an icicle till it reach the ground where it takes root and becomes a stem putting forth new branches and propagating anew so that a single plant of this kind may increase into a forest  strabo describes an indian tree which i should suppose was the same with mr evelins arbor de rays only strabo accounts more simply for the mode of it is propagation it is branches he says grow horizontally about twelve cubits and then take a direction to the earth where they root themselves and when they have attained maturity continue to propagate in the same manner till the ground is covered with them for a considerable space or as strabo more expressively describes it till the whole becomes like a tent supported by many columns  p     edit cause   this seems to be the tree of which milton speaks branching so broad and long that in the ground the bended twigs take root and daughters grow about the mother tree a pillared shade high overarched with ecchoing walks between there often the indian herdsman shunning heat shelters in cool and tends his pasturing herds at loopholes cut through thickest shade   modern travelers speak of an indian tree like this the only tree of the kind they know which they call the banian tree or indian fig in it is mode of propagation it corresponds rather with strabos description than evelins we are informed however that although common in india it is not very commonly found in that state of grandeur in which it is here described nor indeed will it easily take that very regular form without some little assistance from art instead of the indian herdsman whom milton introduces it is often at this day inhabited by a bramin who builds his little reedthatched shed against it is trunk and amuses his leisure by directing it is lengthening branches into proper places and forming each into a regular arch here dressed in a long white tunic the habit of his order and adorned with a flowing beard he spends his solitary hours in wandering among the verdant allies of his tree scarce ever leaving it is limits the inhabitants of the district resort daily to him with the necessaries of life and receive in return his prayers and benedictions  there is a tree in the island of java called the upas or poisontree which in the history of curious trees should not be omitted tho the accounts of it are so wonderful that some have esteemed them fabulous they are given to the public by a surgeon belonging to the dutch east india company of the name of foersch who was stationed at batavia in the year      surprising however as these accounts may be they are accompanied with so many public facts and names of persons and places that it is somewhat difficult to conceive them fabulous  the abridged narrative of this strange production is this  the upas grows about twentyseven leagues from batavia in a plain surrounded by rocky mountains the whole of which plain containing a circle of ten or twelve miles round the tree is totally barren nothing that breathes or vegetates can live within it is influence the bird that flies over it drops down dead the beast that wanders into it expires the whole dreadful area is covered with sand over which lie scattered loose flints and whitening bones  this tree may be called the emperors great military magazine in a solution of the poisonous gum which exudes from it his arrows and offensive weapons are dipped the procuring therefore of this poisonous gum is a matter of as much attention as of difficulty criminals only are employed in this dreadful service of these several every year are sent with a promise of pardon and reward if they procure it hooded in leathern cases with glass eyletholes and secured as much as possible from the full effluvia of the air they are to breathe they undertake this melancholy journey traveling always with the wind about one in ten escapes and brings away a little box of this direful commodity  of the dreadful and sudden effect of this poison the author saw many instances he mentions among others the execution of thirteen young ladies of the emperors seraglio who having been convicted of infidelity to his bed were condemned to die by the poison of upas which is considered in java like the axe in england as an honorable instrument of death at eleven oclock in the forenoon these unhappy victims were led into a court in the palace where a row of thirteen posts had been erected to these they were bound as they stood trembling they were obliged to confess the justice of their sentence which each of them did by laying one hand on the koran and the other on her breast when these confessions were finished and a few religious ceremonies on a sign given by the judge an executioner stepped forward who bared their breasts and amidst their cries and shrieks with a poisoned lancet made a slight incision in each the author says he stood by with his watch in his hand in five minutes they were seized with convulsive spasms  excruciating agonies succeeded and in sixteen minutes they were all dead a frightful change came on from being objects of beauty they became spectacles of horror livid spots broke out upon them their faces swelled their cheeks became blue and their eyes yellow  the author says that on the coast of macassar there are found trees very like the upas of java but not so malignant if so it is probable that all these trees are of the same kind only the javaupas has found a situation where it is poisonous qualities are more sublimed  dr darwin in his loves of the plants has given us a picture of the situation of this dreadful tree the existence of which he seems to believe  where seas of glass with gay reflections smile round the green coasts of javas palmy isle a spacious plain extends it is upland scene rocks rise on rocks and fountains gush between soft breathes the breeze eternal summers reign and showers prolific bless the soil  in vain no spicy nutmeg scents the vernal gales no towering plantain shades the midday vales no grassy mantle hides the sable hills no flowery chaplet crowns the trickling rills no step retreating on the sand impressed invites the visit of a second guest fierce in dread silence on the blasted heath fell upas sits  that i may connect this little biographical history of trees with the principal subject of my book i shall conclude it with an account of three celebrated trees from newforest in hampshire  the first i shall mention is that famous tree against which the arrow of sir walter tyrrel glanced which killed william rufus  leland tells us and camden see camdens account of newforest from him that the death of rufus happened at a place in newforest called througham where a chapel was erected to his memory but i meet with no place of the name of througham in newforest and neither the remains nor the remembrance of any chapel it is probable that througham might be what is now called fritham where the tradition of the country seems to have fixed the spot with more credibility from the tre  the chapel might only have been some little temporary oratory which having never been endowed might speedily have fallen to decay but the tree it is probable would be noticed at the time by every body who lived near it and by strangers who came to see it and it is as probable that it could never be forgotten afterward they who think a tree insufficient to record a fact of so ancient a date may be reminded that seven hundred years and it is not more since the death of rufus make no extraordinary period in the existence of an oak about fifty years ago however this tree became so decayed and mutilated that in all probability the spot would have been forgotten if some other memorial had not been raised before the stump therefore was eradicated a triangular stone was erected by the late lord delaware who lived in one of the neighboring lodges on the three sides of which stone the following inscriptions are engraven    here stood the oaktree on which an arrow shot by sir walter tyrrel at a stag glanced and struck king william ii surnamed rufus in the breast of which stroke he instantly died on the  d of august   00    king william ii being thus slain was laid on a cart belonging to one purkess and drawn from hence to winchester and buried in the cathedral church of that city    that the spot where an event so memorable happened might not hereafter be unknown this stone was set up by john lord delaware who has seen the tree growing in this place  lord delaware asserts plainly that he had seen the oaktree and as he lived much on the spot he had probably other grounds for the assertion besides the tradition of the country that matter however rests on his authority  the next tree i shall exhibit from newforest is the groaningtree of badesly a village about two miles from lymington the history of the groaningtree is this about forty years ago a cottager who lived near the center of the village heard frequently a strange noise behind his house like that of a person in extreme agony soon after it caught the attention of his wife who was then confined to her bed she was a timorous woman and being greatly alarmed her husband endeavored to persuade her that the noise she heard was only the bellowing of the stags in the forest by degrees however the neighbors on all sides heard it and the thing began to be much talked of it was by this time plainly discovered that the groaning noise proceeded from an elm which grew at the end of the garden it was a young vigorous tree and to all appearance perfectly sound  in a few weeks the fame of the groaning tree was spread far and wide and people from all parts flocked to hear it among others it attracted the curiosity of the late prince and princess of wales who resided at that time for the advantage of a seabath at pilewell the seat of sir james worsley which stood within a quarter of a mile of the groaning tree  tho the country people assigned many superstitious causes for this strange phenomenon the naturalist could assign no physical one that was in any degree satisfactory some thought it was owing to the twisting and friction of the roots others thought it proceeded from water which had collected in the body of the tree  or perhaps from pent air but no cause that was alleged appeared equal to the effect in the mean time the tree did not always groan sometimes disappointing it is visitants yet no cause could be assigned for it is temporary cessations either from seasons or weather if any difference was observed it was thought to groan least when the weather was wet and most when it was clear and frosty but the sound at all times seemed to arise from the root  thus the groaning tree continued an object of astonishment during the space of eighteen or twenty months to all the country around and for the information of distant parts a pamphlet was drawn up containing a particular account of all the circumstances relating to it  at length the owner of it a gentleman of the name of forbes making too rash an experiment to discover the cause bored a hole in it is trunk after this it never groaned it was then rooted up with a further view to make a discovery but still nothing appeared which led to any investigation of the cause it was universally however believed that there was no trick in the affair but that some natural cause really existed tho never understood  the last celebrated tree which i shall present to the reader from newforest is the cadenham oak which buds every year in the depth of winter cadenham is a village about three miles from lyndhurst on the salisbury road  having often heard of this oak i took a ride to see it on the   th of december      it was pointed out to me among several other oaks surrounded by a little forest stream winding round a knoll on which they stood it is a tall straight plant of no great age and apparently vigorous except that it is top has been injured from which several branches issue in the form of pollard shoots it was entirely bare of leaves as far as i could discern when i saw it and undistinguishable from the other oaks in it is neighborhood except that it is bark seemed rather smoother occasioned i apprehended only by frequent climbing  having had the account of it is early budding confirmed on the spot i engaged one michael lawrence who kept the white heart a small alehouse in the neighborhood to send me some of the leaves to vicars hill as soon as they should appear the man who had not the least doubt about the matter kept his word and sent me several twigs on the morning of the  th of january      a few hours after they had been gathered the leaves were fairly expanded and about an inch in length from some of the buds two leaves had unsheathed themselves but in general only one  through what power in nature this strange premature vegetation is occasioned i believe no naturalist can explain i sent some of the leaves to one of the ablest botanists we have mr lightfoot author of the flora scotica and was in hopes of hearing something satisfactory on the subject but he is one of those philosophers who is not ashamed of ignorance where attempts at knowledge are mere conjecture he assured me that he neither could account for it in any way nor did he know of any other instance of premature vegetation except the glastonburythorn  the philosophers of the forest in the meantime account for the thing at once through the influence of old christmas day universally believing that the oak buds on that day and that only the same opinion is held with regard to the glastonburythorn by the common people of the west of england but without doubt the germination there is gradual and forwarded or retarded by the mildness or severity of the weather one of it is progeny which grew in the gardens of the duchess dowager of portland at bulstrode had it is flowerbuds perfectly formed so early as the   st of december      which is fifteen days earlier than it ought to flower according to the vulgar prejudice in the salisbury journal january  0th      the following paragraph appeared  in consequence of a report that has prevailed in this country for upwards of two centuries and which by many has been almost considered as a matter of faith that the oak at cadenham in the newforest shoots forth leaves on every old christmas day and that no leaf is ever to be seen on it either before or after that day during the winter a lady who is now on a visit in this city and who is attentively curious in every thing relative to art or nature made a journey to cadenham on monday the  d instant purposely to enquire on the spot about the production of this famous tree on her arrival near it the usual guide was ready to attend her but on his being desired to climb the oak and to search whether there were any leaves then on it he said it would be to no purpose but that if she would come on the wednesday following christmas day she might certainly see thousands however he was prevailed on to ascend and on the first branch which he gathered appeared several fair new leaves fresh sprouted from the buds and nearly an inch and a half in length it may be imagined that the guide was more amazed at this premature production than the lady for so strong was his belief in the truth of the whole tradition that he would have pledged his life that not a leaf was to have been discovered on any part of the tree before the usual hour  but tho the superstitious part of this ancient legend is hence confuted yet it must be allowed that there is something very uncommon and curious in an oaks constantly shooting forth leaves at this unseasonable time of the year and that the cause of it well deserves the philosophical attention of the botanist in some years there is no doubt but that this oak may show it is first leaves on the christmas morning as probably as on a few days before and this perhaps was the case in the last year when a gentleman of this neighborhood a nice and critical observer strictly examined the branches not only on the christmas morn but also on the day prior to it on the first day not a leaf was to be found but on the following every branch had it is complement tho they were then but just shooting from the buds none of them being more than a quarter of an inch long the latter part of the story may easily be credited that no leaves are to be seen on it after christmas day as large parties yearly assemble about the oak on that morning and regularly strip every appearance of a leaf from it     this early spring however of the cadenham oak is of very short duration the buds after unfolding themselves make no farther progress but immediately shrink from the season and die the tree continues torpid like other deciduous trees during the remainder of the winter and vegetates again in the spring at the usual season i have seen it in full leaf in the middle of summer when it appeared both in it is form and foliage exactly like other oaks  i have been informed that another tree with the same property of early germination has lately been found near the spot where rufuss monument stands if this be the case it seems in some degree to authenticate the account which camden see camdens account of newforest gives us of the scene of that princes death for he speaks of the premature vegetation of that very tree on which the arrow of tyrrel glanced and the tree i now speak of if it really exist tho i have no sufficient authority for it might have been a descendant of the old oak and have inherited it is virtues  it is very probable however there may be other oaks in the forest which may likewise have the property of early germination i have heard it often suspected that people gather buds from other trees and carry them on old christmas day to the oak at cadenham from whence they pretended to pluck them for that tree is in such repute and resorted to annually by so many visitants that i think it could not easily supply all it is votaries without some foreign contributions  some have accounted for this phenomenon by supposing that leaves have been preserved over the year by being steeped in vinegar but i am well satisfied this is not the case mr lightfoot to whom i sent the leaves had no such suspicion  end of the first book book ii section i from considering trees as individuals we proceed next to consider them under their various combinations among which clumps are the simplest  what number of trees make a clump no rules of art prescribe the term has rather a relative meaning  in scenes brought near the eye we call three or four trees a clump but in distant and extensive scenery we scruple not to use the term for any smaller detached part of a wood tho it may consist of some hundreds  but tho the term admits not of exact definition i shall endeavor by amplification to make the ideas contained under it as distinct as i can  we distinguish then two kinds of clumps the smaller and the larger confining the former chiefly to the foreground and considering the latter as the ornament of a distance  with regard to the smaller clump the chief beauty we expect here arises from contrast in the parts we have seen that in single trees each must have it is characteristic beauty it has nothing else to depend on but in combination the beauty of the individual is not required the whole clump together must produce the effect  to enumerate all the sources of beautiful contrast which contribute to produce this effect might be difficult i shall cursorily suggest a few  in the first place the relative situation of trees with regard to each other should be considered three trees or more standing in a line are formal in the natural wood you rarely see this formality  and yet even three trees in a line will be greatly assisted by the lines of the several trunks taking different directions and by the various forms distances and growth of the trees  if three trees do not stand in a line they must of course stand in a triangle which produces a great variety of pleasing forms  if a fourth tree be added it stands beautifully near the middle of the triangle of whatever form the triangle may be if it be equilateral and the tree placed exactly in the middle there are three points as you walk round the triangle from which it will appear offensively regular  remarks however of this kind affect only young trees while their stems are tall and similar as they increase their different modes of growth  the swelling of their roots  the habits they contract from wind  their ramification  their lateral branches and other accidental circumstances introduce endless varieties among them and blot out many of those little formalities which attend their youth tho after all the artificial clump will rarely attain the beauty of the natural one  if the clump consist of still more trees than four a greater variety among the stems will of course take place  double triangles irregular quincunxes and other pleasing shapes which may be seen exemplified in every wood of natural growth  the branches also are as much a source of contrast as the stem to be picturesque they must intermingle with each other without heaviness  they must hang loosely but yet with varied looseness on every side  and if there be one superior apex there may be two or three others that are subordinate according to the size of the clump  different kinds of trees also in the same clump occasion often a beautiful contrast there are few trees which will not harmonize with trees of a different kind tho perhaps the most simple and beautiful contrasts arise from the various modes of growth in the same species we often see two or three oaks intermingle their branches together in a very pleasing manner when the beech is full grown it is generally in a luxuriant soil at least so heavy that it rarely blends happily either with it is own kind or with any other the silverfir too we have observed is a very unaccommodating tree  so also are other firs indeed all that taper to a point not so the pinerace they are clumpheaded and unite well in composition with these also the scotchfir leagues from little knots of which we often see beautiful contrasts arise when they are young and luxuriant especially if any number of them above four or five are planted together they generally form a heavy murky spot but as they acquire age this heaviness goes off the inner branches decay the outward branches hang loosely and negligently and the whole has often a good effect unless they have been planted too closely i am rather doubtful how far deciduous trees mix well in a clump with evergreens and yet we sometimes see a natural good effect of light and shade from the darkness of the fir contrasting agreeably with the sprightly green of a deciduous tree just coming into leaf in this however i am clear that if they are mixed they ought not to be planted as they often are alternately but each kind together  contrasts again arise from the mixture of trees of unequal growth  from a young tree united with an old one  a stunted tree with a luxuriant one  and sometimes from two or three trees which in themselves are illshaped but when combined are pleasing inequalities of all these kinds are what chiefly give natures planting a superiority over art  the form of the foliage is another source of contrast in one part where the branches intermingle the foliage will be interwoven and close in another where the boughs of each tree hang separately the appearance will be light and easy  but whatever beauty these contrasts exhibit the effect is totally lost unless the clump be wellbalanced this is as necessary in a combination of trees as in a single tree see page    the clump is considered as one object and the support of the whole must depend on the several trunks and leading branches of which it is composed we do not expect the minutiae of scale and weight if no side preponderate so as to hurt the eye it is enough  unless however the clump have suffered some external injury it is seldom deficient in point of balance nature always conducts the stems and branches in such easy forms wherever there is an opening and fills up all with so much nice contrivance and at the same time with so much picturesque irregularity that we rarely wish for an amendment in her works so true indeed this is that nothing is so dangerous as to take away a tree from a clump you will infallibly destroy the balance which can never again be restored  thus far we have considered a clump as a single independent object  as the object of a foreground  consisting of such a confined number of trees as the eye can fairly include at once and when trees strike our fancy either in the wild scenes of nature or in the improvements of art they will ever be found in combinations similar to these  when the clump grows larger it becomes qualified only as a remote object  combining with vast woods and forming a part of some extensive scene either as a first a second or a third distance  the great use of the larger clump is to lighten the heaviness of a continued distant wood and connect it gently with the plain that the transition may not be too abrupt all we wish to find in a clump of this kind is proportion and general form  with respect to proportion the detached clump must not incroach too much on the dignity of the wood it aids but must observe a proper subordination a large tract of country covered with wood will admit several of these auxiliary clumps of different dimensions but if the wood be of a smaller size the clumps also must be smaller and fewer  with regard to the general form of the larger clump we observed that in a single tree we expected elegance in the parts in the smaller clumps this idea was relinquished and in it is room we expected a general contrast in trunks branches and foliage but as the clump becomes larger and recedes in the landscape all these pleasing contrasts are lost and we are satisfied with a general form no regular form is pleasing a clump on the side of a hill or in any situation where the eye can more easily investigate it is shape must be circumscribed by an irregular line in which it is required that the undulations both at the base and summit of the clump should be strongly marked as the eye probably has a distinct view of both but if it be seen only on the top of a hill or along the distant horizon as in these situations the base is commonly lost in the varieties of the ground a little variation in the line which forms the summit so as to break any disagreeable regularity there will be sufficient  as a large tract of wood requires a few large clumps to connect it gently with the plain so these large clumps themselves require the same service from a single tree or a few trees according to their size  these observations respect chiefly the vast scenes of nature which are but little under the control of art while they assist us however in judging of the natural scene they are in many respects applicable to the embellished one to the painters use they are most adapted whose business it is to introduce his trees in the happiest manner whether he spread them over his canvas in vast woods or break them into smaller or larger combinations  sect ii from clumps we naturally proceed to parkscenery which is generally composed of combinations of clumps interspersed with lawns it is seldom composed of any large district of wood which is the characteristic of forestscenery  the park which is a species of landscape little known except in england is one of the noblest appendages of a great house nothing gives a mansion so much dignity as these home demeisns nor contributes more to mark it is consequence a great house in a course of years naturally acquires space around it a noble park therefore is the natural appendage of an ancient mansion  to the size and grandeur of the house the park should be proportioned blenheimcastle with a paddock around it or a small villa in the middle of woodstockpark would be equally out of place  the house should stand nearly in the center of the park that is it should have ample room about it on every side petworthhouse one of the grandest piles in england loses much of it is grandeur from being placed at the extremity of the park where it is elbowed by a churchyard  the exact spot depends entirely on the ground there are grand situations of various kinds in general houses are built first and parks are added afterward by the occasional removal of enclosures a great house stands most nobly on an elevated knoll from whence it may overlook the distant country while the woods of the park skreen the regularity of the intervening cultivation or it stands well on the side of a valley which winds along it is front and is adorned with wood or a natural stream hiding and discovering itself among the clumps at the bottom of the vale or it stands with dignity as longleat does in the center of demeisns which shelve gently down to it on every side  even on a dead flat i have seen a house draw beauties around it at the seat of the late mr bilson leg now lord stawels in the middle of holtforest a lawn unvaried by a single swell is yet varied with clumps of different forms receding behind each other in so pleasing a manner as to make an agreeable scene  by these observations i mean only to show that in whatever part of a park a house may have been originally placed it can hardly have been placed so awkwardly but that in some way or other the scenery may be happily adapted to it there are some situations indeed so very untoward that scarce any remedy can be applied as when the front of a house immediately urges on a rising ground but such awkward situations are rare and in general the variety of landscape is such that it may almost always be brought in one form or other to serve the purposes of beauty the many improvements of the ingenious mr brown in various parts of england bear witness to the truth of these observations  the beauty however of parkscenery is undoubtedly best displayed on a varied surface  where the ground swells and falls  where hanging lawns skreened with wood are connected with valleys  and where one part is continually playing in contrast with another  as the park is an appendage of the house it follows that it should participate of it is neatness and elegance nature in all her great walks of landscape observes this accommodating rule she seldom passes abruptly from one mode of scenery to another but generally connects different species of landscape by some third species which participates of both a mountainous country rarely sinks immediately into a level one the swellings and heavings of the earth grow gradually less thus as the house is connected with the country through the medium of the park the park should partake of the neatness of the one and of the wildness of the other  as the park is a scene either planted by art or if naturally woody artificially improved we expect a beauty and contrast in it is clumps which we do not look for in the wild scenes of nature we expect to see it is lawns and their appendages contrasted with each other in shape size and disposition from which a variety of artificial scenes will arise we expect that when trees are left standing as individuals they should be the most beautiful of their kind elegant and wellbalanced we expect that all offensive trumpery and all the rough luxuriance of undergrowth should be removed unless where it is necessary to thicken or connect a scene or hide some staring boundary in the wild scenes of nature we have grander exhibitions but greater deformities than are generally met with in the works of art as we seldom meet with these sublime passages in improved landscape it would be unpardonable if any thing disgusting should appear  in the parkscene we wish for no expensive ornament temples chinesebridges obelisks and all the labored works of art suggest inharmonious ideas if a bridge be necessary let it be elegantly plain if a deershed or a keepers lodge be required let the fashion of each be as simple as it is use let nothing appear with ostentation or parade  within restrictions however of this kind we mean not to include piles of superior grandeur such a palace as blenheimcastle distributes it is greatness far and wide there if the bridge be immense or the obelisk superb it is only what we naturally expect it is the chain of ideas properly carried on and gradually lost my remarks regard only such houses as may be rich indeed and elegant but have nothing in them of superior magnificence  one ornament of this kind i should be inclined to allow and that is a handsome gate at the entrance of the park but it should be proportioned in richness and elegance to the house and should also correspond with it in style it should raise the first impression of what you are to expect warwickcastle requires a mode of entrance very different from lord scarsdales at kettlestone and burleighhouse very different from both the parkgate of sionhouse is certainly elegant but it raises the idea of a style of architecture which you must drop when you arrive at the house  the road also through the park should bear the same proportion it should be spacious or moderate like the house it approaches let it wind but let it not take any deviation which is not well accounted for to have the convenience of winding along a valley or passing a commodious bridge or avoiding a wood or a piece of water any traveller would naturally wish to deviate a little and obstacles of this kind if necessary must be interposed mr brown was often very happy in creating these artificial obstructions  from every part of the approach and from the ridings and favorite walks about the park let all the boundaries be secreted a view of paling tho in some cases it may be picturesque is in general disgusting  if there be a natural river or a real ruin in the scene it may be a happy circumstance let the best use be made of it but i should be cautious in advising the creation of either at least i have rarely seen either ruins or rivers well manufactured mr brown i think has failed more in rivermaking than in any of his attempts an artificial lake has sometimes a good effect but neither propriety nor beauty can arise from it unless the heads and extremities of it are perfectly well managed and concealed and after all the success is hazardous you must always suppose it a portion of a larger piece of water and it is not easy to carry on the imposition if the house be magnificent it seldom receives much benefit from an artificial production of this kind grandeur is rarely produced   seldom art can emulate that magnitude sublime which spreads the native lake and failing there her works betray their character and name and dwindle into pools  the most natural inhabitants of parks are fallow deer and very beautiful they are but flocks of sheep and herds of cattle are more useful and in my opinion more beautiful sheep particularly are very ornamental in a park their color is just that dingy hue which contrasts with the verdure of the ground and the flakiness of their wool is rich and picturesque i should wish them however to wear their natural livery and not to be patched with letters and daubed over with redochre to see the side of a hill spread with groups of sheep  or to see them through openings among the boles of trees at a little distance with a gleam of light falling upon them is very picturesque  as the garden or pleasureground as it is commonly called approaches nearer to the house than the park it takes of course a higher polish here the lawns are shorn instead of being grazed the roughness of the road is changed into an elegant gravel walk and knots of flowers and flowering shrubs are introduced yet blended with clumps of foresttrees which connect it with the park single trees also take their station here with great propriety the spreading oak or elm are no disgrace to the most ornamented scene it is the property of these noble plants to harmonize with every species of landscape they equally become the forest and the lawn only here they should be beautiful in their kind and luxuriant in their growth neither the scathed nor the unbalanced oak would suit a polished situation  here too if the situation suits it the elegant temple may find a place but it is an expensive a hazardous and often a useless decoration if more than one however be introduced in the same view they crowd the scene unless it be very extensive more than two should in no case be admitted in the most polished landscape unless nature and simplicity lead the way the whole will be deformed  sect iii from scenes of art let us hasten to the chief object of our pursuit the wild scenes of nature  the wood  the copse  the glen  and opengrove  under the term wood we include every extensive combination of foresttrees in a state of nature all such combinations tho without the privilege of forests compose the same kind of scenery the description therefore of such scenes will come most properly under the head of forestviews on which we shall hereafter dwell at large at present let us examine the smaller combinations and first the copse  the copse is a species of scenery composed commonly of foresttrees intermixed with brushwood which latter is periodically cut down in twelve thirteen or fourteen years in its dismantled state therefore nothing can be more forlorn than the copse the area is covered with bare roots and knobs from which the brushwood has been cut while the foresttrees intermingled among them present their ragged stems despoiled of all their lateral branches which the luxuriance of the surrounding thickets had choked  in a very short time however all this injury which the copse has suffered is repaired one winter only sees its disgrace the next summer produces luxuriant shoots and two summers more restore it almost to perfect beauty  it matters little of what species of wood the copse is composed for as it seldom at best exhibits a scene of picturesque beauty we rarely expect more from it than a shady sequestered path which it generally furnishes in great perfection it is among the luxuries of nature to retreat into the cool recesses of the fullgrown copse from the severity of a meridian sun and to be serenaded by the humming insects of the shade whose continuous song has a more refreshing sound than the buzzing vagrant fly which wantons in the glare of day and as milton expresses it  winds her sultry horn  in distant landscape the copse has seldom any effect the beauty of wood in a distant view arises in some degree from it is tuftings which break and enrich the lights  but chiefly from it is contrast with the plain  and from the grand shapes and forms occasioned by the retiring and advancing parts of the forest which produce vast masses of light and shade and give effect to the whole  these beauties appear rarely in the copse instead of that rich and tufted bed of foliage which the distant forest exhibits the copse presents a meagre and unaccommodating surface it is age which gives the tree it is tufted form and the forest it is effect a nursery of saplings produce it not and the copse is little more nor does the intermixture of fullgrown trees assist the appearance their clumpy heads blend ill with the spiry tops of the juniors neither have they any connection with each other the woodmans judgment is shown in leaving the timber trees at proper intervals that they may neither hinder each others growth nor the growth of the underwood but the woodman does not pretend to manage his trees with a view to picturesque beauty and from his management it is impossible they should produce a mass of light and shade  besides the copse forms no contrast with the plain nor presents those beautiful projections and recesses which the skirts of the forest exhibit a copse is a plot of ground portioned off for the purpose of nurturing wood of course it must be fenced from cattle and these fences which are in themselves disgusting generally form the copse into a square a rhomboid or some other regular figure so that we have not only a deformity but a want also of a connecting tie between the wood and the plain instead of a softened undulating line we have a harsh fence  the best effect which the copse produces is on the lofty banks of a river i have the wye particularly in my view in navigating such a river the deficiences of this mode of scenery as you view it upwards from a boat are lost and in almost every state it has a good effect while it inriches the bank it is uncouth shape unless the fence is too much in view and all it is other unpleasant appearances are concealed  when a winding walk is carried through a copse which must necessarily in a course of years even in point of picturesque beauty be given to the axe  shall the whole be cut down together or shall a border be left as is sometimes done on each side of the walk  this is a difficult question but i think all should go together unless the border you leave be very broad it will have no effect even at present you will see through it it will appear meagre and will certainly never unite happily with the neighboring parts when they begin to grow at least let it not stand longer than two years the rest of the copse will then be growing beautiful and the border may be dispensed with till it is replaced but the best way certainly is if you have courage to cut the whole down together in a little time as we observed above it will recover it is beauty  sect iv from the copse we proceed to the glen a wide open space between hills is called a vale if it be of smaller dimensions we call it a valley but when this space is contracted to a chasm it becomes a glen a glen therefore is most commonly the offspring of a mountainous country tho it is sometimes found elsewhere with it is common accompaniments of woodybanks and a rivulet at the bottom these circumstances it is evident admit infinite variety the glen may be more or less contracted it may form one single sweep or it is deviations may be irregular the wood may consist of fullgrown trees or of underwood or of a mixture of both the path which winds through it may run along the upper part or the lower or lastly the rivulet may foam among rocks or it may murmur among pebbles or it may form transparent pools overhung with wood or which is often the case it may be totally invisible and an object only of the ear  the most beautiful circumstances that attends the internal parts of a glen are the glades or openings which are found in it if the whole were a thicket like the fullgrown copse little beauty would result an agreeable shade alone in that case must satisfy our expectations but the glen whose furniture is commonly of more fortuitous growth than that of the copse and not so subject to periodical defalcations exhibits generally more beautiful scenery particularly it abounds with frequent openings the eye is carried down from the higher grounds to a sweep of the river  or to a little gushing cascade  or to the face of a fractured rock garnished with hanging wood  or perhaps to a cottage with it is scanty area of lawn falling to the river on one side and sheltered by a clump of oaks on the other while the smoke wreathing behind the trees disperses and loses itself as it gains the summit of the glen or still more beautifully perhaps the eye breaks out at some opening into the country enriched with all the varieties of distant landscape  plains and woods melting together  a winding river  blue mountains  or perhaps some bay of the sea with a little harbor and shipping  as an object of distance also the woody glen has often a good effect climbing the sides of mountains breaking their lines and giving variety to their bleak and barren sides  in many places you see the glen under the hands of improvement and when you happen to have a scene of this kind near your house you cannot well have a more fortunate circumstance but great care should be taken not to load it with ornament such scenes admit little art their beauty consists in their natural wildness and the best rule is to add little but to be content with removing a few deformities and obstructions a good walk or a path there must be and the great art will consist in conducting it in the easiest and most natural way to the spot where the cascade the rock or any other object which the glen exhibits may be seen to the best advantage if a seat or two be thought necessary let them be of the rudest materials and their situation no way forced i have often seen semicircular areas on these occasions adapted to elegant seats which have been fixed either where openings happened to be presented or were purposely cut through the woods all this is awkward and disgusting let no formal preparation introduce a view a parading preface always injures a story the eye receives more pleasure from the casual objects of it is own notice than from objects perhaps of more real beauty forced upon it with parade and ostentation  but tho we are averse to load these sweet recesses of nature with false ornaments yet if such scenes make a part of the immediate environs or pleasure ground of a house a proper degree of ornament will of course be required the walk must be more artificial  it is borders may be spread here and there as in other decorated places with flowers and flowering shrubs  the seats may be more elegant and a temple or other building may perhaps find a place but still the same chaste spirit must regulate here which presides over all other improvements to run into excess in ornament is one of the most obvious errors of false taste we frequently see the effect both of the natural scene and of the artificial representation destroyed merely by adorning  sect v as the glen is sometimes found in the country we are about to describe it was necessary just to mention it as a distinct species of woodland scenery yet as it is not one of the common features of the country we shall dwell no longer upon it but hasten to the open grove the open grove is composed of trees arising from a smooth area which may consist either of pines or of the deciduous race i have seen beautiful groves of both the pinegrove will always be dry as it is the peculiar quality of its leaves to suck up moisture but in lightness variety and general beauty the deciduousgrove excels if indeed you wish to compose your grove in the gloomy style the pinerace will best serve your purpose  the opengrove seldom makes a picturesque appearance in distant scenery indeed it may have the effect of other woods for the trees of which it is formed need not be separated from each other as in the copse but being well massed together may receive beautiful effects of light  when we enter its recesses it is not so well calculated to please there it wants variety and that not only from the smoothness of the surface but from the uniformity of the furniture  at least if it be an artificial scene in which the trees having been planted in a nursery grow all alike with upright stems and yet a walk upon a velvet turf winding at pleasure among these natural columns whose twisting branches at least admit some variety with a spreading canopy of foliage over the head is pleasing and in hot weather refreshing sometimes we find the opengrove of natural growth it is then more various and irregular and becomes of course a more pleasing scene and yet when woods of this kind continue as they sometimes do in unpeopled countries through half a province they become tiresome and prove that it is not wood but variety of landscape that delights the eye  sometimes the grove in the neighborhood of great houses demands a little embellishment and as it is naturally less rude than the glen it is therefore more patient of improvement a seat or a temple according to the size and situation of the place may here be a proper ornament but if the turf be neat tho we do not often find it so under trees or close grazed with sheep or deer no artificial walks are necessary if the scene command no distant landscape nor any view of consequence at hand it will require in itself a greater share of ornament but still simplicity must be the leading idea  one thing is absolutely necessary to complete the idea of a grove which is that its boundaries should be concealed it is intended for a sequestered place and should answer that idea  i remember meeting with an ornamented scene of this kind which was very pleasing the grove extended along the brow of a gentle declivity and assumed from that circumstance a dark close gloomy appearance in its deeper recesses tho its opening on the lawn was light and airy and agreeably connected with the ground in the front of the grove stood a rude temple of pan and the lawn being a neat sheepwalk the whole tho highly polished was characteristic harmonious and beautiful  the pleasing tranquillity of groves has ever been in high repute among the innocent and refined part of mankind   groves were planted to console at noon the pensive wanderer in their shades at eve the moonbeam sliding softly in between the sleeping leaves is all the light he wants for meditation  indeed no species of landscape is so fitted for meditation the forest attracts the attention by it is grandeur and the parkscene by it is beauty while the paths through copses dells and thickets are too close devious interrupted and often too beautiful to allow the mind to be at perfect rest but the uniform sameness of the grove leaves the eye disengaged and the feet wandering at pleasure where they are confined by no path want little direction the mind therefore undisturbed has only to retire within itself hence the philosopher the devotee the poet all retreated to these quiet recesses and  from the world retired conversed with angels and immortal forms in classic times the grove was the haunt of gods  habitarunt dii quoque sylvas and in the days of nature before art had introduced a kind of combination against her man had no idea of worshipping god in a temple made with hands the templum nemorale was the only temple he knew  in the resounding wood all vocal beings hymned their equal god and to this idea indeed one of the earliest forms of the artificial temple seems to have been indebted many learned men see a note in bp warburtons edition of popes epist to lord burlington have thought the gothic arch of our cathedralchurches was an imitation of the natural grove it arises from a lofty stem or from two or three stems if they be slender which being bound together and spreading in every direction cover the whole roof with their ramification in the close recesses of the beechengrove we find this idea the most complete the lofty narrow aile  the pointed arch  the clustered pillar whose parts separating without violence diverge gradually to form the fretted roof find there perhaps their earliest archetype  groves too were the scenes of superstition as well as of religion here the priests of baal performed their profane rites and here the backsliding israelites used often to skreen their idolatries the strong ideas of superstition which these gloomy retreats impressed upon the ignorance of early ages are finely touched by virgil the passage i allude to is in the eighth book where the story of evander is introduced the whole country was then as unpeopled countries commonly are a mere forest and as the groves and woods presented themselves on every side the venerable chief describing each scene to his illustrious guest annexes to it some tale of horror or some circumstance of religious awe  hinc lucum ingentem quem romulus acer asylum

beautifully adapted to the subject   meditation here may think down hours to moments here the heart may give a useful lesson to the head and learning wiser grow without it is books knowledge and

time peeps through the moss that clothes the hawthorn root deceive no student wisdom there and truth not shy as in the world and to be won by slow solicitation seize at once the roving thought and fix it on themselves sect vi having thus considered various kinds of woody scenery and traced the peculiar beauties of each we proceed next to the forest which in a manner comprehends them all there are few extensive forests which do not contain in some part or other a specimen of every species of woodylandscape the wild forestview indeed differs essentially from the embellished one tho sometimes we find even the forestlawn in a polished state when browzed by deer into a fine turf and surrounded by stately woods beauty however is not the characteristic of the forest it is peculiar distinction is grandeur and dignity the scenes we have hitherto considered are all within the reach of art and in fact have all been the objects of improvement but the forest disdains all human culture on it the hand of nature only is impressed the forest like other beautiful scenes pleases the eye but it is great effect is to rouse the imagination  the word forest immediately suggests the idea of a continued uninterrupted tract of woody country but forests in general are much more varied they consist indeed of tracts of woody country but these tracts are at the same time intermixed with patches of pasturage which commonly bear the same proportion to the woods of the forest which lawns do to the clumps of a park  these intermingled scenes of wood and pasturage are again divided from other intermixtures of the same kind by wide heaths which are sometimes bounded by a naked line of horizon but more frequently skirted with wood this intermixture of wood and pasturage with large separations of heath give a variety to the forest which a boundless continuance of woody scenery could not exhibit tho it must be acknowledged that in many forests and especially in newforest these tracts of heathy country are often larger than picturesque beauty requires  having given this general idea of the species of country which i mean to treat of under the idea of a forest i shall proceed to particulars let me just recall to the readers memory what was observed before that all great woods diversified as forests are tho not properly denominated forests as not subject to forestlaws will however naturally fall under the description of forestscenery see page       the forest under the division of wood pasturage and heath presents itself to us as a picturesque object in a double view  as the scenery of a foreground and as the scenery of a distance in both views it is equally an object of picturesque beauty but as it is effects are different in each i shall endeavor to delineate their respective beauties  when we speak of forestscenery as a foreground we mean the appearance which it is woods present when we approach their skirts or invade their recesses forests in their nature are woods ab origin  not newly planted but natural woods set apart for the purposes of sheltering and securing game the trees therefore of which these natural woods are composed consist of all ages and sizes from the ancient fathers of the forest to the scion and the seedling they grow also in that wild disordered manner which nature prescribes as the root casually runs which throws up the scion or as the seed or acorn finds soil and room to establish itself and increase but tho the richness of the scenery depends greatly on this multifarious mixture which masses and fills up all the various combinations yet the most ancient trees of each species are the glory of sylvan landscape young trees tho even in distant views inferior to old will however in that situation exhibit a better appearance than on the spot where no forestscenery can fill the eye without a proper assemblage of such trees as have seen ages pass over them these form those bold and rough exhibitions in which the pride and dignity of forestviews consist we have already observed that the wild and rough parts of nature produce the strongest effects on the imagination and we may add they are the only objects in landscape which please the picturesque eye every thing trim and smooth and neat affects it coolly propriety brings us to acquiesce in the elegant and welladapted embellishments of art but the painter who should introduce them on canvas would be characterized as a man void of taste and utterly unacquainted with the objects of picturesque selection  such are the great materials which we expect to find in the skirts and internal parts of the forest  trees of every kind but particularly the oldest and roughest of each  we examine next the mode of scenery which results from their combinations  in speaking of the glen see page      we observed that the principal beauty of it arose from those little openings or glades with which it commonly abounds it is thus in the forestwoods the great beauty of these close scenes arise from the openings and recesses which we find among them  by these i do not mean the lawns and pasturage which i mentioned as one of the great divisions of forestscenery see page   0  but merely those little openings among the trees which are produced by various circumstances a sandy bank or a piece of rocky ground may prevent the contiguity of trees and so make an opening or a tree or two may have been blasted or have been cut down or what is the happiest of all circumstances a winding road may run along the wood  the simple idea which is varied through all these little recesses is the exhibition of a few trees just seen behind others the varieties of this mode of scenery simple as it is are infinite nature is wonderfully fertile the invention of the painter may form a composition more agreeable to the rules of his art than nature commonly produces but no invention can reach the varieties of particular objects  swanewelt and waterlo delighted in these close forestscenes they penetrated their retreats and when they found a little opening or recess that pleased them they fixed it on the spot they studied it is various forms  how the bold portuberances of an old trunk received the light and shade  how easily the large boughs parted and how negligently the smaller were interwoven  how elegantly the foliage hung and what various shapes it is little tuftings exhibited all these things they observed and copied with exact attention their landscape bare of objects and of the simplest composition had little to recommend it but the observance of the minutiae of nature these they characterized with truth and these alone have given a value to their works this praise however is chiefly waterlos  on the other hand claude pousin salvator and other masters who exhibited nature more at large took greater liberties their landscapes were generally carried into remote distance and the beauty of their extensive scenes depended more on composition and general effect than on the exact resemblance of particular objects  but the scenery of the internal parts of a forest is not merely confined to trees there is often an opportunity of introducing a little more variety the sandy bank mentioned above the piece of rocky ground or the winding road are sometimes found in forests and are always introduced with good effect some of the best of waterlos scenes are indebted to these circumstances for their beauty  a pool of water too is a lucky incident when it is shrouded with trees and reflects from it is deep black mirror the mossy branches of an oak or other objects in it is neighborhood which have received a strong touch of sunshine it never fails to please but it must receive it is black hue from clearness where a pool is the principal part of a little landscape the least muddiness or stain from clay or filth of any kind robs it of it is beauty  the green mantle of the standing pool as shakespeare calls it hurts the eye exceedingly from it is ambiguous texture it possesses neither the character of land nor of water  nor is the cottage which is often found in the woody scenes of the forest a circumstance without it is effect in nature at least it pleases nor only as the embellishment of a scene but as it shows us a dwelling where happiness may reside unsupported by wealth  as it shows us a resource where we may still continue to enjoy peace tho we should be deprived of all the favors of fortune yet on canvas where the forestview is formally introduced the cottage is an improper decoration in nature the eye sated with a profusion of rich forestscenes often seizes even the humblest circumstance as an object of relief but when a forestscene is simply and formally introduced it ought to appear like itself with the appendages of greatness there are seasons when a monarch may hold converse with the meanest of his subjects without injuring his dignity but it is not the season when he is seated on his throne a forestscene introduced in picture is introduced with distinction and calls for every appendage of grandeur to harmonize with it the cottage offends it should be a castle a bridge an aquaduct or some other object that suits it is dignity  with regard to aquaducts indeed the romans never suffered wood to grow near them lest it is roots or seeds should insinuate themselves into the crannies of the stone and injure the work but there can be no impropriety at this day in the introduction of a ruined aquaduct in a woody scene as trees of any magnitude may be supposed to have grown up since it had fallen to decay the scenery about the celebrated ruins of pontdugard in languedoc is woody and the immediate environs of it have all the rich furniture at least they had lately that a painter would desire  besides the foresttrees in which the dignity of woodland scenery consists it is enriched by a variety of humble plants which filling up the interstices mass and connect the whole these however rude we only wish to remove when they straggle too far from the clumps with which they are connected and appear as spots in the area or middle space between different combinations  a long catalogue might be given of these humble plants which are so useful in this harmonizing work but it would lead me into tedious detail the holly however should be distinguished in a general muster see page     in many situations it appears to great advantage but particularly growing round the stem as it often does of some noble oak on the foreground and filling up all the space to his lower boughs in summer it is a fine appendage and in autumn it is brilliant leaf and scarlet berry make a pleasing mixture with the wrinkled bark and hoary moss and auburn leaves of the venerable tree which it incircles  the hawthorn too preforms the same office with good effect tho as a single bush it is sometimes offensive see page  00  yet entangled with an oak or mixing with other trees it may be beautiful  nor are shrubs alone useful in harmonizing the forest the larger kinds of weeds and wild flowers have their effect in filling up the smaller vacances near the ground and add to the richness of the whole among these the heath and broom with their purple and yellow tints the foxglove with it is palered pendent bells the widespreading dock and many of the thistletribe are very beautiful the hue of the furze too is pleasant but in bloom it is luxuriant yellow is too powerful nothing can accompany it  but among all the minuter plants fern is the most picturesque i do not mean where it is spread in quantities but where it is sparingly and judiciously introduced in itself it is beautiful we admire the form of it is leaf  it is elegant mode of hanging  and it is darkbrown polished stem as an accompaniment also nothing is better suited to unite the higher plants with the ground while it is brightgreen hue in summer and it is ochertint in autumn join each season with it is correspondent tinge  the poet indeed who with all his cant is sometimes a truant to nature pays in general very little attention to these rougher objects of beauty his foregrounds are commonly adorned with the livelier tints of nature  each beauteous flower iris all hues roses and jessamin crocus and hyacinth with rich inlay broidering the ground  and if he deign to speak of ground embellished with these rough picturesque beauties he disdainfully calls it a place where  nothing teems but hateful docks rough thistles kecksies burs losing both beauty and utility   of all this undergrowth i know but one plant that is disagreeable and that is the bramble we sometimes see it with effect scrawling along the fragments of a rock or running among the rubbish of a ruin tho even then it is a coarse appendage but as a pendent plant it has no beauty it does not hang carelessly twisting round every support like the hop and others of the creeping tribe but forms one stiff unpliant curve nor has it any foliage to recommend it in other pendent plants the leaf is generally luxuriant and hangs loosely in rich festoons but in the suckers of a bramble the leaf is harsh shrivelled and discolored in short it is a plant which one should almost wish to have totally exterminated from landscape it has neither beauty in itself nor harmonizes with any thing around it and may be characterized as the most insignificant of all vegetable reptiles  but however beautiful these minuter plants and wild flowers may be in the natural scene yet no painter would endeavor to represent them with exactness they are too common too undignified and too much below his subject instead of gaining the character of an exact copier of nature by a nice representation of such trifles he would be esteemed puerile and pedantic fern perhaps or dock if his piece be large he might condescend to imitate but if he wanted a few touches of red or blue or yellow to enliven and enrich any particular spot in his foreground instead of aiming at the exact representation of any natural plant he will more judiciously give the tint he wants in a few random general touches of something like nature and leave the spectator if he please to find out a resemblance botanical precision may please us in the flowerpieces of van huysom but it would be paltry and affected in the landscapes of claude or salvator  the following remark i found in a work of dr johnsons which i transcribe not only because it is judicious and may be introduced here in place but because it affords a new argument to show the resemblance between poetry and painting johnson was a critic in the former but i never heard that he was a judge of the latter his opinion therefore in a point of this kind was unbiassed  the business of a poet says he is to examine  not the individual but the species  to remark general and large appearances he does not number the streaks of the tulip nor describe the different shades in the verdure of the forest he is to exhibit in his portraits of nature such prominent and striking features as recall the original to every mind and must neglect the minuter discriminations which one may have remarked and another have neglected for those characteristics which are alike obvious to attention and carelessness pr of abyssin p      sect vii having thus taken a view of the internal parts of a forest which consist chiefly of foregrounds we shall now consider the forest in a light just the reverse as consisting chiefly of distances in both lights it is greatly picturesque and only more or less so in either as the eye is more pleased with a close or a diffusive landscape  we skirt and penetrate the recesses of the woods for the closer view but we frequent the forestlawn and heath for the distant one the beauty of those scenes especially of the heath which is a large surface depends it is true in a great degree on the play and irregularities of the ground but chiefly it depends on the surrounding woods  the forestlawn in itself is a mere field it is only when adorned with the furniture of surrounding woods that it produces it is effect  the forestheath also when it is level and bounded only by the horizon has no charms for the eye when it consists of wellmixed inequalities of ground it gains somewhat more upon us but when it is bounded by woods in various parts and interspersed here and there with clumps which gently unite it is woody boundaries with it is area it becomes an interesting scene sometimes also a variety of furze fern and other wild plants stain it in many parts with beautiful tints often too a winding road passes through it or different roads traversing each other herds of cattle also of different kinds continually frequent it is open plains and when these circumstances happily unite the heath becomes one of the beautiful scenes of the forest  as it is distant wood however on which the forestlawn and especially the forestheath depend for their principal aid i shall dwell a little on this copious subject and shall consider it is most pleasing circumstances under the two heads  of such as are permanent and such as are incidental  but before i enter on the subject it may not be amiss to remind the reader once more see p      that as the vast scenes of extensive forests which we are now considering as distances are not subject to art the idea of suggesting rules to alter and improve them is absurd all we mean is to endeavor to teach the eye to admire justly and to apply to artificial landscape those observations which occur in natural for the source of beauty is the same in both  are  stretching along the horizon if it had been nearer the unvaried line would have been disagreable  an irregular summit with a regular base  an irregular base forming ays   the summit regularly varied    sect viii the permanent beauties of a distant woody scene arise first from it is form there is as much variety in the form of a distant wood as in that of a single tree we sometimes see continuous woods stretching along the horizon without any break all seems of equal growth and the summit of the wood is contained under one strait line this except in very remote distance is formal heavy and disgusting the shape of distant woods is then only picturesque when it is broken by a varied line this variation is in some degree occasioned by the different size of trees but as the size of trees where the distance is great has little effect it is chiefly and most essentially occasioned by the inequalities of the ground  a regular line at the base of a long range of woodyscenery is almost as disgusting as at the summit of it the woods must in some parts approach nearer the eye and in other parts retire forming the appearance of bays and promontories at least this is the most beautiful shape in which they appear as they sometimes do when the distance or the inequalities of the ground do not prevent the eye from seeing the base of the wood as the base is connected with the ground it is commonly much more obscured than the summit which ranges along the sky  all square round picked or other formal shapes in distant woods are disgusting  there should not only be breaks but contrast also between the several breaks of a distant forestscene a line regularly varied disgusts as much as an unvaried one  among the permanent beauties of distant woods may be reckoned also the various kinds of trees of which they are often composed unless the distance be great this mixture has it is effect in the variety it produces both in form and color large bodies of fir also and other species of pines have often a rich appearance in a distance among deciduous trees but they must be scotchsirs pinasters clusterpines or other clumpheaded trees the spiryheaded race the sprucefir the silverfir and the weymouthpine have here too as well as in the clump a bad effect single they are sometimes beautiful or two or three of them here and there by way of contrast in large plantations may be picturesque but i think they are never so in large bodies in general however the picturesque eye is little curious with regard to the kind of trees which compose a distant scene for there are few kinds which do not harmonize together it matters more in this bold style of landscape that the masses of each different kind should be large the opposition is then strongly marked and the contrast striking and beautiful if different trees are grouped in small bodies the effect is totally lost in distance  the last species of permanent beauty which we take notice of in distant forestscenery arises from works of art we mean not the embellishments of art but such rude works as may almost be styled the works of nature  the productions of convenience rather than of taste we certainly fetch the most picturesque objects from the grand storehouse of nature tho we condescend to admit artificial objects also but when they are admitted in this class they must always be of the rough rather than of the polished kind  such objects we often meet with in the wild scenes of the forest spires towers lodges bridges cattlesheds cottages winding pales and other things of the same kind which have often as beautiful an effect when seen at a distance as we have just observed they have when sparingly met with in the internal parts of a forest only the nearer the object is we expect it is form must be the more picturesque distance no doubt hides many defects and many an object may appear well in a remove which brought nearer would disgust the eye  sect ix having thus considered what may properly be called the permanent beauties of distant forestscenery we proceed to it is incidental beauties these arise principally from two causes the weather and the seasons as both are changeable they both produce various appearances the former affects chiefly the sky the latter the earth  the weather is a fruitful source of incidental beauty and there are few states of it which do not impress some peculiar and picturesque character on landscape to which it gives the leading tint  a country is chiefly affected by the weather when it is hazy and misty  or when the sky is invested with some cold tint  or when the sun rises  or when it shines full at noon  or when it sets  or lastly when the day is stormy each of these different states of the weather admits much variation but as it would be endless to trace these variations into detail i shall take notice only of the general effects of each and of these merely as they affect the forest in other works of this kind i have touched upon these sources of incidental beauty as they affect lakes and mountains see observations on the lakes of cumberland and highlands of scotland   the calm overcast soft day such as these climates often produce in the beginning of autumn hazy mild and undisturbed affords a beautiful medium spreading over the woods a seet gray tint which is especially favorable to their distant appearances the internal parts of the forest receive little advantages from this hazy medium but the various tuftings of distant woods are wonderfully sweetened by it and many a form and many a hue which in the full glare of sunshine would be harsh and discordant are softened and melted together in harmony  we often see the effects of this mode of atmosphere in various species of landscape but it has no where a better effect than on the woods of the forest nothing appears through mist more beautiful than trees a little removed from the eye when they are opposed to trees at hand for as the foliage of a tree consists of a great number of parts the contrast is very pleasing between the varied surface of the tree at hand and the dead unvaried appearance of the removed one  the lightmist is only a greater degree of haziness it is object is a nearer distance as a remote one is totally obscured by it  in this situation of the atmosphere not only all the strong tints of nature are obscured but all the smaller variations of form are lost we look only for a general mass of softened harmony and sober coloring unmarked by any strength of effect the vivid hues of autumn particularly appear to great advantage through this medium  sometimes these mists are partial and if they happen to coincide with the composition of the landscape this partiality is attended with peculiar beauty i have remarked in other works of this kind see observations on scotland v ii p      that when some huge promontory emerges from a spreading mist which hangs over one part of it it not only receives the advantage of contrast but it also becomes an object of double grandeur we often see the woods of the forest also with peculiar advantage emerging through a mist in the same style of greatness  i have known likewise a nearer distance strongly illumined produce a good effect through a light drizzling shower  nearly allied to mists is another incidental appearance that of smoke which is often attended with peculiar beauty in woody scenes when we see it spreading in the forest glade and forming a soft bluish background to the trees which intercept it it shows their foliage and ramification to great advantage  sometimes also a good effect arises when the sky under the influence of a bleak north wind cold and overcast is hung with blue or purple clouds lowering over the horizon if under that part of the atmosphere the distant forest happens to range it is overspread with a deep blue or a purple tint from the reflection of the clouds and makes a very picturesque appearance  and yet i should be cautious in advising the painter to introduce it with that full strength in which he may sometimes perhaps observe it the appearance of blue and purple trees unless in very remote distance offends and tho the artist may have authority from nature for his practice yet the spectator who is not versed in such effects may be displeased painting like poetry is intended to excite pleasure and tho the painter with this view should avoid such images as are trite and vulgar yet he should seize those only which are easy and intelligible neither poetry nor painting is a proper vehicle for the depths of learning the painter therefore will do well to avoid every uncommon appearance in nature  within this caution however he will spread the prevailing tint of the day over his landscape  over his whole landsape nature tinges all her pictures in this harmonious manner it is the greyish tint or it is the blue or it is the purple or it is one of the vivid tints of illumination red or yellow  whatever it be it blends with all the lights and shadows of the piece this great principle of harmony which arises from the reflection of color in some degree even when the air is diaphanous must be observed by every painter who wishes to procure an effect his picture must be painted from one pallet and one key as in music must prevail through his whole composition as the air however is the vehicle of all these tints it is evident that in distances in which we see through a deeper medium of tinged air they will prevail most and of course very little on foregrounds the painter must observe this rule of nature by bringing his tints regularly forward and his foregrounds he must compose of such colors mute or vivid as accord best with the general hue of his landscape yet still he will be cautious how he spreads even the prevailing tint too strongly much error has arisen from this source and some painters under the idea of harmonizing have given us blue and purple pictures i know not whether poussin himself did not sometimes fall into this fault natures veil is always pure and transparent yet tho in itself hardly discoverable it will still give it is kindred tinge to the features which are seen through it  we have now considered incidental beauty as arising from the colder modifications of the air we use the word colder not in a physical but in a picturesque sense as productive only of sober coloring unattended with any force of effect  we come now to a more illustrious family of tints the offspring of the sun these are fertile sources of incidental beauty among the woods of the forest the characteristic of them is strong effect  let us first examine the incident of a rising sun  the first dawn of day exhibits a beautiful obscurity  when the east begins just to brighten with the reflections only of effulgence a pleasing progressive light dubious and amusing is thrown over the face of things a single ray is able to assist the picturesque eye which by such slender aid creates a thousand imaginary forms if the scene be unknown and as the light steals gradually on is amused by correcting it is vague ideas by the real objects what in the confusion of twilight perhaps seemed a stretch of rising ground broken into various parts becomes now vast masses of wood and an extent of forest  as the sun begins to appear above the horizon another change takes place what was before only form being now enlightened begins to receive effect this effect depends on two circumstances the catching lights which touch the summits of every object and the mistiness in which the rising orb is commonly inveloped  the effect is often pleasing when the sun rises in unsullied brightness diffusing its ruddy light over the upper parts of objects which is contrasted by the deeper shadows below yet the effect is then only transcendent when he rises accompanied by a train of vapors in a misty atmosphere among lakes and mountains this happy accompaniment often forms the most astonishing visions and yet in the forest it is nearly as great with what delightful effect do we sometimes see the suns disk just appear above a woody hill or in shakespeares language  stand tiptoe on the misty mountains top and dart his diverging rays through the rising vapor the radiance catching the tops of the trees as they hang midway upon the shaggy steep and touching here and there a few other prominent objects imperceptibly mixes its ruddy tint with the surrounding mists setting on fire as it were their upper parts while their lower skirts are lost in a dark mass of varied confusion in which trees and ground and radiance and obscurity are all blended together when the eye is fortunate enough to catch the glowing instant for it is always a vanishing scene it furnishes an idea worth treasuring among the choicest appearances of nature  mistiness alone we have observed occasions a confusion in objects which is often picturesque but the glory of the vision depends on the glowing lights which are mingled with it  landscapepainters in general pay too little attention to the discriminations of morning and evening we are often at a loss to distinguish in pictures the rising from the setting sun tho their characters are very different both in the lights and shadows the ruddy lights indeed of the evening are more easily distinguished but it is not perhaps always sufficiently observed that the shadows of the evening are much less opaque than those of the morning they may be brightened perhaps by the numberless rays floating in the atmosphere which are incessantly reverberated in every direction and may continue in action after the sun is set whereas in the morning the rays of the preceding day having subsided no object receives any light but from the immediate luster of the sun whatever becomes of the theory the fact i believe is well ascertained  the incidental beauties which the meridian sun exhibits are much fewer than those of the rising sun in summer when he rides high at noon and sheds his perpendicular ray all is illumination there is no shadow to balance such a glare of light no contrast to oppose it the judicious artist therefore rarely represents his objects under a vertical sun and yet no species of landscape bears it so well as the scenes of the forest the tuftings of the trees  the recesses among them  and the lighter foliage hanging over the darker may all have an effect under a meridian sun i speak chiefly however of the internal scenes of the forest which bear such total brightness better than any other as in them there is generally a natural gloom to balance it the light obstructed by close intervening trees will rarely predominate hence the effect is often fine a strong sunshine striking a wood through some fortunate chasm and reposing on the tuftings of a clump just removed from the eye and strengthened by the deep shadows of the trees behind appears to great advantage especially if some noble tree standing on the foreground in deep shadow flings athwart the sky it is dark branches here and there illumined with a splendid touch of light  in an open country the most fortunate circumstance that attends a meridian sun is cloudy weather which occasions partial lights then it is that the distant forestscene is spread with lengthened gleams while the other parts of the landscape are in shadow the tuftings of trees are particularly adapted to catch this effect with advantage there is a richness in them from the strong opposition of light and shade which is wonderfully fine a distant forest thus illumined wants only a foreground to make it highly picturesque  as the sun descends the effect of it is illumination becomes stronger it is a doubt whether the rising or the setting sun is more picturesque the great beauty of both depends on the contrast between splendour and obscurity but this contrast is produced by these different incidents in different ways the grandest effects of the rising sun are produced by the vapors which invelop it the setting sun rests it is glory on the gloom which often accompanies it is parting rays a depth of shadow hanging over the eastern hemisphere gives the beams of the settingsun such powerful effect that although in fact they are by no means equal to the splendour of a meridian sun yet through force of contrast they appear superior  a distant forestscene under this brightened gloom is particularly rich and glows with double splendour the verdure of the summer leaf and the varied tints of the autumnal one are all lighted up with the most resplendent colors  the internal parts of the forest are not so happily disposed to catch the effects of a settingsun the meridian ray we have seen may dart through the openings at the top and produce a picture see page      but the flanks of the forest are generally too well guarded against it is horizontal beams sometimes a recess fronting the west may receive a beautiful light spreading in a lengthened gleam amidst the gloom of the woods which surround it but this can only be had in the outskirts of the forest sometimes also we find in it is internal parts tho hardly in it is deep recesses splendid lights here and there catching the foliage which tho in nature generally too scattered to produce an effect yet if judiciously collected may be beautiful on canvas  we sometimes also see in a woody scene coruscations like a bright star occasioned by a sunbeam darting through an eyelethole among the leaves many painters and especially rubens have been fond of introducing this radiant spot in their landscapes but in painting it is one of those trifles which produces no effect nor can this radiance be given in poetry indeed it may produce a pleasing image shakespeare has introduced it beautifully where speaking of the force of truth entering a guilty conscience he compares it to the sun which  fires the proud tops of the eastern pines and darts his light through every guilty hole it is one of those circumstances which poetry may offer to the imagination but the pencil cannot well produce to the eye and if it could it were better omitted as it attracts the eye from what is more interesting  under the sameness of italian skies the beauties of a settingsun are hardly known there the radiant orb courses his way with equal splendour from one end of the hemisphere to the other nothing refracts his beam to the vapors of grosser climates we owe those beautiful tints which accompany his whole journey through the skies but especially his parting ray  thus far the sources of incidental beauty are all derived from milder skies but the turbulence of the atmosphere is still a more fruitful source of picturesque effect in the forest as in other scenes unaided indeed by sunshine the storm has little power but when the force of the tempest separates the clouds into large dark unequal forms and the rays of the sun stream from behind them athwart a clear horizon if the objects correspond a very sublime picture is exhibited  no master was better acquainted with these circumstances than the younger vandervelt in all his seastorms he avails himself of them and is remarkable for the grand masses of light and shade which he produces  the landstorm is equally a source of beauty when the tempest scowls over the forest as we traverse it is deep recesses what grandeur do the internal parts of it receive from the casual ray darting upon them or when we view it as a distant object and see the storm blackening behind trees with what wonderful effect does the sun in an opposite direction strike their tufted heads but if that sun be setting while the tempest is brewing over the hemisphere black toward the east  lurid  more purple  and glowing with red as it advances toward the west  then it is that the utmost value is given to it is effect the castle the lake or the forestscene whether viewed in shadow against the ruddy light or illumined under the storm appear in full grandeur and we see all that light and shade in extreme contention yet fully harmonized can produce  vain are the hopes by coloring to display the bright effulgence of the noontide ray or paint the fullorbed ruler of the skies with pencils dipped in dull terrestrial dies but when mild evening sheds her golden light when morn appears arrayed in modest white when soft suffusions of the vernal shower dims the pale sun or at the thundering hour when wrapped in crimson clouds he hides his head then catch the glow and on the canvas spread i know no appearance indeed in nature that is more awfully grand than the conjunction of a storm and a sunset on some noble mass of forestscenery we may easily conceive that ignorance and superstition might magnify such a resplendnt gloom into something supernatural in a passage which i lately quoted from virgil an idea of this kind is very picturesquely as well as poetically introduced it is in the interview between aeneas and evander when the old chief informs his noble guest that frequently in tempests the simple arcadians believed they saw heavenly forms behind the groves of the tarpeian rock  hoc nemus hunc inquit frondoso vertice collem quis deus incertum est habitat deus arcades ipsum credunt se vidisse jovem cum saepe nigrantem aegida concuteret dextra nimbosque cieret as these great effects are certainly the most picturesque of all aerial appearances it is rather surprising that landscapepainters in general make so little use of them it is much more common to see landscape painted under the uniform brightness of an equal light than to see it illumined by these grand circumstances of the atmosphere in which light and shade are so happily combined  the landscapepainter says that effects like these are uncommon and he chooses to paint nature as he generally sees her  the idea is good but certainly these effects are common enough to have been often the object of every ones observation he will not i suppose take the commonest objects as he finds them and if he select his objects why not the most beautiful mode of exhibiting them the great effects of morning and evening suns of mists and storms are not more uncommon than natural combinations of beautiful objects  but the real truth seems to be that such effects are the most difficult to manage and require great study and observation the artist therefore who paints for his bread rather than his character an evil attending the art which can never be removed chooses such an exhibition of light and shade as is the most easy to himself and may likewise be most pleasing to the generality of his undistinguishing employers hence we have so great a number of glaring landscapes which depend on nothing but the beauty and coloring of a few particular objects without any attention to those grand effects which make landscape by many degrees the most sublime and interesting  it is perhaps one of the great errors in painting as indeed it is in literary as well as in picturesque composition to be more attentive to the finishing of parts than to the production of a whole whereas the masters great care should be first to contrive a whole and then to adapt the parts as artificially as he can i speak of imaginary landscape when he paints a particular view his management must be just the reverse he has the parts given him and he must form them into a whole as he can and this is often difficult  there is nothing however that tends so much to produce a whole as a proper distribution of light and shade which we best obtain when we can present our landscape under one of these grand effects of nature a common sunshine furnishes lights  not masses  it may throw a beautiful illumination on particular objects but the grand effects of nature furnish the best opportunities of forming the masses of each  what gives the most grandeur to these effects is a predominancy of shade which has always more dignified ideas annexed to it than a predominancy of light and yet how little is this observed in the generality of pictures and prints you see the balance on the other side and are often offended with glaring spots of light which destroy the idea of a whole the painter should examine his piece therefore with great care he may put out one light after another and reviewing his work with a fresh eye may still find some glaring part to erase before he venture it abroad on this occasion he may apply with good sense and form into an adage a very nonsensical passage as it appears in shakespeare put out the light  and then  put out the light  if the artificial representation of every subject seems rather to require a balance of shade in sublime subjects it is still more required all writers on sublime subjects deal in shadows and obscurity see burke on the sublime  the grandeur of jehovah is commonly represented by the hebrew writers behind a cloud the imagination makes up deficiences by grander ideas than it is possible for the pencil to produce many images owe much of their sublimity to their indistinctness and frequently what we call sublime is the effect of that heat and fermentation which ensues in the imagination from it is ineffectual efforts to conceive some dark obscure idea beyond it is grasp bring the same within the compass of it is comprehension and it may continue great but it will cease to be sublime this speces of the sublime is oftener found in the composition of the poet than of the painter in general the poet has great advantages over the painter in the process of sublimication if the term may be allowed the business of the former is only to excite ideas that of the latter to represent them the advantage of excited over represented ideas is very great inasmuch as they are in some degree the readers own production and are susceptible of those modifications which make them peculiarly acceptable to the mind in which they are raised whereas the others being confined within a distinct and unalterable outline admit of none of the modifications which flatter the particular taste of the spectator but must make their way by their own intrinsic force  sect x we have now treated of the incidental beauty of forestscenery as arising from the weather we examine it next as arising from the seasons each season has beauties peculiar to itself  the early spring is not very favorable to the study of landscape nature is yet unfolding herself and is in her progress only to perfection the bloom of many trees gay and fantastic in it is coloring and form may be beautiful and curious in itself but is illadapted to harmonize and unite with other objects and yet we sometimes see tints which produce a pleasing effect the budding oak displays great variety among neighboring oaks the bud of one is a tender green of another almost yellow of a third an osierbrown perhaps nearly inclining to red yet each of these as it opens will probably accord harmoniously with the tint of it is neighbor but all trees have not the accommodating qualities of the oak the early shoots particularly of evergreens are seldom in harmony with the foliage of the parenttree  as summer advances the forest assumes a more determined and connected form the germs and leaves are all unfolded the hue of the foliage becomes harmonious the tuftings also of the trees are prepared as beds for masses of light to rest on which the spray and the bloom of early spring unconnected and unformed could not fully receive  so far we have gained by the progress of the year but the great objection to summer arises from the uniformity of it is hue the face of nature is covered with one unvaried mantle of green for tho the nicer eye may trace many shades in this general color yet on the whole it is both too vivid and too uniform for the pencil  the reign of summer scarcely indures three months the leaves within that period begin to change their hue and give way to autumn which presents an appearance much more picturesque and indeed the most replete with incidental beauty of any season of the year this is so evident that painters have chosen the autumn with almost universal predilection as the season of landscape the leafy surface of the forest is at that time so varied and the masses of foliage are yet so full that they allow the artist great latitude in producing his tints without injuring the breadth of his lights   the fading manycoloured woods shade deepening over shade the country round imbrown a varied umbrage dusk and dun of every hue from wan declining green to sooty dark  yet the autumn in it is wane is not so pleasing it has too forlorn an aspect the leaves are withered and their tufts shrivelled and shapeless this remark however affects trees only at hand the homeplantation suffers where you walk so near the fading tree as to see nature in decay but at a distance the withered effect is not easily discerned  in the wane of autumn however there are other defects the ash and some other trees have deserted their station in the forest they have shed their leaves and left a cheerless blank  besides the verdure of the forest is too much wasted and the brown and yellow tints beautiful as they are become too predominant for the prevalence of these hues in autumn fatigues the eye no less than the prevalence of green in summer only indeed the autumnal tints will ever be more varied but the intermediate time is the season of picturesque beauty when the greens and the browns and the yellows are blended together by a variety of middle tints which often create the most exquisite harmony  of all the hues of autumn those of the oak are commonly the most harmonious as it is vernal tints are more varied than those of other trees so are it is autumnal in an oaken wood you see every variety of green and every variety of brown owing either to the different exposure of the tree it is different soil or it is different nature but it is not my business to enquire into causes  in the beechen grove you seek in vain for this variety in the early autumn indeed you see it when the extremities only of the tree are just tinged with ochre but as the year advances the eye is generally fatigued with one deep monotony of orange tho among all the hues of autumn it is in itself perhaps the most beautiful the painter imitates it the most happily by a touch of terra de sienna but the eye is palled with beauty in profusion and calls for contrast  the same uniformity reigns tho of a different hue when ash or elm prevails no fading foliage indeed of any one kind that i know produces harmony except that of the oak  the hues however of the distant forest when most discordant are often harmonized by the intervening trees on the foreground we can bear the glow of the distant beechwood when it is contrasted at hand by a spreading oak whose foliage has yet scarce lost it is summertint  or by an elm or an ash whose fading leaves have assumed a yellowish hue  but after all the autumnal forest is an instrument easily untuned one frosty night or parching blast may introduce some striking discord tho on the other hand it is true by softening some discordant tint it may as easily introduce a harmony which did not exist before here art comes to the aid of nature the pencil fixes the scene in the happy moment and the fading tints of autumn become perennial  i have known some planters endeavor in their improvements to range their trees in such a manner as in the wane of the year to receive all the beauty of autumnal coloring the attempt is vain unless they could so command the weather as to check or produce at pleasure those tints which nature has subjected to so many accidents a general direction is all that can be given oak is rarely in discord but beech and elm can as rarely be depended on all must be left to chance and after the utmost that art can do the wild forest with it is casual discords and monotonies will present a thousand beauties which no skill of man can rival  thus the beauties of the waning year are fixed rather by the weather than by the calendar we often see them vanish in october and we sometimes see a fine autumnal effect in the beginning of november nay even later we may trace the beauties of the declining year and  catch the last smile of autumn beaming over the yellow woods   even when the beauty of the landscape is gone the charms of autumn may remain after the rage of summer is abated and before the rigours of winter are yet set in there are often days of such heavenly temperature that every mind must feel their effect thompson to whom the beauties of nature were familiar thus describes a day of this kind  the morning shines serene in all it is dewy beauties bright unfolding fair the last autumnal day over all the soul it is sacred influence breaths inflames imagination through the breast infuses every tenderness and far beyond dim earth exalts the swelling thought to the picturesque beauties of autumn we may add that the sunsets at that season are commonly richer than when the days are of the same length in the spring or indeed at any other season  but the leafy forest is not solely the object of incidental beauty the picturesque eye finds great amusement even in it is wintryscenes when it has thrown it is rich mantle aside and appears to the common eye naked and deformed  the hazy sunshine of a frosty morning is accompanied with an indistinctness peculiar to itself the common haziness of a summerday spreads over the landscape one general gray tint and as we have had occasion to remark in different circumstances is often the source of great beauty but the effect we are here observing is of a different kind it is generally more partial  more rich  and mixing with streaks of different colored clouds which often form behind it produces a very pleasing effect  great beauty also arises from the different tints of the spray the dark brown spray of the birch for instance has a good effect among that of a lighter tinge and when the forest is deep all this little bushiness of ramification has in some degree the effect of foliage  the boles of trees likewise and all their larger limbs add a rich variety and contrast to the forest the smooth and the rough the light and the dark often beautifully opposing each other in winter the stem predominates as the leaf in summer it is amusing in one season to see the branches losing and discovering themselves among the foliage and it is amusing also in the other to walk through the desolate forest and see the various combinations of stems  the traversing of the branches across each other in so many beautiful directions  and the pains which nature takes in forming a wood as well as a single tree see page  0   she leaves no part unclosed but pushing in the branch or the spray as the opening allows she fills all vacant space by uniting the heads of the trees while every step we take presents us with some beautiful variety in her mode of forming the fretted roof under which we walk  in winter too the effect of evergreens is often pleasing the holly when it happens to be well combined and mixed in just proportion makes an agreeable contrast the ivy hanging round the oak if it be not too profuse we have already observed is a beautiful appendage to it is grandeur i have seen some parts of the forest where the stem of almost every tree was covered with it this indeed was not picturesque but it gave the wood a very odd appearance by exhibiting so total an inversion of nature in summer the tops of the trees are green and their stems commonly bare here the tops were bare while the stems were in full leaf  in a light hoarfrost before the sun and air begin to shake the powder from the trees the wintry forest is often beautiful and almost exhibits the effect of tufted foliage  as single objects also trees under this circumstance are curious the black branches whose undersides are not covered with rhyme often make a singular contrast with the whitened spray trees of minuter ramification and foliage as the beech the elm and the fir appear under this circumstance to most advantage the ash the horsechesnut and other plants of coarser form have no great beauty  trees also thus covered with hoarfrost have sometimes  if not a picturesque  at least an uncommon effect when they appear against a lurid cloud especially when the sun shines strongly upon them  but although many appearances in winter are beautiful and amusing and some of them even picturesque yet the judicious painter will rarely introduce them in landscape because he has choice of more beautiful effects when nature appears dressed to more advantage  picturesque pleasure arises from two sources  from the beauty and combination of the objects represented and from the exactness of the representation thus we are pleased with the picture of a noble landscape the composition of which is just and the lights welldisposed and yet a sort of pleasure arises from seeing a bright table a dealboard or a rasher of bacon naturally represented deceptions of this kind used frequently to be hung up in the exhibitionroom in london among the works of capital artists where indeed they were unworthy of a place  since this passage was written i have met with the following excellent remark in one of sir joshua reynold s notes on mr masons translation of fresnoy p      deception which is so often recommended by writers on the theory of painting instead of advancing the art is in reality carrying it back to it is infant state the first essays of painting were certainly nothing but mere imitations of individual objects and when this amounted to a deception the artist had accomplished his purpose    but while the former of these is the work of genius the latter is a mere mechanical knack the one therefore is admired by the man of taste  the other except for a moment only by the ignorant and uninformed  this is just the case before us the painter who chooses a wintersubject in general gives up composition and effect to show how naturally he can represent snow or hoarfrost it is almost impossible to produce a good effect with these appendages of winter they must naturally create false and glaring lights to which the painter generally makes his composition subservient  among the sources of incidental beauty in a forest may be mentioned what perhaps may appear odd the felling of timber if you wish to fell trees with some particular view to improvement the intention is often frustrated it must be done very artfully or in general your design will be apparent and disgusting to the eye the master of the scene himself who is always on the spot and examines it frequently from every stand if he be a man of taste will be the best improver and direct the felling axe with most judgment at the same time we frequently see trees cut down carelessly for the purpose of utility which have opened greater beauties than any they possessed themselves when standing tho the preconceived loss of them was greatly lamented but this can only happen where trees abound  i shall conclude this enumeration of the incidental beauties belonging to forestscenery with an appendage which we frequently see in it  that of a timberwain an object of the most picturesque kind especially when drawn by oxen here the tree when dead adorns again the landscape which it adorned when living a gilded chariot is an object which art has industriously tricked out and decorated it is of a piece therefore with all such artificial objects as are the most unlike nature whereas the timberwain is at least a piece of simple art and the rudeness of it is form and materials is a property which it has in common with the works of nature  oxen too are more picturesque in themselves than horses  much of the beauty however of this incident arises from it is being adapted to the scene a wain of timber is much more beautiful in a forest than it would be in the streets of a town  thus i have enumerated the most common sources of permanent and incidental beauty in forestlandscape i have insisted only on the most common sources an eye inquisitive in the scenes of nature will investigate many others  having detained the reader perhaps too long in this examination i shall endeavor to relieve him by a few general observations on foresthistory  sect xi perhaps of all species of landscape there is none which so universally captivates mankind as forestscenery and our prepossession in favor of it appears in nothing more than in this that the inhabitants of bleak countries totally destitute of wood are generally considered from the natural feelings of mankind as the objects of pity  pliny has given us a view of this kind which he tells us he took himself upon the spot it represents a bleak seacoast in zealand before that country was embanked the inhabitants of which he speaks of as the most wretched of human beings it is true there are other wants besides that of scenery which enter into the idea of their wretchedness but i dare affirm that if pliny had found the same people with all their wants about them in a country richly furnished with wood he would have spoken of them in different language  plinys picture is in itself so good and is likewise so excellent a contrast to the scenes which we have just examined that i think it worth inserting i shall rather give the general sense of the passage than an exact translation of it  this coast says he lies so much lower than the ocean that the tides daily overflow it the inhabitants build their huts on little eminences which they either find or construct on the shores and which serve to raise their dwellings just above the watermark these dwellings or rather cabins when the tide rises often seem like floating boats and when it retires the inhabitants appear like stranded mariners and their cottages like wrecks their harvest is the ebbing of the sea during which they are every where seen running about in quest of fish and pursuing them in each little creek of the shore as the tide deserts it they have neither horse nor cow nor domestic animal of any kind and as to game they have not the least appearance of a bush to shelter it the whole employment of this wretched people is fishing they make their nets of seaweed and dry a kind slimy mud for fuel rainwater is their only drink which they preserve in ditches dug before their cabins see plinys not hist book xvi cap     such is plinys picture of this bleak and desolate country from the very feelings of nature we shudder at it whereas the idea of the forest is pleasing to every one the case is tho there may be as much real misery amidst beautiful scenery yet beautiful scenery covers it wretchedness is often felt under splendid apparel but it does not strike us in such attire as it does in rags  that man was originally a forestanimal appears from every page of his early history trace the first accounts of any people and you will find them the inhabitants of woods if woods were to be found in the countries in which they lived caves thickets and trunks of trees were their retreats and acorns their food with such beasts as they took in hunting which afforded them only a precarious supply  haec nemora indigenae fauni nymphaeque tenebant gensque virum truncis et duro robore nata born and living in trunks of trees as ruaeus well explains it not produced from them  queis neque mos neque cultus erat nec jungere tauros aut componere opes norant ant parcere parto sed rami atque asper victu venatus alebat if indeed they lived near a coast like the zealanders described by pliny they obtained a livelihood by fishing but with the savages of the coast we have nothing to do our attention is only engaged by the savage of the woods  while man continued thus an inmate of the forest it is possible he might have sagacity to build himself a hut of boughs which he might cover with clods and yet it is more probable that while he continued the mere child of nature he was contented with the simple shelter which virgil above supposes his common mother furnished the imbowering thicket or the hollow trunk as summer or winter led him to prefer an open or a closer cover strabo speaks of certain asiatics even so late in the history of mankind as the times of pompey the great who harbored like birds in the tops of trees lib xii p     edit casaub  and i think the savages about botanybay are not represented by our late discoverers in a much more improved condition  man in this solitary state for scarcity of food forbad any enlarged ideas of society waged but unequal war with his brothersavages the brutes most of them outstripped him in speed many of them contended with him in strength and some nearly equalled him in sagacity  the human savage thus finding himself hard put to it even to defend his own might look round for assistance the dog whose friendly manners that there is something very harmonious between the human and canine nature is the observation of all naturalists every other domestic animal is attached to his habitation the dog alone to his master build a shed for horses or cows in any place and let them be well supplied with food and they are perfectly happy they know their keeper indeed but they are no way disturbed if his loss be supplied by another who feeds them as well let a family leave a house and a new family occupy it the cat complains of nothing except the bustle of a remove but the dog carry him where you will and feed him with the most grateful food enjoys for a long time no happiness if he be deprived of his beloved master he forms new attachments in time but he never forgets an old friendship the friendship of a dog homer has thought of consequence to introduce into an epic poem might solicit his acquaintance was probably one of his first associates in those countries where dogs were to be found this union made a powerful party in the forest the great object of it however was rather food than conquest the dog and his master were both carnivorous animals and they soon began to gratify their appetites at the expense of their fellowbrutes the one conducting and the other executing the plan few creatures could oppose them  but man from the beginning was an ambitious animal having filled his belly he aspired after dominion for this purpose it was necessary for him to procure a better ally than that he had chosen he had yet but little connection with his fellow to join now and then in a huntingparty was all the intercourse he knew it was little more than such a league as is found among wolves jackalls and other animals that hunt in packs ideas of society however by degrees took place the dawnings of social compact appeared man now threw off the brute and thought it good to leave his scattered tenements and to assemble in hords the rudiments of law were traced and some rude sketch of subordination in earnest he began now to show his dominion by fellowship he had increased his strength the horse the bullock and other animals were reclaimed from the forest some for social assistance and others for a less precarious supply of food while the shaggy tenants of the forest which were hostile to his plans began every where to give way prowling only by night and skulking by day in such deep recesses as might best secure them from the formidable assocication which had taken place  but still his native forest was mans delight here in some opening surrounded with woods the hord first settled here the first attempts of architecture were made the krail was laid out by rule and line and the first draughts of regular defense were imagined caesar with all his boasted conquests found the gauls the britons and the germans scarce emerging from this state of barbarism his commentaries every where show them to have been forest people retreating before him into their fastnesses and impeding his march by felling timber in his way the britons he expressly tells us oppidum britanni vocant quum sylvas impeditas vallo atque fossa municrunt de bell gal lib v  gave the name of a town to a part of a forest which they had fortified with a rampart and a ditch  but caesar saw the british town only in time of war strabo gives us a picture of one in time of peace forests says he were the only towns in use among them which were formed by cutting down a large circle of wood and erecting huts within it and sheds for cattle lib vii p     edit casaub  the same author afterward describing a town of this kind shows more exactly the mode of fortifying it it was the practice he tells us to intermix and weave together the branches of thorny trees and strengthen them with stakes  as the arts of civilization increased man began to feel that the forest could not afford him all the conveniences he wished wants multiplied upon him which he could not indulge amidst it is recesses he chose fertile situations for tillage  the neighborhood of rivers for mills and manufactures  and descended to the seacoast for commerce which he extended to the most distant parts  thus genial intercourse and mutual aid cheered what were else an universal shade called nature from her ivymantled den and softened human rockwork into men when man became thus refined we leave him when he relinquished the forest we have no farther connection with him his haunts and habits are no longer the object of conjecture they become the subject of recorded history to the sage historian therefore we now consign him and return to the forest which at this day in most parts of the world where any forests remain is left in possession of the brute creation  under the burning suns of lybia in the forests of zara and bildulgerid the lordly lion reigns he harbors too in the woods of india but there he is an ignoble brute compared with the lion of africa the african lion is a beast of unrivalled prowess nothing appalls him from his dark recesses in the forest he sometimes eyes the numerous caravan consisting of men horses and camels marching slowly along the burning sands of barca he lashes his tail collects his strength and bounding forward tho single attacks the whole he is received by a brigade of pointed spears and soon overpowered but in the bravery of his soul he dies without a wish to retreat  in the forests of mallabar and bengal the tiger roams of this animal there are various kinds the largest and fiercest is called the royaltyger of all the savages of the forest he is the most active the most insidious and the most cruel  the forests of india are inhabited also by the gentle and inoffensive elephant this animal commonly marches in social bands the traveller hears them at a distance as they traverse the forest marking their rout by the crush and desolation of thickets and intervening woods he listens without dismay and even waits to be a spectator of the unweildy procession as it moves along  the monkey inhabits the woods both of africa and india and what is singular where he chooses to take possession he may be called the lord of the forest the lion himself gives way not being able to bear as travelers report the incessant tricking of that mischievous brute whose agility prevents correction but the human figure is of all others the object of his highest derision if such a phenomenon appear in his domains the whole society are called together by a whoop from curiosity they proceed to insolence chattering grinning and throwing drown fruit cones withered sticks or any thing their situation furnishes firearms can scarce repress them  in some forests where the ape the baboon and other larger species of this disgusting tribe inhabit the traveller must be well guarded to pass in security  in southamerica in the wide forests of brazil and paraguay along the banks of the amazon the cougar a species of tiger is the most formidable animal possessed of amphibious nature he plunges into the river and carries his devastations beyond that mighty stream buffon relates that he has been known to cross the sea in large companies between the continent and the island of cayenne and in the infancy of that colony to have kept it in constant alarms  in north america the moosedeer seems entitled to the appellation of lord of the forest an animal represented by many travelers as high as an elephant and of a nature as gentle with stately tread he traverses the vast woods of fir and crops the cones and pinetops beyond the reach of any other animal  when the forest is covered with snow and crusted over with frost the wild american marks him for certain destruction his feet sink deep in the faithless surface and his flight is impeded while his pursuers mounted on snowshoes attack and retreat at pleasure assailing him with shot or arrows on every side and when he falls half a township is employed to drag him to their habitations where the noble carcass is received in triumph and at once suspends the effects of famine if food be plentiful he is hunted for his skin but tho his nature is gentle like many other animals he will turn upon his pursuer if he be wounded he fights with his forefeet we have a story well authenticated of a hunter on whom a wounded moosedeer turned he was found in the woods pounded into a jelly his very bones were broken in pieces and the deer having exhausted his fury was found lying dead beside him  the woods of germany nourish the wild boar a beast by no means among the most ignoble of the forest his form the shape of his head his short erect ears his tusks his thick muscular shoulders adorned with bristles and the lightness of his hind quarters so contrary to the domestichog which is a round lump are all highly picturesque such also are his color a grisly brown and his coat covered in many parts as well as his shoulders with long sweeping bristles nor are his gait attitude and motion at all inferior to his form  this beast during the three first years of his life herds with the litter among which he was produced he is then called by foresters a beast of company in his fourth year he assumes the title of a wild boar  ranges the forest alone  becomes royal game  and at this day furnishes the chief amusement of half the princes of the empire  from the forests of the pyrennees when winter rages the famished wolves rush down in troops all the country is in arms and the utmost vigilance and force of men and dogs can scarce repress such a torrent of invasion  in the gloomy forests of lapland where the pine is covered with black moss the hardy reindeer browzes if he descend into the plain his food differs only in hue with these two kinds of moss the black and the white the whole face of lapland is discolored and when the diminutive native of the country sees the wastes around him abound with this semivegetable he blesses his stars and calls it luxury his reindeer supported by this cheerless pasturage supplies him with every thing that nature wants it gives him food  it gives him milk  it gives him clothing  and carries him wrapped in fur and seated in his sledge with amazing velocity from one desert to another  thus most of the forests of the earth became the possession of the brute creation in the forests of sumatra we are told that wildbeasts at this very day depopulate whole villages see marsdens hist of sumatra  in other savage countries man and beast are still jointtenants yet in general even the barbarian is taught by example to leave the forest for a more convenient abode  sect xii but tho man had deserted the forest as a dwelling and had left it to be inhabited by beasts it soon appeared that he had no intention of giving up his right of dominion over it in a course of ages as population increased he began to find it in his way in one part it occupied grounds fit for his plough in another for the pasturage of his domestic cattle and in some parts it afforded shelter for his enemies he soon showed the beasts they were only tenants at will he began amain to lay about him with his axe the forest groaned and receded from it is ancient bounds it is amazing what ravages he made in his original habitation through every quarter of the globe the fable was realized man begged of the forest a handle to his hatchet and when he had obtained the boon he used it in felling the whole  in very early days this devastation began when joshua divided the land of promise among the israelites the children of joseph made complaint that their lot was insufficient for their numbers get thee up to the woodcountry said joshua and cut down for thyself there in the land of the perizzites the mountain shall be thine for it is a wood and thou shall cut it down and the outgoings of it shall be thine josh xvii      the mighty forest of lebanon which once found employment for eighty thousand hewers   kings v     is now dwindled to a dozen trees the woods which covered the island of delos had entirely disappeared even in the time of herodotus in all the new peopled parts of america it was the sole employment of each colony to cut down wood and it is astonishing what devastation the woods of these countries have suffered during these two last centuries in the west indies the same havoc was made in barbados which was once covered with wood scarce a single tree can be found all the other west india islands are more or less in the same condition to prepare the ground for sugarcanes the axe has continued to rage in them ever since the time of their discovery  in the east indies we see the same scenes of desolation wherever settlements have been made the woods have been cut down and indeed often unnecessarily in the island of sumatra mr marsden tells us see marsdens hist of sumatra  the inhabitants have no settled land for their tillage but cut down every year a part of the ancient forests of the country and meliorate the soil by the ashes of the trees which they burn upon it i could never says he behold this devastation without a strong sentiment of regret perhaps the prejudices of a classical education taught me to respect those aged trees as the habitations of an order of sylvan deities who were now deprived of existence but without having recourse to superstition it is not difficult to account for such feelings at the fight of a venerable wood old as the soil it stood on and beautiful beyond what the pencil can describe annihilated for the mere temporary use of the space it occupied see marsdens hist of sumatra   in part the devastation of timber has been owing in some countries to other causes among these it is well known what prodigious quantities of drifttimber are every year wrecked on the seacoast of greenland iceland siberia kamskatka and other northern regions brought down as is supposed by the great rivers of tartary and america and thrown by the setting of the currents on those shores in a voyage related by purchase we are told that the obi and the jenisca frequently when the frosts break and the snows dissolve overflow their banks and carry down with them vast mountains of ice which rolling along through the forests crush down all the trees they meet with and will sometimes drive whole woods before them to the sea second part b iii chapter     on the coasts of spain and portugal also drifttimber is frequently found at the siege of gibraltar on the night of the   th of december      says captain drinkwater in his history of that siege we had a most violent rain with dreadful thunder and lightening the succeeding morning a vast quantity of wood was floating under our walls the rain had washed it from the banks of the palmone and guadaranque and it was wafted by the wind over to our side of the bay fuel had long been a scarce article this supply was therefore considered as a miraculous instance of providence in our favor  in the east indies we have likewise accounts of the devastation of timber from the same cause  this cause however operates only on the banks of large rivers or near the coasts of the sea see crantzs history of greenland v i p     evelins travels through siberia v ii p      millars collection of russian transact viii     drinkwaters siege of gibraltar page  0   but tho in all countries woods have been dismantled yet this devastation of timber has raged with the greatest ardour in europe france is almost entirely deprived of wood all timber of such a size belonged to the king the consequence was nobody would suffer trees to attain that size in the internal parts of spain and germany some woody tracts still remain but the grandeur of those ancient forests which hannibal and caesar traversed is no where to be found where shall we now hear of a forest that took a period of sixty days to pass through it hercynia sylva dierum sexaginta iter occupans pompon mela l iii c    but if some woody scenery is still found in the internal parts of these countries yet along the coasts from the baltic to the rhine and from the rhine to the streights of gibraltar all is laid waste  in italy too the same havoc has been made in calabria indeed are still some tracts of wood but i believe in few other parts those vast pineforests which had rooted themselves from the beginning of time on the ridges of the appennines are now in most parts of that chain of mountains recorded only by a few scattered clumps  even the bleak clime of iceland is supposed to have been once covered with large forests tho it is now almost totally bare of wood it is probable however that other causes besides that of making room for tillage of which there is but little in that island have contributed to this event see troils letters on iceland p    etc   from these varied scenes of devastation the turkish dominions i believe are the most exempted the turks venerate trees and cherish them in all places where the soil is not absolutely required they may almost be said to live under them for they are continually reclining beneath their shade in turkey it is common to see inferior buildings raised around the bole of a large plantain which rising through the roof covers the whole with it is expanded boughs we may suppose therefore what we sometimes hear is true that some of the most picturesque scenery in the world may be found among the islands of the egean and along the shores of the dardanells many of which are beautifully covered with wood  these woods account probably for an appearance which is singular to a stranger navigating those narrow seas as the cornvessels sail through them in their way to constantinople innumerable flights of pigeons which find shelter in these woody recesses hover round the boats demanding a sort of toll from each which the turks never fail to pay them these domestic birds acquire the sagacity to distinguish the cornboat from every other species of navigation and settling upon it is deck they eat their dole at perfect ease as the vessel approaches constantinople the tame pigeons of that capital and all it is suburbs scruple not if they choose it to take the same liberty doves of every kind are sacred in turkey  sect xiii britain like other countries abounded once in wood when cassibalan caractacus and boadicia defended their countrys rights the country itself was a fortress an extensive plain was then as uncommon as a forest is now fitzstephen a monk of canterbury in the time of henry ii tells us that a large forest lay round london in which were woody groves in the covers whereof lurked bucks and does wild boars and bulls to shelter beasts of the latter kind we know a forest must be of some magnificence these woods contiguous even to the capital continued close and thick many ages afterward even so late as henry viis time we are informed by polidore virgil that tertia propemodum angliae pars pecori aut cervis damis capreolis nam et ii quoque in ea part sunt quae ad septentrionem est cuniculisve nutriendis relicta est inculta quippe passim sunt ejusmodi ferarum vivaria seu roboraria quae lignis roboreis sunt clausa unde multa venatio qua se nobiles cum primis exercent  in this passage the forest seems to be distinguished from the park which latter was fenced in those days with oak pales as it is now  as britain became more cultivated it is woods of course receded they gave way as in other places to the plough to pasturage to shipbuilding to architecture and all other objects of human industry in which timber is the principal material obtaining for that reason among the romans the pointed appellation of materies  that our woods were often cut down merely for the sake of tillage and pasturage without any respect to the uses of timber seems to be evident from the great quantities of subterraneous trees dug up in various parts of england they are chiefly found in marshy grounds which abounded indeed every where before the arts of draining were in use nothing was necessary in such places to produce the future phenomenon of subterraneous timber but to carry the trees upon the surface of the bog which might easily be done in dry summers their own weight the ouzing of the springs and the swelling of the mossy ground would soon sink them as they were generally stripped of their branches which were probably burnt dr plot who had examined subterraneous timber with great exactness gives good reasons for supposing it might have been buried in this way merely to make way for the plough and imagines that the english might begin to clear their woodlands for tillage as early as the times of alfred the great see plots hist of oxfordshire chap   sect      others account for the phenomenon of subterraneous timber from the havoc made in woods by the violence of storms in marshy grounds especially where trees take but feeble hold they would be most liable to this destruction  both this hypothesis and dr plots may be equally true  but notwithstanding this general extermination of timber for the purposes of human industry still many forests were left in the time of our ancestors in every part of the island under the denomination of royal chaces which our ancient kings preserved sacred for their amusement  forests indeed have ever been in use in all parts and ages of the world as the appendages of royalty we read of them thus appropriated even in the times of sacred story when nehemiah was in captivity in the court of artaxerxes and had obtained leave of that prince to rebuild jerusalem artaxerxes granted him we read among other favors a letter to asaph the keeper of the kings forest to supply him with timber see nehemiah ii     in england the royal appropriation of most of our forests seems to have been at least as early as the times of the heptarchy every petty prince had then his royal demeisns afterward when one sovereign obtained possession of the whole island he found himself the proprietor of a number of these forests scattered over the different parts of it  in scotland also several forests existed but whether they were in general the soverigns property or indeed any of them under the jurisdiction of forestlaw might be matter of inquiry some of them undoubtedly belonged to private persons but on the whole the forests of england were both more numerous in proportion and more appropriated to the crown than the forests of scotland how many of these districts existed between the forest of englewood in cumberland and newforest in hampshire may easily be supposed when we are assured that in the last named county alone there were anciently at least a dozen tho we can scarce at this time trace above half that number  at present indeed even the vestiges of most of our english forests are obliterated of a few of them we find the site marked in old maps but as to their sylvan honors scarce any of them has the least remains to boast some of the woods were destroyed in licentious times and many have been suffered through mere negligence to waste away  the pillage of a dishonest neighborhood  the picturesque eye in the meantime is greatly hurt with the destruction of all these sylvan scenes not that it delights in a continued forest nor wishes to have a whole country covered with wood it delights in the intermixture of wood and plain in which beauty consists it is not it is business to consider matters of utility it has nothing to do with the affairs of the plough and the spade but merely examines the face of nature as a beautiful object at the same time it is more than probable that if at least some of our ancient forests in different parts of the kingdom had been preserved the ends of public utility might have been answered as well as those of picturesque beauty this was at least the opinion of our enemies we are informed that in the intended invasion of      the spaniards among other mischief that was meditated had orders to cut down all the forests of england which they could meet with particularly the forest of dean in glocestershire john of ghent indeed acted this part in scotland when to revenge an inroad he set twentyfour thousand axes at work in the forest of caledonia  out of respect however to the noble scenes which the forests of britain once presented i shall endeavor to preserve the remembrance of as many of them as i can i shall carry my reader first into the northern parts of scotland and shall from thence proceed regularly through all the forests of which we have any knowledge to the southern parts of england  sect xiv the character of the scotchforest is very different from that of the english one it commonly extends over a mountainous country abounding with valleys rocks precipices torrents cataracts lakes and all the accompaniments of the wildest and grandest species of landscape it is chiefly composed of pines which give it a melancholy gloomy aspect in some parts this gloomy tinge is varied by birch and in other parts inlivened by the cheerful green and brilliant berries of the mountainash the pineforests often climb precipices of very towering height diminishing to the gazing eye when stationed at the bottom till the loftiest pines almost appear melting into air  the woods that rear themselves over the steeps of the alps and appennines often form appearances of this kind but of a more cheerful cast the following description is a beautiful contrast to the gloomy aspect of a scotchforest tho i fancy the poet has drawn a more woody species of scenery than is at this time commonly to be found in italy  far to the right where appennine ascends bright as the summer italy extends woods over woods in gay theatric pride well massed yet varied deck the mountains side while towering often amidst the tufted green some venerable ruin marks the scene the animals which inhabit the scotchforest are the roebuck the eagle and the falcon heretofore it was frequented by the cock of the wood a noble bird dressed in splendid plumage of nearly the size of a turkey he was often seen amidst the dark foliage of the pine rearing his glossy crest and crowing at intervals but he is now seldom found the stag also sometimes shelters himself among the thickets of the forest but it is the heat only of a meridian sun that drives him thither the storm he values not but continues browzing in defiance of it on the side of the bleakest mountain on which it happens to overtake him  the english forest except in the northern counties which border on scotland exhibits a very different species of landscape it is commonly composed of woodland views interspersed as we have described them see p   0  with extensive heaths and lawns it is trees are oak and beech whose lively green corresponds better than the gloomy pine with the nature of the scene which seldom assumes the dignity of a mountain one but generally exhibits a cheerful landscape it aspires indeed to grandeur but it is grandeur does not depend like that of the scottish forest on the sublimity of the objects but on the vastness of the whole  the extent of it is woods and wideness of it is plains  in it is inhabitants also the english forest differs from the scotch instead of the stag and the roebuck it is frequented by cattle and fallowdeer and exchanges the screams of the eagle and the falcon for the crowing of pheasants and the melody of nightingales the scotchforest no doubt is the sublimer scene and speaks to the imagination in a loftier language than the english forest can reach this latter indeed often rouses the imagination but seldom in so great a degree being generally content with captivating the eye  the scenery too of the scotchforest is better calculated to last through ages than that of the english the woods of both are almost destroyed but while the englishforest has lost all it is beauty with it is oaks and becomes only a desolate waste the rocks and the mountains the lakes and the torrents of the scotchforest make it still an interesting scene  in sutherland which is the most northern county in scotland are found the forests of derrymore and derrymonach  in rossshire in the district of assynt lies the forest of coygach and along the confines of lochmari which is one of the most extensive lakes in scotland runs another forest which bears the name of the lake  in the county of murray are the forests of abernethy and rothimurcha winding along the banks of the spey they both belong to the family of the grants and make a part of the extensive demeisns of castlegrant which stands in their neighborhood  in the shire of inverness are the remains of several forests  those of lochloyn glenmoriston strathglass lochgarrie lochartrig and kinlochleven  in the county of bamff lies the forest of glenmore which belongs to the duke of gordon whose castle rises among the woods on the confines of it  on the banks of the dee in the southern part of the county of aberdeen lies the forest of glentaner which belongs to lord aboyne and more to the west the forests of braemar and invercald  the former is a very romantic scene especially in the eastern parts here we find in great perfection every species of the wildest and most awful country the beetling rock assumes no where a more tremendous form nor the pine bursting from it is fissures a more majestic station nor does the river in any place threw itself into more furious contortions this wild and extensive forest is much frequented by game of every kind which used formerly in the summer season to draw together a great resort of nobility and gentry from all parts of scotland their meeting had the appearance of a military expedition they wore a uniform and encamped together in temporary huts their days were spent in the chase and their evenings in jollity such meetings were common in scotland and of great antiquity a huntingparty of this kind gave occasion to the celebrated ballad of chevychace  the forest of invercald is likewise a very romantic scene the pines which at this day grow in some parts of it are thought to be superior to any in europe both in size and quality many of them attain the height of eighty or ninety feet and measure four feet and a half in diameter they are sold even in that country for five or six guineas a tree the timber which they yield is resinous heavy and of a darkred color considerable quantities of it are still carried into the lower parts of scotland in floats down the dee when that river happens to be swollen with rains the forests of braemar and invercald are supposed to be the remains of the ancient caledonian wood  in the county of athol is the forest of lochrannoc and in that of argyl the forest of lochtulla where mr pennant tells us he saw the last pines which he supposed to be of spontaneous growth in scotland  in the county of stirling lies the forest of that name or torwood as it is often called here the country tho still abrupt and rough begins to assume a milder form here too the oak begins to mix it is cheerful verdure with the dark green tint of the pine  as we approach nearer the english border it is probable the oak became still more frequent and occupied large tracts in those vast woods which on better evidence than that of balladhistory we believe existed formerly in the wilds of tiviot and cheviot  as we enter england the large county of northumberland affords the remains only of two forests rothbury in the middle of it and lowes on the western side a little to the north of the roman wall  in cumberland we find five nicol knaredale westwood inglewood and copeland all now desolate and naked scenes except where some of the lands have been cultivated  the wild county of westmorland consisted formerly of little besides forests with the appendages of lakes and mountains six are still traced in it on the north lies the forest of milburn in which rises one of the loftiest mountains in england that of crossfell on the west lie the forests of whinfield martindale and thornthwait martindale is bounded by the beautiful lake of ullswater and thornthwait by that of broadwater on the eastern side of this rough county lie the forests of stainmore and mellerstang stainmore is a wild scene noted only for being one of the great western passes into scotland at the northern extremity of it is presented a grand piece of distant mountain scenery  on the borders of mellerstang stand the ruins of pendragoncastle the walls of which are full four yards in thickness pendragoncastle gives westmorland perhaps a better title to that celebrated hero uter pendragon than any the welsh can boast it stands upon the river eden and the tradition of the country is that the noble founder proposed to draw that great stream around it like a trench his enterprise miscarrying gave rise to the following adage applied to the attempting of an impossibility let pendragon do what he can eden runs where eden ran this forest was likewise celebrated for being formerly the haunt of wildboars and a part of it to this day retains the name of wildboarfell here also stands the mountain of mowil from whence three of the largest rivers in the north of england take their source the eden the ewer and the swale  in the bishopric of durham we find only the forest of langden or teesdale which latter name it assumes from running along the banks of the tees when the woods of this forest were in perfection they must have afforded a great variety of very picturesque scenery for the tees is one of the most romantic rivers in england and forms many a furious eddy and many a foaming cascade in it is passage through the forest particularly that celebrated cataract which by way of eminence is called the fall of the tees  in lancashire we find three forests  lancasterforest which i suppose is the same as wiresdale  bowland a little to the south  and simonswood extending almost to liverpool  in the northern parts of yorkshire lie a cluster of small forests  lime  applegarth  swaledale  and wenseleydale whether each of these had a separate jurisdiction or whether their rights were intermingled would be difficult at this day to ascertain they must formerly however in their rude state have been delightful scenes even now they contain some of the most picturesque country we have in england  rivers  valleys  rocks  and woods in great prosusion tho intermingled and deformed with patches of human industry  on the eastern side of yorkshire lies the forest of pickering extending itself almost to scarborough this forest with that of wiresdale were royalties belonging to the duchy of lancaster and in the time of john of ghent the jurisdiction of forestlaw was maintained in both of them with so much exactness that the determinations of the courts of lancaster and pickering were always esteemed sufficient precedents for all the other forest courts in england see manwood on forestlaw in various parts   in the middle of yorkshire lies the wide forest of knaresborough once a very romantic scene a little to the south lies harewood and on the east lies galtries still a woody district extending almost to the walls of york  around hallifax lies hardwickeforest within the precincts of which hallifaxlaw as it was called took place it was a very severe jurisdiction vested in the magistrates of the town to punish clothstealing the offender within the space of two or three marketdays was tried condemned and executed the instrument of his execution was called a maiden it was a machine in which an axe was drawn up a considerable height between two posts and under the pressure of a heavy weight fell rapidly on the criminals neck the axe is still shown at hallifax  there were probably many other forests in yorkshire but we can only trace with any degree of certainty the site of one more which is hatfieldchace and this might likewise have been forgotten had it not been for a piece of history belonging to it  the death of edwin king of northumberland which happened in this forest together with the destruction of his army by penda the pagan king of mercia  in cheshire we have the forests of delamere and macclesfield the former is an extensive district of ground rising as it approaches chester and presenting at the extremity a grand view of the flat country below bounded by the mountains of wales the castle of beeston seated on a hill in the second distance appears to great advantage in the view in this forest edelfleda a mercian princess founded a little town for her retirement which obtained the title of the happy city the site is still known by the name of the chamber in the forest  besides these two forests in cheshire there was formerly another of larger dimensions than either of them it occupied under the name of wireallforest that whole peninsula which lies between the estuaries of the mercey and the dee  in the county of nottingham is the celebrated forest of sherwood which was formerly the frequent scene of royal amusement mansfield a town in that forest was the seat of the kings residence on those occasions and it was here that he made an acquaintance with the miller of famous memory  this forest was also the retreat of another personage equally celebrated in the chronicle of ballad the illustrious robin hood who with little john and the rest of his associates making the woody scenes of it his asylum laid the whole country under contribution  sherwoodforest is at present a scene of great desolation tho it is woods in various parts are reviving under the auspices of several eminent patrons the dukes of norfolk kingston newcastle and portland sir george saville sir charles sedley and others have made large plantations in several parts  whose estates either lie within it or on it is confines  in shropshire are the vestiges of at least four forests huckstow kingswood bridgenorth and clune cluneforest deserves ever to be remembered in british annals as the scene where caractacus is supposed see camden on shropshire to have made his last noble stand against the romans having resisted them nine years with various success and being now pushed to extremity he fortified himself on a hill in this forest tacitus tells the story at length see tac annal lib xii chap     ostorius led his legions against him the british camp was forced and through treachery the gallant chief was delivered to his conqueror at rome says the historian the senate considered the triumph over caractacus as splendid as those over syphax and perses  in the county of stafford the forest of needwood still affords a variety of pleasing country it is bounded by the trent and the dove and is in the neighborhood of those romantic scenes in which the latter of these rivers makes so pleasing an appendage  on the confines of this forest stand the ruins of tutburycastle where the princes of the house of lancaster formerly held their residence their hospitality diversions and jovial housekeeping are not yet forgotten in the traditions of the country one instance called the bullrunning remains i believe to this day on the   th of august a bull is turned loose and is the property of those who seize him this amusement which was formerly given to the duke of lancasters servants is now become the subject of great contention between the youth of staffordshire and derbyshire who exercise their prowess on the occasion for the honor of their respective counties  the middle parts of staffordshire are occupied by a very extensive forest known by the name of cankwood  in the southen parts of leicestershire lies the wide forest of charnwood in which the park of beaumanour twenty miles in circumference was walled round by the lords of beaumont and was thought to be one of the largest works of the kind in england in this county also lies the forest of leicester on the borders of which is the celebrated field of bosworth where after so much bloodshed in the contest between the two houses of york and lancaster their quarrel was finally decided  in rutlandshire is the forest of lyfield still in some parts in it is original state and stocked with deer and in hertfordshire are the remains of the forests of bringwood deerfield hawood and acornbury  wireforest once famous for it is stately timber lies on the northwest of worcestershire along the banks of the severn in this county also we have the forest of malvern and feckingham the former winds among the hills whose name it bears and and the latter is famous for it is salt springs in the boiling of which it is woods have been almost exterminated  more than half the county of warwick was formerly a continued forestscene and was known by the name of arden an old british word which singnifies a wood whether this vast district of woodland was divided into different jurisdictions would be difficult to ascertain there seems at least to have been one separate chase in it which belonged to the castle of kenelworth and it is probable there might have been others  in the county of northampton is the large forest of rockingham which stretches along the river welland almost to stamford in this forest stands the castle of rockingham formerly a pile of vast importance built by william the conqueror  in northamptonshire also there are three other forests sacy yardly and whittlebury  i have been assured that in the first and last of these forests rockingham and whittlebury there remains at this day sufficient timber to build the navy of england twice over and as canals are now forming in those parts it may soon be no difficult matter to convey it from it is deep recesses to any of the kings yards these forests also particularly whittlebury are infested by the wildcat which the naturalists call the british tiger  huntingdon takes it is name as etymologists suppose from being a country adapted to hunting see camdens huntingdonshire  we may imagine therefore that in elder times when such beasts were hunted as required large covers a great part of the county was forest at present tho we have the vestiges of several woods we meet with no forest directly named but that of wabridge  in glocestershire the forest of dean has ever been esteemed one of the most celebrated forests in england it is of large extent not less than twenty miles in length and half as many in breadth stretching on the southeast along the severn and on the northwest along the wye the picturesque scenes of which latter river it greatly improves by often presenting it is woody distances the timber in this forest was formerly more in request than any other timber for the service of the navy but it is at this time much diminished owing chiefly to the neighborhood of several iron forges which it has long supplied with fuel there is however still more the appearance of a forest preserved here both in the scenery and in the jurisdiction than in almost any other part of england the courts are held in a large house which was built for this purpose in the middle of the forest  in the county of gloucester also is the forest of micklewood on the confines of which stands berklycastle of celebrated antiquity  kingswood too is another forest in this county which being bounded by the avon spreads itself almost to the walls of bristol  in oxfordshire we have only the single forest of whichwood  in buckinghamshire we have those of bernwood and clitern bernwood runs along the hilly country from aylesbury almost to to oxford clitern was formerly a very thick impervious wood and noted for being the haunt of banditti who long infested the country till a publicspirited abbot of st albans broke their confederacy by bringing many of them to justice and destroying their retreats  in essex are the two forests of epping and hainhault the latter of which it is probable was once an appendage to the former for eppingforest was anciently a very extensive district and under the name of the forest of essex included a great part of that county it afterward took the name of walthamforest but epping being a place better known it now commonly takes that denomination  wiltshire also was formerly a very woody county and once probably almost the whole of it was a forest even at this day we find in it the vestiges of four forests peevisham blakemore bradon and savernack bradon was a scene of dreadful bloodshed in the year  0  when the danes under ethelred invaded it and slaughtered all the inhabitants of it is environs among whom were a number of women and children who had fled for refuge to it is recesses  savernackforest is still a woody scene and adorns a part of the road between bath and london it belongs to the earl of aylesbury and is almost the only privileged forest in england in the hands of a subject by whom in strict language a chase only is tenable this forest is about twelve miles in circuit and is still well stocked with deer and timber  in berkshire is the celebrated forest of windsor it was formerly the property of queen emma and was afterward distinguished by william the conqueror who built lodges in it and established forestlaw he himself used commonly after the chase to sleep at an abbey in the neighborhood there is now little scenery left in any part of it some of the finest of the old foresttrees still remaining stand on the left of the road leading from the great park to cranburnlodge the scenery here chiefly from the ornament of the trees is beautiful  the most pleasing part of windsorforest is the great park which tho in many places artificially and formally planted contains great variety of ground the improvements of duke william of cumberland were magnificent rather than in a style suitable to a forest all formalities should have been as much as possible avoided and the whole formed into noble lawns and woods with views introduced where they could be into the country the great avenue to windsorcastle tho in a style of great formality is however in it is kind so noble a piece of scenery that we should not wish to see it destroyed  besides great numbers of red and fallowdeer this park was in the dukes time much frequented by wild turkies the breed of which he encouraged it could hardly have had a more beautiful decoration birds are among the most picturesque objects their forms and plumage are both picturesque yet they are generally so diminutive that beautiful as they are they have little effect but the turkey is both a large bird and being gregarious forms groups which become objects of consequence it is shape also is picturesque and all it is actions it is color also especially if it be of the bright copper varying in the sunbeam is more beautiful than the plumage of any other bird the peacock neither in form nor in color is equal to the turkey as this bird was reclaimed from the unbounded woods of america where it is still indigenous it is habits continue wilder than those of any domestic fowl it strays widely for it is food  it flies well considering it is apparent inactivity  and it perches and roosts on trees on all these accounts it is a proper inhabitant of parks  windsorforest is about thirty miles round  the great park fourteen  and the little park three  in middlesex is the forest of enfield after the death of charles i it is said that cromwell divided it into farms among his veterans but if they ever took possession they were dispossessed at the restoration and deer it is ancient inhabitants were again settled in their room  surry and kent were formerly very woody counties of which we need no evidence besides that of caesar when he invaded britain there are no traces however of any nominal forest in either of them except the forest of tunbridge woods indeed there are in various parts and much more the appearance of a woody country is still left than in most of those countries in which forests are known to have existed  sussex on the other hand which has ever been remarkable as one of the finest timber counties in england abounds at the same time with nominal forests it contains no fewer than seven st leonards word ashdown waterdown dallington arundel and charlton which last forest was settled on the dukes of richmond ridings through it have lately been cut and many plantations made but i never saw them  in cornwall it does not appear that there has ever been any thing like a forest  in devonshire there are two the forest of dartmore which runs along the mountainous and barren country on both sides of the river dart before it enters the southhams and the forest of exmore which accompanies the river ex till it enter the more fertile country about dulverton  in somersetshire there are likewise two neroheforest which lies a little to the south of taunton and selwoodforest a little to the south of froom  these scenes will ever be famous in british history while the remembrance continues of alfred the great frequent inundations of danes and repeated losses had driven him from the management of affairs but he retired before the enemies of his country only to attack them with more advantage seeing the time ripe for action he emerged from his retreat sent his emissaries around and called his friends together in the forest of selwood which sheltered and concealed his numbers here arranging his followers he burst from the forest like a torrent upon the danes they gave way at once and suffered so terrible a defeat that they never again molested his repose  on the north of dorsetshire lies gillinghamforest remarkable also for a great defeat which edmond ironside gave the danes on the confines of it a little to the east lies cranburnchase and on the west blackmoreforest commonly called the forest of whitehart from a celebrated stag which afforded great diversion to henry iii  the whole of the island of purbeck was once a forest in the midst of it stands corfcastle where elsrida to open the throne for her son ethelred murdered her soninlaw edward when he called for refreshment at her castle after a toilsome chase  in hampshire are the vestiges of five forests on the north near sylchester lies chuteforest through which passes the great southern roman road still visible in many parts on the west lies the forest of harewood which is still a woody scene tho it is larger trees are in general gone this place was formerly celebratad for the unfortunate loves of athelwold and elfrida here edgar slew his rival and the supposed place is traditionally marked by the name of deadmans plot the abbey of whorwell which elfrida founded on this occasion is not now to be traced except by a monumental stone which marks it is situation on the east of hampshire lies holtforest more to the south the forest of waltham which belongs to the bishop of winchester and near tichfield the forest of bear some parts of these forests still afford remains of woody scenery  at the southwest extremity of hampshire lies newforest which as it has given occasion to these remarks and is besides the noblest scene of the kind in england i shall in the following book consider more at large and endeavor to illustrate by it is scenes some of the observations which have already been made to this account of the forests of england i shall only subjoin that mr st john see his observations on the landrevenues of the crown p     enumerates seventyseven of which windsor waltham dean rockingham whittlewood salcey sherwood which wood newforest bear and walmer are the only forests he says which are reputed to have preserved their rights of the rest indeed he gives the names many of which i meet with no where but in his catalogue he says however that several of them were disforested and changed into private property by an act of charles i which was wrested from him in consequence of his having revived the vexations of forestlaw at the beginning of his difficulties   end of the second book and of the first volume a catalogue of the

tint with which these aquatinta drawings are stained to be an attempt to color after nature i would suggest that nothing less is intended some little idea of the glow of sunset may be given by it and this is attempted only in one or two prints in all the rest the design of this wash is only to take off the glaring rawness of whitepaper and to harmonize by a mellow tint the unpleasant opposition of
