an answer to the ld hshams speech by daniel d foe had the subject of this paper been able to stay but one week more it had not been a digression the determined course of the reviews being then to review to the subject of trade and the general state of things and as the daily flux of subject for this paper is such that i despair to return yet a great while to my original design as to france i shall turn this paper for the present to be a review of the state of the nation and i do not oblige my self that the next volume may not bear that title  i find a paper cried about town with an unusual earnestness entitled the lord hshams speech in the house of peers  i think my self obliged before i enter upon the particulars to make a short introduction relating to my manner of treating the case i am upon which is expected to be an answer to that paper  i am going to answer my lord hshams speech but if i may say any thing to certain points hinted at in the paper called by that title they are welcome to call mine an answer or what else they please  that the lord hsham made a speech in the house of lords is no part of my enquiry nor shall i meddle with what was transacted there i know the duty of an author with respect to what is done or said in that assembly  the paper published i think shows it self in a double capacity as a speech and as a pamphlet as a speech i have nothing to say to it but as a pamphlet with no authors name to it it may be any bodies and may be answered by any body it is an appeal to the people a challenge to every reader and i am at liberty as well as another to remark upon it  as a pamphlet i say i may be concerned with it and no otherwise the anonymous author is nothing to me be it a lord or a tinker there is no name to it to vouch the particulars and i believe indeed no man would ever set his name to it that valued the reputation of his character either for truth understanding or good manners  let the speech be what it will and whose it will i must confess the publication of it seems to me to have something in it that i cannot allow to be the noble lords doing whatever has an air in its countenance calculated or screwed up to a pitch of malecontent and chagrin as if it was done on purpose to sower the nation cannot be published with a good design let the saying or speaking this any where be done with what design it will the printing of it can in my poor opinion have no meaning but what is mischievous and unpeaceable  having thus stated the case between the review and the pamphlet i speak of i shall lead my reader no farther about  i shall endeavor to speak as plain as the deference and regard due to dignity and quality of persons will permit i wish the noble lord who they say made this speech would give me leave to answer paragraph by paragraph every article without taking the advantages laws and power furnishes him with upon any reasonable penalty if i did not give what even the whole house of lords should determine a full answer  but limited by that article of quality i shall refrain an answer as an answer to this speech and only handle the subject without pointing at the person  the first paragraph in the paper above which is all i shall recite makes the author address in the first person my lords as introductory to something he has to say relating to the state of the nation and nothing that the best way of preserving the liberty of speech is to make use of it tells them he will speak to three or four generals very plainly if he had said coursly he had said   four heads are treated of in this paper and i also purpose to treat of the same four heads among many other if my lord hshams opinion and mine differ i hope neither this paper nor its author are bound to sacrifice his judgment to his manners i shall treat the name the speech is called by in no terms beneath his quality and have nothing to ask his lordships pardon for but for discoursing of the same points with himself which i hope his lordship will allow me the liberty to do the particulars are   the consederate war   the trade of england   the right of princes to take notice of things done in parliament but not brought to their knowledge in a parliamentary manner   the bringing over the presumptive heir of the crown to reside here   i begin with the last of these and i shall no more take notice that these have been the subject of any speech nor do i know they have been i know this article has been started in print before now by an author whose principle is as well known as his paper and as his proposal i shall speak to it and of him i must say as an old man said to his poor nephew who waited for his death to come to his estate the young fellow advised him to remove to a certain place in the country for his health which as he said was a better air i believe it is a better air says the old man but i do not fancy the place why so sir says the nephew  because you propose it says he for what can you get by my livig  now mr politicus as this author would be called we could be glad to see the heir of the crown among us but we cannot fancy the proposal because you make it for what can your party get by it what advantage can it be to your party to bring those over that we know you hate and how can you think but we must suspect your integrity an old lion that by his age and infirmities was grown heavy and could hardly get his living as he used to do his joints stiff with the excesses of his youth his claws broke and his teeth rotten just as it fares with mr mercurius politicuss party to supply the defects of his power with the helps of his cunning feigns himself very sick and being near the point of death invites all his subjects of the horn and the hoof to come and visit him pretends he had great need of their assistance and withal that it was very convenient to have them near him and that he had several things to tell them for the public safety away comes the inhabitants of the adjacent woods out of their holes and secure places where they were far enough out of his reach to visit this old devourer when he had thus got them into his power he watches his opportunity flies upon them and devours them all  these old stories and fifty more such i could tell them might give us very good caution when these foxes preach to beware of the geese but of that by the way the proposal of bringing over the princess of hannover is specious and seems to lay a difficulty in the way of a great many honest subjects as if not complying with it should be taken for a disrespect to that illustrious house which will best appear when a little farther examined into for all things are not to be judged of by their outsides  no man more sincerely joins in the satlement of the succession and rejoices in the safety of england on that head than the author of this paper and when we talk of inviting the princes of the line royal hither all that desire their peaceable enjoyment of the crown would without doubt bid them welcome and be glad to see them round the throne as some call it  but when we talk of the respect due to the illustrious branches of our succession it is one thing and when we talk of the security and safety of england it is another and in this case with all manner of duty and respect to the successors of the english crown i freely say we are as secure without them as with them to say it would be a fine court or a pleasant thing if all the house of hannover was here a great deal of gallantry and some trade might be the consequence this has something in it and not much but when we talk of safety and danger it is not the distance of our princes can influence the matter an english parliament is the security of england against all the intervening accidents and how easy is all that pretense fallen to the ground now in one vote of the house of lords  public safety is a fine gilded pretense and sounds very popular but it is not always meant most where it is most talked of and security of the queen from the heirs being at her elbow i cannot foresee the security of the queen consists in the hearts of her people which i believe no prince for some ages has more entirely possessed and i cannot say the queen had been more secure in the life of the duke of gloucester it had been a joy and comfort both to the queen and the whole nation if it had pleased god to have spared that prince whose loss is a grief to all that reflect on it and who have any value for their sovereign  but still as to safety as to the public security it consists not in persons but in things if god for our sins should take away every branch of that illustrious stock from whence we hope for such a succession of princes i am of opinion and think it is plain the foundation of the english crown and government stands too fast to be shaken it is built upon this fundemental maxim of state recorded in parliament and which all the nation concurs in that we will not have a popish prince to reign over us  the parliament of england is our security for the making this good and it can neither add nor diminish to this security how or to what extent it may please god to lengthen the lives of the successors to the crown  nor does it seem to me a matter of any great moment the acquainting the heir with the english prelates in our case the present presumtive heir being very unlikely to succeed her majesty god be praised is in good health and much more likely to reign  0 or  0 years god forbid i should stint her majesty than a princess of above  0 is to succeed and in this case i would fain ask mr politicus who would you have brought over if you examine the heirs to the english crown it is three to one against all the three alternately wi shall enjoy it i mean as to respect of age and natural probabilities it is  0 to one against the old lady the immediate presumtive heir to what purpose then would they bring that princess over in her old age but to shortten her days by changing the air and her manner of living it is then at least an even wager against the elector regent and i know no body so weak to talk of his highness coming over to quit his soverign dominion and the administration of his affairs to come hither to live in the quality of an english nobleman and wait for the queen shoes who is god be thanked likely to live as long as himself  then ere is that young elector prince and of him it is perhaps odds six to four that some time  he may enjoy it but it is at least three to two that he does not enjoy it next to the queen and on what pretense can it be moved to send for this prince over if he were here when the queen should happen to die he could be no security he could not act but by commission from his father or grandmother unless by name established in parliament as lord justice or commiss or some other title and that is done already in naming seven or eight lord justices to act in  so that any of these ways this proposal signifies just nothing  suspicio that some snake lies hid in the grass of which hereafter  london printed in the year   0
