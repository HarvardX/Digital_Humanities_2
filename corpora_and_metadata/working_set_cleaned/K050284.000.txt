liberty slavery    dialogue betwixt whig and tory herein the principles and practices of each party are fairly and impartially stated that thereby mistakes and prejudices may be removed from amongst us and all who prefer english liberty and the protestant religion to french slavery and popery may be informed how to choose fit and proper instruments for our preservation in these times of danger  london printed in the year mdccx  advertisement the following discourse was first printed  the year      but as the same causes w always produce the same effects it is thought n unseasonable to publish it now afresh and if the who have any regard to the happiness of the native country of whatever party they be w peruse it with minds free from heat and prejudic the publisher will attain his chiefest aim  to the king sir tho the sacred majesty of kings i am sensible ought not in common cases to be approached by every little busybody or frivolous remonstrancemaker yet when our princes palace is  fire and his sacred person in the midst of the flames e meanest of his subjects has the privilege then to ve him warning of his danger and to assist to quench e fire and this i am afraid sir is at present too near r case or i would not have assumed the boldness to sturb your repose or have placed my self so disadvantaeously before your majesty as i must expect to appear under the character of a public censor of the manners  your ministers and a petty statereformer but it is ot i alone that am thus concerned and busy for the pubck the whole world are at this time mournfully reflecing upon the miserable estate we are fallen into from that happy and glorious prospect of things which we had       and      this has put all men upon enquiry to the causes of the unhappy change of our affairs and i find it agreed on all hands that the principal occasion f our misfortunes or rather mismanagements is from he intrusting those with the government of all who ere the creatures and tools of the two last reigns and re irreconcilable enemies to your majestys government those who opposed your coming to the crown those who eclard to your face king james the only rightful king those who sold their country and betrayed it to the two ast kings and will be always ready to sell it even to the french king if he prove the fairest chapman  i have heard that thurloe who was secretary of sta to cromwell being asked by king charles ii how they d support their government so long when all the nobilit gentry and clergy were against it he replied by intrusti those only in the management of all affairs who were as hearti against that nobility gentry and clergy i do not apply the literally for god be praised your majesty has a great pa of all these several degrees of men who are most hearti and zealously in your interests but i mean by this that yo are to oppose your enemies with their enemies not wit their friends and that the design of keeping out kin james with jacobites seems to be as impracticable as h project proved of setting up popery with a protestan army  yet there are some about your majesty who for ba and private ends endeavor to possess you with the destructive politics of courting and buying your enemie into your service and would persuade you that kin jamess tories are the only party truly principld for monarchy and are fittest for employment as being lon practiced in business and that on the contrary you majestys best friends whom they call whigs are not onl ignorant and unacquainted with public business but ar haters of monarchy of commonwealth principles an at best for making their kings no more than dukes  venice and kings of clouts now this is a notion so false so fatal to the prosperity of your affairs and so dangerous to the very being of your government that  cannot but think it highly necessary that this matter should be fairly stated and laid before your majesty i am sensible how unfit i am for the task and how open i lie to a charge of presumption in attempting it but as the son of cyrus who was from his birth dumb broke silence when he saw his father in the hands of his murderers so since i saw no other champion appear in this cause i resolved to break through all impediments even those of nature and to endeavor the rescue of my king out of the hands of those who have already been the ruin of two kings your majestys predecessors and who will undoubtedly bring you and your affairs into great difficulties if you be not delivered from their counsels  in order to this i have impartially made a collection in the following dialogue of all the arguments which whigs employ against the tories or tories against the whigs and submit it to your majestys discerning judgment and most piercing and distinguishing wisdom upon the whole which of them are most proper for your majesty to employ those who were in the interest of popery d of france or those who opposed both to the death  appeal to you sir whether a torys being for the dine right of succession and consequently for king jamess monarchy makes him the fitter in principle to be employed y king william or whether his boasted skill in busiess will be of any use to your majesty if he be in prinple and inclination for king james and believes king illiam a king de facto only without a rightful title and in plain english an usurper if these gentlemen as their principles will naturally lead them to do use all their skill in their several stations to obstruct and make ifficult your affairs to betray your designs to your enemies to countenance and protect king jamess friends in ll their plots and contrivances furnish them with inelligence help them to passes escapes etc all which things it cannot be denied have been and are daily done by some persons employed in this government of what use sir or service then is this boasted skill in business to your majestys interests certainly men less conversant in public affairs who have a zeal for your government would be of more use and service to you men who were persecuted by king charles and king james either in their own persons or in the persons of their friends who were fined imprisoned and some of their relations hanged in those reigns are more likely to act in earnest against king james and in the supporting your majesty and your government than those who had their fortunes and their families raised by king james and his brother king charles and who hope to be raised yet more by his return or at least to secure in his government what they have got in this by obliging him and his friends at the price of sacrificing you and yours  for example is it reasonable to believe the e of n whose father and family was raised by king charles and king james for prostituting the law and his nauseous rhetoric to the designs of those two brothers who himself was a privycounsellor with father peters and chosen by king james at the time of the revolution to treat with your majesty at hungerford in order to delay your progress to london and lastly who so violently opposed your majestys being crowned king as to lay an eternal obligation upon king james by it i say sir is it reasonable to believe this gentleman so proper a secretary of state to your majesty as the e of s who has so mortally disobliged king james in being so early and so zealous in your interests who went at the head of that message to king james wherein he was required to retire from whitehall who has since that been so instrumental to place and preserve the crown upon your head and has in a word broken all measures so with king james as to leave no possibility of a reconciliation to him and consequently has no retreat from this government but is obliged in common sense to serve your majesty faithfully and zealously  or can your majesty think mr k who it is generally said believes himself the son of king j and it is known by all the world owes his fortune to him who if we may believe report at the time of the revolution agreed with captain tosyer to carry the ships he then commanded in the straits to king james in france had not the common sailors very rudely opposed the project who after this acquitted himself so ill at cadiz in letting the thoulon squadron pass by him in his sight without fighting them and to conclude has made so unaccountable a campagn of it this summer can your majesty give me leave to say sir think this gentleman after all this fitter to command the fleet of england than mr r whose provocations to king james are never to be forgiven by him who was one of the most instrumental men in england in placing you upon the throne who last year gave you the greatest and most glorious victory that ever was obtained by us at sea and whose courage conduct and fidelity the parliament of england has unanimously attested  and now sir if i may presume so far will your majesty be pleased to examine what honor what profit has accrud to you or the nation by your employing these gentlemen who have of late been at the head of the ministry for gods sake sir cast up the account of the last four years management and see what you have gained by changing whigs for torys have not your affairs gone backward both at home and abroad have not mismanagements been multiplied have you not cooled your friends and yet not gained your enemies do not almost all the tories you employ drink king jamess health in your wine and serve him in your offices do they not obstruct all business which ought to be dispatched and dispatch all business which ought to be obstructed browbeat your friends and delay them in the most just pretenses but comply with your enemies in their most unreasonable demands nay connive at their cabals and conspiracies and snatch them out of the hands of justice when the law has sentenced them to death for their treasons would not such ministers and friends as these be less dangerous to you when professed enemies nay in arms against you in the field than in your council cabinet and offices undoubtedly they would  but i know the common answer to all these kind of complaints is that it is more easy to find faults than remedies if you please therefore sir we will consider of remedys and i think there may be some found out both easy and certain and they are these first sir be pleased to remove from your person council and offices of trust men bred up and confirmed in principles destructive to our english government and hateful to your people and to discountenance all stateprojecters and mountebankministers who make wounds in the state to recommend their balsam throw out sir these achans to be stoned by the people who will otherwise i fear prevent gods favor to you who blast your success abroad and rob you of the affections of your subjects at home with their accursed thing i mean that tinsel power with which these miscreants dazzle the eyes of princes and lead them out of the right way god is displeased with it for uncontrollable and unaccountable power is the right and attribute of god alone and as the scripture tells us he will not give his glory unto another nor suffer those to act like gods who are to die like men your people also will be displeased with a despotick power for the kings of england are bound by laws by mutual compacts etc as you your self sir have set forth most unanswerably in your declaration when you came over and if these are broken englishmen who believe themselves subjects to the crown of england as by law established and not slaves to any particular person otherwise king james would have a fairer pretense than i hope we shall ever allow him  they become impatient angry and at length perhaps unreasonable and whenever they see their king beset with ministers of lawless principles those wholesale merchants of arbitrary power they grow mistrustful and uneasy and are apt in such cases to shut their purses and open their mouths and give me leave to say sir had not the people been made apprehensive and jealous by seeing these men in the ministry whose mischievous methods they were so well acquainted with and did so much abhor no general excise no loans no powers would have been thought by the people of england too much to have entrusted you with so highly they esteemed your generous relief of them your unequal courage and the many other admirable virtues they saw shine in you an english king is the greatest monarch upon earth when he reigns in the hearts of his subjects and all other methods to power and greatness have been found ineffectual in england i remember i once saw written over a mercers shop keep thy shop and thy she will keep thee and tho it be a homely allusion it is very applicable to the present point keep your laws sir a your laws will keep you support your people in their right and liberties and queen elizabeth shall pass her royal word for them they will support your just prerogative a home and your honor abroad and sir by the way do not let your flatterers give you a cheap opinion of  power derived from the people for it is undoubtedly from their consent that all power must come nor let them make you uneasy that your title to the crown is from the universal free choice of the commons of england believe me your ministers nor the two learned bishops who have scribled upon this subject will ever be able to find you a better  in the next place discharge all jacobites and trimmer from offices of trust for such as either desire king james or from their fear or wisdom endeavor to deserve from him so much as their pardon i humbly conceive are unfit for your service at this juncture tho when the government is more settled i am for entertaining all who give proofs of their penitence for their past actions and opinions  but sir purgatives will not alone perfect the cure of your government and restore it to perfect health you must make use of alteratives too there must be a change of measures as well as a discharge of men and the method i would humbly offer is this  first to make the interest of england your chief design and aim and since you are an english king to become entirely an englishman england is a nation jealous of rivals in her princes favor and thinks her self deserving of all his care and all his caresses if the people of england think you have a favorable opinion of them they will endeavor to deserve it if not they may perhaps deserve your worst opinion too this humor of the nation queen elizabeth found early and applied her self so happily to it as by this single point to master all her difficulties the greatest it may be that ever prince had to struggle with whereas her successors by contrary measures brought themselves into very unfortunate circumstances  in the next place sir let me desire you to avoid concerning your self in elections of members in parliament or influencing them when chosen the parliament is a sacred part of the english constitution and like the israelites ark of old is not to be touched profanely but with great danger to those who touch it so and therefore sir it will be ur true interest to leave the people free to their choice d the members free to their opinions when chosen is still fresh in our memories how much the practices  the late reigns in corrupting elections and closeting embers of parliament enraged the nation and they d reason to resent it for if for the sake of a vote a ember of parliament shall be placed in an office of rust he is not fit for this is destroying the government wo ways at once for to speak in the phrase of the ministry it is making a parliament of clouts and an officer of clouts at the same stroke rejecting bills offered y parliament of public benefit and for securing our ntient government and the fundamental rights of the bject was highly displeasing to the nation also in the te reigns and will be so in all reigns as was likewise e denying the people their undoubted right of frequent arliaments they had also in the late governments an nvention to make a pump of the parliament and by ouring in a pint of water to fetch out a tun this as justly most provoking to the nation and treasured up wrath against the day of wrath  the refusing of bills and the contempt of addresses from the parliament against ministers or in any other cases has likewise given great offense in former reigns for tho the house of commons seconded by the house of ords cannot reach the life or estate of any person but y a full proof in form of law yet because it is so difficult a matter to come at such a proof a vote of the house of commons against any minister has always been esteemed by all kings who were well with the people a sufficient reason for the removing them from court and i have heard that our king henry iv a warlike and wise prince upon an address from the parliament against some of his ministers replied i know no evil by these men but if they are thought unfit by my parliament for my service i shall not think fit to continue them in it  all these things sir therefore are most carefully to be avoided by your majesty they will appear with a worse grace in you who have declared and made war against these practices than in your predecessors for as st paul says thou who have said ye shall not commit adultery do thou commit adultery thou who have said ye shall not steal do thou steal you must by no means sir give this occasion of clamor and recrimination to your enemies but be pleased to follow this general rule always to beware of the ministers and to avoid the schemes and counsels of king charles and king jamess government and then you can scarce err for whatever is opposite to their principles and practices is the direct road to yo security and success  in the next place sir let rewards and punishment be duly and impartially distributed this is a rule  which all ages and governments have paid the greate respect and observance and to which the present monarch of france does chiefly owe the prosperity of h affairs and without this principle no government ca subsist your ministers who serve you well and faithfull must be distinguished from those who betray you or serv you carelessly and idely and not smiled or frowned upon as they are supported or persecuted by this or that par or faction and by the way sir a prince in englan that rules according to the laws and interests of his people will never have occasion to make his court to an party or faction nor can any minister of any part serve you against the interest of the nation let you soldiers be encouraged and preferred according to their bravery and abilities without favor or affection the bravest otherwise will follow the example of cowards i they find they have no advantage over them by their courage for all men would be cowards if they durs to an english soldier a smile or a kind word is as acceptable at some times as a months pay and if you will condescend to a commendation of what they do well the will endeavor on the next occasion to exceed what the did before for if you are once master of their love you are sure to have the disposal of their lives no need you fear to punish them severely provided you reward them bountifully let the insolence of your enemies be rebuked and rebels and traitors to your government be severely punished and not courted and caressed for in the present state of affairs all mercy to your enemies is cruelty to your self and friends and it encourage your enemies and disheartens your loyal subjects to se these insolents brave the government unpunished and t see your treacherous ministers soliciting the pardon o every condemned traitor and making their court to king james at the price of your safety is most provoking to every good man besides it looks like your having a doubt of your own right and title to the government to be thus backward in asserting it and is so interpreted by the jacobites  intelligence as another point of mighty consequence and can scarce be purchased too dear for it is the sou of government and directs all its actions properly and without it you consult in the dark and execute blind fold you know not what to act what to fear where to attack or where to defend i do not mean by this that we are to penetrate into the french kings counsels or rifle his cabinet that i am afraid is out of the reach of our power and of our purse but i cannot but think we may be able to know the marches of their armies and the motions of their fleets without selling our souls to the devil for intelligence or breaking our exchequer  thus sir i have set before your majesty what in my poor judgment is for your interest to pursue and what is for your service to avoid what will make your majesty and this nation happy what will make both unhappy and i heartily pray the great good and wise god to dit bless and prosper your majesty in all your glorious signs for the defense of these kingdoms and of christedom against the common enemy if i have used too great a freedom or have offended in what i designed for your service i am sorry for it i call god to witness my plainness proceeded from my zeal and affection to your interests and the prosperity of your affairs and not from any factious saucy or unmannerly principle i wish some abler pen had taken upon him this part but i must own it provoked me to see my country and my king so forsaken the one of advocates the other of honest counsel and this urged me to take upon me these two characters of advocate and adviser both which i confess my self very unfit for not but that as i said in the beginning i take it to be the privilege nay and the duty too of every english subject provided it be performed formed with a decent and due respect to lay before the king such matters as may be dangerous to his person or government to be concealed from his knowledge for we are not tied up in england to spanish forms where the king must be wet to the skin if he whose proper office o is be not in the way to put on his cloak and i beg your majesty to believe what i have said is from a faithfulness and sincerity which will in all accidents and difficulties preserve me unalterably  your majestys most loyal most dutiful and most obedient subject  to the honest english protestant reader honest reader at the beginning of the late revolution i dare say it wa not expected by thee or me that it would have been ncessary in this reign to have entered into argument whether the principles of whig or tory are most agreeable to t constitution of the english monarchy or which party were to b chosen for the support of our present king and queen but suc is our fate that i am afraid it requires an abler pen than min to convince some who it is highly necessary should be convinced that any of the measures of the late reigns were mistaken the are taught to believe those monarchs in the right nay e those evil counselors too who were so mauled in the declaration of      and none are rogues and villains and deserve to b hanged but those who were most active in the bringing the preset king and queen over and in settling the crown upon their heads i thought it therefore high time that this matter should be se right and in order to it that the principles and practices o whig and tory should be truly and impartially examined which i have endeavored to do to the best of my knowledge and shall b well pleased to see any other do it better from my poor hint  acknowledge the looseness of the style the want of method in the following paper and the many repetitions this dialogueway  writing is liable to will lay it open to the lash of every pedan and schoolmaster but know i write not for fame or out o any vanity of being an author and therefore i come not to you as the apostle says in the enticing words of man wisdom but in plainness and truth etc i have state the matter so fairly that some of the tories may be fools enough perhaps to think i have given them a victory and triumph o their admirals did in their being gazetted because the council wo favorable as to suffer them to pass for mistaken blockheads ead of wilful knavish liars but indeed i thought the tories  so weak a plea that i might well allow them to make the st of it and have left nothing unsaid which i have ever heard m say in their defense what they have done the honest ople and the interest of england most mischief by is that am of a commonwealth which i have in the following disrse i hope convinced all honest men is a false notion imcticable and impossible in england however this is the breastrk which they have always covered themselves with when they signd to fire upon the rights and privileges the laws libers and properties of their country and whenever they do raise is breastwork we must endeavor to beat it about their ears am sure it is too weak to resist any attack and i hope as ays says they fly they fly they fly who first did make at lie what i have here written is with an honest design of ing service to my country and if it either happens to inform  convince any to embrace the public interest and the common od of themselves and fellow creatures i have my end and r the tory critics they may bite till their teeth meet through  book yet i shall be as insensible of their malice as they have en of the kings mercy favor and friendship to them i will mfort my self honest reader that i have thee on my side and  long as thou do continue firm in the support of the english aws and liberties thou do build upon a rock against which  hope the gates of hell shall not prevail and so long i will uild upon thee and hope for all good from thee and pray for all lessings upon thee adieu  a dialogue between whig and tory etc tory well met old acquaintance who would have thought seven years ago to have seen you and i at whitehall together in the same interest  whig in the same interest why who thinks that now  tory what in one of your old peevish fits i thought now all things go to your mind you would have been in better humor  whig you were begotten born and bred in mistakes and i doubt not but you will continue so to your end yet you cannot be so grossly mistaken sure as to think all things go to any honest englishmans mind when you who were the tools of the two last reigns the instruments of all our past and present misfortunes and the declared cause of the war which brought on the late revolution are notwithstanding the only men courted by this government  tory i am afraid you will never be pleased with any monarchical government  whig that is a point i know you have been long endeavoring to put upon the world but more industriously upon the court yet i wonder at your impudence of urging it now since it is so fresh in every mans memory how zealously the whigs struggled in the late convention to settle the monarchy whilst you contested as zealously to make it an anarchy  tory we will talk more of this by and by but if you were so instrumental as you say in setting up this government why are you so out of humor with what you have made your selves  whig disappointment you must allow a just cause of esentment we hoped from new lords new laws new inisters and new methods but if still we are to have e same ministers and consequently the same methods he very tools of the two last reigns and consequently he same work this i take in my lord h  s phrase  be a change without an alteration and in my opin gives too just occasion of dislike and i cannot but nk this way of managing affairs must end unhappily oth to prince and people  tory but how come you and i to be so concerned either or the prosperity of princes who never think of us ut as we can serve some present turn of theirs or for the nterest of mob who will sing ballads upon us under the allows when we are hanging there for their sakes preee whig grow wise and do not torment thy self thus ith state affairs let princes take care of themselves and he people of themselves and let us take care of ourselves my method is to get what i can and let courts do what they will  whig why then sir with your leave your method is  foolish as it is knavish for whoever sells his country o a lawless power leaves himself nor his family no certainty no property in what he has gotten by his treachery nay his estate is as often the snare as the comfort of his life it proves sometimes a naboths vineard and makes him the eyesore of some hungry court favorite and i would ask whether a small estate fenced about with laws and the possession thereof secured o you and your family is not of more value than a much greater revenue of which you cannot assure your self the possession one minute your forefathers thought the laws and liberties of england worth their care and contest and waded through rivers of blood to leave them in force to their posterity and the church once made it an article of their religion nolumus leges angliae mutari but thou do renounce all the principles of humanity of common sense and of religion and oughtst to be driven out of a country which thou make open profession to sell and betray and as for what you say of the ingratitude of princes and people the one to his faithful and affectionate subjects the other to their zealous patriots this does not discharge you from your duty to either but in answer to the first if you will serve princes no farther than you serve your country in serving them that service will always reward it self and for the mob as you are ever pleased most mannerly to call your countrymen and fellowcitizens if any prove so sordid as you alledg i shall answer you in the words of our savior forgive them for they know not what they do and let his example teach you better principles who notwithstanding all the scoffs and indignities he met with laid down h life upon the cross for the benefit of mankind b your principles make you the triumph of heathens a bring you upon the same foot with brute beasts  tory come dont tell us stories of our great grandfat who troubled themselves about trifles there is a fashion in government as well as in clothes which must  complied with according to the humor of the prese age and you may as well pretend to shape all gowns b queen elizabeths fardingale as to shape our court  counsels according to the sentiments of that or other times which were as different too from one another  we are different from them  whig as for your fashion of government mr tor i hope it is either gone to the grave with king charles  to france with king james and could heartily wish yo would follow it to either place but pray before you g let me ask you in what age or time it was that men  sense or men of honor did prefer will and pleasure  laws or slavery to freedom as i take it the principles of liberty and property have always been in fashion amongst men of sense and estates in england and eve will be but your principles can never find professors bu amongst fools and beggars  tory whatever our principles are you find both the and us preferred to you and yours even by a government of your own choosing and let that satisfy you as an answer to that point  whig not at all that only proves a mistake somewhere and where the mistake is if you please we wi inquire and i think it will best appear by examining the original rise principles and practices of both parties  tory come on then a clear stage and no favor  whig as for your original rise it is certain you ow your being known in the world to the horrid and execrable designs of the two late kings to set up arbitrary power and popery amongst us then were all the jails brothels and kennels raked for villains of feared consciences and desperate fortunes your arl  ns cliff  d os  s were then thought upon for ministers of state and under them were bred such a pack of wretches as the court of tiberius would have been ashamed of in the la they were of the same sort with the ministry wha age can parallel your n  ms your n  ths you jeff  is sc  gs rain  ds wri  s etc and ir under managers graham and burton etc then to the pillars of what they then called the church of land tho so disguised at that time that it was scarce wn by its most dutiful most affectionate and most is children i need say no more of them than that  were composed of bishops and a clergy preferred by  kings who were about to set up popery and tyranny  therefore were to choose such men into the governnt of the church who they thought would be most plying with those purposes and whose looseness of als might bring most discredit upon the protestant igion and whoever remembers park  r cart  t nows c  w and wat  n will i think be of the inion they were not ill chosen for the abovesaid pures  tory but you see whatever purposes they were chosen  several of the bishops opposed popery with the great bravery imaginable  whig true they did oppose a popish clergy being ight into their bishoprics churches and colleges  who but a mad man would have expected any other n them but did they ever stick at any thing that ht advance arbitrary power over the laity did they  conjure the people to passiveobedience nonrence etc did they not tie us hand and foot and ow us like daniel into the lions den nay did they r stick at building his popish church for him whilst  contented himself to make use of their hands but en they saw that after they had gone so far in the service others were taken in to finish the work and to reap e fruit of what they had sowed and planted this was deed intolerable and then it was and not before that ey begun to make a noise about the protestant religion and nglish liberties and to preach backward all their former ermons  tory but you cannot deny but that they were very inrumental to the revolution  whig i own they were for some time like fishes who ave got a worm in their heads they did frisk and leap ut of their own element but like them too they soon ungd into it again for king james was scarce got to eversham before they repented what they had done and om that day to this have given all the proofs and marks  an invincible hatred and enmity to the present government they opposed the kings coming to the crown ell into cabals for the weakening his government when e was king and raised rebellion without and plots within the kingdom for the restoring king james etc nay at this time it is undeniable that wherever the clergy are most numerous the jacobites are most numerous too there are more jacobites ten for one in ever cathedral town than in any other towns accountin number for number and how the universities are generally disaffected to this government is notorious the reproach and rail against the very bishops and clergyme preferred in this reign the archbishop of canterb himself whose learning piety and excellencies of a kinds are so eminent that it seems impolitick in them a well as unjust to reproach him yet him too do they rascoff at and treat with the foulest invectives in shor those who every day piously attend the service and religious worship of the church who most frequently a communicants in the holy sacrament these they will nowithstanding call presbyterians canting whining hypocrit etc and esteem none sound members of their body b those who drink with them and come up to all the highest points of dominion tyranny and uncharitablness to all those who are not of their faction i will no call it their church because i think it a dishonor to the best reformed church in the world to be served by such a clergy as are not only a scandal to the name of protestant but to the name of religion and who under the title of protestant priests are laboring with a their power the return of king james with his poper and slavery and preach and pray openly for his restoration whilst no exhortation for obedience to our present king our great deliverer from popery and slavery heard from any pulpit no passiveobedience nor no resistance is named in this reign and if for the sake  their livings they are forced to pray for the king an queen it is in so faint and low a voice as if they ha no mind to be heard either by god or the people  tory some few discontented persons there may be perhaps who may deserve this character but i hope yo do not lay this charge upon the whole clergy of england  whig no i know there are many religious learned an good men amongst them and there will i hope be more if this government continues but that the number  not small who have refused the oaths to this present government you cannot deny and that most of the highchurch as they call themselves those who as a learne doctor said have the spirit of the church in which the were bred tho they will not say with st paul they have the spirit of god the first instance i have met of their modesty  most of this order i say profess to e the oath of allegiance to this king as he is king  facto not de jure and by the example of these reend clergymen the layknaves and fools are dited to take oaths with mental reservations and prie interpretations and distinctions and having no inciple but that of selfinterest in which case you r renounce all justice all humanity to your felloweatures you profess slavery to some that you may d it over others yea renounce and trample upon all ws to serve a turn make a jest of liberty and proper and to gratify your pride or avarice you have berayd your country persecuted and murdered your innont countrymen and fellowcitizens sold your neighrs to the french king and your laws and religion to  late kings and even from the same principles have en endeavoring to bring about the same practices in s reign too and in order to it have been tempting ur lord and master in the language of the devil to  savior all this will i give thee if thou will fall down  worship me and i hope he will answer you in his rds upon that occasion thou shall not tempt the lord thy ng thus have i given you in few lines an account of e rise principles and practices of your party with which i could fill a volume but i consider the nation eds only a general hint to refresh their memory to rticulars for the smart of the wounds received in the e reigns from you is yet most sensible to many honest glishmen  tory if this devil of a tory be so black as you paint m i wonder how he comes by so fair a character and  numerous a party in the nation and so great a counnance from all courts of contrary interests  whig fair appearances and great numbers prove noing the leudest srumpets are often fair and fools and naves have in all ages outnumberd the wise and hoest how ye tories came to have so great a countenance om the last court i have already showed and will ince you command me show you how ye became the avourites of this court too even by the same means and the same man that made you favorites in king harless time for the m of c after all his mischieous management of affairs in that reign having by n ill fate to this poor nation got into some small preence of merit by little assistances he gave to the late revolution upon this he sets up again for ministry but being apprehensive that those honest gentlemen who had o bravely exposed their lives and fortunes for the reemption of their country and were so well acquainted with his methods in the late reigns would be jealous o his having too great a credit with the king he though it his best play to begin with them and from his first coming to court labored to insinuate jealousies into the king of those gentlemen as commonwealthsmen haters  monarchy etc and having likewise an implacable pique t parliaments for their impeachment and imprisonment o him he at the same time represents that part of the government envious of the kings power and always endeavoring to make him a king of clouts a duke o venice etc thus by misrepresenting the kings be friends he made way to bring in his old practices an his old working tools whom he represented to be me of business and friends to monarchy into this cour too and being assisted afterward by the e of n an some others ye have indeed carried all before you an how much to the interest of the nation and the honor of the king let all the world judge who have seen thi poor kingdom every year for this last four years brough to a reasonable apprehension of being invaded from abroad and betrayed at home and in a word to subsis only by a miracle  tory all this rambling story you have told is a will supposition and straining the intention of this nobl lord to your own malicious purpose who designed nothin more in bringing in these gentlemen you call the king enemies than by reconciling them to the king and hi government to make the foundation of it broader an deeper and i know not how this comes to be such  crime and so ill policy with us i have heard that henr the fourth of france who was esteemed a wise and politic prince thought it very good kingcraft to cares his enemies of the league and to make his court to the jesuits  whig and pray what did he get by it did he ever gain either of them heartily into his interest were not those of the league ever ready to plot with the spaniard etc against him and for his dear friends of the church not all his renunciation of his old religion and his old friends not all his gifts his caresses and his courtship could reconcile them to him or so much as save his life when they had it in their power to destroy it for those jealous gentlemen the jesuits never would believe they had his heart till it was sent them in a box to la a college of jeits in anjou fleche to be buried there  tory but notwithstanding your jesuits tale of a tub i  undertake that all the tories as you call them in land both clergy and laymen shall take the oaths  the king and serve him heartily provided he will  one thing  whig what is that  tory utterly discard you whigs and give us the penal ws again upon the fanatics  whig and would that make the foundation of the gonment broader and deeper as you talked just now ides have you not heard a story of one sampson sir o after he had resigned his lock of hair in which his ength lay was delivered up to his enemies by those he  trusted but supposing what you propose if gran might win you to be williamites were king james d yet i am mistaken if whilst he lives and the king  france continues as powerful as at present you will ever  drawn by any courtship to engage so far in the intets of this government as to swear otherwise to the ng than as king de facto nor will you make your renciliation to king james desperate answer to this int plainly and truly  tory wise men will always secure a retreat and selfeservation is a first principle with all men and as a entleman said wittily upon this occasion as long as the overnment can maintain it self and will maintain me is sure of me but i have lived too long at court to die  martyr for any monarch and will always behave my lf so in one court as to be well with the next and o perhaps this is not all that this government might asonably wish from us yet i can tell you they do not beeve that they shall mend themselves by changing us for u for diverse and sundry reasons  whig pray let us have some of them  tory first because you are for a commonwealth gornment and haters of monarchy  whig that is that we are mad men and void of all ommon sense and reason for whoever has either of ese will know a commonwealth to be a chimera imracticable and impossible to be brought about in england  macchiavel be of any authority he says in his    th chapter upon government that where there is not an equaty in the conditions and estates of a people it is impossible for that people or nation to erect and settle a commonwealth he gives you examples to confirm this but i think there are some more to our purpose as being more recent and nearer home upon the revolt of the low countries from the spanish yoke it was necessary for them to put themselves under some form of government and the for being in their own free choice seven of the seventee provinces who were a trading sort of people much upon an equality in their condition and fortune and had fe families of nobility or gentry among them fell naturally into a commonwealthgovernment but the other ten provinces having great numbers of nobility and getry tho they were more immediately under the tyran of the spaniard and had been more particularly sensible o d alvas cruelty and oppression notwithstanding cho rather to continue under the hated government of spai than to accept of the invitation the other seven province had made them of coming into the more hated project of commonwealth so impossible it is to reconcile men ditinguishd by titles and fortunes to mix themselves in common level with the people upon any consideration o disgust whatsoever and whoever will look over wh passed here in england from the year      to the yea    0 will be yet more convinced of the truth of the assertion and of the nonsense of any commonwealth design in this nation perhaps there were never at an time so many men of strong inclinations for a commowealthgovernment as then nor of greater abilities t effect such a design and yet they found the nobilit gentry and dignified clergy such a rub in their way i no art no force could remove and at last they we brought into that confusion and disorder by attempting i that the very people and army who were in this projec of a commonwealth and had overthrown the monarch in order to it and could support cromwell in a singl person yet after his death saw a necessity of restoring the monarchy again and assisted toward it but this wa the dust which the two last courts threw into the people eyes when they would make them blind to arbitrar power and popery and is now one great artifice the jacobites depend upon whereby to separate the friends  this government from its support tho it will always be jeft to understanding men i have heard a story of lady who passing through a crowd to her coach and havin a rich jewel on her breast covered the jewel with one o her hands which a pickpocket in the crowd observin steps up to her and claps his hand upon a place belo which he thought would oblige her to remove her han from her breast to defend it but the lady apprehendin the thiefs design very prudently neglected the fall attack and applied both her hands to the securing he jewel and by that means came off safe and so gentlemen whenever you make your false attack upon o mmonwealth we shall for the future take it for the nal to us that your real aim is at our liberties and perties and shall apply both our hands and hearts to  securing those jewels of inestimable price but to be ous in our case the whigs as i said in the beginning of  discourse have given sufficient proof how little they gnd a commonwealth and how hearty they were to  monarchy in their struggling so zealously to set the wn on the kings head  tory we own you were for giving him the name of a g but after all speak sincerely did you design to e him any more than a king of clouts a duke of ve or a stadtholder  whig we designed to make him as great a king as the ws of england and our ancient constitution make any ng and if you pretend to make him more take the nour of it but sir upon this occasion your party e for making his present majesty less than either a duke venice or a stadtholder of holland for in proposing to e him a regent you make him only a journyman g a subject to king james and accountable to him  what the whigs did to deserve being suspected of a mmonwealth design or of any intention to lessen the gs just power i am yet ignorant  tory you are wilfully so then for what could the meag of the convention be to settle the revenue of the wn from three years to three years and to take away  revenue of the chimnymony one of the fairest flowers  the crown but lessening the kings power and making  government precarious  whig the chimnytax being grown a grievance more sible and more odious to the common people than any er and the danger of being enslaved by giving such at revenues for life to the two last kings by ch they were enabled to maintain standing armies  to subsist without parliaments was so fresh in the mories of all thinking englishmen and so apprehended  them that the kings friends thought it greatly for  service to take away the burden of the one and the prehension of the other from the people and by using ferent methods to those which had been followed in the rmer reigns to make his present majestys government re acceptable to all good men and that he might hereby gn in the hearts of his subjects and be distinguished by em which method if pursued would have given us a rer prospect of our affairs than at present i am afraid  have but this is not the interest of wicked ministers o when kings take their courses lose these dominion over them their business is therefore to make prin jealous of encroachments of parliaments of commwealth designs amongst the people to represent the kin interest separate from the interest of his subjects a then to ingratiate themselves with him and raise thselves in his opinion for their parts and abilities t offer him schemes of politics to prevent designs aga him which were never thought on thus these ho jagos first work a prince up to jealousies and hatred his people by false suggestions and then as a rem against the mischiefs they have supposed put him u designs ruinous to his country and himself but in  mean time by appearing thus zealous for what they  the kings particular interest and glory they insin themselves into some sort of princes favor they bec confidents of all courtintrigues and grow great  rich they dispose all offices and crush all who are their creatures and at last come to awe and govern ki themselves as waitingwomen who when they h debauched their mistresses by their mercenary sollictions and are become the trustees of their frailty t no longer taste the busk nor bitter reproofs for misplac a pin or patch but from servants become mistresses faults are then found with them no liberty denied the even the purse and the rich petticoat is absolutely at waitingwomans service till at last they bring the mistresses to infamy and beggary and so to return the ministry again by this kind of management t make their masters kings of clouts necessitous misera and despised princes for example what made the  king james a king of clouts but those evil counsell who put him upon a despotick and dispensing pow and propagating a religion against law who put  upon preferring papists and irish to protestants and engl who advised his seizing colleges and charters setting highcommissioncourts and making parliaments  laws a nose of wax deny this if you can mr t nay as to your idolking charles ii who notwistanding i believe much the worse of the two broth as sinning against a better understanding and great obligations was it not by these counsels and some these counselors that this gentleman was made a k of clouts too from having all the advantages at the t of his restoration that ever king was blessed with  was beloved delighted in and courted by his subjec was respected abroad in plenty and power at home a could direct the votes of a parliament with a nod m than he could at last with his exchequer yet after  this in a few years by the management of some of  present evil counselors who gave him ill impressions his subjects made him out of love with parliaments  poisoned him with lawless power and love of tricks  worst of poisons to an english king who for their  filthy interest persuaded him to sell dunkirk break  triple league and enter into measures with france dective to the interest of this nation and of all europe  these measures i say he at last became distasteful to  subjects and was forsaken by a parliament the most chd to him and in love with his person to a fault so  at last his necessities drove him to become a pensioner france a fine character for an english king  and if you will believe mr dryden his poetreat he concluded his reign in these miserable cirstances of being despisd abroad and living on tricks  home and how these gentlemens father and ndfather were made kings of clouts by the like meas and the like ministers by endeavoring at lawless ver and laying aside parliaments etc even the histo of those times published by their own authority ke it out plainly and now mr tory if you please  will examine a little into the few examples we have  princes who have practiced a contrary method to  beforementioned one we will inquire what effects t sort of government has produced and we need go  farther i think than queen elizabeths reign the mediate predecessor to the scottish race to fetch a comison that will answer all objections and to give the uty of her government its due luster let us set it off h the difficulties that attended it and surrounded it  the beginning let us consider her in the first place   the weaker sex  a woman  having no a new distinction our statesman have lately found out right tho a lawful title  the greatest part of her bjects of a contrary religion to her  the queen  scotland her next neighbor a pretender to the own  ireland in open rebellion the king of spain  greatest monarch of europe at that time her mortal emy and invader  plots and conspiracies by the pists against her at home  and no ally abroad but e dutch then an infant state and supported by her  d yet we see this poor weak woman in the midst of all ese disadvantages absolute and uncontrolled at home ful and glorious abroad this indeed seems very exordinary let us inquire therefore what methods were then practiced in order to the producing such wonder success was it by corrupting elections or making psioners of parliament men  no for her court pleaded as well in bar of being parliament men as being sheriffs that they were the queens servants that by this we may reasonably conclude there was nothi to be got by it in those days  was it by imployi her sister queen marys ministers or courting her enem the papists  no  for she made england too hot  the one and adorned almost every gibbet in the nati with her justice upon the other  was it by a standi army then  not that neither for she had no art nor no guards but her gentlemenpensioners and y men of the guard i know you will say how the devil a she bring matters about as she did without using any of  admired methods of our late times  in good soo even by so homely and plain a receipt that you will lat at me when i tell it you  only  by loving and coting the love of her people and not preferring scotl french nor irish favorites to them as in the late reig  by being just to their rights and liberties and devot to their interests  by rewarding bountifully and pnishing severely  by encouraging honest men a  browbeating stateprojectors and tricksters kna who persuade princes that their interest is separate fr the interest of their people  who counsel them stretch prerogative or be overfond of it  who endvour to breed unkind thoughts in them to their be friends and honestest subjects this sort of gentlem were out at heels in her time she like a truly wi woman never seemed fond of despotick dominion n of those who flattered her with it and put her upon i for she knew that nolo dominari is the readiest way  power in england and that it is soonest found of those w seek it not  she  wisely thought that to be the deliverer of europe was a greater character than to b conqueror of it and that it would be more truly glorio to redeem one single town from slavery than to enslav the whole world not like some of her successor who unworthy to be sovereigns of the noble order the kings of england wear have chosen rather to be the dragon than st george rather to destroy than to defe their kingdoms she never took money from her subject but she gave them a pennyworth for their penny an was seldom nice in affording them such laws as the thought necessary to their safety for being well assur or her own just intentions she never suspected their and thus at last she got an absolute power even over the s  as a good wife gets a power over her husband oving and obeying him and now i think i have sufently exemplified what sort of ministers and methods  are which make princes great and glorious monarchs  which make them kings of clouts and whether this er character belongs to the whig or tory i submit to  judgment of every impartial and reasonable man but n with your charge  tory it is objected against you whigs also that you do  love the kings person  whig what an accusation have thou blunderd upon n very irish tory thou eternal trifler not love the gs person  it is a thought fit only for a chamberd when the chaplain or valet offer their service to  kings are to be loved by millions of their subjects o never see their persons as heaven is by mankind  their providence and care of their people for the innces they dispense of their justice and mercy and for  universal good and benefits which they scatter amongst ir subjects and in this point their thoughts and signs should be godlike and by any other sort of vers than these any king will be as slenderly accomnyd in his misfortunes as king james was to feversham t beside this accusation is as false as it is foolish pray  who showed the most early inclination to the prince  oranges person the whigs or the tories who went o holland first and begun the project of the prince of anges coming over hither whigs or tories who put the own upon his head when he did come whigs or tories t to come nearer to the point did not the whigs show  most apparent partiality to the prince of oranges person  all the points of the settlement of the crown and rticularly in giving it him for life overlooking at the me time the p of ds title and the lineal succession id they not to a man stand by the kings authority in e debate concerning the p of ds revenue and leave e disposal of that affair entirely to the kings pleasure and now after four years being used like the worst of nemies for all these services after being shut out from eaking to the king and almost from seeing him after eing discountenanced and frowned upon they have notwithstanding like the humorous lieutenant ever showed  grutching to his grace upon the least encouragement or nvitation and have at the opening of every sessions for three winters successively still been ready to swallow the ame sweetnings and to be coaksd by a clap on the cheek like an old city cuckold and cully and have been wrought into a credulity which nothing but their fondness and dotage on the kings person could ha effected  tory but you will not deny that you have sometim expressed your selves peevishly concerning the king  whig and what lover that hangs or drowns hims for his mistress does not do the same railing in a lo is an infallible symptom that he is far gone in the distemper and no woman ever yet resented it when it ca from that cause but our court has not learned to distinguish between those who are angry with them in conce for their prosperity and those who seemed pleased wi them in hopes that they are in the way to destructi and to speak plainly sir the partiality and courtsh which the king has showed to you tories in spite of  your apparent hatred of his person as well as your prfessd dislike of his title and government and the avsion he has showed to the whigs and contempt of all the advances and addresses has begotten ugly reasonings  jealous and prying men as if there were a biass towar the principles of former governments rather than  those this government declared for and set up upon an even the wise and wellmeaning tories begin once aga to smell a t  d when you hold it so near their nos but come proceed  tory you are likewise accused of being wedded to  party and by that means will reduce his majesty to  king of a faction only of his subjects  whig this will appear much otherwise if you w please to remember who brought in the e of n to b secretary of state and many others of that party a how few of your faction were displaced by the whigs when they had interest with the king but this charge wi appear most foully true upon you who by the basest ingratitude and villainy fell upon undermining those wh brought you into the government the minute you were possessed of the kings ear and yet you see notwithstanding all your barbarous treatment of us we have always come in cheerfully to all votes for money all loans and all other measures to support your credit and the common interest till both are fallen so low that the people clamors were never so loud nor their dissatisfaction never so great you like solomons harlot are for tearing the government asunder if you may not have the posession of it we have showed on the other hand true motherly tenderness and consented rather that it should remain in your possession entirely than be torn in piece betwixt us till it appeared to all the world what a vile stepmother you have been and how you have starved and sd a government worthy your most indulgent tenders and care and yet i am not for refusing any tory t gives proof of his sincere repentance and of a ve to his country but with all my heart would give  share of the fatted calf to make the returning proal welcome tho i cannot but think it reasonable that  should submissively seek the government and not the vernment submissively seek you that you should own r sin against heaven and against your country and e security of another course of life for the future  not justify your faults and persevere in them if i ld see amongst any of you the least consideration for  common good and benefit of mankind and the universal welfare of your fellow creatures to which you  bound by the law of god and the law of nature  to which all the heathens who were not barbarous d a most profound reverence and obedience and pred to all private interest to wives children estate  to life it self if i can find any amongst you a lover  his country a sincere supporter of the laws libers and interest of the english nation i am as much his rvant tho he be a not  m a ca  n or a r  r  if he were a sh   a ru  ll a some  rs or a   d but instead of showing any regard to the inrest of the nation any bowels for your country any elfdenial in point of private interest have you not sold ur country and their birthrights upon all occasions ike esau for a mess of pottage have not some of u put off human nature human reason and all common honesty so far as to conspire to bring in a french ower to gratify your private and personal piques to ring in popery and slavery to rule over you because you cannot tyrannically rule over your fellow subjects remember what the presbyterians got by being so active in estoring the two late popish kings hoping to be revenged hereby upon the independents and other dissenters were hey not mingled in the same persecution with the others ay more oppressed and marked out for wrath as being more numerous and more considerable than any other sect ust so must the church and their proselites expect to fare from the hands of their popish friends whose cause they re so zealously propagating they may admit them to the honor of being the catsfoot but not a bit of the chesut no whig no fanatic but will then have as fair quarter at least from king lewis as you for king james i take to be only a cipher and property to your french lord and master who when he has finished his work will finish his life too and do you jure divino you truly loyal gentlemen think that you will find mo favor then for being more attached to king james interest no be assured the most inveterate enemies  king james will meet with as favorable a treatment a least as you who have professed your selves so violent enamored of king jamess person and of the right line reflect a little upon the king of frances conduct at the time of the late revolution he knew long before the prince of oranges design of making a descent into england and could have prevented it a thousand ways but inste of that he writes to barillon then his ambassador  england to know in what condition king james was  oppose the princes forces he being a foreigner an judging only by outward appearances represents the army of king james sufficiently powerful to resist what force the prince of orange could bring whereupon the french king believing that the english and dutch would b this means weaken and destroy one another and leave  fair game for him the next year against the emperor and flanders and to take away all apprehension from the dutch of their needing an army for their own defense and to give all encouragement to their design upon england he draws all his troops from the side of flanders and falls upon philipsburgh which army if he had march toward the spanish frontiers in flanders the dutch dur not have transported a man and the whole design of the descent had been at an end from hence it is plai what friendship the french king had for his dear brother king james and what you may expect from this man o honor and good nature when you have served his turn  come grow wise and honest and let us not divide under this or that ministry under this or that faction or party but let us all unite against the common enemy let us make the public interest and the support of the government as it is established by law our chief and only aim and for all projectors and conspirators whether for a commonwealth or french tyranny or any other tyranny i wish they were all hanged on the same tree the first for fools the others for miscreants and villains and thus much and no more am i for being wedded to a party  tory i own you have told us a fair tale but nothing i proved nothing appears undeniable but your venom and enmity against the church and her friends  whig if you mean the french story needs proving the disgrace of barillon when he returned to versailles upon the account of mistaking and misrepresenting the english affairs is notorious but besides the story proves it self e than a thousand witnesses and for the rest i have ted nothing but what every english man is knowing of d as for what you charge me with in relation to the urch i see little reason for it unless as st paul says  account me your enemy because i tell you the truth  my part i reverence the church of england as much  any man but i am not for sacrificing the laws and erties of the public nay the very nation it self to a eign conquest for the sound of a word i have a due ect for the priesthood too and am their servant but er can submit to be their slave i honor their coat  cannot be content to strip my self of mine in respect to  a moderate respect is decent and our duty more ke to be superstition at least if not idolatry and to ship a wooden priest appears to me as bad as worshipg a wooden god  tory now you are running into your usual violence  heat and let me tell you as a friend it does you no d neither with the church nor court which latter has ery low opinion of those men who express too much rmth in what they say or do  whig and therefore their affairs have succeeded accorgly let the nation be judge whether if men of rmth had been put in office by our ministers the xes would not have been more justly and carefully colted than they have been by those lukewarm manars they have employed who like the unjust steward en the kings due was an hundred bid their neighurs write down fifty or do you think the deputy eutenants of surry would have absconded last year when ey were ordered to raise the militia upon king jamess ming down to normandy if they had been men of armth to the government or that king jamess iends would dare to profess their opinions and carry  their designs so publicly that they would presume  insult the government in every coffeehouse nay in e mall and whitehall it self that they would dare to reaten you to your teeth as they do with invasions escents and rebellions or would venture to correspond ith france and go forward and backward every day to ing james nay raise regiments of horse and foot uner your noses for a rebellion if men of warmth and eal were in the government but it is from hence that all these insolences take their rise that the enemies f the government are come from hating it to despise it that its friends are discouraged to appear for it and that those officers and soldiers who in king charless time ould have broken the heads of those whom they heard reflect upon the kings person or government will  this reign hear both treated very odly not that t want affection to either but out of a fear to offend  showing themselves men of warmth and partymen the characters being so abominable to our court  tory you whigs have been the occasion of all this t for you were so irreconcilable to some ministers of st at the beginning of the revolution because they h made a few slips in the late reigns or perhaps beca they had hanged some of your friends a father or bther or so that you forced them to take in some person whom they themselves thought not very proper for t government but if you will run a man down he  support himself at any rate for men are but men a withal i believe they hoped that a place would buy a party out of their principles and that all whom the brought into the government would be obliged by the means to be for the government  whig this is very far fetched mr tory tho it is t the first time i have heard it but as to the first part  this paragraph the matter of fact is false the wo were willing to forget all past miscarriages and be recocild to any minister that could be honest as i shew you before but these gentlemen quickly convinced a the world that they were grown so old and stiff in the former mischiefs that they were capable of no oth bent or impression but what they had taken in the la reigns and it was plain to every man who had ev that they were no sooner in the ministry but they fe into their old schemes which no honest man could com into and which i am afraid the court has not found the good effects from which these evil counselors promis it is true by giving places to all that were supple an complying you have brought in the knaves of all parties but since that which brings them into the service of the government is their own interest and not that of the government it will be reasonable for our rulers to expect that the whole design of such men will be rathe how to serve themselves of the government than ho to serve it to conclude sir notwithstanding all yo have said in excuse of your ministers and their method i cannot but remain in my first opinion that the men  easy phlegm born on the confines of indifference as sir samue tuke in f  chlike fustian describes our lukewarm neutrals are not fit men to be employed in our government as the case stands at present but will prove as destructive to i as downright jacobites  tory all this is taking things for granted which we y and accusing men of what you do not prove and  were so you confess there are knaves of your party  whig the truth of what i say in relation to your paris so notorious to all the world that it would be as ertinent to go about proving it as to prove there is n even you your selves have confessed and preten to repent of your principles and practices in king mess time tho you are now returned to your vomit  as to what you say of our having knaves amongst us ust confess it too true and am as much afflicted as  can be that any whig should invade your undoubted  sole right of being knaves and selling and betray their fellow subjects but yet we hope we may claim  distinction to be made betwixt our party who not only fess but have maintained to the death the religion ghts and libertys of their country and yours who  king charless and beginning of king jamess reign e up all these things and who tho you are employed  and sworn to the present government made public joicings at the slaughter of our armies and destrucon of our fleets if the whigs have the misfortune of me knaves professing themselves of their party our viour himself had a judas amongst his twelve and t that did not at all discredit the doctrine and inciples of the apostles nor does our having some naves among us make it as reasonable and equal to adere to your party that are the professed enemies of eir king and country as to depend on those who ave generally in all times and on all occasions declared their affection to their country love of its laws and eligion and have since the revolution showed their zeal or the present establishment  tory just now you seemed to agree to a comprehension and were for welcoming the prodigals as you called them ow you are for excluding them again  whig no i am for receiving any tory as i told you that seeks the government and becomes a true penitent ut i would not have the government seek them nor would i have them entrusted in this critical time without some marks of their repentance and regeneracy and by our easiness give them the opportunity of selling us to the french k or k james as i fear some of em do at this time  tory all that is malice and stuff and not reasonably to be apprehended and i tell you once more it is the opinion of some wise men that the king cannot follow a more fatal counsel than to confine himself to any on party of his subjects  whig then your patrons have been advising him fatall these four years for they have been persuading the kin to throw himself entirely into your hands  tory they never refused to receive any whig tha would comply and come under their protection but  the king will choose any one party i think we of the church are the most numerous and considerable and ar fittest as such to be employed by him  whig now you are retired into your sanctuary the church you think you are safe and it is indeed dangerou pursuing you but however i will venture it and since yo force me i must repeat again some of those argument i have given you already why you are not fit to b trusted by this government first you tories do no believe your selves king williams subjects and therefore are very unfit to be employed by him as his servants secondly it cools the affections of the people to se those employed in places of highest trust who they have a demonstration are not for the government even when they are in it and by this method it is plain the king according to the fable loses his shoulder of mutton by catching at the shadow and by aiming at both parties he has neither  tory i confess i am for the kings relying on one party as much as you are tho not yours but however there are great and wise men as i told you of another opinion and i have heard it asked why this method of uniting all parties should not have as good an effect here as in holland for there the prince of orange reconciled all to the common interest  whig i will tell you why first it appears all parties there sincerely intended the good of the government which it is too plain is not your case secondly neither party had any other head to repair to as you tories have the prince of orange had no pretending rival to the right of stadtholder but the king has here a rival a fatherinlaw who pretends a right to the crown who is supported by the greatest power that ever was known in europe so as to make the event appear doubtful even to those who are most zealous to this government and by this means the friends of king james are encouraged to be firm to his interests and neutrals nay and even his fearful enemies are frighted from acting with a zeal against him is this a time then to be trying experiments to put our selves and our affairs into the hands of men bred up and principled against the design of this government is this a time to reconcile our lves to our enemies and to take men out of plots and place them in our cabinet no sure with my lord n  s leave this is not the time in this time of danger those who have been the ancient and declared enemies of king james and who have most reason to expect being hanged if he return are most fit for the king to rely on but when these difficulties are mastered as much comprehension as you please in the mean time your education in toryism your obligations to king james and which is more than both your present hopes from him will make you so averse to this government that no favor no courtship can engage you heartily in its interests and it is nonsense to expect you should fight for a title you have always declared to disapprove of  tory you are always harping upon that string but pposing we do not approve of the making him king t we know how to obey kings when they are made but u after you have made a king are using him like your reature clipping his power and finding fault with his onduct for my part if i were a king i would sooner give a man that disliked my title than one who disliked my conduct  whig why then mr tory you would be none of the sest princes for he who finds fault with your conduct may be your friend but he who finds fault with your title must be your enemy or else a knave and acts against his conscience but how does this article appear of the whigs being dissatifyd with the kings conduct in any point but in his employing you and the consequences of it is it from giving cheerfully whatever ums were demanded in parliament is it being ready to advance money upon the most remote funds in offering their persons to the public service in all times of danger notwithstanding all browbeatings and discouragements by breaking all measures with king james and is party that they discover their dislike and dissatisction to the king or his government but if they isapprove that the friends of king james should be king williams ministers that those should be placed in all offices who hate him and betray him will he have reason to take their dislike of this part of his conduct so very unkindly from them as to forgive it less than your reouncing his right and title to the crown but you tories have got a trick of bringing kings into your quarrels as the priests do god almighty into theirs and by placing them before you hope to make your selve safe not caring how much you expose them and you impudently place your own crimes unfairly upon others and whilst you your selves are daily libelling and lampooning the kings person and conduct most maliciously and triumphing in all his misfortunes ingratefully witnes the public insolences at the bath and windsor upon the late defeat in flanders you according to your wonte modesty charge the whigs with your own faults and avoid being criminals by turning accusers  tory i know not what some hotheaded drunken me may have said and done at the bath or elsewhere b this i know that a whole party ought not to share the miscarriages of some few particular men  whig you are in the right if that were the case b it is undeniable that this insolence is universal and eve amongst those of you employed and paid by the government  tory this is a sore place i find you are ever complaining of but why are you angry with us for being i places did we seek them were we not sought counted entreated to accept of employments and sinc you provoke me i will tell you the reason the king foun none of you whigs capable of or fit for business he sa you too of a sour morose temper jealous of prerogativ affecting popularity childishly fond of trifles and tnacious of lawless liberty whilst we are frank and ea in all these matters and know the respect that is due t crowned heads  whig that is when they are rightful  tory come you will make no prince have the wor opinion of us for that the right line passive obedien and nonresistance prerogative etc will always sound we in every kings ear and when he considers us enemi to his title only out a principle of loyalty he will have reason rather to accuse his own misfortune than o virtue we plainly and honestly told him our principle that we believed him a king de facto only and our hnour in this point made him rely upon our honor  others  whig let us examine then how honorably how gratfully you have behaved your selves to a king who ha relied on you and obliged you so extremely we will pa by those who refuse to swear allegiance to him on the forementioned honorable pretenses and only mention those who have accepted employments of profit and trus have not even those in the government both in englan and scotland been plotting the dethroning this king who has trusted them so generously and courted them so indly particularly did not one of your party at the beginning of this government give notice to the kings enemies of warrants against them in order to their making their escape and was discharged his employment upon it did not a brother of a certain secretary give but blank passes under the hand and seal of that secretary by which a correspondence was carried on betwixt this place and france securely and was not this gentleman on this account laid aside gently and privately and this matter huddled up for fear of any reflection on our monarchical favorites and put on the public as passes forged as indeed they were by our own officers and a lame proclamation put out with rewards to the discoverer but without a pardon for life when they knew the whole matter beforehand have not some women lately been taken going to france with letters o king james with a scottish secretarys pass under his hand and seal was not an officer of the post office ately found corresponding with france and without any other punishment for his capital crime laid aside gently and privately the story of captain john layton late commander of the st albans and which has been told n the house of commons will show you how faithfully ou tories serve the government and how fit you are o be trusted captain layton being ordered to cruise twenty leagues off vshant by a storm of wind was driven to cape clear where he met a french privateer and took her the captain of the privateer asked layton the name of his ship which he told him upon this the privateer looking into his pocketbook asked layton how he came there for by his intelligence the station of the st albans was to be twenty leagues from vshant and no further and the like story is told of a transportship going to france with prisoners some few months ago who meeting with diverse privateers asked them how they durst be so bold as to cruise there when four english men of war were within six leagues of them they replied they knew the station of those english and that they could not come where they were a cruising but by breaking their orders but the relation of the sailor who was taken and for some time served aboard an irish privater is yet more remarkable for he deposes that they told him three months before the straits fleet failed from spithead both the time when they were to sail the number of their convoy and likewise that the main fleet was to go no further than beyo vshant now how they could come by this intelligenc but from officers employed by and sworn to the government i know not and if so how faithfully and honorably you tories serve those who trust you and how  you are to be employed in this critical time i appeal all the world  tory these are malicious stories and if strictly equird into will prove false i dare say  whig whenever there is a committee of indiffere men ordered to take the examination i am inform all this will be proved and much more and how reasonable it is to expect this and any other treachery from you will appear probable to those who see you in a offices daily and publicly drinking king jamess health who see one clerk going to a nonswearing doctor t take advice whether he may serve the government a a writing clerk without damnation to his soul ye replies the doctor for thereby you keep out an i man and may serve your rightful king upon occasion to see another clerk valuing himself to his companions that his place thank god does not oblige him to take the oaths to the government to see officer of the greatest trust in the admiralty in clubs twic a week with mr p  ps mr ew  rs and other known jacobites and from saturday to monday constantly living with them night and day  tory i know who you mean one of them is a nephew to one of the gentlemen and expects  0000 l from him and would you have him renounce such an expectance i consideration of your place  whig no but i would have the government renounce such an officer that had such an expectation from such an uncle  tory but where could you get such able officers if these were discharged  whig as the case stands one honest man will be of more service than ten such able men the forms of business will be quickly learned and want of experience will be less fatal to us than want of fidelity most of the underplaces require a very indifferent understanding and little experience to carry on the business and if you ascend to the ministry i cannot help thinking my lord sh  y or sir j t  d as able secretaries as the e of n and mr r  ll as able an admiral as mr k etc what is it your able men have done for us pray these four years was ever any government in so promising a condition as ours was at the time of the revolution were we not the hopes of all our allies and the terror of our enemies and is not the case altered with us i fear it is to be plain a ministry from wapping could not have made worse work on it than yours have done ministers who know not so much as what money their affairs will require but ask the parliament too little and manage it so as to make it less that want intelligence so much that matters of the greatest consequence have been public in every coffeehouse three days before it comes to the secretarys office particularly the loss of our merchants fleet and beating our army in flanders as if as one said secretaries like cuckolds were to know their dishonor and misfortunes last then the return of our fleets for want of provisions laying out money in false expeditions and anting it thereby in true necessities imperfect orrs from whence proceeds imperfect execution and sides they prove an excuse to officers even in the ost fatal miscarriages with a thousand more mismagements and treacheries from the top to the bottom of the ministry too tedious to relate here  tory and do you think the government would be tter served at this time by novices and strangers to usiness  whig i have answered you that before i think it would be much better served by ignorant friends than understanding enemies tho i am far at the same time from granting you that point for i am sure there are more men of sense and capacity to be found amongst the whigs than amongst the tories and that experience is not of such mighty consequence as you would infer will appear if you will please to call to mind the men employed in public affairs by cromwell was ever government better served than his and yet he chose men of the most private condition and one would have thought most unqualifyd for public business tailors draymen broken shopkeepers raw scholars and some few of the middling gentry but being careful to choose men principled against the government of king charles and zealous for the interest of the government then on foot they did wonders supported their friends and were awful to their enemies and this with all the nobility gentry and clergy both church of england and presbyterian in perpetual combinations and conspiracies against them at home and a war in ireland scotland holland and spain too upon their hands  you have an instance of it in this government in  person of one of your secretaries of scotland who  bred in a very private way has showed himself a  successful statesman and of great consequence to  welfare of the kings affairs in that country and  merely from his incorruptible honesty zeal and integ to the present government without experience or g insight into business  tory i must grant there is something in what  say union and integrity will do great matters  you whigs cannot pretend to this for you are not  of you in the same mind you have no governme no discipline in your party no firmness to one ather or to any point your great p f  y t cadet and carries arms under the general of the  saxons the two har  is father and son are enneers under the late lieutenant of the ordnance a bomb any bill which he has once resolved to red to ashes tho it were for recognition or any thi else that is most necessary to our security your j s and jack g whenever they touch penny will to pot too and drink all in the bowl be it ever  deep and besides this you are always laughing  spising or railing at one another some of you are t wise some of you too witty and some of you too nest for the rest jealous and envious of one another favor and preferment every man thinking hims fittest to be at the head of affairs and hating and  flecting upon those who are so and despising to be vernd or directed by them and at the same ti those who are at the top disdaining to look down upon those below them tho they were the steps by whi they did ascend they grow stately to their frien and unmindful of their fortunes impatient of address hard of access huddling into little cabals where th are wise and witty among themselves whilst we to on the contrary have but one heart one voice o purse and one interest excuse and justify one another faults prefer the meanest fool or knave of our paty and in return the underlings are every man in  perfect obedience to his superior to vote rail write  talk according to direction and not otherwise  whig i own there is too much truth in what y say and you speak truth so seldom that we ought  allow it you when you do but i hope we have seen t error of our disunion and shall mend it for the futur  however we may have had personal differences  likewise may have been too much divided and too inate in some opinions yet still in all times and er all discouragements we have all agreed to the e end viz the public good of our country and  support of its laws and liberties and in this pret reign have been and are unanimous against king mes and his interest and have at all times with one nsent owned his present majesty rightful and law which i take to be the shibboleth to distinguish se who are alone fit to serve this government and  there be an act of recognition in force i will be d to say all the other steps of our ablest and hostest statesmen will be upon boggy ground nor can y man be reasonably employed in any office who s not taken this test for whoever thinks king wilm not rightful must think king james is so and the me conscience which leads them to believe him rightl will incline them to assist that right when they ve opportunity but to return to the point of your harge we must confess likewise that we have not been  much under the government of our superiors as ou are nor so industrious in supporting each others ivate and particular interests but to the first i ight answer that fools and beggars are more easily d by the nose than men of sense and estates and as to the latter i must put you in mind that e societies of ignatius and of newgate are both of them as much united as you in universal mischief r roguery makes a stronger glue and cement than ertue because there are more men capable of the ormer than of the latter and tho it were to be ishd that the whigs were more friendly and had more oncern for the support of one another in all their hoest pretenses yet god forbid there should ever be such  friendship and partiality amongst them as to conemn and disgrace those who gain victories because hey are not of their party and to support and dend those who have lost the ships trade and honor of the nation because they are their creatures but on the other side where it is without offense to justice and the public interest all unanimity and friendship  to be admired praised and prayed for and i hope you ill find it amongst us for the future till it becomes he subject of your envy instead of being an occasion of eproach to put an end to this argument it is plain ith all your friendships and union and other politics you have brought the nation and all its allies to  lowest condition both in power and reputation  have almost put it out of the skill of any condu recover us and whoever now takes the administra of affairs upon them will be applied to the govment like pigeons to the feet of dying men  however to those who are true lovers of their ctry no time seems too late to attempt its relief  difficulty so great as to discourage them from endearing it and tho as the case stands it is more  probable we may miscarry under the best conduct  it is undeniable we must miscarry under yours an i take my leave  finis
