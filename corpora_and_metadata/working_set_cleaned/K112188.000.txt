and exalted genius will meet with its merited reward and your poetical abilities shine in their full splendour   saun upon my soul man you say too much to an unworthy brother  i am a stranger to england but extraordinarily pleased with your good acquaintance which recompenses the toil of my fatiguing journey from the city of edinburgh   goose your toil my friend you will think the greatest pleasure of your life when you find by my unequalled pen your character is raised to the top pinnacle of fame  virgils shade will envy the reputation i am capable of giving you   saun virgil was an eminent poet he is unequalled in this age unless it be in you   goose you speak like a man of judgment brother and i doubt not to convince the ignorant world that virgil amidst his soaring flights and pompous elegance was an ass to s  l   saun but we shall find it a plaguey task to persuade the giddy multitude to this opinion you may seem to resemble the style and manner of the ancients but i fear the colors are faint and will not bear examination  they are strong and sublime we weak and spiritless   goose i thought you gentlemen had more of the hibernian quality than to entertain a mean opinion of your selves and your own capacities lay aside humility if you intend to thrive in the english territories and let conceit hypocrisy and pride take place be bold and audacious in selfpraises learn to cabal flatter and condemn and the games your own   saun to all these i am a stranger my dear    goose for what did you desert your native country  can you expect services from me and you entirely unqualified   saun but hold it is not too late to learn  i believe i can despise merit and for a considerable sum be a considerable flatterer but the greatest work is to compliment my self   goose pugh that is the easiest thing in the world you have nature on your side which incites fondness in all to works of their own production i can do it with an air of gravity and damn with a grace the misbelievers of an untruth   saun but you have the happiness brother to be established and it requires some time for a man to be entered in any thing although it be in iniquity   goose every airy female tells ye her ware is the best most charming the most inviting and all that  and cannot we extol our own verses many whereof describe those beauties they falsely pretend to be mistresses of   saun woudnt it be better that like a fair virtuous woman we make no boastings of our selves but let our own real worth recommend us to mankind   goose there is no such thing as real worth my friend it is all imaginary the whole universe is a sham and false representation  generals are not always made with fighting scholars by learning nor divines by study no management and caballing will save infinite trouble of that kind  it is but to place proper famebrokers at the most remarkable parts of the town fellows of good lungs to bellow out your praise the work is done the ignorant populace famed for credulity will believe it with as much eagerness as they entertain scandal against true merit and thus is a reputation at once acquired   saun but this seems according to my notion of things to be inconsistent with true sense and it is contrary to all scottish politics we are equally backward in praising as in condemning   goose sense sir is nothing else but a rule of acting on the principle of interest so that if it promotes my profit i will applaud my self or any senseless wretch and if my fortune cannot be raised without calumniating what is truly great and glorious the doing it is an argument of sound sense and perfectly consonant with the dictates of nature and the great senecas philosophy   saun i cannot be of your opinion brother i must term that abuse which you are pleased to call sense in spite of the greatest oratory to recommend it   goose you must learn to think more advantagiously if you expect prosperity here  but that i may not be tedious in my first lectures well quit this conversation and retire to a house of diversion in the hundreds of drury well drink till we rival the sun with our ruddy complexions set up all night with the moon lie with half a dozen virgins break all the windows of the mansion and then like true sons of parnassus make a hasty escape and pay no reckoning but leave that to be accounted for by the gods   saun will not

pretense sir to merit   goose as much as you have to be a coxcomb sir   smart the coxcomb does not belong to me at present   goose i can write sense and english a capacity you are unacquainted with   smart in your walk to st j  s street there is neither english sense nor grammar and your best pieces of poetry are but trifles   goose it would be an honor to you sir to be the author of such trifles   smart i can receive no honor from your accomplishments  you have by good fortune indeed wrote one piece that has sold but more from the popularity of the subject than the performance your best scenes of love are notoriously worse than those of the lowest poet in this or any other age  the few similies are no way adapted and really appear like flowers in a dunghill  in your other poetical writings all the beauties are borrowed if we divest you of your thefts you will resemble the crow in the fable and little will remain but froth and rhyme   goose thou foolish boy do thee pretend to criticize on the greatest genius of the age   smart you may compliment your genius as you please and your friends may give it out but i shall take liberty to affirm that it is far from being a perfect one in poetry a perfect genius is capable of producing a finished piece of the greatest length which is what you will never be master of  a few good lines i confess you sometimes happen to write but more from a flashy wit than a true native genius   goose my genius is eminently conspicuous in every thing i do  can you peruse any performance of mine where i dont strike out with a surprising strength of poetical fury  and in my odes my flights are very extraordinary   smart your flights are like those of the owl never soaring or lofty if you intend to gain a solid reputation you must strike out the greatest part of what you have written leave off recommending the works of others in order to assume the honor of the whole yourself and blaming that which you cannot mend for no other reason than because you have had no hand in it   goose why all this unmerited calumny   smart your talent is calumny brother though preposterously mixed with panegyric  you can condemn and praise even the same thing and at such times as it merits neither your censure nor approbation  you can lampoon your best friends and abuse your greatest benefactors in their absence and supported by a gamester you think to bully mankind   goose this is provoking with a vengeance would any one but a poet bear all this   smart you are born to bear the burden of your folly and the repetition of your faults  a first rateminister of state was first your patron him you have commended to excess since you have let fly at him at least twenty satyrs on a great statesman whom you have lately praised first a satyr then a panegyric on a certain noble lord first a panegyric then a lampoon a great commoner first a satyr then a compliment and many other instances of this kind i could enumerate and as hypocrisy is your principle the whigs have your present praises but the tories and jacobites your affections   goose if i should gain any honor by beating of a monkey i would do it   smart come on  i have some inches of my sword at your service   goose but few inches for a lady i presume  youre a child and deserve the rod  farewell   exit smart adieu  what a vain conceited wretch is this he gives me an aversion to
