cecilia or memoirs of an heiress  by the author of evelina  in five volumes  vol i  london printed for t pain and son at the mewsgate and t cadell in the strand mdcclxxxii  advertisement the indulgence shown by the public to evelina which unpatronized unaided and unowned past through four editions in one year has encouraged its author to risk this second attempt the animation of success is too universally acknowledged to make the writer of the following sheets dread much censure of temerity though the precariousness of any power to give pleasure suppresses all vanity of confidence and sends cecilia into the world with scarce more hope though far more encouragement than attended her highlyhonoured predecessor evelina  july      cecilia book i chapter i a journey peace to the spirits of my honored parents respected be their remains and immortalized their virtues may time while it moulders their frail relics to dust commit to tradition the record of their goodness and oh may their orphandescendant be influenced through life by the remembrance of their purity and be solaced in death that by her it was unsullied  such was the secret prayer with which the only survivor of the beverley family quitted the abode of her youth and residence of her forefathers while tears of recollecting sorrow filled her eyes and obstructed the last view of her native town which had excited them  cecilia this fair traveller had lately entered into the oneandtwentieth year of her age her ancestors had been rich farmers in the county of suffolk though her father in whom a spirit of elegance had supplanted the rapacity of wealth had spent his time as a private country gentleman satisfied without increasing his store to live upon what he inherited from the labors of his predecessors she had lost him in her early youth and her mother had not long survived him they had bequeathed to her  0000 l and consigned her to the care of the dean of  her uncle with this gentleman in whom by various contingencies the accumulated possessions of a rising and prosperous family were centred she had passed the last four years of her life and a few weeks only had yet elapsed since his death which by depriving her of her last relation made her heiress to an estate of  000 l per annum with no other restriction than that of annexing her name if she married to the disposal of her hand and her riches  but though thus largely indebted to fortune to nature she had yet greater obligations her form was elegant her heart was liberal her countenance announced the intelligence of her mind her complexion varied with every emotion of her soul and her eyes the heralds of her speech now beamed with understanding and now glistened with sensibility  for the short period of her minority the management of her fortune and the care of her person had by the dean been entrusted to three guardians among whom her own choice was to settle her residence but her mind saddened by the loss of all her natural friends coveted to regain its serenity in the quietness of the country and in the bosom of an aged and maternal counselor whom she loved as her mother and to whom she had been known from her childhood  the deanery indeed she was obliged to relinquish a long repining expectant being eager by entering it to bequeath to another the anxiety and suspense he had suffered himself though probably without much impatience to shorten their duration in favor of the next successor but the house of mrs charlton her benevolent friend was open for her reception and the alleviating tenderness of her conversation took from her all wish of changing it  here she had dwelt since the interment of her uncle and here from the affectionate gratitude of her disposition she had perhaps been content to dwell till her own had not her guardians interfered to remove her  reluctantly she complied she quitted her early companions the friend she most revered and the spot which contained the relics of all she had yet lived to lament and accompanied by one of her guardians and attended by two servants she began her journey from bury to london  mr harrel this gentleman though in the prime of his life though gay fashionable and splendid had been appointed by her uncle to be one of her trustees a choice which had for object the peculiar gratification of his niece whose most favorite young friend mr harrel had married and in whose house he therefore knew she would most wish to live  whatever goodnature could dictate or politeness suggest to dispel her melancholy mr harrel failed not to urge and cecilia in whose disposition sweetness was tempered with dignity and gentleness with fortitude suffered not his kind offices to seem ineffectual she kissed her hand at the last glimpse a friendly hill afforded of her native town and made an effort to forget the regret with which she lost sight of it she revived her spirits by plans of future happiness dwelt upon the delight with which she should meet her young friend and by accepting his consolation amply rewarded his trouble  her serenity however had yet another though milder trial to undergo since another friend was yet to be met and another farewell was yet to be taken  at the distance of seven miles from bury resided mr monckton the richest and most powerful man in that neighborhood at whose house cecilia and her guardian were invited to breakfast in their journey  mr monckton who was the younger son of a noble family was a man of parts information and sagacity to great native strength of mind he added a penetrating knowledge of the world and to faculties the most skilful of investigating the character of every other a dissimulation the most profound in concealing his own in the bloom of his youth impatient for wealth and ambitious of power he had tied himself to a rich dowager of quality whose age though sixtyseven was but among the smaller species of her evil properties her disposition being far more repulsive than her wrinkles an inequality of years so considerable had led him to expect that the fortune he had thus acquired would speedily be released from the burden with which it was at present incumbered but his expectations proved as vain as they were mercenary and his lady was not more the dupe of his protestations than he was himself of his own purposes ten years he had been married to her yet her health was good and her faculties were unimpaired eagerly he had watched for her dissolution yet his eagerness had injured no health but his own so shortsighted is selfish cunning that in aiming no further than at the gratification of the present moment it obscures the evils of the future while it impedes the perception of integrity and honor  his ardour however to attain the blessed period of returning liberty deprived him neither of spirit nor inclination for intermediate enjoyment he knew the world too well to incur it is censure by illtreating the woman to whom he was indebted for the rank he held in it he saw her indeed but seldom yet he had the decency alike in avoiding as in meeting her to show no abatement of civility and good breeding but having thus sacrificed to ambition all possibility of happiness in domestic life he turned his thoughts to those other methods of procuring it which he had so dearly purchased the power of essaying  the resources of pleasure to the possessors of wealth are only to be cut off by the satiety of which they are productive a satiety which the vigorous mind of mr monckton had not yet suffered him to experience his time therefore was either devoted to the expensive amusements of the metropolis or spent in the country among the gayest of its diversions  the little knowledge of fashionable manners and of the characters of the times of which cecilia was yet mistress she had gathered at the house of this gentleman with whom the dean her uncle had been intimately connected for as he preserved to the world the same appearance of decency he supported to his wife he was every where well received and being but partially known was extremely respected the world with its wonted facility repaying his circumspect attention to its laws by silencing the voice of censure guarding his character from impeachment and his name from reproach  cecilia had been known to him half her life she had been caressed in his house as a beautiful child and her presence was now solicited there as an amiable acquaintance her visits indeed had by no means been frequent as the illhumour of lady margaret monckton had rendered them painful to her yet the opportunities they had afforded her of mixing with people of fashion had served to prepare her for the new scenes in which she was soon to be a performer  mr monckton in return had always been a welcome guest at the deanery his conversation was to cecilia a neverfailing source of information as his knowledge of life and manners enabled him to start those subjects of which she was most ignorant and her mind copious for the admission and intelligent for the arrangement of knowledge received all new ideas with avidity  pleasure given in society like money lent in usury returns with interest to those who dispense it and the discourse of mr monckton conferred not a greater favor upon cecilia than her attention to it repaid and thus the speaker and the hearer being mutually gratified they had always met with complacency and commonly parted with regret  this reciprocation of pleasure had however produced different effects upon their minds the ideas of cecilia were enlarged while the reflections of mr monckton were embittered he here saw an object who to all the advantages of that wealth he had so highly prized added youth beauty and intelligence though much her senior he was by no means of an age to render his addressing her an impropriety and the entertainment she received from his conversation persuaded him that her good opinion might with ease be improved into a regard the most partial he regretted the venal rapacity with which he had sacrificed himself to a woman he abhorred and his wishes for her final decay became daily more fervent he knew that the acquaintance of cecilia was confined to a circle of which he was himself the principal ornament that she had rejected all the proposals of marriage which had hitherto been made to her and as he had sedulously watched her from her earliest years he had reason to believe that her heart had escaped any dangerous impression this being her situation he had long looked upon her as his future property as such he had indulged his admiration and as such he had already appropriated her estate though he had not more vigilantly inspected into her sentiments than he had guarded his own from a similar scrutiny  the death of the dean her uncle had indeed much alarmed him he grieved at her leaving suffolk where he considered himself the first man alike in parts and in consequence and he dreaded her residing in london where he foresaw that numerous rivals equal to himself in talents and in riches would speedily surround her rivals too youthful and sanguine not shackled by present ties but at liberty to solicit her immediate acceptance beauty and independence rarely found together would attract a crowd of suitors at once brilliant and assiduous and the house of mr harrel was eminent for it is elegance and gaiety but yet undaunted by danger and confiding in his own powers he determined to pursue the project he had formed not fearing by address and perseverance to ensure its success  chap ii an argument mr monckton had at this time a party of company assembled at his house for the purpose of spending the christmas holidays he waited with anxiety the arrival of cecilia and flew to hand her from the chaise before mr harrel could alight he observed the melancholy of her countenance and was much pleased to find that her london journey had so little power to charm her he conducted her to the breakfast parlour where lady margaret and his friends expected her  lady margaret received her with a coldness that bordered upon incivility irascible by nature and jealous by situation the appearance of beauty alarmed and of cheerfulness disgusted her she regarded with watchful suspicion whoever was addressed by her husband and having marked his frequent attendance at the deanery she had singled out cecilia for the object of her peculiar antipathy while cecilia perceiving her aversion though ignorant of its cause took care to avoid all intercourse with her but what ceremony exacted and pitied in secret the unfortunate lot of her friend  the company now present consisted of one lady and several gentlemen  miss bennet the lady was in every sense of the phrase the humble companion of lady margaret she was lowborn meanly educated and narrowminded a stranger alike to innate merit or acquired accomplishments yet skilful in the art of flattery and an adept in every species of low cunning with no other view in life than the attainment of affluence without labor she was not more the slave of the mistress of the house than the tool of it is master receiving indignity without murmur and submitting to contempt as a thing of course  among the gentlemen the most conspicuous by means of his dress was mr aresby a captain in the militia a young man who having frequently heard the words redcoat and gallantry put together imagined the conjunction not merely customary but honorable and therefore without even pretending to think of the service of his country he considered a cockade as a badge of politeness and wore it but to mark his devotion to the ladies whom he held himself equipped to conquer and bound to adore  the next who by forwardness the most officious took care to be noticed was mr morris a young lawyer who though rising in his profession owed his success neither to distinguished abilities nor to skillsupplying industry but to the art of uniting suppleness to others with confidence in himself to a reverence of rank talents and fortune the most profound he joined an assurance in his own merit which no superiority could depress and with a presumption which encouraged him to aim at all things he blended a good humor that no mortification could lessen and while by the pliability of his disposition he avoided making enemies by his readiness to oblige he learned the surest way of making friends by becoming useful to them  there were also some neighboring squires and there was one old gentleman who without seeming to notice any of the company sat frowning in a corner  but the principal figure in the circle was mr belfield a tall thin young man whose face was all animation and whose eyes sparkled with intelligence he had been intended by his father for trade but his spirit soaring above the occupation for which he was designed from repining led him to resist and from resisting to rebel he eloped from his friends and contrived to enter the army but fond of the polite arts and eager for the acquirement of knowledge he found not this way of life much better adapted to his inclination than that from which he had escaped he soon grew weary of it was reconciled to his father and entered at the temple but here too volatile for serious study and too gay for laborious application he made little progress and the same quickness of parts and vigor of imagination which united with prudence or accompanied by judgment might have raised him to the head of his profession being unhappily associated with sickleness and caprice served only to impede his improvement and obstruct his preferment and now with little business and that little neglected a small fortune and that fortune daily becoming less the admiration of the world but that admiration ending simply in civility he lived an unsettled and unprofitable life generally caressed and universally sought yet careless of his interest and thoughtless of the future devoting his time to company his income to dissipation and his heart to the muses  i bring you said mr monckton as he attended cecilia into the room a subject of sorrow in a young lady who never gave disturbance to her friends but in quitting them  if sorrow cried mr belfield darting upon her his piercing eyes wears in your part of the world a form such as this who would wish to change it for a view of joy  she is divinely handsome indeed cried the captain affecting an involuntary exclamation  mean time cecilia who was placed next to the lady of the house quietly began her breakfast mr morris the young lawyer with the most easy freedom seating himself at her side while mr monckton was elsewhere arranging the rest of his guests in order to secure that place for himself  mr morris without ceremony attacked his fair neighbor he talked of her journey and the prospects of gaiety which it opened to her view but by these finding her unmoved he changed his theme and expatiated upon the delights of the spot she was quitting studious to recommend himself to her notice and indifferent by what means one moment he flippantly extolled the entertainments of the town and the next rapturously described the charms of the country a word a look sufficed to mark her approbation or dissent which he no sooner discovered than he slided into her opinion with as much facility and satisfaction as if it had originally been his own  mr monckton suppressing his chagrin waited some time in expectation that when this young man saw he was standing he would yield to him his chair but the remark was not made and the resignation was not thought of the captain too regarding the lady as his natural property for the morning perceived with indignation by whom he was supplanted while the company in general saw with much surprise the place they had severally forborne to occupy from respect to their host thus familiarly seized upon by the man who in the whole room had the least claim either from age or rank to consult nothing but his own inclination  mr monckton however when he found that delicacy and good manners had no weight with his guest thought it most expedient to allow them none with himself and therefore disguising his displeasure under an appearance of facetiousness he called out come morris you that love christmas sports what say you to the game of moveall  i like it of all things answered morris and starting from his chair he skipped to another  so should i too cried mr monckton instantly taking his place were i to remove from any seat but this  morris though he felt himself outwitted was the first to laugh and seemed as happy in the change as mr monckton himself  mr monckton now addressing himself to cecilia said we are going to lose you and you seem concerned at leaving us yet in a very few months you will forget bury forget its inhabitants and forget its environs  if you think so answered cecilia must i not thence infer that bury its inhabitants and its environs will in a very few months forget me  ay ay and so much the better said lady margaret muttering between her teeth so much the better  i am sorry you think so madam cried cecilia coloring at her illbreeding  you will find said mr monckton affecting the same ignorance of her meaning that cecilia really felt as you mix with the world you will find that lady margaret has but expressed what by almost every body is thought to neglect old friends and to court new acquaintance though perhaps not yet avowedly delivered as a precept from parents to children is nevertheless so universally recommended by example that those who act differently incur general censure for affecting singularity  it is happy then for me answered cecilia that neither my actions nor myself will be sufficiently known to attract public observation  you intend then madam said mr belfield in defiance of these maxims of the world to be guided by the light of your own understanding  and such returned mr monckton at first setting out in life is the intention of every one the closet reasoner is always refined in his sentiments and always confident in his virtue but when he mixes with the world when he thinks less and acts more he soon finds the necessity of accomodating himself to such customs as are already received and of pursuing quietly the track that is already marked out  but not exclaimed mr belfield if he has the least grain of spirit the beaten track will be the last that a man of parts will deign to tread for common rules were never designed directors of a noble mind   a pernicious maxim a most pernicious maxim cried the old gentleman who sat frowning in a corner of the room  deviations from common rules said mr monckton without taking any notice of this interruption when they proceed from genius are not merely pardonable but admirable and you belfield have a peculiar right to plead their merits but so little genius as there is in the world you must surely grant that pleas of this sort are very rarely to be urged  and why rarely cried belfield but because your general rules your appropriated customs your settled forms are but so many absurd arrangements to impede not merely the progress of genius but the use of understanding if man dared act for himself if neither worldly views contracted prejudices eternal precepts nor compulsive examples swayed his better reason and impelled his conduct how noble indeed would he be how infinite in faculties in apprehension how like a god hamlet   all this answered mr monckton is but the doctrine of a lively imagination that looks upon impossibilities simply as difficulties and upon difficulties as mere invitations to victory but experience teaches another lesson experience shows that the opposition of an individual to a community is always dangerous in the operation and seldom successful in the event  never indeed without a concurrence strange as desirable of fortunate circumstances with great abilities  and why is this returned belfield but because the attempt is so seldom made the pitiful prevalence of general conformity extirpates genius and murders originality man is brought up not as if he were the noblest work of god but as a mere ductile machine of human formation he is early taught that he must neither consult his understanding nor pursue his inclinations left unhappily for his commerce with the world his understanding should be averse to fools and provoke him to despise them and his inclinations to the tyranny of perpetual restraint and give him courage to abjure it  i am ready enough to allow answered mr monckton that an excentric genius such for example as yours may murmur at the tediousness of complying with the customs of the world and wish unconfined and at large to range through life without any settled plan or prudential restriction but would you therefore grant the same license to every one would you wish to see the world peopled with defiers of order and contemners of established forms and not merely excuse the irregularities resulting from uncommon parts but encourage those also to lead who without blundering cannot even follow  i would have all men replied belfield whether philosophers or idiots act for themselves every one would then appear what he is enterprise would be encouraged and imitation abolished genius would feel its superiority and folly its insignificance and then and then only should we cease to be surfeited with that eternal sameness of manner and appearance which at present runs through all ranks of men  petrifying dull work this mon ami said the captain in a whisper to morris  de grace start some new game  with all my heart answered he and then suddenly jumping up exclaimed a hare a hare  where  where  which way and all the gentlemen arose and ran to different windows except the master of the house the object of whose pursuit was already near him  morris with much pretended earnestness flew from window to window to trace footsteps upon the turf which he knew had not printed it yet never inattentive to his own interest when he perceived in the midst of the combustion he had raised that lady margaret was incensed at the noise it produced he artfully gave over his search and seating himself in a chair next to her eagerly offered to assist her with cakes chocolate or whatever the table afforded  he had however effectually broken up the conversation and breakfast being over mr harrel ordered his chaise and cecilia arose to take leave  and now not without some difficulty could mr monckton disguise the uneasy fears which her departure occasioned him taking her hand i suppose he said you will not permit an old friend to visit you in town lest the sight of him should prove a disagreeable memorial of the time you will soon regret having wasted in the country  why will you say this mr monckton cried cecilia i am sure you cannot think it  these profound studiers of mankind madam said belfield are mighty sorry champions for constancy or friendship they wage war with all expectations but of depravity and grant no quarter even to the purest designs where they think there will be any temptation to deviate from them  temptation said mr monckton is very easy of resistance in theory but if you reflect upon the great change of situation miss beverley will experience upon the new scenes she will see the new acquaintance she must make and the new connections she may form you will not wonder at the anxiety of a friend for her welfare  but i presume cried belfield with a laugh miss beverly does not mean to convey her person to town and leave her understanding locked up with other natural curiosities in the country why therefore may not the same discernment regulate her adoption of new acquaintance and choice of new connections that guided her selection of old ones do you suppose that because she is to take leave of you she is to take leave of herself  where fortune smiles upon youth and beauty answered mr monckton do you think it nothing that their fair possessor should make a sudden transition of situation from the quietness of a retired life in the country to the gaiety of a splendid town residence  where fortune frowns upon youth and beauty returned belfield they may not irrationally excite commiseration but where nature and chance unite their forces to bless the same object what room there may be for alarm or lamentation i confess i cannot divine  what cried mr monckton with some emotion are there not sharpers fortunehunters sycophants wretches of all sorts and denominations who watch the approach of the rich and unwary feed upon their inexperience and prey upon their property  come come cried mr harrel it is time i should hasten my fair ward away if this is your method of describing the place she is going to live in  is it possible cried the captain advancing to cecilia that this lady has never yet tried the town and then lowering his voice and smiling languishingly in her face he added can any thing so divinely handsome have been immured in the country ah quelle honte do you make it a principle to be so cruel  cecilia thinking such a compliment merited not any other notice than a slight bow turned to lady margaret and said should your ladyship be in town this winter may i expect the honor of hearing where i may wait upon you  i dont know whether i shall go or not answered the old lady with her usual ungraciousness  cecilia would now have hastened away but mr monckton stopping her again expressed his fears of the consequences of her journey be upon your guard he cried with all new acquaintance judge nobody from appearances form no friendship rashly take time to look about you and remember you can make no alteration in your way of life without greater probability of faring worse than chance of faring better keep therefore as you are and the more you see of others the more you will rejoice that you neither resemble nor are connected with them  this from you mr monckton cried belfield what is become of your conformity system i thought all the world was to be alike or only so much the worse for any variation  i spoke said mr monckton of the world in general not of this lady in particular and who that knows who that sees her would not wish it were possible she might continue in every respect exactly and unalterably what she is at present  i find said cecilia you are determined that flattery at least should i meet with it shall owe no pernicious effects to its novelty  well miss beverley cried mr harrel will you now venture to accompany me to town or has mr monckton frightened you from proceeding any farther  if replied cecilia i felt no more sorrow in quitting my friends than i feel terror in venturing to london with how light a heart should i make the journey  brava cried belfield i am happy to find the discourse of mr monckton has not intimidated you nor prevailed upon you to deplore your condition in having the accumulated misery of being young fair and affluent  alas poor thing exclaimed the old gentleman who sat in the corner fixing his eyes upon cecilia with an expression of mingled grief and pity  cecilia started but no one else paid him any attention  the usual ceremonies of leavetaking now followed and the captain with most obsequious reverence advanced to conduct cecilia to the carriage but in the midst of the dumb eloquence of his bows and smiles mr morris affecting not to perceive his design skipped gaily between them and without any previous formality seized the hand of cecilia himself failing not however to temper the freedom of his action by a look of respect the most profound  the captain shrugged and retired but mr monckton enraged at his assurance and determined it should nothing avail him exclaimed why how now morris do you take away the privilege of my house  true true answered morris you members of parliament have an undoubted right to be tenacious of your privileges then bowing with a look of veneration to cecilia he resigned her hand with an air of as much happiness as he had taken it  mr monckton in leading her to the chaise again begged permission to wait upon her in town mr harrel took the hint and entreated him to consider his house as his own and cecilia gratefully thanking him for his solicitude in her welfare added and i hope sir you will honor me with your counsel and admonitions with respect to my future conduct whenever you have the goodness to let me see you  this was precisely his wish he begged in return that she would treat him with confidence and then suffered the chaise to drive off  chap iii an arrival as soon as they lost sight of the house cecilia expressed her surprise at the behavior of the old gentleman who sat in the corner whose general silence seclusion from the company and absence of mind had strongly excited her curiosity  mr harrel could give her very little satisfaction he told her that he had twice or thrice met him in public places where every body remarked the singularity of his manners and appearance but that he had never discoursed with any one to whom he seemed known and that he was as much surprised as herself in seeing so strange a character at the house of mr monckton  the conversation then turned upon the family they had just quitted and cecilia warmly declared the good opinion she had of mr monckton the obligations she owed to him for the interest which from her childhood he had always taken in her affairs and her hopes of reaping much instruction from the friendship of a man who had so extensive a knowledge of the world  mr harrel professed himself well satisfied that she should have such a counselor for though but little acquainted with him he knew he was a man of fortune and fashion and well esteemed in the world they mutually compassionated his unhappy situation in domestic life and cecilia innocently expressed her concern at the dislike lady margaret seemed to have taken to her a dislike which mr harrel naturally enough imputed to her youth and beauty yet without suspecting any cause more cogent than a general jealousy of attractions of which she had herself so long outlived the possession  as their journey drew near to its conclusion all the uneasy and disagreeable sensations which in the bosom of cecilia had accompanied its commencement gave way to the expectation of quick approaching happiness in again meeting her favorite young friend  mrs harrel had in childhood been her playmate and in youth her schoolfellow a similarity of disposition with respect to sweetness of temper had early rendered them dear to each other though the resemblance extended no farther mrs harrel having no pretensions to the wit or understanding of her friend but she was amiable and obliging and therefore sufficiently deserving affection though neither blazing with attractions which laid claim to admiration nor endowed with those superior qualities which mingle respect in the love they inspire  from the time of her marriage which was near three years she had entirely quitted suffolk and had had no intercourse with cecilia but by letter she was now just returned from violet bank the name given by mr harrel to a villa about twelve miles from london where with a large party of company she had spent the christmas holidays  their meeting was tender and affectionate the sensibility of cecilias heart flowed from her eyes and the gladness of mrs harrels dimpled her cheeks  as soon as their mutual salutations expressions of kindness and general enquiries had been made mrs harrel begged to lead her to the drawing room where she added you will see some of my friends who are impatient to be presented to you  i could have wished said cecilia after so long an absence to have passed this first evening alone with you  they are all people who particularly desired to see you she answered and i had them by way of entertaining you as i was afraid you would be out of spirits at leaving bury  cecilia finding the kindness of her intentions forbore any further expostulation and quietly followed her to the drawingroom but as the door was opened she was struck with amazement upon finding that the apartment which was spacious lighted with brilliancy and decorated with magnificence was more than half filled with company every one of which was dressed with gaiety and profusion  cecilia who from the word friends expected to have seen a small and private party selected for the purpose of social converse started involuntarily at the sight before her and had hardly courage to proceed  mrs harrel however took her hand and introduced her to the whole company who were all severally named to her a ceremonial which though not merely agreeable but even necessary to those who live in the gay world in order to obviate distressing mistakes or unfortunate implications in discourse would by cecilia have been willingly dispensed with since to her their names were as new as their persons and since knowing nothing of their histories parties or connections she could to nothing allude it therefore served but to heighten her color and increase her embarrassment  a native dignity of mind however which had early taught her to distinguish modesty from bashfulness enabled her in a short time to conquer her surprise and recover her composure she entreated mrs harrel to apologize for her appearance and being seated between two young ladies endeavored to seem reconciled to it herself  nor was this very difficult for while her dress which she had not changed since her journey joined to the novelty of her face attracted general observation the report of her fortune which had preceded her entrance secured to her general respect she soon found too that a company was not necessarily formidable because full dressed that familiarity could be united with magnificence and that though to her every one seemed attired to walk in a procession or to grace a drawing room no formality was assumed and no solemnity was affected every one was without restraint even rank obtained but little distinction ease was the general plan and entertainment the general pursuit  cecilia though new to london which city the ill health of her uncle had hitherto prevented her seeing was yet no stranger to company she had passed her time in retirement but not in obscurity since for some years past she had presided at the table of the dean who was visited by the first people of the country in which he lived and notwithstanding his parties which were frequent though small and elegant though private had not prepared her for the splendor or the diversity of a london assembly they yet by initiating her in the practical rules of good breeding had taught her to subdue the timid fears of total inexperience and to repress the bashful feelings of shamefaced awkwardness fears and feelings which rather call for compassion than admiration and which except in extreme youth serve but to degrade the modesty they indicate  she regarded therefore the two young ladies between whom she was seated rather with a wish of addressing than a shyness of being attacked by them but the elder miss larolles was earnestly engaged in discourse with a gentleman and the younger miss leeson totally discouraged her by the invariable silence and gravity with which from time to time she met her eyes  uninterrupted therefore except by occasional speeches from mr and mrs harrel she spent the first part of the evening merely in surveying the company  nor was the company dilatory in returning her notice since from the time of her entrance into the room she had been the object of general regard  the ladies took an exact inventory of her dress and internally settled how differently they would have been attired if blessed with equal affluence  the men disputed among themselves whether or not she was painted and one of them asserting boldly that she rouged well a debate ensued which ended in a bet and the decision was mutually agreed to depend upon the color of her cheeks by the beginning of april when if unfaded by bad hours and continual dissipation they wore the same bright bloom with which they were now glowing her champion acknowledged that his wager would be lost  in about half an hour the gentleman with whom miss larolles had been talking left the room and then that young lady turning suddenly to cecilia exclaimed how odd mr meadows is do you know he says he shall not be well enough to go to lady nylands assembly how ridiculous as if that could hurt him  cecilia surprised at an attack so little ceremonious lent her a civil but silent attention  you shall be there shant you she added  no maam i have not the honor of being at all known to her ladyship  o there is nothing in that returned she for mrs harrel can acquaint her you are here and then you know she will send you a ticket and then you can go  a ticket repeated cecilia does lady nyland only admit her company with tickets  o lord cried miss larolles laughing immoderately dont you know what i mean why a ticket is only a visiting card with a name upon it but we all call them tickets now  cecilia thanked her for the information and then miss larolles enquired how many miles she had traveled since morning  seventythree answered cecilia which i hope will plead my apology for being so little dressed  o youre vastly well returned the other and for my part i never think about dress but only conceive what happened to me last year do you know i came to town the twentieth of march was not that horrid provoking  perhaps so said cecilia but i am sure i cannot tell why  not tell why repeated miss larolles why dont you know it was the very night of the grand private masquerade at lord dariens i would not have missed it for the whole universe i never traveled in such an agony in my life we did not get to town till monstrous late and then do you know i had neither a ticket nor a habit only conceive what a distress well i sent to every creature i knew for a ticket but they all said there was not one to be had so i was just like a mad creature  but about ten or eleven oclock a young lady of my particular acquaintance by the greatest good luck in the world happened to be taken suddenly ill so she sent me her ticket  was not that delightful  for her extremely said cecilia laughing  well she continued then i was almost out of my wits with joy and i went about and got one of the sweetest dresses you ever saw if you will call upon me some morning i will show it you  cecilia not prepared for an invitation so abrupt bowed without speaking and miss larolles too happy in talking herself to be offended at the silence of another continued her narration  well but now comes the vilest part of the business do you know when every thing else was ready i could not get my hairdresser i sent all over the town  he was no where to be found i thought i should have died with vexation i assure you i cried so that if i had not gone in a mask i should have been ashamed to be seen and so after all this monstrous fatigue i was forced to have my hair dressed by my own maid quite in a common way was not it cruelly mortifying  why yes answered cecilia i should think it was almost sufficient to make you regret the illness of the young lady who sent you her ticket  they were now interrupted by mrs harrel who advanced to them followed by a young man of a serious aspect and modest demeanor and said i am happy to see you both so well engaged but my brother has been reproaching me with presenting every body to miss beverley but himself  i cannot hope said mr arnott that i have any place in the recollection of miss beverley but long as i have been absent from suffolk and unfortunate as i was in not seeing her during my last visit there i am yet sure even at this distance of time grown and formed as she is i should instantly have known her  amazing cried an elderly gentleman in a tone of irony who was standing near them for the face is a very common one  i remember well said cecilia that when you left suffolk i thought i had lost my best friend  is that possible cried mr arnott with a look of much delight  yes indeed and not without reason for in all disputes you were my advocate in all plays my companion and in all difficulties my assistant  madam cried the same gentleman if you liked him because he was your advocate companion and assistant pray like me too for i am ready to become all three at once  you are very good said cecilia laughing but at present i find no want of any defender  that is pity he returned for mr arnott seems to me very willing to act the same parts over again with you  but for that purpose he must return to the days of his childhood  ah would to heaven it were possible cried mr arnott for they were the happiest of my life  after such a confession said his companion surely you will let him attempt to renew them it is but taking a walk backwards and though it is very early in life for mr arnott to sigh for that retrogade motion which in the regular course of things we shall all in our turns desire yet with such a motive as recovering miss beverley for a playfellow who can wonder that he anticipates in youth the hopeless wishes of age  here miss larolles who was one of that numerous tribe of young ladies to whom all conversation is irksome in which they are not themselves engaged quitted her place of which mr gosport cecilias new acquaintance immediately took possession  is it utterly impossible continued this gentleman that i should assist in procuring mr arnott such a renovation is there no subaltern part i can perform to facilitate the project for i will either hide or seek with any boy in the parish and for a q in the corner there is none more celebrated  i have no doubt sir answered cecilia of your accomplishments and i should be not a little entertained with the surprise of the company if you could persuade yourself to display them  and what cried he could the company do half so well as to arise also and join in the sport it would but interrupt some tale of scandal or some description of a toupee active wit however despicable when compared with intellectual is yet surely better than the insignificant clickclack of modish conversation casting his eyes toward miss larolles or even the pensive dullness of affected silence changing their direction toward miss leeson  cecilia though surprised at an attack upon the society her friend had selected by one who was admitted to make a part of it felt its justice too strongly to be offended at its severity  i have often wished he continued that when large parties are collected as here without any possible reason why they might not as well be separated something could be proposed in which each person might innocently take a share for surely after the first half hour they can find little new to observe in the dress of their neighbors or to display in their own and with whatever seeming gaiety they may contrive to fill up the middle and end of the evening by wiredrawing the comments afforded by the beginning they are yet so miserably fatigued that if they have not four or five places to run to every night they suffer nearly as much from weariness of their friends in company as they would do from weariness of themselves in solitude  here by the general breaking up of the party the conversation was interrupted and mr gosport was obliged to make his exit not much to the regret of cecilia who was impatient to be alone with mrs harrel  the rest of the evening therefore was spent much more to her satisfaction it was devoted to friendship to mutual enquiries to kind congratulations and endearing recollections and though it was late when she retired she retired with reluctance  chap iv a sketch of high life eager to renew a conversation which had afforded her so much pleasure cecilia neither sensible of fatigue from her change of hours nor her journey arose with the light and as soon as she was dressed hastened to the breakfast apartment  she had not however been more impatient to enter than she soon became to quit it for though not much surprised to find herself there before her friend her ardour for waiting her arrival was somewhat chilled upon finding the fire but just lighted the room cold and the servants still employed in putting it in order  at  0 oclock she made another attempt the room was then better prepared for her reception but still it was empty again she was retiring when the appearance of mr arnott stopped her  he expressed his surprise at her early rising in a manner that marked the pleasure it gave to him and then returning to the conversation of the preceding evening he expatiated with warmth and feeling upon the happiness of his boyish days remembered every circumstance belonging to the plays in which they had formerly been companions and dwelt upon every incident with a minuteness of delight that showed his unwillingness ever to have done with the subject  this discourse detained her till they were joined by mrs harrel and then another more gay and more general succeeded to it  during their breakfast miss larolles was announced as a visitor to cecilia to whom she immediately advanced with the intimacy of an old acquaintance taking her hand and assuring her she could no longer defer the honor of waiting upon her  cecilia much amazed at this warmth of civility from one to whom she was almost a stranger received her compliment rather coldly but miss larolles without consulting her looks or attending to her manner proceeded to express the earnest desire she had long had to be known to her to hope they should meet very often to declare nothing could make her so happy and to beg leave to recommend to her notice her own milliner  i assure you she continued she has all paris in her disposal the sweetest caps the most beautiful trimmings and her ribbons are quite divine it is the most dangerous thing you can conceive to go near her i never trust myself in her room but i am sure to be ruined if you please i will take you to her this morning  if her acquaintance is so ruinous said cecilia i think i had better avoid it  o impossible there is no such thing as living without her to be sure she is shockingly dear that i must own but then who can wonder she makes such sweet things it is impossible to pay her too much for them  mrs harrel now joining in the recommendation the party was agreed upon and accompanied by mr arnott the ladies proceeded to the house of the milliner  here the raptures of miss larolles were again excited she viewed the finery displayed with delight inexpressible enquired who were the intended possessors heard their names with envy and sighed with all the bitterness of mortification that she was unable to order home almost every thing she looked at  having finished their business here they proceeded to various other dress manufacturers in whose praises miss larolles was almost equally eloquent and to appropriate whose goods she was almost equally earnest and then after attending this loquacious young lady to her fathers house mrs harrel and cecilia returned to their own  cecilia rejoiced at the separation and congratulated herself that the rest of the day might be spent alone with her friend  why no said mrs harrel not absolutely alone for i expect some company at night  company again tonight  nay dont be frightened for it will be a very small party not more than fifteen or twenty in all  is that so small a party said cecilia smiling and how short a time since would you as well as i have reckoned it a large one  o you mean when i lived in the country returned mrs harrel but what in the world could i know of parties or company then  not much indeed said cecilia as my present ignorance shows  they then parted to dress for dinner  the company of this evening were again all strangers to cecilia except miss leeson who was seated next to her and whose frigid looks again compelled her to observe the same silence she so resolutely practiced herself yet not the less was her internal surprise that a lady who seemed determined neither to give nor receive any entertainment should repeatedly choose to show herself in a company with no part of which she associated  mr arnott who contrived to occupy the seat on her other side suffered not the silence with which her fair neighbor had infected her to spread any further he talked indeed upon no new subject and upon the old one of their former sports and amusements he had already exhausted all that was worth being mentioned but not yet had he exhausted the pleasure he received from the theme it seemed always fresh and always enchanting to him it employed his thoughts regaled his imagination and enlivened his discourse cecilia in vain tried to change it for another he quitted it only by compulsion and returned to it with redoubled eagerness  when the company was retired and mr arnott only remained with the ladies cecilia with no little surprise enquired for mr harrel observing that she had not seen him the whole day  o cried his lady dont think of wondering at that for it happens continually he dines at home indeed in general but otherwise i should see nothing of him at all  indeed why how does he fill up his time  that i am sure i cannot tell for he never consults me about it but i suppose much in the same way that other people do  ah priscilla cried cecilia with some earnestness how little did i ever expect to see you so much a fine lady  a fine lady repeated mrs harrel why what is it i do dont i live exactly like every body else that mixes at all with the world  you miss beverley said mr arnott in a low voice will i hope give to the world an example not take one from it  soon after they separated for the night  the next morning cecilia took care to fill up her time more advantageously than in wandering about the house in search of a companion she now expected not to find she got together her books arranged them to her fancy and secured to herself for the future occupation of her leisure hours the exhaustless fund of entertainment which reading that richest highest and noblest source of intellectual enjoyment perpetually affords  while they were yet at breakfast they were again visited by miss larolles i am come cried she eagerly to run away with you both to my lord belgrades sale all the world will be there and we shall go in with tickets and you have no notion how it will be crowded  what is to be sold there said cecilia  o every thing you can conceive house stables china laces horses caps every thing in the world  and do you intend to buy any thing  lord no but one likes to see the peoples things  cecilia then begged they would excuse her attendance  o by no means cried miss larolles you must go i assure you therell be such a monstrous crowd as you never saw in your life i dare say we shall be half squeezed to death  that said cecilia is an inducement which you must not expect will have much weight with a poor rustic just out of the country it must require all the polish of a long residence in the metropolis to make it attractive  o but do go for i assure you it will be the best sale we shall have this season i cannot imagine mrs harrel what poor lady belgrade will do with herself i hear the creditors have seized every thing i really believe creditors are the cruelest set of people in the world they have taken those beautiful buckles out of her shoes poor soul i declare it will make my heart ache to see them put up its quite shocking upon my word i wonder who will buy them i assure you they were the prettiest fancied i ever saw but come if we dont go directly there will be no getting in  cecilia again desired to be excused accompanying them adding that she wished to spend the day at home  at home my dear cried mrs harrel why we have been engaged to mrs mears this month and she begged me to prevail with you to be of the party i expect she will call or send you a ticket every moment  how unlucky for me said cecilia that you should happen to have so many engagements just at this time i hope at least there will not be any for tomorrow  o yes tomorrow we go to mrs eltons  again tomorrow and how long is this to last  o heaven knows i will show you my catalogue  she then produced a book which contained a list of engagements for more than three weeks and as these she said are struck off new ones are made and so it is we go on till after the birthday  when this list had been examined and commented upon by miss larolles and viewed and wondered at by cecilia it was restored to its place and the two ladies went together to the auction permiting cecilia at her repeated request to return to her own apartment  she returned however neither satisfied with the behavior of her friend nor pleased with her own situation the sobriety of her education as it had early instilled into her mind the pure dictates of religion and strict principles of honor had also taught her to regard continual dissipation as an introduction to vice and unbounded extravagance as the harbinger of injustice long accustomed to see mrs harrel in the same retirement in which she had hitherto lived herself when books were their first amusement and the society of each other was their chief happiness the change she now perceived in her mind and manners equally concerned and surprised her she found her insensible to friendship indifferent to her husband and negligent of all social felicity dress company parties of pleasure and public places seemed not merely to occupy all her time but to gratify all her wishes cecilia in whose heart glowed the warmest affections and most generous virtue was cruelly depressed and mortified by this disappointment yet she had the good sense to determine against upbraiding her well aware that if reproach has any power over indifference it is only that of changing it into aversion  mrs harrel in truth was innocent of heart though dissipated in life married very young she had made an immediate transition from living in a private family and a country town to becoming mistress of one of the most elegant houses in portmansquare at the head of a splendid fortune and wife to a man whose own pursuits soon showed her the little value he himself set upon domestic happiness immersed in the fashionable round of company and diversions her understanding naturally weak was easily dazzled by the brilliancy of her situation greedily therefore sucking in air impregnated with luxury and extravagance she had soon no pleasure but to vie with some rival in elegance and no ambition but to exceed some superior in expense  the dean of  in naming mr harrel for one of the guardians of his neice had no other view than that of indulging her wishes by allowing her to reside in the house of her friend he had little personal knowledge of him but was satisfied with the nomination because acquainted with his family fortune and connections all which persuaded him to believe without further enquiry that it was more peculiarly proper for his neice than any other he could make  in his choice of the other two trustees he had been more prudent the first of these the honorable mr delvile was a man of high birth and character the second mr briggs had spent his whole life in business in which he had already amassed an immense fortune and had still no greater pleasure than that of increasing it from the high honor therefore of mr delvile he expected the most scrupulous watchfulness that his neice should in nothing be injured and from the experience of mr briggs in money matters and his diligence in transacting business he hoped for the most vigilant observance that her fortune while under his care should be turned to the best account and thus as far as he was able he had equally consulted her pleasure her security and her pecuniary advantage  mrs harrel returned home only in time to dress for the rest of the day  when cecilia was fummoned to dinner she found besides her host and hostess and mr arnott a gentleman she had not before seen but who as soon as she entered the parlour mr harrel presented to her saying at the same time he was one of the most intimate of his friends  this gentleman sir robert floyer was about thirty years of age his face was neither remarkable for its beauty nor its ugliness but sufficiently distinguished by its expression of invincible assurance his person too though neither striking for its grace nor its deformity attracted notice from the insolence of his deportment his manners haughty and supercilious marked the high opinion he cherished of his own importance and his air and address at once bold and negligent announced his happy perfection in the character at which he aimed that of an accomplished man of the town  the moment cecilia appeared she became the object of his attention though neither with the look of admiration due to her beauty nor yet with that of curiosity excited by her novelty but with the scrutinizing observation of a man on the point of making a bargain who views with faultseeking eyes the property he means to cheapen  cecilia wholly unused to an examination so little ceremonious shrunk abashed from his regards but his conversation was not less displeasing to her than his looks his principal subjects which were horseracing losses at play and disputes at gamingtables could afford her but little amusement because she could not understand them and the episodes with which they were occasionally interspersed consisting chiefly of comparative strictures upon celebrated beauties hints of impending bankruptcies and witticisms upon recent divorces were yet more disagreeable to her because more intelligible wearied therefore with uninteresting anecdotes and offended with injudicious subjects of pleasantry she waited with impatience for the moment of retiring but mrs harrel less eager because better entertained was in no haste to remove and therefore she was compelled to remain quiet till they were both obliged to arise in order to fulfill their engagement with mrs mears  as they went together to the house of that lady in mrs harrels visavis cecilia not doubting but their opinions concerning the baronet would accord instantly and openly declared her disapprobation of every thing he had uttered but mrs harrel far from confirming her expectations only said i am sorry you dont like him for he is almost always with us  do you like him then yourself  extremely he is very entertaining and clever and knows the world  how judiciously do you praise him cried cecilia and how long might you deliberate before you could add another word to his panegyric  mrs harrel satisfied to commend without even attempting to vindicate him was soon content to change the subject and cecilia though much concerned that the husband of her friend had made so disgraceful an election of a favorite yet hoped that the lenity of mrs harrel resulted from her desire to excuse his choice not from her own approbation  chap v an assembly mrs mears whose character was of that common sort which renders delineation superfluous received them with the customary forms of good breeding  mrs harrel soon engaged herself at a cardtable and cecilia who declined playing was seated next to miss leeson who arose to return the courtesy she made in advancing to her but that past did not again even look at her  cecilia though fond of conversation and formed for society was too diffident to attempt speaking where so little encouraged they both therefore continued silent till sir robert floyer mr harrel and mr arnott entered the room together and all at the same time advanced to cecilia  what cried mr harrel dont you choose to play miss beverley  i flatter myself cried mr arnott that miss beverley never plays at all for then in one thing i shall have the honor to resemble her  very seldom indeed answered cecilia and consequently very ill  o you must take a few lessons said mr harrel sir robert floyer i am sure will be proud to instruct you  sir robert who had placed himself opposite to her and was staring full in her face made a slight inclination of his head and said certainly  i should be a very unpromising pupil returned cecilia for i fear i should not only want diligence to improve but desire  o you will learn better things said mr harrel we have had you yet but three days amongst us  in three months we shall see the difference  i hope not cried mr arnott i earnestly hope there will be none  mr harrel now joined another party and mr arnott seeing no seat vacant near that of cecilia moved round to the back of her chair where he patiently stood for the rest of the evening but sir robert still kept his post and still without troubling himself to speak kept his eyes fixed upon the same object  cecilia offended by his boldness looked a thousand ways to avoid him but her embarrassment by giving greater play to her features served only to keep awake an attention which might otherwise have wearied she was almost tempted to move her chair round and face mr arnott but though she wished to show her disapprobation of the baronet she had not yet been reconciled by fashion to turning her back upon the company at large for the indulgence of conversing with some particular person a fashion which to unaccustomed observers seems rude and repulsive but which when once adopted carries with it imperceptibly its own recommendation in the ease convenience and freedom it promotes  thus disagreeably stationed she found but little assistance from the neighborhood of mr arnott since even his own desire of conversing with her was swallowed up by an anxious and involuntary impulse to watch the looks and motions of sir robert  at length quite tired of sitting as if merely an object to be gazed at she determined to attempt entering into conversation with miss leeson  the difficulty however was not inconsiderable how to make the attack she was unacquainted with her friends and connections uninformed of her way of thinking or her way of life ignorant even of the found of her voice and chilled by the coldness of her aspect yet having no other alternative she was more willing to encounter the forbidding looks of this lady than to continue silently abashed under the scrutinizing eyes of sir robert  after much deliberation with what subject to begin she remembered that miss larolles had been present the first time they had met and thought it probable they might be acquainted with each other and therefore bending forward she ventured to enquire if she had lately seen that young lady  miss leeson in a voice alike inexpressive of satisfaction or displeasure quietly answered no maam  cecilia discouraged by this conciseness was a few minutes silent but the perseverance of sir robert in staring at her exciting her own in trying to avoid his eyes she exerted herself so far as to add does mrs mears expect miss larolles here this evening  miss leeson without raising her head gravely replied i dont know maam  all was now to be done over again and a new subject to be started for she could suggest nothing further to ask concerning miss larolles  cecilia had seen little of life but that little she had well marked and her observation had taught her that among fashionable people public places seemed a neverfailing source of conversation and entertainment upon this topic therefore she hoped for better success and as to those who have spent more time in the country than in london no place of amusement is so interesting as a theater she opened the subject she had so happily suggested by an enquiry whether any new play had lately come out  miss leeson with the same dryness only answered indeed i cannot tell  another pause now followed and the spirits of cecilia were considerably dampt but happening accidentally to recollect the name of almack she presently revived and congratulating herself that she should now be able to speak of a place too fashionable for disdain she asked her in a manner somewhat more assured if she was a subscriber to his assemblies  yes maam  do you go to them constantly  no maam  again they were both silent and now tired of finding the ill success of each particular enquiry she thought a more general one might obtain an answer less laconic and therefore begged she would inform her what was the most fashionable place of diversion for the present season  this question however cost miss leeson no more trouble than any which had preceded it for she only replied indeed i dont know  cecilia now began to sicken of her attempt and for some minutes to give it up as hopeless but afterward when she reflected how frivolous were the questions she had asked she felt more inclined to pardon the answers she had received and in a short time to fancy she had mistaken contempt for stupidity and to grow less angry with miss leeson than ashamed of herself  this supposition excited her to make yet another trial of her talents for conversation and therefore summoning all the courage in her power she modestly apologized for the liberty she was taking and then begged her permission to enquire whether there was any thing new in the literary way that she thought worth recommending  miss leeson now turned her eyes toward her with a look that implied a doubt whether she had heard right and when the attentive attitude of cecilia confirmed her question surprise for a few instants took place of insensibility and with rather more spirit than she had yet shown she answered indeed i know nothing of the matter  cecilia was now utterly disconcerted and half angry with herself and wholly provoked with her sullen neighbor she resolved to let nothing in future provoke her to a similar trial with so unpromising a subject  she had not however much longer to endure the examination of sir robert who being pretty well satisfied with staring turned upon his heel and was striding out of the room when he was stopped by mr gosport who for some time had been watching him  mr gosport was a man of good parts and keen satire minute in his observations and ironical in his expressions  so you dont play sir robert he cried  what here no i am going to brookess  but how do you like harrels ward you have taken a pretty good survey of her  why faith i dont know but not much i think she is a devilish fine woman too but she has no spirit no life  did you try her have you talked to her  not i truly  nay then how do you mean to judge of her  o faith that is all over now one never thinks of talking to the women by way of trying them  what other method then have you adopted  none  none why then how do you go on  why they talk to us the women take all that trouble upon themselves now  and pray how long may you have commenced fade macaroni for this is a part of your character with which i was not acquainted  o hang it it is not from ton no it is merely from laziness who the d  l will fatigue himself with dancing attendance upon the women when keeping them at a distance makes them dance attendance upon us  then stalking from him to mr harrel he took him by the arm and they left the room together  mr gosport now advanced to cecilia and addressing her so as not to be heard by miss leeson said i have been wishing to approach you some time but the fear that you are already overpowered by the loquacity of your fair neighbor makes me cautious of attempting to engage you  you mean said cecilia to laugh at my loquacity and indeed its ill success has rendered it sufficiently ridiculous  are you then yet to learn cried he that there are certain young ladies who make it a rule never to speak but to their own cronies of this class is miss leeson and till you get into her particular coterie you must never expect to hear from her a word of two syllables the ton misses as they are called who now infest the town are in two divisions the supercilious and the voluble the supercilious like miss leeson are silent scornful languid and affected and disdain all converse but with those of their own set the voluble like miss larolles are flirting communicative restless and familiar and attack without the smallest ceremony every one they think worthy their notice but this they have in common that at home they think of nothing but dress abroad of nothing but admiration and that every where they hold in supreme contempt all but themselves  probably then said cecilia i have passed to night for one of the volubles however all the advantage has been with the supercilious for i have suffered a total repulse  are you sure however you have not talked too well for her  o a child of five years old ought to have been whipped for not talking better  but it is not capacity alone you are to consult when you talk with misses of the ton were their understandings only to be considered they would indeed be wonderfully easy of access in order therefore to render their commerce somewhat difficult they will only be pleased by an observance of their humors which are ever most various and most exuberant where the intellects are weakest and least cultivated i have however a receipt which i have found infallible for engaging the attention of young ladies of whatsoever character or denomination  o then cried cecilia pray favor me with it for i have here an admirable opportunity to try its efficacy  i will give it you he answered with full directions when you meet with a young lady who seems resolutely determined not to speak or who if compelled by a direct question to make some answer drily gives a brief affirmative or coldly a laconic negative    a case in point interrupted cecilia  well thus circumstanced he continued the remedy i have to propose consists of three topics of discourse  pray what are they  dress public places and love  cecilia half surprised and half diverted waited a fuller explanation without giving any interruption  these three topics he continued are to answer three purposes since there are no less than three causes from which the silence of young ladies may proceed sorrow affectation and stupidity  do you then cried cecilia give nothing at all to modesty  i give much to it he answered as an excuse nay almost as an equivalent for wit but for that sullen silence which resists all encouragement modesty is a mere pretense not a cause  you must however be somewhat more explicit if you mean that i should benefit from your instructions  well then he answered i will briefly enumerate the three causes with directions for the three methods of cure to begin with sorrow the taciturnity which really results from that is attended with an incurable absence of mind and a total unconsciousness of the observation which it excites upon this occasion public places may sometimes be tried in vain and even dress may fail but love    are you sure then said cecilia with a laugh that sorrow has but that one source  by no means answered he for perhaps papa may have been angry or mama may have been cross a milliner may have sent a wrong pompoon or a chaperon to an assembly may have been taken ill    bitter subjects of affliction indeed and are these all you allow us  nay i speak but of young ladies of fashion and what of greater importance can befall them if therefore the grief of the fair patient proceeds from papa mama or the chaperon then the mention of public places those endless incentives of displeasure between the old and the young will draw forth her complaints and her complaints will bring their own cure for those who lament find speedy consolation if the milliner has occasioned the calamity the discussion of dress will have the same effect should both these medicines fail love as i said before will be found infallible for you will then have investigated every subject of uneasiness which a youthful female in high life can experience  they are greatly obliged to you cried cecilia bowing for granting them motives of sorrow so honorable and i thank you in the name of the whole sex  you madam said he returning her bow are i hope an exception in the happiest way that of having no sorrow at all i come now to the silence of affectation which is presently discernable by the roving of the eye round the room to see if it is heeded by the sedulous care to avoid an accidental smile and by the variety of disconsolate attitudes exhibited to the beholders this species of silence has almost without exception its origin in that babyish vanity which is always gratified by exciting attention without ever perceiving that it provokes contempt in these cases as nature is wholly out of the question and the mind is guarded against its own feelings dress and public places are almost certain of failing but here again love is sure to vanquish as soon as it is named attention becomes involuntary and in a short time a struggling simper discomposes the arrangement of the features and then the business is presently over for the young lady is either supporting some system or opposing some proposition before she is well aware that she has been cheated out of her sad silence at all  so much said cecilia for sorrow and for affectation proceed next to stupidity for that in all probability i shall most frequently encounter  that always must be heavy work returned he yet the road is plain though it is all up hill love here may be talked of without exciting any emotion or provoking any reply and dress may be dilated upon without producing any other effect than that of attracting a vacant stare but public places are indubitably certain of success dull and heavy characters incapable of animating from wit or from reason because unable to keep pace with them and void of all internal sources of entertainment require the stimulation of show glare noise and bustle to interest or awaken them talk to them of such subjects and they adore you no matter whether you paint to them joy or horror let there but be action and they are content a battle has charms for them equal to a coronation and a funeral amuses them as much as a wedding  i am much obliged to you said cecilia smiling for these instructions yet i must confess i know not how upon the present occasion to make use of them public places i have already tried but tried in vain dress i dare not mention as i have not yet learned its technical terms    well but interrupted he be not desperate you have yet the third topic unessayed  o that returned she laughing i leave to you  pardon me cried he love is a source of loquacity only with yourselves when it is started by men young ladies dwindle into mere listeners simpering listeners i confess but it is only with one another that you will discuss its merits  at this time they were interrupted by the approach of miss larolles who tripping toward cecilia exclaimed lord how glad i am to see you so you would not go to the auction well you had a prodigious loss i assure you all the wardrobe was sold and all lady belgrades trinkets i never saw such a collection of sweet things in my life i was ready to cry that i could not bid for half an hundred of them i declare i was kept in an agony the whole morning i would not but have been there for the world poor lady belgrade you really cannot conceive how i was shocked for her all her beautiful things sold for almost nothing i assure you if you had seen how they went you would have lost all patience it is a thousand pities you were not there  on the contrary said cecilia i think i had a very fortunate escape for the loss of patience without the acquisition of the trinkets would have been rather mortifying  yes said mr gosport but when you have lived some time longer in this commercial city you will find the exchange of patience for mortification the most common and constant traffic among it is inhabitants  pray have you been here long cried miss larolles for i have been to twenty places wondering i did not meet with you before but whereabouts is mrs mears o i see her now i am sure there is no mistaking her i could know her by that old red gown half a mile off did you ever see such a frightful thing in your life and it is never off her back i believe she sleeps in it i am sure i have seen her in nothing else all winter it quite tires ones eye she is a monstrous shocking dresser but do you know i have met with the most provoking thing in the world this evening i declare it has made me quite sick i was never in such a passion in my life you can conceive nothing like it  like what cried cecilia laughing your passion or your provocation  why i will tell you what it was and then you shall judge if it was not quite past endurance you must know i commissioned a particular friend of mine miss moffat to buy me a trimming when she went to paris well she sent it me over about a month ago by mr meadows and it is the sweetest thing you ever saw in your life but i would not make it up because there was not a creature in town so i thought to bring it out quite new in about a weeks time for you know any thing does till after christmas well to night at lady jane dranets who should i meet but miss moffat she had been in town some days but so monstrously engaged i could never find her at home well i was quite delighted to see her for you must know she is a prodigious favorite with me so i ran up to her in a great hurry to shake hands and what do you think was the first thing that struck my eyes why just such a trimming as my own upon a nasty odious gown and half dirty can you conceive any thing so distressing i could have cried with pleasure  why so said cecilia if her trimming is dirty yours will look the more delicate  o lord but it is making it seem quite an old thing half the town will get something like it and i quite ruined myself to buy it i declare i dont think any thing was ever half so mortifying it distressed me so i could hardly speak to her if she had stayed a month or two longer i should not have minded it but it was the cruellest thing in the world to come over just now i wish the customhouseofficers had kept all her clothes till summer  the wish is tender indeed said cecilia for a particular friend  mrs mears now rising from the cardtable miss larolles tript away to pay her compliments to her  here at least cried cecilia no receipt seems requisite for the cure of silence i would have miss larolles be the constant companion of miss leeson they could not but agree admirably since that supercilious young lady seems determined never to speak and the voluble miss larolles never to be silent were each to borrow something of the other how greatly would both be the better  the composition would still be a sorry one answered mr gosport for i believe they are equally weak and equally ignorant the only difference is that one though silly is quick the other though deliberate is stupid upon a short acquaintance that heaviness which leaves to others the whole weight of discourse and whole search of entertainment is the most fatiguing but upon a longer intimacy even that is less irksome and less offensive than the flippancy which hears nothing but itself  mrs harrel arose now to depart and cecilia not more tired of the beginning of the evening than entertained with its conclusion was handed to the carriage by mr arnott  chap vi a breakfast the next morning during breakfast a servant acquainted cecilia that a young gentleman was in the hall who begged to speak with her she desired he might be admitted and mrs harrel laughing asked if she ought not to quit the room while mr arnott with even more than his usual gravity directed his eye toward the door to watch who should enter  neither of them however received any satisfaction when it was opened for the gentleman who made his appearance was unknown to both but great was the amazement of cecilia though little her emotion when she saw mr morris  he came forward with an air of the most profound respect for the company in general and obsequiously advancing to cecilia made an earnest enquiry into her health after her journey and hoped she had heard good news from her friends in the country  mrs harrel naturally concluding both from his visit and behavior that he was an acquaintance of some intimacy very civilly offered him a seat and some breakfast which very frankly he accepted but mr arnott who already felt the anxiety of a rising passion which was too full of veneration to be sanguine looked at him with uneasiness and waited his departure with impatience  cecilia began to imagine he had been commissioned to call upon her with some message from mr monckton for she knew not how to suppose that merely and accidentally having spent an hour or two in the same room with her would authorize a visiting acquaintance mr morris however had a facility the most happy of reconciling his pretensions to his inclination and therefore she soon found that the pretense she had suggested appeared to him unnecessary to lead however to the subject from which she expected his excuse she enquired how long he had left suffolk  but yesterday noon maam he answered or i should certainly have taken the liberty to wait upon you before  cecilia who had only been perplexing herself to devise some reason why he came at all now looked at him with a grave surprise which would totally have abashed a man whose courage had been less or whose expectations had been greater but mr morris though he hazarded every danger upon the slightest chance of hope knew too well the weakness of his claims to be confident of success and had been too familiar with rebuffs to be much hurt by receiving them he might possibly have something to gain but he knew he had nothing to lose  i had the pleasure he continued to leave all our friends well except poor lady margaret and she has had an attack of the asthma yet she would not have a physician though mr monckton would fain have persuaded her however i believe the old lady knows better things and he looked archly at cecilia but perceiving that the insinuation gave her nothing but disgust he changed his tone and added it is amazing how well they live together nobody would imagine the disparity in their years poor old lady mr monckton will really have a great loss of her when she dies  a loss of her repeated mrs harrel i am sure she is an exceeding illnatured old woman when i lived at bury i was always frightened out of my wits at the sight of her  why indeed maam said morris i must own her appearance is rather against her i had myself a great aversion to her at first sight but the house is cheerful  very cheerful i like to spend a few days there now and then of all things miss bennet too is agreeable enough and   miss bennet agreeable cried mrs harrel i think she is the most odious creature i ever knew in my life a nasty spiteful old maid  why indeed maam as you say answered morris she is not very young and as to her temper i confess i know very little about it and mr monckton is likely enough to try it for he is pretty severe  mr monckton cried cecilia extremely provoked at hearing him censured by a man she thought highly honored in being permitted to approach him whenever i have been his guest has merited from me nothing but praise and gratitude  o cried morris eagerly there is not a more worthy man in the world he has so much wit so much politeness i dont know a more charming man any where than my friend mr monckton  cecilia now perceiving that the opinions of her new acquaintance were as pliant as his bows determined to pay him no further attention and hoped by sitting silent to force from him the business of his visit if any he had or if as she now suspected he had none to weary him into a retreat  but this plan though it would have succeeded with herself failed with mr morris who to a stock of good humor that made him always ready to oblige others added an equal portion of insensibility that hardened him against all indignity finding therefore that cecilia to whom his visit was intended seemed already satisfied with its length he prudently forbore to torment her but perceiving that the lady of the house was more accessible he quickly made a transfer of his attention and addressed his discourse to her with as much pleasure as if his only view had been to see her and as much ease as if he had known her all his life  with mrs harrel this conduct was not injudicious she was pleased with his assiduity amused with his vivacity and sufficiently satisfied with his understanding they conversed therefore upon pretty equal terms and neither of them were yet tired when they were interrupted by mr harrel who came into the room to ask if they had seen or heard any thing of sir robert floyer  no answered mrs harrel nothing at all  i wish he was hanged returned he for he has kept me waiting this hour he made me promise not to ride out till he called and now he will stay till the morning is over  pray where does he live sir cried morris starting from his seat  in cavendishsquare sir answered mr harrel looking at him with much surprise  not a word more said morris but scampered out of the room  pray who is this genius cried mr harrel and what has he run away for  upon my word i know nothing at all of him said mrs harrel he is a visitor of miss beverleys  and i too said cecilia might almost equally disclaim all knowledge of him for though i once saw i never was introduced to him  she then began a relation of her meeting him at mr moncktons house and had hardly concluded it before again and quite out of breath he made his appearance  sir robert floyer sir said he to mr harrel will be here in two minutes  i hope sir said mr harrel you have not given yourself the trouble of going to him  no sir it has given me nothing but pleasure a run these cold mornings is the thing i like best  sir you are extremely good said mr harrel but i had not the least intention of your taking such a walk upon my account  he then begged him to be seated to rest himself and to take some refreshment which civilities he received without scruple  but miss beverley said mr harrel turning suddenly to cecilia you dont tell me what you think of my friend  what friend sir  why sir robert floyer i observed he never quitted you a moment while he stayed at mrs mears  his stay however was too short said cecilia to allow me to form a fair opinion of him  but perhaps cried morris it was long enough to allow you to form a foul one  cecilia could not forbear laughing to hear the truth thus accidentally blundered out but mr harrel looking very little pleased said surely you can find no fault with him he is one of the most fashionable men i know  my finding fault with him then said cecilia will only farther prove what i believe is already pretty evident that i am yet a novice in the art of admiration  mr arnott animating at this speech glided behind her chair and said i knew you could not like him i knew it from the turn of your mind  i knew it even from your countenance  soon after sir robert floyer arrived  you are a pretty fellow ant you cried mr harrel to keep me waiting so long  i could not come a moment sooner i hardly expected to get here at all for my horse has been so confounded resty i could not tell how to get him along  do you come on horseback through the streets sir robert asked mrs harrel  sometimes when i am lazy but what the d  l is the matter with him i dont know he has started at every thing i suspect there has been some foul play with him  is he at the door sir cried morris  yes answered sir robert  then i will tell you what is the matter with him in a minute and away again ran morris  what time did you get off last night harrel said sir robert  not very early but you were too much engaged to miss me by the way lowering his voice what do you think i lost  i cannot tell indeed but i know what i gained i have not had such a run of luck this winter  they then went up to a window to carry on their enquiries more privately  at the words what do you think i lost cecilia half starting cast her eyes uneasily upon mrs harrel but perceived not the least change in her countenance mr arnott however seemed as little pleased as herself and from a similar sensation looked anxiously at his sister  morris now returning called out he is had a fall i assure you  curse him cried sir robert what shall i do now he cost me the d  l and all of money and i have not had him a twelvemonth can you lend me a horse for this morning harrel  no i have not one that will do for you you must send to astley  who can i send john must take care of this  i will go sir cried morris if you will give me the commission  by no means sir said sir robert i cannot think of giving you such an office  it is the thing in the world i like best answered he i understand horses and had rather go to astleys than any where  the matter was now settled in a few minutes and having received his directions and an invitation to dinner morris danced off with an heart yet lighter than his heels  why miss beverley said mr harrel this friend of yours is the most obliging gentleman i ever met with there was no avoiding asking him to dinner  remember however said cecilia who was involuntarily diverted at the successful officiousness of her new acquaintance that if you receive him henceforth as your guest he obtains admission through his own merits and not through my interest  at dinner morris who failed not to accept the invitation of mr harrel was the gayest and indeed the happiest man in the company the effort he had made to fasten himself upon cecilia as an acquaintance had not it is true from herself met with much encouragement but he knew the chances were against him when he made the trial and therefore the prospect of gaining admission into such a house as mr harrels was not only sufficient to make amends for what scarcely amounted to a disappointment but a subject of serious comfort from the credit of the connection and of internal exultation at his own management and address  in the evening the ladies as usual went to a private assembly and as usual were attended to it by mr arnott the other gentlemen had engagements elsewhere  chap vii a project several days passed on nearly in the same manner the mornings were all spent in gossipping shopping and dressing and the evenings were regularly appropriated to public places or large parties of company  meanwhile mr arnott lived almost entirely in portmansquare he slept indeed at his own lodgings but he boarded wholly with mr harrel whose house he never for a moment quitted till night except to attend cecilia and his sister in their visitings and rambles  mr arnott was a young man of unexceptionable character and of a disposition mild serious and benignant his principles and blameless conduct obtained the universal esteem of the world but his manners which were rather too precise joined to an uncommon gravity of countenance and demeanor made his society rather permitted as a duty than sought as a pleasure  the charms of cecilia had forcibly suddenly and deeply penetrated his heart he only lived in her presence away from her he hardly existed the emotions she excited were rather those of adoration than of love for he gazed upon her beauty till he thought her more than human and hung upon her accents till all speech seemed impertinent to him but her own yet so small were his expectations of success that not even to his sister did he hint at the situation of his heart happy in an easy access to her he contented himself with seeing hearing and watching her beyond which bounds he formed not any plan and scarce indulged any hope  sir robert floyer too was a frequent visitor in portmansquare where he dined almost daily cecilia was chagrined at seeing so much of him and provoked to find herself almost constantly the object of his unrestrained examination she was however far more seriously concerned for mrs harrel when she discovered that this favorite friend of her husband was an unprincipled spendthrift and an extravagant gamester for as he was the inseparable companion of mr harrel she dreaded the consequence both of his influence and his example  she saw too with an amazement that daily increased the fatigue yet fascination of a life of pleasure mr harrel seemed to consider his own house merely as an hotel where at any hour of the night he might disturb the family to claim admittance where letters and messages might be left for him where he dined when no other dinner was offered him and where when he made an appointment he was to be met with his lady too though more at home was not therefore more solitary her acquaintance were numerous expensive and idle and every moment not actually spent in company was scrupulously devoted to making arrangements for that purpose  in a short time cecilia who every day had hoped that the next would afford her greater satisfaction but who every day found the present no better than the former began to grow weary of eternally running the same round and to sicken at the irksome repetition of unremitting yet uninteresting dissipation she saw nobody she wished to see as she had met with nobody for whom she could care for though sometimes those with whom she mixed appeared to be amiable she knew that their manners like their persons were in their best array and therefore she had too much understanding to judge decisively of their characters but what chiefly damped her hopes of forming a friendship with any of the new acquaintance to whom she was introduced was the observation she herself made how ill the coldness of their hearts accorded with the warmth of their professions upon every first meeting the civilities which were shown her flattered her into believing she had excited a partiality that a very little time would ripen into affection the next meeting commonly confirmed the expectation but the third and every future one regularly destroyed it she found that time added nothing to their fondness nor intimacy to their sincerity that the interest in her welfare which appeared to be taken at first sight seldom with whatever reason increased and often without any abated that the distinction she at first met with was no effusion of kindness but of curiosity which is scarcely sooner gratified than satiated and that those who lived always the life into which she had only lately been initiated were as much harrassed with it as herself though less spirited to relinquish and more helpless to better it and that they coveted nothing but what was new because they had experienced the insufficiency of whatever was familiar  she began now to regret the loss she sustained in quitting the neighborhood and being deprived of the conversation of mr monckton and yet more earnestly to miss the affection and sigh for the society of mrs charlton the lady with whom she had long and happily resided at bury for she was very soon compelled to give up all expectation of renewing the felicity of her earlier years by being restored to the friendship of mrs harrel in whom she had mistaken the kindness of childish intimacy for the sincerity of chosen affection and though she saw her credulous error with mortification and displeasure she regretted it with tenderness and sorrow what at last cried she is human felicity who has tasted and where is it to be found if i who to others seem marked out for even a partial possession of it  distinguished by fortune caressed by the world brought into the circle of high life and surrounded with splendor seek without finding it yet losing scarce know how i miss it  ashamed upon reflection to believe she was considered as an object of envy by others while repining and discontentd herself she determined no longer to be the only one insensible to the blessings within her reach but by projecting and adopting some plan of conduct better suited to her taste and feelings than the frivolous insipidity of her present life to make at once a more spirited and more worthy use of the affluence freedom and power which she possessed  a scheme of happiness at once rational and refined soon presented itself to her imagination she purposed for the basis of her plan to become mistress of her own time and with this view to drop all idle and uninteresting acquaintance who while they contribute neither to use nor pleasure make so large a part of the community that they may properly be called the underminers of existence she could then show some taste and discernment in her choice of friends and she resolved to select such only as by their piety could elevate her mind by their knowledge improve her understanding or by their accomplishments and manners delight her affections this regulation if strictly adhered to would soon relieve her from the fatigue of receiving many visitors and therefore she might have all the leisure she could desire for the pursuit of her favorite studies music and reading  having thus from her own estimation of human perfection culled whatever was noblest for her society and from her own ideas of sedentary enjoyments arranged the occupations of her hours of solitude she felt fully satisfied with the portion of happiness which her scheme promised to herself and began next to consider what was due from her to the world  and not without trembling did she then look forward to the claims which the splendid income she was soon to possess would call upon her to discharge a strong sense of duty a fervent desire to act right were the ruling characteristics of her mind her affluence she therefore considered as a debt contracted with the poor and her independence as a tie upon her liberality to pay it with interest  many and various then soothing to her spirit and grateful to her sensibility were the scenes which her fancy delineated now she supported an orphan now softened the sorrows of a widow now snatched from iniquity the feeble trembler at poverty and now rescued from shame the proud struggler with disgrace the prospect at once exalted her hopes and enraptured her imagination she regarded herself as an agent of charity and already in idea anticipated the rewards of a good and faithful delegate so animating are the designs of disinterested benevolence so pure is the bliss of intellectual philanthropy  not immediately however could this plan be put in execution the society she meant to form could not be selected in the house of another where though to some she might show a preference there were none she could reject nor had she yet the power to indulge according to the munificence of her wishes the extensive generosity she projected these purposes demanded an house of her own and the unlimited disposal of her fortune neither of which she could claim till she became of age that period however was only eight months distant and she pleased herself with the intention of meliorating her plan in the mean time and preparing to put it in practice  but though in common with all the race of stillexpecting man she looked for that happiness in the time to come which the present failed to afford she had yet the spirit and good sense to determine upon making every effort in her power to render her immediate way of life more useful and contented  her first wish therefore now was to quit the house of mr harrel where she neither met with entertainment nor instruction but was perpetually mortified by seeing the total indifference of the friend in whose society she had hoped for nothing but affection  the will of her uncle though it obliged her while underage to live with one of her guardians lest her at liberty to choose and to change amongst them according to her wishes or convenience she determined therefore to make a visit herself to each of them to observe their manners and way of life and then to the best of her judgment decide with which she could be most contented resolving however not to hint at her intention till it was ripe for execution and then honestly to confess the reasons of her retreat  she had acquainted them both of her journey to town the morning after her arrival she was almost an entire stranger to each of them as she had not seen mr briggs since she was nine years old nor mr delvile within the time she could remember  the very morning that she had settled her proceedings for the arrangement of this new plan she intended to request the use of mrs harrels carriage and to make without delay the visits preparatory to her removal but when she entered the parlour upon a summons to breakfast her eagerness to quit the house gave way for the present to the pleasure she felt at the sight of mr monckton who was just arrived from suffolk  she expressed her satisfaction in the most lively terms and scrupled not to tell him she had not once been so much pleased since her journey to town except at her first meeting with mrs harrel  mr monckton whose delight was infinitely superior to her own and whose joy in seeing her was redoubled by the affectionate frankness of her reception stifled the emotions to which her sight gave rise and denying himself the solace of expressing his feelings seemed much less charmed than herself at the meeting and suffered no word nor look to escape him beyond what could be authorized by friendly civility  he then renewed with mrs harrel an acquaintance which had been formed before her marriage but which she had dropped when her distance from cecilia upon whose account alone he had thought it worth cultivation made it no longer of use to him she afterward introduced her brother to him and a conversation very interesting to both the ladies took place concerning several families with which they had been formerly connected as well as the neighborhood at large in which they had lately dwelt  very little was the share taken by mr arnott in these accounts and enquiries the unaffected joy with which cecilia had received mr monckton had struck him with a sensation of envy as involuntary as it was painful he did not indeed suspect that gentlemans secret views no reason for suspicion was obvious and his penetration sunk not deeper than appearances he knew too that he was married and therefore no jealousy occurred to him but still she had smiled upon him  and he felt that to purchase for himself a smile of so much sweetness he would have sacrificed almost all else that was valuable to him upon earth  with an attention infinitely more accurate mr monckton had returned his observations the uneasiness of his mind was apparent and the anxious watchfulness of his eyes plainly manifested whence it arose from a situation indeed which permitted an intercourse the most constant and unrestrained with such an object as cecilia nothing less could be expected and therefore he considered his admiration as inevitable all that remained to be discovered was the reception it had met from his fair enslaver nor was he here long in doubt he soon saw that she was not merely free from all passion herself but had so little watched mr arnott as to be unconscious she had inspired any  yet was his own serenity though apparently unmoved little less disturbed in secret than that of his rival he did not think him a formidable candidate but he dreaded the effects of intimacy fearing she might first grow accustomed to his attentions and then become pleased with them he apprehended also the influence of his sister and of mr harrel in his favor and though he had no difficulty to persuade himself that any offer he might now make would be rejected without hesitation he knew too well the insidious properties of perseverance to see him without inquietude situated so advantageously  the morning was far advanced before he took leave yet he found no opportunity of discoursing with cecilia though he impatiently desired to examine into the state of her mind and to discover whether her london journey had added any fresh difficulties to the success of his long concerted scheme but as mrs harrel invited him to dinner he hoped the afternoon would be more propitious to his wishes  cecilia too was eager to communicate to him her favorite project and to receive his advice with respect to it is execution she had long been used to his counsel and she was now more than ever solicitous to obtain it because she considered him as the only person in london who was interested in her welfare  he saw however no promise of better success when he made his appearance at dinner time for not only mr arnott was already arrived but sir robert floyer and he found cecilia so much the object of their mutual attention that he had still less chance than in the morning of speaking to her unheard  yet was he not idle the sight of sir robert gave abundant employment to his penetration which was immediately at work to discover the motive of his visit but this with all his sagacity was not easily decided for though the constant direction of his eyes toward cecilia proved at least that he was not insensible of her beauty his carelessness whether or not she was hurt by his examination the little pains he took to converse with her and the invariable assurance and negligence of his manners seemed strongly to demonstrate an indifference to the sentiments he inspired totally incompatible with the solicitude of affection  in cecilia he had nothing to observe but what his knowledge of her character prepared him to expect a shame no less indignant than modest at the freedom with which she saw herself surveyed  very little therefore was the satisfaction which this visit procured him sor soon after dinner the ladies retired and as they had an early engagement for the evening the gentlemen received no summons to their teatable but he contrived before they quitted the room to make an appointment for attending them the next morning to a rehearsal of a new serious opera  he stayed not after their departure longer than decency required for too much in earnest was his present pursuit to fit him for such conversation as the house in cecilias absence could afford him  chap viii an opera rehearsal the next day between eleven and twelve oclock mr monckton was again in portmansquare he found as he expected both the ladies and he found as he feared mr arnott prepared to be of their party he had however but little time to repine at this intrusion before he was disturbed by another for in a few minutes they were joined by sir robert floyer who also declared his intention of accompanying them to the haymarket  mr monckton to disguise his chagrin pretended he was in great haste to set off lest they should be too late for the overture they were therefore quitting the breakfast room when they were stopped by the appearance of mr morris  the surprise which the sight of him gave to mr monckton was extreme he knew that he was unacquainted with mr harrel for he remembered they were strangers to each other when they lately met at his house he concluded therefore that cecilia was the object of his visit but he could frame no conjecture under what pretense  the easy terms upon which he seemed with all the family by no means diminished his amazement for when mrs harrel expressed some concern that she was obliged to go out he galiy begged her not to mind him assuring her he could not have stayed two minutes and promising unasked to call again the next day and when she added we would not hurry away so only we are going to a rehearsal of an opera he exclaimed with quickness a rehearsal  are you really i have a great mind to go too  then perceiving mr monckton he bowed to him with great respect and enquired with no little solemnity how he had left lady margaret hoped she was perfectly recovered from her late indisposition and asked sundry questions with regard to her plan for the winter  this discourse was ill constructed for rendering his presence desirable to mr monckton he answered him very drily and again pressed their departure  o cried morris there is no occasion for such haste the rehearsal does not begin till one  you are mistaken sir said mr monckton it is to begin at twelve oclock  o ay very true returned morris i had forgot the dances and i suppose they are to be rehearsed first pray miss beverley did you ever see any dances rehearsed  no sir  you will be excessively entertained then i assure you it is the most comical thing in the world to see those signores and signoras cutting capers in a morning and the figuranti will divert you beyond measure you never saw such a shabby set in your life but the most amusing thing is to look in their faces for all the time they are jumping and skipping about the stage as if they could not stand still for joy they look as sedate and as dismal as if they were so many undertakers men  not a word against dancing cried sir robert it is the only thing carries one to the opera and i am sure it is the only thing one minds at it  the two ladies were then handed to mrs harrels visavis and the gentlemen joined without further ceremony by mr morris followed them to the haymarket  the rehearsal was not begun and mrs harrel and cecilia secured themselves a box upon the stage from which the gentlemen of their party took care not to be very distant  they were soon perceived by mr gosport who instantly entered into conversation with cecilia miss larolles who with some other ladies came soon after into the next box looked out to courtsie and nod with her usual readiness at mrs harrel but took not any notice of cecilia though she made the first advances  what is the matter now cried mr gosport have you affronted your little prattling friend  not with my own knowledge answered cecilia perhaps she does not recollect me  just then miss larolles tapping at the door came in from the next box to speak to mrs harrel with whom she stood chatting and laughing some minutes without seeming to perceive that cecilia was of her party  why what have you done to the poor girl whispered mr gosport did you talk more than herself when you saw her last  would that have been possible cried cecilia however i still fancy she does not know me  she then stood up which making miss larolles involuntarily turn toward her she again courtsied a civility which that young lady scarce deigned to return before bridling with an air of resentment she hastily looked another way and then nodding goodhumouredly at mrs harrel hurried back to her party  cecilia much amazed said to mr gosport see now how great was our presumption in supposing this young ladys loquacity always at our devotion  ah madam cried he laughing there is no permanency no consistency in the world no not even in the tongue of a voluble and if that fails upon what may we depend  but seriously said cecilia i am sorry i have offended her and the more because i so little know how that i can offer her no apology  will you appoint me your envoy shall i demand the cause of these hostilities  she thanked him and he followed miss larolles who was now addressing herself with great earnestness to mr meadows the gentleman with whom she was conversing when cecilia first saw her in portmansquare he stopped a moment to let her finish her speech which with no little spirit she did in these words i never knew any thing like it in my life but i shant put up with such airs i assure her  mr meadows made not any other return to her harangue but stretching himself with a languid smile and yawning mr gosport therefore seizing the moment of cessation said miss larolles i hear a strange report about you  do you returned she with quickness pray what is it something monstrous impertinent i dare say  however i assure you it int true  your assurance cried he carries conviction indisputable for the report was that you had left off talking  o was that all cried she disappointed i thought it had been something about mr sawyer for i declare i have been plagued so about him i am quite sick of his name  and for my part i never heard it so fear nothing from me upon his account  lord mr gosport how can you say so i am sure you must know about the festino that night for it was all over the town in a moment  what festino  well only conceive how provoking  why i know nothing else was talked of for a month  you are most formidably stout this morning it is not two minutes since i saw you fling the gauntlet at miss beverley and yet you are already prepared for another antagonist  o as to miss beverley i must really beg you not to mention her she has behaved so impertinently that i dont intend ever to speak to her again  why what has she done  o she is been so rude you have no notion i will tell you how it was you must know i met her at mrs harrels the day she came to town and the very next morning i waited on her myself for i would not send a ticket because i really wished to be civil to her well the day after she never came near me though i called upon her again however i did not take any notice of that but when the third day came and i found she had not even sent me a ticket i thought it monstrous ill bred indeed and now there has past more than a week and yet she has never called so i suppose she dont like me so i shall drop her acquaintance  mr gosport satisfied now with the subject of her complaint returned to cecilia and informed her of the heavy charge which was brought against her  i am glad at least to know my crime said she for otherwise i should certainly have sinned on in ignorance as i must confess i never thought of returning her visits but even if i had i should not have supposed i had yet lost much time  i beg your pardon there said mrs harrel a first visit ought to be returned always by the third day  then have i an unanswerable excuse said cecilia for i remember that on the third day i saw her at your house  o that is nothing at all to the purpose you should have waited upon her or sent her a ticket just the same as if you had not seen her  the overture was now begun and cecilia declined any further conversation this was the first opera she had ever heard yet she was not wholly a stranger to italian compositions having assiduously studied music from a natural love of the art attended all the best concerts her neighborhood afforded and regularly received from london the works of the best masters but the little skill she had thus gained served rather to increase than to lessen the surprise with which she heard the present performance  a surprise of which the discovery of her own ignorance made not the least part unconscious from the little she had acquired how much was to be learnt she was astonished to find the inadequate power of written music to convey any idea of vocal abilities with just knowledge enough therefore to understand something of the difficulties and feel much of the merit she gave to the whole opera an avidity of attention almost painful from its own eagerness  but both the surprise and the pleasure which she received from the performance in general were faint cold and languid compared to the strength of those emotions when excited by signore pacchierotti in particular and though not half the excellencies of that superior singer were necessary either to amaze or charm her unaccustomed ears though the refinement of his taste and masterly originality of his genius to be praised as they deserved called for the judgment and knowledge of professors yet a natural love of music in some measure supplied the place of cultivation and what she could neither explain nor understand she could feel and enjoy  the opera was artaserse and the pleasure she received from the music was much augmented by her previous acquaintance with that interesting drama yet as to all noviciates in science whatever is least complicated is most pleasing she found herself by nothing so deeply impressed as by the plaintive and beautiful simplicity with which pacchierotti uttered the affecting repetition of sono innocente his voice always either sweet or impassioned delivered those words in a tone of softness pathos and sensibility that struck her with a sensation not more new than delightful  but though she was perhaps the only person thus astonished she was by no means the only one enraptured for notwithstanding she was too earnestly engaged to remark the company in general she could not avoid taking notice of an old gentleman who stood by one of the side scenes against which he lent his head in a manner that concealed his face with an evident design to be wholly absorbed in listening and during the songs of pacchierotti he sighed so deeply that cecilia struck by his uncommon sensibility to the power of music involuntarily watched him whenever her mind was sufficiently at liberty to attend to any emotions but its own  as soon as the rehearsal was over the gentlemen of mrs harrels party crowded before her box and cecilia then perceived that the person whose musical enthusiasm had excited her curiosity was the same old gentleman whose extraordinary behavior had so much surprised her at the house of mr monckton her desire to obtain some information concerning him again reviving she was beginning to make fresh enquiries when she was interrupted by the approach of captain aresby  that gentleman advancing to her with a smile of the extremest selfcomplacency after hoping in a low voice he had the honor of seeing her well exclaimed how wretchedly empty is the town petrifying to a degree i believe you do not find yourself at present obsede by too much company   at present i believe the contrary cried mr gosport  really said the captain unsuspicious of his sneer i protest i have hardly seen a soul have you tried the pantheon yet maam  no sir  nor i i dont know whether people go there this year it is not a favorite spectacle with me that sitting to hear the music is a horrid bore have you done the festino the honor to look in there yet  no sir  permit me then to have the honor to beg you will try it  o ay true cried mrs harrel i have really used you very ill about that i should have got you in for a subscriber but lord i have done nothing for you yet and you never put me in mind there is the ancient music and abels concert  as to the opera we may have a box between us  but there is the ladies concert we must try for and there is  o lord fifty other places we must think of  oh times of folly and dissipation exclaimed a voice at some distance oh mignons of idleness and luxury what next will ye invent for the perdition of your time how yet further will ye proceed in the annihilation of virtue  every body stared but mrs harrel cooly said dear it is only the manhater  the manhater repeated cecilia who found that the speech was made by the object of her former curiosity is that the name by which he is known  he is known by fifty names said mr monckton his friends call him the moralist the young ladies the crazyman the macaronies the bore in short he is called by any and every name but his own  he is a most petrifying wretch i assure you said the captain i am obsede by him partout if i had known he had been so near i should certainly have said nothing  that you have done so well cried mr gosport that if you had known it the whole time you could have done it no better  the captain who had not heard this speech which was rather made at him than to him continued his address to cecilia give me leave to have the honor of hoping you intend to honor our select masquerade at the pantheon with your presence we shall have but  00 tickets and the subscription will only be three guineas and a half  oh objects of penury and want again exclaimed the incognito oh vassals of famine and distress come and listen to this wantonness of wealth come naked and breadless as ye are and learn how that money is consumed which to you might bring raiment and food  that strange wretch said the captain ought really to be confined i have had the honor to be degoute by him so often that i think him quite obnoxious i make it quite a principle to seal up my lips the moment i perceive him  where is it then said cecilia that you have so often met him  o answered the captain  partout there is no greater bore about town but the time i found him most petrifying was once when i happened to have the honor of dancing with a very young lady who was but just come from a boardingschool and whose friends had done me the honor to fix upon me upon the principle of first bringing her out and while i was doing mon possible for killing the time he came up and in his particular manner told her i had no meaning in any thing i said i must own i never selt more tempted to be enrage with a person in years in my life  mr arnott now brought the ladies word that their carriage was ready and they quitted their box but as cecilia had never before seen the interior parts of a theater mr monckton hoping while they loitered to have an opportunity of talking with her asked morris why he did not show the lions morris always happy in being employed declared it was just the thing he liked best and begged permission to do the honors to mrs harrel who ever eager in the search of amusement willingly accepted his offer  they all therefore marched upon the stage their own party now being the only one that remained  we shall make a triumphal entry here cried sir robert floyer the very tread of the stage half tempts me to turn actor  you are a rare man said mr gosport if at your time of life that is a turn not already taken  my time of life repeated he what do you mean by that do you take me for an old man  no sir but i take you to be past childhood and consequently to have served your apprenticeship to the actors you have mixed with on the great stage of the world and for some years at least to have set up for yourself  come cried morris let us have a little spouting twill make us warm  yes said sir robert if we spout to an animating object if miss beverley will be juliet i am romeo at her service  at this moment the incognito quitting the corner in which he had planted himself came suddenly forward and standing before the whole group cast upon cecilia a look of much compassion and called out poor simple victim have thou already so many pursuers yet see not that thou art marked for sacrifice yet know not that thou art destined for prey  cecilia extremely struck by this extraordinary address stopped short and looked much disturbed which when he perceived he added let the danger not the warning affect you discard the sycophants that surround you seek the virtuous relieve the poor and save yourself from the impending destruction of unfeeling prosperity  having uttered these words with vehemence and authority he sternly passed them and disappeared  cecilia too much astonished for speech stood for some time immovable revolving in her mind various conjectures upon the meaning of an exhortation so strange and so urgent  nor was the rest of the company much less discomposed sir robert mr monckton and mr arnott each conscious of their own particular plans were each apprehensive that the warning pointed at himself mr gosport was offended at being included in the general appellation of sycophants mrs harrel was provoked at being interrupted in her ramble and captain aresby sickening at the very sight of him retreated the moment he came forth  for heavens sake cried cecilia when somewhat recovered from her consternation who can this be and what can he mean you mr monckton must surely know something of him it was at your house i first saw him  indeed answered mr monckton i knew almost nothing of him then and i am but little better informed now belfield picked him up somewhere and desired to bring him to my house he called him by the name of albany i found him a most extraordinary character and belfield who is a worshipper of originality was very fond of him  he is a devilish crabbed old fellow cried sir robert and if he goes on much longer at this confounded rate he stands a very fair chance of getting his ears cropped  he is a man of the most singular conduct i have ever met with said mr gosport he seems to hold mankind in abhorrence yet he is never a moment alone and at the same time that he intrudes himself into all parties he associates with none he is commonly a stern and silent observer of all that passes or when he speaks it is but to utter some sentence of rigid morality or some bitterness of indignant reproof  the carriage was now again announced and mr monckton taking cecilias hand while mr morris secured to himself the honor of mrs harrels sir robert and mr gosport made their bows and departed but though they had now quitted the stage and arrived at the head of a small stair case by which they were to descend out of the theater mr monckton finding all his tormentors retired except mr arnott whom he hoped to elude could not resist making one more attempt for a few moments conversation with cecilia and therefore again applying to morris he called out i dont think you have shown the ladies any of the contrivances behind the scenes  true cried morris no more i have suppose we go back  i shall like it vastly said mrs harrel and back they returned  mr monckton now soon found an opportunity to say to cecilia miss beverley what i foresaw has exactly come to pass you are surrounded by selfish designers by interested doubleminded people who have nothing at heart but your fortune and whose mercenary views if you are not guarded against them    here a loud scream from mrs harrel interrupted his speech cecilia much alarmed turned from him to enquire the cause and mr monckton was obliged to follow her example but his mortification was almost intolerable when he saw that lady in a violent fit of laughter and found her scream was only occasioned by seeing mr morris in his diligence to do the honors pull upon his own head one of the side scenes  there was now no possibility of proposing any farther delay but mr monckton in attending the ladies to their carriage was obliged to have recourse to his utmost discretion and forbearance in order to check his desire of reprimanding morris for his blundering officiousness  dressing dining with company at home and then going out with company abroad filled up as usual the rest of the day  chap ix a supplication the next morning cecilia at the repeated remonstrances of mrs harrel consented to call upon miss larolles she felt the impracticability of beginning at present the alteration in her way of life she had projected and therefore thought it most expedient to assume no singularity till her independency should enable her to support it with consistency yet greater than ever was her internal eagerness to better satisfy her inclination and her conscience in the disposition of her time and the distribution of her wealth since she had heard the emphatic charge of her unknown mentor  mrs harrel declined accompanying her in this visit because she had appointed a surveyor to bring a plan for the inspection of mr harrel and herself of a small temporary building to be erected at violetbank for the purpose of performing plays in private the ensuing easter  when the street door was opened for her to get into the carriage she was struck with the appearance of an elderly woman who was standing at some distance and seemed shivering with cold and who as she descended the steps joined her hands in an act of supplication and advanced nearer to the carriage  cecilia stopped to look at her her dress though parsimonious was too neat for a beggar and she considered a moment what she could offer her the poor woman continued to move forward but with a slowness of pace that indicated extreme weakness and as she approached and raised her head she exhibited a countenance so wretched and a complexion so sickly that cecilia was impressed with horror at the sight  with her hands still joined and a voice that seemed fearful of its own sound oh madam she cried that you would but hear me  hear you repeated cecilia hastily feeling for her purse most certainly and tell me how i shall assist you  heaven bless you for speaking so kindly madam cried the woman with a voice more assured i was sadly afraid you would be angry but i saw the carriage at the door and i thought i would try for i could be no worse and distress madam makes very bold  angry said cecilia taking a crown from her purse no indeed  who could see such wretchedness and feel any thing but pity  oh madam returned the poor woman i could almost cry to hear you talk so though i never thought to cry again since i left it off for my poor billy  have you then lost a son  yes madam but he was a great deal too good to live so i have quite left off grieving for him now  come in good woman said cecilia it is too cold to stand here and you seem half starved already come in and let me have some talk with you  she then gave orders that the carriage should be driven round the square till she was ready and making the woman follow her into a parlour desired to know what she should do for her changing while she spoke from a movement of increasing compassion the crown which she held in her hand for double that sum  you can do every thing madam she answered if you will but plead for us to his honor he little thinks of our distress because he has been afflicted with none himself and i would not be so troublesome to him but indeed indeed madam we are quite pinched for want  cecilia struck with the words he little thinks of our distress because he has been afflicted with none himself felt again ashamed of the smallness of her intended donation and taking from her purse another half guinea said will this assist you will a guinea be sufficient to you for the present  i humbly thank you madam said the woman curtfying low shall i give you a receipt  a receipt cried cecilia with emotion for what alas our accounts are by no means balanced but i shall do more for you if i find you as deserving an object as you seem to be  you are very good madam but i only meant a receipt in part of payment  payment for what i dont understand you  did his honor never tell you madam of our account  what account  our bill madam for work done to the new temple at violetbank it was the last great work my poor husband was able to do for it was there he met with his misfortune  what bill what misfortune cried cecilia what had your husband to do at violetbank  he was the carpenter madam i thought you might have seen poor hill the carpenter there  no i never was there myself perhaps you mistake me for mrs harrel  why sure madam ant you his honors lady  no but tell me what is this bill  it is a bill madam for very hard work for work madam which i am sure will cost my husband his life and though i have been after his honor night and day to get it and sent him letters and petitions with an account of our misfortunes i have never received so much as a shilling and now the servants will not even let me wait in the hall to speak to him oh madam you who seem so good plead to his honor in our behalf tell him my poor husband cannot live tell him my children are starving and tell him my poor billy that used to help to keep us is dead and that all the work i can do by myself is not enough to maintain us  good heaven cried cecilia extremely moved is it then your own money for which you sue thus humbly  yes madam for my own just and honest money as his honor knows and will tell you himself  impossible cried cecilia he cannot know it but i will take care he shall soon be informed of it how much is the bill  twoandtwenty pounds madam  what no more  ah madam you gentlefolks little think how much that is to poor people a hard working family like mine madam with the help of  0 l will go on for a long while quite in paradise  poor worthy woman cried cecilia whose eyes were filled with tears of compassion if  0 l will place you in paradise and that  0 l only your just right it is hard indeed that you should be kept without it especially when your debtors are too affluent to miss it stay here a few moments and i will bring you the money immediately  away she flew and returned to the breakfast room but found there only mr arnott who told her that mr harrel was in the library with his sister and some gentlemen cecilia briefly related her business and begged he would inform mr harrel she wished to speak to him directly mr arnott shook his head but obeyed  they returned together and immediately  miss beverley cried mr harrel gaily i am glad you are not gone for we want much to consult with you will you come up stairs  presently answered she but first i must speak to you about a poor woman with whom i have accidentally been talking who has begged me to intercede with you to pay a little debt that she thinks you have forgotten but that probably you have never heard mentioned  a debt cried he with an immediate change of countenance to whom  her name i think is hill she is wife to the carpenter you employed about a new temple at violetbank  o what  what that woman  well well i will see she shall be paid come let us go to the library  what with my commission so ill executed i promised to petition for her to have the money directly  pho pho there is no such hurry i dont know what i have done with her bill  i will run and get another  o upon no account she may send another in two or three days she deserves to wait a twelvemonth for her impertinence in troubling you at all about it  that was entirely accidental but indeed you must give me leave to perform my promise and plead for her it must be almost the same to you whether you pay such a trifle as  0 l now or a month hence and to this poor woman the difference seems little short of life or death for she tells me her husband is dying and her children are half famished and though she looks an object of the cruellest want and distress herself she appears to be their only support  o cried mr harrel laughing what a dismal tale has she been telling you no doubt she saw you were fresh from the country but if you give credit to all the farragos of these trumpery impostors you will never have a moment to yourself nor a guinea in your purse  this woman answered cecilia cannot be an impostor she carries marks but too evident and too dreadful in her countenance of the sufferings which she relates  o returned he when you know the town better you will soon see through tricks of this sort a sick husband and five small children are complaints so stale now that they serve no other purpose in the world but to make a joke  those however who can laugh at them must have notions of merriment very different to mine and this poor woman whose cause i have ventured to undertake had she no family at all must still and indisputably be an object of pity herself for she is so weak she can hardly crawl and so pallid that she seems already half dead  all imposition depend upon it the moment she is out of your sight her complaints will vanish  nay sir cried cecilia a little impatiently there is no reason to suspect such deceit since she does not come hither as a beggar however well the state of beggary may accord with her poverty she only sollicits the payment of a bill and if in that there is any fraud nothing can be so easy as detection  mr harrel bit his lips at this speech and for some instants looked much disturbed but soon recovering himself he negligently said pray how did she get at you  i met her at the street door but tell me is not her bill a just one  i cannot say i have never had time to look at it  but you know who the woman is and that her husband worked for you and therefore that in all probability it is right  do you not  yes yes i know who the woman is well enough she has taken care of that for she has pestered me every day these nine months  cecilia was struck dumb by this speech hitherto she had supposed that the dissipation of his life kept him ignorant of his own injustice but when she found he was so well informed of it yet with such total indifference could suffer a poor woman to claim a just debt every day for nine months together she was shocked and astonished beyond measure they were both some time silent and then mr harrel yawning and stretching out his arms indolently asked pray why does not the man come himself  did i not tell you answered cecilia staring at so absent a question that he was very ill and unable even to work  well when he is better added he moving toward the door he may call and i will talk to him  cecilia all amazement at this unfeeling behavior turned involuntarily to mr arnott with a countenance that appealed for his assistance but mr arnott hung his head ashamed to meet her eyes and abruptly left the room  mean time mr harrel half turning back though without looking cecilia in the face carelessly said well will not you come  no sir answered she coldly  he then returned to the library leaving her equally displeased surprised and disconcerted at the conversation which had just passed between them good heaven cried she to herself what strange what cruel insensibility to suffer a wretched family to starve from an obstinate determination to assert that they can live to distress the poor by retaining the recompense for which alone they labor and which at last they must have merely from indolence forgetfulness or insolence o how little did my uncle know how little did i imagine to what a guardian i was entrusted she now felt ashamed even to return to the poor woman though she resolved to do all in her power to soften her disappointment and relieve her distress  but before she had quitted the room one of the servants came to tell her that his master begged the honor of her company up stairs perhaps he relents thought she and pleased with the hope readily obeyed the summons  she found him his lady sir robert floyer and two other gentlemen all earnestly engaged in an argument over a large table which was covered with plans and elevations of small buildings  mr harrel immediately addressed her with an air of vivacity and said you are very good for coming we can settle nothing without your advice pray look at these different plans for our theater and tell us which is the best  cecilia advanced not a step the sight of plans for new edifices when the workmen were yet unpaid for old ones the cruel wantonness of raising fresh fabrics of expensive luxury while those so lately built had brought their neglected laborers to ruin excited an indignation she scarce thought right to repress while the easy sprightliness of the director of these revels to whom but the moment before she had represented the oppression of which they made him guilty filled her with aversion and disgust and recollecting the charge given her by the stranger at the opera rehearsal she resolved to speed her departure to another house internally repeating yes i will save myself from the impending destruction of unfeeling prosperity  mrs harrel surprised at her silence and extreme gravity enquired if she was not well and why she had put off her visit to miss larolles and sir robert floyer turning suddenly to look at her said do you begin to feel the london air already  cecilia endeavored to recover her serenity and answer these questions in her usual manner but she persisted in declining to give any opinion at all about the plans and after slightly looking at them left the room  mr harrel who knew better how to account for her behavior than he thought proper to declare saw with concern that she was more seriously displeased than he had believed an occurrence which he had regarded as wholly unimportant could have made her and therefore desirous that she should be appeased he followed her out of the library and said miss beverley will tomorrow be soon enough for your protegee  o yes no doubt answered she most agreeably surprised by the question  well then will you take the trouble to bid her come to me in the morning  delighted at this unexpected commission she thanked him with smiles for the office and as she hastened down stairs to cheer the poor expectant with the welcome intelligence she framed a thousand excuses for the part he had hitherto acted and without any difficulty persuaded herself he began to see the faults of his conduct and to meditate a reformation  she was received by the poor creature she so warmly wished to serve with a countenance already so much enlivened that she fancied mr harrel had himself anticipated her intended information this however she found was not the case for as soon as she heard his message she shook her head and said ah madam his honor always says tomorrow but i can better bear to be disappointed now so i will grumble no more for indeed madam i have been blessed enough today to comfort me for every thing in the world if i could but keep from thinking of poor billy i could bear all the rest madam but whenever my other troubles go off that comes back to me so much the harder  there indeed i can afford you no relief said cecilia but you must try to think less of him and more of your husband and children who are now alive tomorrow you will receive your money and that i hope will raise your spirits and pray let your husband have a physician to tell you how to nurse and manage him i will give you one fee for him now and if he should want further advice dont fear to let me know  cecilia had again taken out her purse but mrs hill clasping her hands called out oh madam no i dont come here to fleece such goodness but blessed be the hour that brought me here today and if my poor billy was alive he should help me to thank you  she then told her that she was now quite rich for while she was gone a gentleman had come into the room who had given her five guineas  cecilia by her description soon found this gentleman was mr arnott and a charity so sympathetic with her own failed not to raise him greatly in her favor but as her benevolence was a stranger to that parade which is only liberal from emulation when she found more money not immediately wanted she put up her purse and charging mrs hill to enquire for her the next morning when she came to be paid bid her hasten back to her sick husband  and then again ordering the carriage to the door she set off upon her visit to miss larolles with a heart happy in the good already done and happier still in the hope of doing more  miss larolles was out and she returned home for she was too sanguine in her expectations from mr harrel to have any desire of seeking her other guardians the rest of the day she was more than usually civil to him with a view to mark her approbation of his good intentions while mr arnott gratified by meeting the smiles he so much valued thought his five gnineas amply repaid independently of the real pleasure which he took in doing good  chap x a provocation the next morning when breakfast was over cecilia waited with much impatience to hear some tidings of the poor carpenters wife but though mr harrel who had always that meal in his own room came into his ladys at his usual hour to see what was going forward he did not mention her name she therefore went into the hall herself to enquire among the servants if mrs hill was yet come  yes they answered and had seen their master and was gone  she then returned to the breakfast room where her eagerness to procure some information detained her though the entrance of sir robert floyer made her wish to retire but she was wholly at a loss whether to impute to general forgetfulness or to the failure of performing his promise the silence of mr harrel upon the subject of her petition  in a few minutes they were visited by mr morris who said he called to acquaint the ladies that the next morning there was to be a rehearsal of a very grand new dance at the operahouse where though admission was difficult if it was agreeable to them to go he would undertake to introduce them  mrs harrel happened to be engaged and therefore declined the offer he then turned to cecilia and said well maam when did you see our friend monckton  not since the rehearsal sir  he is a mighty agreeable fellow he continued and his house in the country is charming one is as easy at it as at home were you ever there sir robert  not i truly replied sir robert what should i go for  to see an old woman with never a tooth in her head sitting at the top of the table faith i would go an hundred miles a day for a month never to see such a sight again  o but you dont know how well she does the honors said morris and for my part except just at meal times i always contrive to keep out of her way  i wonder when she intends to die said mr harrel  she is been a long time about it cried sir robert but those tough old cats last for ever we all thought she was going when monckton married her however if he had not managed like a driveler he might have broke her heart nine years ago  i am sure i wish he had cried mrs harrel for she is an odious creature and used always to make me afraid of her  but an old woman answered sir robert is a person who has no sense of decency if once she takes to living the devil himself cannot get rid of her  i dare say cried morris she will pop off before long in one of those fits of the asthma i assure you sometimes you may hear her wheeze a mile off  she will go never the sooner for that said sir robert for i have got an old aunt of my own who has been puffing and blowing as if she was at her last gasp ever since i can remember and for all that only yesterday when i asked her doctor when she would give up the ghost he told me she might live these dozen years  cecilia was by no means sorry to have this brutal conversation interrupted by the entrance of a servant with a letter for her she was immediately retiring to read it but upon the petition of mr monckton who just then came into the room she only went to a window the letter was as follows  to miss at his honor squire harrels these honored madam this with my humble duty his honor has given me nothing but i would not be troublesome having wherewithal to wait so conclude  honored madam your dutiful servant to command till death m hill   the vexation with which cecilia read this letter was visible to the whole company and while mr arnott looked at her with a wish of enquiry he did not dare express and mr monckton under an appearance of inattention concealed the most anxious curiosity mr morris alone had courage to interrogate her and pertly advancing said he is a happy man who writ that letter maam for i am sure you have not read it with indifference  were i the writer said mr arnott tenderly i am sure i should reckon myself far otherwise for miss beverley seems to have read it with uneasiness  however i have read it answered she i assure you it is not from any man  o pray miss beverley cried sir robert coming forward are you any better today  no sir for i have not been ill  a little vapoured i thought yesterday perhaps you want exercise  i wish the ladies would put themselves under my care cried morris and take a turn round the park  i dont doubt you sir said mr monckton contemptuously and but for the check of modesty probably there is not a man here who would not wish the same  i could propose a much better scheme than that said sir robert what if you all walk to harleystreet and give me your notions of a house i am about there what say you mrs harrel  o i shall like it vastly  done cried mr harrel it is an excellent motion  come then said sir robert let us be off miss beverley i hope you have a good warm cloak  i must beg you to excuse my attending you sir  mr monckton who had heard this proposal with the utmost dread of its success revived at the calm steadiness with which it was declined mr and mrs harrel both teized cecilia to consent but the haughty baronet evidently more offended than hurt by her refusal pressed the matter no further either with her or the rest of the party and the scheme was dropped entirely  mr monckton failed not to remark this circumstance which confirmed his suspicions that though the proposal seemed made by chance its design was nothing else than to obtain cecilias opinion concerning his house but while this somewhat alarmed him the unabated insolence of his carriage and the confident defiance of his pride still more surprised him and notwithstanding all he observed of cecilia seemed to promise nothing but dislike he could draw no other inference from his behavior than that if he admired he also concluded himself sure of her  this was not a pleasant conjecture however little weight he allowed to it and he resolved by outstaying all the company to have a few minutes private discourse with her upon the subject  in about half an hour sir robert and mr harrel went out together mr monckton still persevered in keeping his ground and tried though already weary to keep up a general conversation but what moved at once his wonder and his indignation was the assurance of morris who seemed not only bent upon staying as long as himself but determined by rattling away to make his own entertainment  at length a servant came in to tell mrs harrel that a stranger who was waiting in the housekeepers room begged to speak with her upon very particular business  o i know cried she it is that odious john groot do pray brother try to get rid of him for me for he comes to teize me about his bill and i never know what to say to him  mr arnott went immediately and mr monckton could scarce restrain from going too that he might entreat john groot by no means to be satisfied without seeing mrs harrel herself john groot however wanted not his entreaties as the servant soon returned to summon his lady to the conference  but though mr monckton now seemed near the completion of his purpose morris still remained his vexation at this circumstance soon grew intolerable to see himself upon the point of receiving the recompense of his perseverance by the fortunate removal of all the obstacles in its way and then to have it held from him by a young fellow he so much despised and who had no entrance into the house but through his own boldness and no inducement to stay in it but from his own impertinence mortified him so insufferably that it was with difficulty he even forbore affronting him nor would he have scrupled a moment desiring him to leave the room had he not prudently determined to guard with the utmost sedulity against raising any suspicions of his passion for cecilia  he arose however and was moving toward her with intention to occupy a part of a sofa on which she was seated when morris who was standing at the back of it with a sudden spring which made the whole room shake jumpt over and sunk plump into the vacant place himself calling out at the same time come come what have you married men to do with young ladies i shall seize this post for myself  the rage of mr monckton at this feat and still more at the words married men almost exceeded endurance he stopped short and looking at him with a fierceness that overpowered his discretion was bursting out with sir you are an  impudent fellow but checking himself when he got half way concluded with a very facetious gentleman  morris who wished nothing so little as disobliging mr monckton and whose behavior was merely the result of levity and a want of early education no sooner perceived his displeasure than rising with yet more agility than he had seated himself he resumed the obsequiousness of which an uncommon flow of spirits had robbed him and guessing no other subject for his anger than the disturbance he had made he bowed almost to the ground first to him and afterward to cecilia most respectfully begging pardon of them both for his frolic and protesting he had no notion he should have made such a noise  mrs harrel and mr arnott now hastening back enquired what had been the matter morris ashamed of his exploit and frightened by the looks of mr monckton made an apology with the utmost humility and hurried away and mr monckton hopeless of any better fortune soon did the same gnawn with a cruel discontent which he did not dare avow and longing to revenge himself upon morris even by personal chastisement  chap xi a narration the moment cecilia was at liberty she sent her own servant to examine into the real situation of the carpenter and his family and to desire his wife would call upon her as soon as she was at leisure the account which he brought back increased her concern for the injuries of these poor people and determined her not to rest satisfied till she saw them redressed he informed her that they lived in a small lodging up two pair of stairs that there were five children all girls the three eldest of whom were hard at work with their mother in matting chairbottoms and the fourth though a mere child was nursing the youngest while the poor carpenter himself was confined to his bed in consequence of a fall from a ladder while working at violetbank by which he was covered with wounds and contusions and an object of misery and pain  as soon as mrs hill came cecilia sent for her into her own room where she received her with the most compassionate tenderness and desired to know when mr harrel talked of paying her  tomorrow madam she answered shaking her head that is always his honors speech but i shall bear it while i can however though i dare not tell his honor something bad will come of it if i am not paid soon  do you mean then to apply to the law  i must not tell you madam but to be sure we have thought of it many a sad time and often but still while we could rub on we thought it best not to make enemies but indeed madam his honor was so hardhearted this morning that if i was not afraid you would be angry i could not tell how to bear it for when i told him i had no help now for i had lost my billy he had the heart to say so much the better there is one the less of you  but what cried cecilia extremely shocked by this unfeeling speech is the reason he gives for disappointing you so often  he says madam that none of the other workmen are paid yet and that to be sure is very true but then they can all better afford to wait than we can for we were the poorest of all madam and have been misfortunate from the beginning and his honor would never have employed us only he had run up such a bill with mr wright that he would not undertake any thing more till he was paid we were told from the first we should not get our money but we were willing to hope for the best for we had nothing to do and were hard run and had never had the offer of so good a job before and we had a great family to keep and many losses and so much illness  oh madam if you did but know what the poor go through  this speech opened to cecilia a new view of life that a young man could appear so gay and happy yet be guilty of such injustice and inhumanity that he could take pride in works which not even money had made his own and live with undiminished splendour when his credit itself began to fail seemed to her incongruities so irrational that hitherto she had supposed them impossible  she then enquired if her husband had yet had any physician  yes madam i humbly thank your goodness she answered but i am not the poorer for that for the gentleman was so kind he would take nothing  and does he give you any hopes what does he say  he says he must die madam but i knew that before  poor woman and what will you do then  the same madam as i did when i lost my billy work on the harder  good heaven how severe a lot but tell me why is it you seem to love your billy so much better than the rest of your children  because madam he was the only boy that ever i had he was seventeen years old madam and as tall and as pretty a lad and so good that he never cost me a wet eye till i lost him he worked with his father and all the folks used to say he was the better workman of the two  and what was the occasion of his death  a consumption madam that wasted him quite to nothing and he was ill a long time and cost us a deal of money for we spared neither for wine nor any thing that we thought would but comfort him and we loved him so we never grudged it but he died madam and if it had not been for very hard work the loss of him would quite have broke my heart  try however to think less of him said cecilia and depend upon my speaking again for you to mr harrel you shall certainly have your money take care therefore of your own health and go home and give comfort to your sick husband  oh madam cried the poor woman tears streaming down her cheeks you dont know how touching it is to hear gentlefolks talk so kindly and i have been used to nothing but roughness from his honor but what i most fear madam is that when my husband is gone he will be harder to deal with than ever for a widow madam is always hard to be righted and i dont expect to hold out long myself for sickness and sorrow wear fast and then when we are both gone who is to help our poor children   i will cried the generous cecilia i am able and i am willing you shall not find all the rich hardhearted and i will try to make you some amends for the unkindness you have suffered  the poor woman overcome by a promise so unexpected burst into a passionate fit of tears and sobbed out her thanks with a violence of emotion that frightened cecilia almost as much as it melted her she endeavored by reiterated assurances of assistance to appease her and solemnly pledged her own honor that she should certainly be paid the following saturday which was only three days distant  mrs hill when a little calmer dried her eyes and humbly begging her to forgive a transport which she could not restrain most gratefully thanked her for the engagement into which she had entered protesting that she would not be troublesome to her goodness as long as she could help it and i believe she continued that if his honor will but pay me time enough for the burial i can make shift with what i have till then but when my poor billy died we were sadly off indeed for we could not bear but bury him prettily because it was the last we could do for him but we could hardly scrape up enough for it and yet we all went without our dinners to help forward except the little one of all but that did not much matter for we had no great heart for eating  i cannot bear this cried cecilia you must tell me no more of your billy but go home and cheer your spirits and do every thing in your power to save your husband  i will madam answered the woman and his dying prayers shall bless you and all my children shall bless you and every night they shall pray for you and oh  again bursting into tears that billy was but alive to pray for you too  cecilia kindly endeavored to soothe her but the poor creature no longer able to suppress the violence of her awakened sorrows cried out i must go madam and pray for you at home for now i have once begun crying again i dont know how to have done and hurried away  cecilia determined to make once more an effort with mr harrel for the payment of the bill and if that in two days did not succeed to take up money for the discharge of it herself and rest all her security for reimbursement upon the shame with which such a proceeding must overwhelm him offended however by the repulse she had already received from him and disgusted by all she had heard of his unfeeling negligence she knew not how to address him and resolved upon applying again to mr arnott who was already acquainted with the affair for advice and assistance  mr arnott though extremely gratified that she consulted him betrayed by his looks an hopelessness of success that damped all her expectations he promised however to speak to mr harrel upon the subject but the promise was evidently given to oblige the fair mediatrix without any hope of advantage to the cause  the next morning mrs hill again came and again without payment was dismissed  mr arnott then at the request of cecilia followed mr harrel into his room to enquire into the reason of this breach of promise they continued some time together and when he returned to cecilia he told her that his brother had assured him he would give orders to davison his gentleman to let her have the money the next day  the pleasure with which she would have heard this intelligence was much checked by the grave and cold manner in which it was communicated she waited therefore with more impatience than confidence for the result of this fresh assurance  the next morning however was the same as the last mrs hill came saw davison and was sent away  cecilia to whom she related her grievances then flew to mr arnott and entreated him to enquire at least of davison why the woman had again been disappointed  mr arnott obeyed her and brought for answer that davison had received no orders from his master  i entreat you then cried she with mingled eagerness and vexation to go for the last time to mr harrel i am sorry to impose upon you an office so disagreeable but i am sure you compassionate these poor people and will serve them now with your interest as you have already done with your purse i only wish to know if there has been any mistake or if these delays are merely to sicken me of petitioning  mr arnott with a repugnance to the request which he could as ill conceal as his admiration of the zealous requester again forced himself to follow mr harrel his stay was not long and cecilia at his return perceived that he was hurt and disconcerted as soon as they were alone together she begged to know what had passed nothing answered he that will give you any pleasure when i entreated my brother to come to the point he said it was his intention to pay all his workmen together for that if he paid any one singly all the rest would be dissatisfied  and why said cecilia should he not pay them at once there can be no more comparison in the value of the money to him and to them than to speak with truth there is in his and in their right to it  but madam the bills for the new house itself are none of them settled and he says that the moment he is known to discharge an account for the temple he shall not have any rest for the clamours it will raise among the workmen who were employed about the house  how infinitely strange exclaimed cecilia will he not then pay any body  next quarter he says he shall pay them all but at present he has a particular call for his money  cecilia would not trust herself to make any comments upon such an avowal but thanking mr arnott for the trouble which he had taken she determined without any further application to desire mr harrel to advance her  0 l the next morning and satisfy the carpenter herself be the risk what it might  the following day therefore which was the saturday when payment was promised she begged an audience of mr harrel which he immediately granted but before she could make her demand he said to her with an air of the utmost gaiety and goodhumour well miss beverley how fares it with your protegee i hope at length she is contented but i must beg you would charge her to keep her own counsel as otherwise she will draw me into a scrape i shall not thank her for  have you then paid her cried cecilia with much amazement  yes i promised you i would you know  this intelligence equally delighted and astonished her she repeatedly thanked him for his attention to her petition and eager to communicate her success to mr arnott she hastened to find him now cried she i shall torment you no more with painful commissions the hills at last are paid  from you madam answered he gravely no commissions could be painful  well but said cecilia somewhat disappointed you dont seem glad of this  yes answered he with a forced smile i am very glad to see you so  but how was it brought about did mr harrel relent or did you attack him again  the hesitation of his answer convinced her there was some mystery in the transaction she began to apprehend she had been deceived and hastily quitting the room sent for mrs hill but the moment the poor woman appeared she was satisfied of the contrary for almost frantic with joy and gratitude she immediately flung herself upon her knees to thank her benefactress for having seen her righted  cecilia then gave her some general advice promised to continue her friend and offered her assistance in getting her husband into an hospital but she told her he had already been in one many months where he had been pronounced incurable and therefore was desirous to spend his last days in his own lodgings  well said cecilia make them as easy to him as you can and come to me next week and i will try to put you in a better way of living  she then still greatly perplexed about mr arnott sought him again and after various questions and conjectures at length brought him to confess he had himself lent his brother the sum with which the hills had been paid  struck with his generosity she poured forth thanks and praises so grateful to his ears that she soon gave him a recompense which he would have thought cheaply purchased by half his fortune  book ii chapter i a man of wealth the meanness with which mr harrel had assumed the credit as well as accepted the assistance of mr arnott increased the disgust he had already excited in cecilia and hastened her resolution of quitting his house and therefore without waiting any longer for the advice of mr monckton she resolved to go instantly to her other guardians and see what better prospects their habitations might offer  for this purpose she borrowed one of the carriages and gave orders to be driven into the city to the house of mr briggs  she told her name and was shown by a little shabby footboy into a parlour  here she waited with tolerable patience for half an hour but then imagining the boy had forgotten to tell his master she was in the house she thought it expedient to make some enquiry  no bell however could she find and therefore she went into the passage in search of the footboy but as she was proceeding to the head of the kitchen stairs she was startled by hearing a mans voice from the upper part of the house exclaiming in a furious passion dare say you have filched it for a dishclout  she called out however are any of mr briggss servants below  anan answered the boy who came to the foot of the stairs with a knife in one hand and an old shoe upon the sole of which he was sharpening it in the other does any one call  yes said cecilia i do for i could not find the bell  o we have no bell in the parlour returned the boy master always knocks with his stick  i am afraid mr briggs is too busy to see me and if so i will come another time  no maam said the boy masters only looking over his things from the wash  will you tell him then that i am waiting  i has maam but master misses his shavingrag and he says he will not come to the mogul till he is found it and then he went on with sharpening his knife  this little circumstance was at least sufficient to satisfy cecilia that if she fixed her abode with mr briggs she should not have much uneasiness to fear from the sight of extravagance and profusion  she returned to the parlour and after waiting another half hour mr briggs made his appearance  mr briggs was a short thick sturdy man with very small keen black eyes a square face a dark complexion and a snub nose his constant dress both in winter and summer was a snuffcolour suit of clothes blue and white speckled worsted stockings a plain shirt and a bob wig he was seldom without a stick in his hand which he usually held to his forehead when not speaking  this bob wig however to the no small amazement of cecilia he now brought into the room upon the fore finger of his left hand while with his right he was smoothing the curls and his head in defiance of the coldness of the weather was bald and uncovered  well cried he as he entered did you think should not come  i was very willing sir to wait your leisure  ay ay knew you had not much to do been looking for my shavingrag going out of town never use such a thing at home paper does as well warrant master harrel never heard of such a thing ever see him comb his own wig warrant he dont know how never trust mine out of my hands the boy would tear off half the hair all one to master harrel i suppose well which is the warmer man that is all will he cast an account with me  cecilia at a loss what to say to this singular exordium began an apology for not waiting upon him sooner  ay ay cried he always gadding no getting sight of you live a fine life a pretty guardian master harrel and where is the other where is old don puffabout  if you mean mr delvile sir i have not yet seen him  thought so no matter as well not only tell you he is a german duke or a spanish don ferdinand well you have me poorly off else a couple of ignoramusses dont know when to buy nor when to sell no doing business with either of them we met once or twice all to no purpose only heard don vampus count his old grandees how will that get interest for money then comes master harrel  twenty bows to a word  looks at a watch  about as big as a sixpence  poor raw ninny  a couple of rare guardians well you have me i say mind that  cecilia was wholly unable to devise any answer to these effusions of contempt and anger and therefore his harangue lasted without interruption till he had exhausted all his subjects of complaint and emptied his mind of ill will and then settling his wig he drew a chair near her and twinkling his little black eyes in her face his rage subsided into the most perfect good humor and after peering at her some time with a look of much approbation he said with an arch nod well my duck got ever a sweetheart yet  cecilia laughed and said no  ah little rogue dont believe you all a fib better speak out come fit i should know ant you my own ward to be sure almost of age but not quite so what is that to me  she then more seriously assured him she had no intelligence of that sort to communicate  well when you have tell that is all warrant sparks enough hankering i will give you some advice take care of sharpers dont trust shoebuckles nothing but bristol stones tricks in all things a fine gentleman sharp as another man never give your heart to a gold topped cane nothing but brass gilt over cheats every where fleece you in a year wont leave you a groat but one way to be safe  bring em all to me  cecilia thanked him for his caution and promised not to forget his advice  that is the way he continued bring em to me will not be bamboozled know their tricks show em the odds on it ask for the rentroll  see how they will look stare like stuck pigs got no such thing  certainly sir that will be an excellent method of trial  ay ay know the way soon find if they are above par be sure dont mind gold waistcoats nothing but tinsel all show and no substance better leave the matter to me take care of you myself know where to find one will do  she again thanked him and being fully satisfied with this specimen of his conversation and unambitious of any further counsel from him she arose to depart  well repeated he nodding at her with a look of much kindness leave it to me i say i will get you a careful husband so take no thought about the matter  cecilia half laughing begged he would not give himself much trouble and assured him she was not in any haste  all the better said he good girl no fear for you look out myself warrant i will find one not very easy neither hard times men scarce wars and tumults stocks low women chargeable  but dont fear do our best get you off soon  she then returned to her carriage full of reflection upon the scene in which she had just been engaged and upon the strangeness of hastening from one house to avoid a vice the very want of which seemed to render another insupportable but she now found that though luxury was more baneful in it is consequences it was less disgustful in it is progress than avarice yet insuperably averse to both and almost equally desirous to fly from the unjust extravagance of mr harrel as from the comfortless and unnecessary parsimony of mr briggs she proceeded instantly to st jamesssquare convinced that her third guardian unless exactly resembling one of the others must inevitably be preferable to both  chap ii a man of family the house of mr delvile was grand and spacious fitted up not with modern taste but with the magnificence of former times the servants were all veterans gorgeous in their liveries and profoundly respectful in their manners every thing had an air of state but of a state so gloomy that while it inspired awe it repressed pleasure  cecilia sent in her name and was admitted without difficulty and was then ushered with great pomp through sundry apartments and rows of servants before she came into the presence of mr delvile  he received her with an air of haughty affability which to a spirit open and liberal as that of cecilia could not fail being extremely offensive but too much occupied with the care of his own importance to penetrate into the feelings of another he attributed the uneasiness which his reception occasioned to the overawing predomiance of superior rank and consequence  he ordered a servant to bring her a chair while he only half rose from his own upon her entering into the room then waving his hand and bowing with a motion that desired her to be seated he said i am very happy miss beverley that you have found me alone you would rarely have had the same good fortune at this time of day i am generally in a crowd people of large connections have not much leisure in london especially if they see a little after their own affairs and if their estates like mine are dispersed in various parts of the kingdom however i am glad it happened so and i am glad too that you have done me the favor of calling without waiting till i sent which i really would have done as soon as i heard of your arrival but that the multiplicity of my engagements allowed me no respite  a display of importance so ostentatious made cecilia already half repent her visit satisfied that the hope in which she had planned it would be fruitless  mr delvile still imputing to embarrasment an inquietude of countenance that proceeded merely from disappointment imagined her veneration was every moment increasing and therefore pitying a timidity which both gratified and softened him and equally pleased with himself for inspiring and with her for feeling it he abated more and more of his greatness till he became at length so infinitely condescending with intention to give her courage that he totally depressed her with mortification and chagrin  after some general enquiries concerning her way of life he told her that he hoped she was contented with her situation at the harrels adding if you have any thing to complain of remember to whom you may appeal he then asked if she had seen mr briggs  yes sir i am this moment come from his house  i am sorry for it his house cannot be a proper one for the reception of a young lady when the dean made application that i would be one of your guardians i instantly sent him a refusal as is my custom upon all such occasions which indeed occur to me with a frequency extremely importunate but the dean was a man for whom i had really a regard and therefore when i found my refusal had affected him i suffered myself to be prevailed upon to indulge him contrary not only to my general rule but to my inclination  here he stopped as if to receive some compliment but cecilia very little disposed to pay him any went no farther than an inclination of the head  i knew not however he continued at the time i was induced to give my consent with whom i was to be associated nor could i have imagined the dean so little conversant with the distinctions of the world as to disgrace me with inferior coadjutors but the moment i learnt the state of the affair i insisted upon withdrawing both my name and countenance  here again he paused not in expectation of an answer from cecilia but merely to give her time to marvel in what manner he had at last been melted  the dean he resumed was then very ill my displeasure i believe hurt him i was sorry for it he was a worthy man and had not meant to offend me in the end i accepted his apology and was even persuaded to accept the office you have a right therefore to consider yourself as personally my ward and though i do not think proper to mix much with your other guardians i shall always be ready to serve and advise you and much pleased to see you  you do me honor sir said cecilia extremely wearied of such graciousness and rising to be gone  pray sit still said he with a smile i have not many engagements for this morning you must give me some account how you pass your time are you much out the harrels i am told live at a great expense what is their establishment  i dont exactly know sir  they are decent sort of people i believe are they not  i hope so sir  and they have a tolerable acquaintance i believe i am told so for i know nothing of them  they have at least a very numerous one sir  well my dear said he taking her hand now you have once ventured to come dont be apprehensive of repeating your visits i must introduce you to mrs delvile i am sure she will be happy to show you any kindness come therefore when you please and without scruple i would call upon you myself but am fearful of being embarrassed by the people with whom you live  he then rang his bell and with the same ceremonies which had attended her admittance she was conducted back to her carriage  and here died away all hope of putting into execution during her minority the plan of which the formation had given her so much pleasure she found that her present situation however wide of her wishes was by no means the most disagreeable in which she could be placed she was tired indeed of dissipation and shocked at the sight of unfeeling extravagance but notwithstanding the houses of each of her other guardians were exempt from these particular vices she saw not any prospect of happiness with either of them vulgarity seemed leagued with avarice to drive her from the mansion of mr briggs and haughtiness with ostentation to exclude her from that of mr delvile  she came back therefore to portmansquare disappointed in her hopes and sick both of those whom she quitted and of those to whom she was returning but in going to her own apartment mrs harrel eagerly stopping her begged she would come into the drawing room where she promised her a most agreeable surprise  cecilia for an instant imagined that some old acquaintance was just arrived out of the country but upon her entrance she saw only mr harrel and some workmen and found that the agreeable surprise was to proceed from the sight of an elegant awning prepared for one of the inner apartments to be fixed over a long deserttable which was to be ornamented with various devices of cut glass  did you ever see any thing so beautiful in your life cried mrs harrel and when the table is covered with the colored ices and those sort of things it will be as beautiful again we shall have it ready for tuesday sennight  i understood you were engaged to go to the masquerade  so we shall only we intend to see masks at home first  i have some thoughts said mr harrel leading the way to another small room of running up a flight of steps and a little light gallery here and so making a little orchestra what would such a thing come to mr tomkins  o a trifle sir answered mr tomkins a mere nothing  well then give orders for it and let it be done directly i dont care how slight it is but pray let it be very elegant will not it be a great addition miss beverley  indeed sir i dont think it seems to be very necessary said cecilia who wished much to take that moment for reminding him of the debt he had contracted with mr arnott  lord miss beverley is so grave cried mrs harrel nothing of this sort gives her any pleasure  she has indeed answered cecilia trying to smile not much taste for the pleasure of being always surrounded by workmen  and as soon as she was able she retired to her room feeling both on the part of mr arnott and the hills a resentment at the injustice of mr harrel which fixed her in the resolution of breaking through that facility of compliance which had hitherto confined her disapprobation to her own breast and venturing henceforward to mark the opinion she entertained of his conduct by consulting nothing but reason and principle in her own  her first effort toward this change was made immediately in begging to be excused from accompanying mrs harrel to a large card assembly that evening  mrs harrel extremely surprised asked a thousand times the reason of her refusal imagining it to proceed from some very extraordinary cause nor was she without the utmost difficulty persuaded at last that she merely meant to pass one evening by herself  but the next day when the refusal was repeated she was still more incredulous it seemed to her impossible that any one who had the power to be encircled with company could by choice spend a second afternoon alone and she was so urgent in her request to be entrusted with the secret that cecilia found no way left to appease her but by frankly confessing she was weary of eternal visiting and sick of living always in a crowd  suppose then cried she i send for miss larolles to come and sit with you  cecilia not without laughing declined this proposal assuring her that no such assistant was necessary for her entertainment yet it was not till after a long contention that she was able to convince her there would be no cruelty in leaving her by herself  the following day however her trouble diminished for mrs harrel ceasing to be surprised thought little more of the matter and forebore any earnestness of solicitation and from that time she suffered her to follow her own humor with very little opposition cecilia was much concerned to find her so unmoved and not less disappointed at the indifference of mr harrel who being seldom of the same parties with his lady and seeing her too rarely either to communicate or hear any domestic occurrences far from being struck as she had hoped with the new way in which she passed her time was scarce sensible of the change and interfered not upon the subject  sir robert floyer who continued to see her when he dined in portmansquare often enquired what she did with herself in an evening but never obtaining any satisfactory answer he concluded her engagements were with people to whom he was a stranger  poor mr arnott felt the cruellest disappointment in being deprived of the happiness of attending her in her evenings expeditions when whether he conversed with her or not he was sure of the indulgence of seeing and hearing her  but the greatest sufferer from this new regulation was mr monckton who unable any longer to endure the mortifications of which his morning visits to portmansquare had been productive determined not to trust his temper with such provocations in future but rather to take his chance of meeting with her elsewhere for which purpose he assiduously frequented all public places and sought acquaintance with every family and every person he believed to be known to the harrels but his patience was unrewarded and his diligence unsuccessful he met with her no where and while he continued his search fancied every evil power was at work to lead him whither he was sure never to find her  mean while cecilia passed her time greatly to her own satisfaction her first care was to assist and comfort the hills she went herself to their lodgings ordered and paid for whatever the physician prescribed to the sick man gave clothes to the children and money and various necessaries to the wife she found that the poor carpenter was not likely to languish much longer and therefore for the present only thought of alleviating his sufferings by procuring him such indulgencies as were authorized by his physician and enabling his family to abate so much of their labor as was requisite for obtaining time to nurse and attend him but she meant as soon as the last duties should be paid him to assist his survivors in attempting to follow some better and more profitable business  her next solicitude was to furnish herself with a wellchosen collection of books and this employment which to a lover of literature young and ardent in it is pursuit is perhaps the minds first luxury proved a source of entertainment so fertile and delightful that it left her nothing to wish  she confined not her acquisitions to the limits of her present power but as she was laying in a stock for future as well as immediate advantage she was restrained by no expense from gratifying her taste and her inclination she had now entered the last year of her minority and therefore had not any doubt that her guardians would permit her to take up whatever sum she should require for such a purpose  and thus in the exercise of charity the search of knowledge and the enjoyment of quiet serenely in innocent philosophy passed the hours of cecilia  chap iii a masquerade the first check this tranquillity received was upon the day of the masquerade the preparations for which have been already mentioned the whole house was then in commotion from various arrangements and improvements which were planned for almost every apartment that was to be opened for the reception of masks cecilia herself however little pleased with the attendant circumstance of wantonly accumulating unnecessary debts was not the least animated of the party she was a stranger to every diversion of this sort and from the novelty of the scene hoped for uncommon satisfaction  at noon mrs harrel sent for her to consult upon a new scheme which occurred to mr harrel of fixing in fantastic forms some colored lamps in the drawing room  while they were all discoursing this matter over one of the servants who had two or three times whispered some message to mr harrel and then retired said in a voice not too low to be heard by cecilia indeed sir i cannot get him away  he is an insolent scoundrel answered mr harrel however if i must speak to him i must and went out of the room  mrs harrel still continued to exercise her fancy upon this new project calling both upon mr arnott and cecilia to admire her taste and contrivance till they were all interrupted by the loudness of a voice from below stairs which frequently repeated sir i can wait no longer i have been put off till i can be put off no more  startled by this mrs harrel ceased her employment and they all stood still and silent they then heard mr harrel with much softness answer good mr rawlins have a little patience i shall receive a large sum of money tomorrow or next day and you may then depend upon being paid  sir cried the man you have so often told me the same that it goes just for nothing i have had a right to it a long time and i have a bill to make up that cannot be waited for any longer  certainly mr rawlins replied mr harrel with still increasing gentleness and certainly you shall have it nobody means to dispute your right i only beg you to wait a day or two days at furthest and you may then depend upon being paid and you shall not be the worse for obliging me i will never employ any body else and i shall have occasion for you very soon as i intend to make some alterations at violetbank that will be very considerable  sir said the man still louder it is of no use your employing me if i can never get my money all my workmen must be paid whether i am or no and so if i must needs speak to a lawyer why there is no help for it  did you ever hear any thing so impertinent exclaimed mrs harrel i am sure mr harrel will be very much to blame if ever he lets that man do any thing more for him  just then mr harrel appeared and with an air of affected unconcern said here is the most insolent rascal of a mason below stairs i ever met with in my life he has come upon me quite unexpectedly with a bill of  00 l and will not leave the house without the money brother arnott i wish you would do me the favor to speak to the fellow for i could not bear to stay with him any longer  do you wish me to give him a draught for the money upon my own banker  that would be vastly obliging answered mr harrel and i will give you my note for it directly and so we shall get rid of this fellow at once and he shall do nothing more for me as long as he lives i will run up a new building at violetbank next summer if only to show him what a job he has lost  pay the man at once there is a good brother cried mrs harrel and let us hear no more of him  the two gentlemen then retired to another room and mrs harrel after praising the extreme goodnature of her brother of whom she was very fond and declaring that the masons impertinence had quite frightened her again returned to her plan of new decorations  cecilia amazed at this indifference to the state of her husbands affairs began to think it was her own duty to talk with her upon the subject and therefore after a silence so marked that mrs harrel enquired into its reason she said will you pardon me my dear friend if i own i am rather surprised to see you continue these preparations  lord why  because any fresh unnecessary expenses just now till mr harrel actually receives the money he talks of    why my dear the expense of such a thing as this is nothing in mr harrels affairs i assure you it will not be at all felt besides he expects money so soon that it is just the same as if he had it already  cecilia unwilling to be too officious began then to express her admiration of the goodness and generosity of mr arnott taking frequent occasion in the course of her praise to insinuate that those only can be properly liberal who are just and oeconomical  she had prepared no masquerade habit for this evening as mrs harrel by whose direction she was guided informed her it was not necessary for ladies to be masked at home and said she should receive her company herself in a dress which she might wear upon any other occasion mr harrel also and mr arnott made not any alteration in their appearance  at about eight oclock the business of the evening began and before nine there were so many masks that cecilia wished she had herself made one of the number as she was far more conspicuous in being almost the only female in a common dress than any masquerade habit could have made her the novelty of the scene however joined to the general air of gaiety diffused throughout the company shortly lessened her embarrassment and after being somewhat familiarized to the abruptness with which the masks approached her and the freedom with which they looked at or addressed her the first confusion of her situation subsided and in her curiosity to watch others she ceased to observe how much she was watched herself  her expectations of entertainment were not only fulfilled but surpassed the variety of dresses the madley of characters the quick succession of figures and the ludicrous mixture of groupes kept her attention unwearied while the conceited efforts at wit the total thoughtlessness of consistency and the ridiculous incongruity of the language with the appearance were incitements to surprise and diversion without end even the local cant of do you know me who are you and i know you with the sly pointing of the finger the arch nod of the head and the pert squeak of the voice though wearisome to those who frequent such assemblies were to her unhackneyed observation additional subjects of amusement  soon after nine oclock every room was occupied and the common crowd of regular masqueraders were dispersed through the various apartments dominos of no character and fancydresses of no meaning made as is usual at such meetings the general herd of the company for the rest the men were spaniards chimneysweepers turks watchmen conjurers and old women and the ladies shepherdesses orange girls circassians gipseys haymakers and sultanas  cecilia had as yet escaped any address beyond the customary enquiry of do you know me and a few passing compliments but when the rooms filled and the general crowd gave general courage she was attacked in a manner more pointed and singular  the very first mask who approached her seemed to have nothing less in view than preventing the approach of every other yet had he little reason to hope favor for himself as the person he represented of all others least alluring to the view was the devil he was black from head to foot save that two red horns seemed to issue from his forehead his face was so completely covered that the sight only of his eyes was visible his feet were cloven and in his right hand he held a wand the color of fire  waving this wand as he advanced toward cecilia he cleared a semicircular space before her chair thrice with the most profound reverence bowed to her thrice turned himself around with sundry grimaces and then fiercely planted himself at her side  cecilia was amused by his mummery but felt no great delight in his guardianship and after a short time arose with intention to walk to another place but the black gentleman adroitly moving round her held out his wand to obstruct her passage and therefore preferring captivity to resistance she was again obliged to seat herself  an hotspur who just then made his appearance was now strutting boldly toward her but the devil rushing furiously forwards placed himself immediately between them hotspur putting his arms akembo with an air of defiance gave a loud stamp with his right foot and then  marched into another room  the victorious devil ostentatiously waved his wand and returned to his station  mr arnott who had never moved two yards from cecilia knowing her too well to suppose she received any pleasure from being thus distinguished modestly advanced to offer his assistance in releasing her from eonfinement but the devil again describing a circle with his wand gave him three such smart raps on the head that his hair was disordered and his face covered with powder a general laugh succeeded and mr arnott too diffident to brave raillery or withstand shame retired in confusion  the black gentleman seemed now to have all authority in his own hands and his wand was brandished with more ferocity than ever no one again venturing to invade the domain he thought fit to appropriate for his own  at length however a don quixote appeared and every mask in the room was eager to point out to him the imprisonment of cecilia  this don quixote was accoutered with tolerable exactness according to the description of the admirable cervantes his armor was rusty his helmet was a barbers basin his shield a pewter dish and his lance an old sword fastened to a slim cane his figure tall and thin was well adapted to the character he represented and his mask which depictured a lean and haggard face worn with care yet fiery with crazy passions exhibited with propriety the most striking the knight of the doleful countenance  the complaints against the devil with which immediately and from all quarters he was assailed he heard with the most solemn taciturnity after which making a motion for general silence he stalked majestically toward cecilia but stopping short of the limits prescribed by her guard he kissed his spear in token of allegiance and then slowly dropping upon one knee began the following address most incomparable princess  thus humbly prostrate at the feet of your divine and ineffable beauty graciously permit the most pitiful of your servitors don quixote de la mancha from your high and tender grace to salute the fair boards which sustain your corporeal machine    then bending down his head he kissed the floor after which raising himself upon his feet he proceeded in his speech  report o most fair and unmatchable virgin daringly affirms that a certain discourteous person who calls himself the devil even now and in thwart of your fair inclinations keeps and detaineth your irradiant frame in hostile thraldom suffer then magnanimous and undiscribable lady that i the most grovelling of your unworthy vassals do sift the fair truth out of this foul sieve and obsequiously bending to your divine attractions conjure your highness veritably to inform me if that honorable chair which happily supports your terrestrial perfections contains the inimitable burden with the free and legal consent of your celestial spirit  here he ceased and cecilia who laughed at this characteristic address though she had not courage to answer it again made an effort to quit her place but again by the wand of her black persecutor was prevented  this little incident was answer sufficient for the valorous knight who indignantly exclaimed sublime lady  i beseech but of your exquisite mercy to refrain mouldering the clay composition of my unworthy body to impalpable dust by the refulgence of those bright stars vulgarly called eyes till i have lawfully wreaked my vengeance upon this unobliging caitiff for his most disloyal obstruction of your highnesses adorable pleasure    then bowing low he turned from her and thus addressed his intended antagonist uncourtly miscreant  the black garment which envellopeth thy most unpleasant person seems even of the most ravishing whiteness in compare of the black bile which floateth within thy sable exterior behold then my gauntlet yet ere i deign to be the instrument of thy extirpation o thou most mean and ignoble enemy that the honor of don quixote de la mancha may not be sullied by thy extinction i do here confer upon thee the honor of knighthood dubbing thee by my own sword don devil knight of the horrible physiognomy    he then attempted to strike his shoulder with his spear but the black gentleman adroitly eluding the blow defended himself with his wand a mock fight ensued conducted on both sides with admirable dexterity but cecilia less eager to view it than to become again a free agent made her escape into another apartment while the rest of the ladies though they almost all screamed jumped upon chairs and sofas to peep at the combat  in conclusion the wand of the knight of the horrible physiognomy was broken against the shield of the knight of the doleful countenance upon which don quixote called out victoria the whole room ecchoed the sound the unfortunate new knight retired abruptly into another apartment and the conquering don seizing the fragments of the weapon of his vanquished enemy went out in search of the lady for whose releasement he had fought and the moment he found her prostrating both himself and the trophies at her feet he again pressed the floor with his lips and then slowly arising repeated his reverences with added formality and without waiting her acknowledgments gravely retired  the moment he departed a minerva not stately nor austere not marching in warlike majesty but gay and airy  tripping on light fantastic toe ran up to cecilia and squeaked out do you know me  not answered she instantly recollecting miss larolles by your appearance i own but by your voice i think i can guess you  i was monstrous sorry returned the goddess without understanding this distinction that i was not at home when you called upon me pray how do you like my dress i assure you i think it is the prettiest here but do you know there is the most shocking thing in the world happened in the next room i really believe there is a common chimneysweeper got in i assure you its enough to frighten one to death for every time he moves the soot smells so you cannot think quite real soot i assure you only conceive how nasty i declare i wish with all my heart it would suffocate him  here she was interrupted by the reappearance of don devil who looking around him and perceiving that his antagonist was gone again advanced to cecilia not however with the authority of his first approach for with his wand he had lost much of his power but to recompense himself for this disgrace he had recourse to another method equally effectual for keeping his prey to himself for he began a growling so dismal and disagreeable that while many of the ladies and among the first the goddess of wisdom and courage ran away to avoid him the men all stood aloof to watch what next was to follow  cecilia now became seriously uneasy for she was made an object of general attention yet could neither speak nor be spoken to she could suggest no motive for behavior so whimsical though she imagined the only person who could have the assurance to practice it was sir robert floyer  after some time spent thus disagreeably a white domino who for a few minutes had been a very attentive spectator suddenly came forward and exclaiming  i will cross him though he blast me rushed upon the fiend and grasping one of his horns called out to a harlequin who stood near him harlequin do you fear to fight the devil  not i truly answered harlequin whose voice immediately betrayed young morris and who issuing from the crowd whirled himself round before the black gentleman with yet more agility than he had himself done before cecilia giving him from time to time many smart blows on his shoulders head and back with his wooden sword  the rage of don devil at this attack seemed somewhat beyond what a masquerade character rendered necessary he foamed at the mouth with resentment and defended himself with so much vehemence that he soon drove poor harlequin into another room but when he would have returned to his prey the genius of pantomime curbed but not subdued at the instigation of the white domino returned to the charge and by a perpetual rotation of attack and retreat kept him in constant employment pursuing him from room to room and teazing him without cessation or mercy  mean time cecilia delighted at being released hurried into a corner where she hoped to breathe and look on in quiet and the white domino having exhorted harlequin to torment the tormentor and keep him at bay followed her with congratulations upon her recovered freedom  it is you answered she i ought to thank for it which indeed i do most heartily i was so tired of confinement that my mind seemed almost as little at liberty as my person  your persecutor i presume said the domino is known to you  i hope so answered she because there is one man i suspect and i should be sorry to find there was another equally disagreeable  o depend upon it cried he there are many who would be happy to confine you in the same manner neither have you much cause for complaint you have doubtless been the aggressor and played this game yourself without mercy for i read in your face the captivity of thousands have you then any right to be offended at the spirit of retaliation which one out of such numbers has courage to exert in return  i protest cried cecilia i took you for my defender whence is it you are become my accuser  from seeing the danger to which my incautions knight errantry has exposed me i begin indeed to take you for a very mischievous sort of person and i fear the poor devil from whom i rescued you will be amply revenged for his disgrace by finding that the first use you make of your freedom is to doom your deliverer to bondage  here they were disturbed by the extreme loquacity of two opposite parties and listening attentively they heard from one side my angel fairest of creatures goddess of my heart uttered in accents of rapture while from the other the vociferation was so violent they could distinctly hear nothing  the white domino satisfied his curiosity by going to both parties and then returning to cecilia said can you conjecture who was making those soft speeches a shylock his knife all the time in his hand and his design doubtless to cut as ar the heart as possible while the loud cackling from the other side is owing to the riotous merriment of a noisy mentor when next i hear a disturbance i shall expect to see some simpering pythagoras stunned by his talkative disciples  to own the truth said cecilia the almost universal neglect of the characters assumed by these masquers has been the chief source of my entertainment this evening for at a place of this sort the next best thing to a character well supported is a character ridiculously burlesqued  you cannot then have wanted amusement returned the domino for among all the persons assembled in these apartments i have seen only three who have seemed conscious that any change but that of dress was necessary to disguise them  and pray who are those  a don quixote a schoolmaster and your friend the devil  o call him not my friend exclaimed cecilia for indeed in or out of that garb he is particularly my aversion   my friend then i will call him said the domino for so were he ten devils i must think him since i owe to him the honor of conversing with you and after all to give him his due to which you know he is even proverbially entitled he has shown such abilities in the performance of his part so much skill in the display of malice and so much perseverance in the art of tormenting that i cannot but respect his ingenuity and capacity and indeed if instead of an evil genius he had represented a guardian angel he could not have shown a more refined taste in his choice of an object to hover about  just then they were approached by a young haymaker to whom the white domino called out you look as gay and as brisk as if fresh from the hayfield after only half a days work pray how is it you pretty lasses find employment for the winter  how cried she pertly why the same as for the summer and pleased with her own readiness at repartee without feeling the ignorance it betrayed she tript lightly on  immediately after the schoolmaster mentioned by the white domino advanced to cecilia his dress was merely a long wrapping gown of green stuff a pair of red slippers and a woollen nightcap of the same color while as the symbol of his profession he held a rod in his hand  ah fair lady he cried how soothing were it to the austerity of my life how softening to the rigidity of my manners might i  without a breaking out of bounds which i ought to be the first to discourage and a confusion to all order for which the schoolboy should himself chastise his master be permitted to cast at your feet this emblem of my authority and to forget in the softness of your conversation all the roughness of discipline  no no cried cecilia i will not be answerable for such corruption of taste  this repulse answered he is just what i feared for alas under what pretense could a poor miserable country pedagogue presume to approach you should i examine you in the dead languages would not your living accents charm from me all power of reproof could i look at you and hear a false concord should i doom you to water gruel as a dunce would not my subsequent remorse make me want it myself as a madman were your fair hand spread out to me for correction should i help applying my lips to it instead of my rattan if i ordered you to be called up should i ever remember to have you sent back and if i commanded you to stand in a corner how should i forbear following you thither myself  cecilia who had no difficulty in knowing this pretended schoolmaster for mr gosport was readily beginning to propose conditions for according him her favor when their ears were assailed by a forced phthisical cough which they found proceeded from an apparent old woman who was a young man in disguise and whose hobbling gait grunting voice and most grievous asthmatic complaints seemed greatly enjoyed and applauded by the company  how true is it yet how inconsistent cried the white domino that while we all desire to live long we have all an horror of being old the figure now passing is not meant to ridicule any particular person nor to stigmatize any particular absurdity its sole view is to expose to contempt and derision the general and natural infirmities of age and the design is not more disgusting than impolitic for why while so carefully we guard from all approaches of death should we close the only avenues to happiness in long life respect and tenderness  cecilia delighted both by the understanding and humanity of her new acquaintance and pleased at being joined by mr gosport was beginning to be perfectly satisfied with her situation when creeping softly toward her she again perceived the black gentleman  ah cried she with some vexation here comes my old tormentor screen me from him if possible or he will again make me his prisoner  fear not cried the white domino he is an evil spirit and we will surely lay him if one spell fails we must try another  cecilia then perceiving mr arnott begged he would also assist in barricading her from the fiend who so obstinately pursued her  mr arnott most gratefully acceded to the proposal and the white domino who acted as commanding officer assigned to each his station he desired cecilia would keep quietly to her seat appointed the schoolmaster to be her guard on the left took possession himself of the opposite post and ordered mr arnott to stand centinal in front  this arrangement being settled the guards of the right and left wings instantly secured their places but while mr arnott was considering whether it were better to face the besieged or the enemy the archfoe rushed suddenly before him and laid himself down at the feet of cecilia  mr arnott extremely disconcerted began a serious expostulation upon the illbreeding of this behavior but the devil resting all excuse upon supporting his character only answered by growling  the white domino seemed to hesitate for a moment in what manner to conduct himself and with a quickness that marked his chagrin said to cecilia you told me you knew him  has he any right to follow you  if he thinks he has answered she a little alarmed by his question this is no time to dispute it  and then to avoid any hazard of altercation she discreetly forebore making further complaints preferring any persecution to seriously remonstrating with a man of so much insolence as the baronet  the schoolmaster laughing at the whole transaction only said and pray madam after playing the devil with all mankind what right have you to complain that one man plays the devil with you  we shall at least fortify you said the white domino from any other assailant no threeheaded cerberus could protect you more effectually but you will not therefore fancy yourself in the lower regions for if i mistake not the torment of three guardians is nothing new to you  and how said cecilia surprised should you know of my three guardians i hope i am not quite encompassed with evil spirits  no answered he you will find me as inoffensive as the hue of the domino i wear  and would i could add as insensible  this black gentleman said the schoolmaster who and very innocently i was going to call your blackguard has as noble and fiendlike a disposition as i remember to have seen for without even attempting to take any diversion himself he seems gratified to his hearts content in excluding from it the lady he serves  he does me an honor i could well dispense with said cecilia but i hope he has some secret satisfaction in his situation which pays him for its apparent inconvenience  here the black gentleman half raised himself and attempted to take her hand she started and with much displeasure drew it back he then growled and again sunk prostrate  this is a fiend said the schoolmaster who to himself says budge not let his conscience never so often say budge well fair lady your fortifications however may now be deemed impregnable since i with a flourish of my rod can keep off the young by recollection of the past and since the fiend with a jut of his foot may keep off the old from dread of the future  here a turk richly habited and resplendent with jewels stalked toward cecilia and having regarded her some time called out i have been looking hard about me the whole evening and faith i have seen nothing handsome before  the moment he opened his mouth his voice to her utter astonishment betrayed sir robert floyer mercy on me cried she aloud and pointing to the fiend who then can this possibly be  do you not know cried the white domino  i thought i had known with certainty answered she but i now find i was mistaken  he is a happy man said the schoolmaster sarcastically looking at the turk who has removed your suspicions only by appearing in another character  why what the deuce then exclaimed the turk have you taken that black dog there for me  before this question could be answered an offensive smell of soot making every body look around the room the chimneysweeper already mentioned by miss larolles was perceived to enter it every way he moved a passage was cleared for him as the company with general disgust retreated wherever he advanced he was short and seemed somewhat incommoded by his dress he held his sootbag over one arm and his shovel under the other as soon as he espied cecilia whose situation was such as to prevent her eluding him he hooted aloud and came stumping up to her ah ha he cried found at last then throwing down his shovel he opened the mouth of his bag and pointing waggishly to her head said come shall i pop you  a good place for naughty girls in i say poke in  cram you up the chimney  and then he put forth his sooty hands to reach her cap  cecilia though she instantly knew the dialect of her guardian mr briggs was not therefore the more willing to be so handled and started back to save herself from his touch the white domino also came forward and spread out his arms as a defense to her while the devil who was still before her again began to growl  ah ha cried the chimneysweeper laughing so did not know me poor duck will not hurt you dont be frightened nothing but old guardian all a joke and then patting her cheek with his dirty hand and nodding at her with much kindness pretty dove he added be of good heart shant be meddled with come to see after you heard of your tricks thought i would catch you  come opurpose  poor duck did not know me ha ha  good joke enough  what do you mean you dirty dog cried the turk by touching that lady  will not tell answered he not your business got a good right who cares for pearls nothing but french beads pointing with a sneer to his turban then again addressing cecilia fine doings he continued here is a place never saw the like before turn a mans noddle  all goings out no comings in wax candles in every room servants thick as mushrooms and where is the cash who is to pay the piper come to more than a guinea warrant master harrel thinks that nothing  a guinea contemptuously repeated the turk and what do you suppose a guinea will do  what why keep a whole family handsome a week  never spend so much myself no nor half neither  why then how the devil do you live do you beg  beg who should beg of you  got any thing to give are warm  take the trouble to speak more respectfully sir said the turk haughtily i see you are some low fellow and i shall not put up with your impudence  shall shall i say answered the chimneysweeper sturdily harkee my duck chucking cecilia under the chin dont be cajoled nick that spark never mind gold trappings none of his own all a takein hired for eighteen pence not worth a groat never set your heart on a fine outside nothing within bristol stones will not buy stock only wants to chouse you  what do you mean by that you little old scrub cried the imperious turk would you provoke me to soil my fingers by pulling that beastly snub nose for mr briggs had saved himself any actual mask by merely blacking his face with soot  beastly snub nose sputtered out the chimneysweeper in much wrath good nose enough dont want a better good as another mans where is the harm on it  how could this blackguard get in cried the turk i believe he is a mere common chimneysweeper out of the streets for he is all over dirt and filth i never saw such a dress at a masquerade before in my life  all the better returned the other would not change what do think it cost  cost why not a crown  a crown ha ha  a pot obeer little tom borrowed it had it of our own sweep said twas for himself i bid him a pint rascal would not take less  did your late uncle said the white domino in a low voice to cecilia choose for two of your guardians mr harrel and mr briggs to give you an early lesson upon the opposite errors of profusion and meanness  my uncle cried cecilia starting were you acquainted with my uncle  no said he for my happiness i knew him not  you would have owed no loss of happiness to an acquaintance with him said cecilia very seriously for he was one who dispensed to his friends nothing but good  perhaps so said the domino but i fear i should have found the good he dispensed through his niece not quite unmixed with evil  what is here cried the chimneysweeper stumbling over the fiend what is this black thing dont like it looks like the devil you shant stay with it carry you away take care of you myself  he then offered cecilia his hand but the black gentleman raising himself upon his knees before her paid her in dumb show the humblest devoirs yet prevented her from removing  ah ha cried the chimneysweeper significantly nodding his head smell a rat a sweetheart in disguise no bamboozling it will not do ant so soon put upon if you have got any thing to say tell me that is the way where is the cash got ever a rentall are warm that is the point are warm  the fiend without returning any answer continued his homage to cecilia at which the enraged chimneysweeper exclaimed come come with me will not be imposed upon an old fox  understand trap  he then again held out his hand but cecilia pointing to the fiend answered how can i come sir  show you the way cried he shovel him off and taking his shovel he very roughly set about removing him  the fiend then began a yell so horrid that it disturbed the whole company but the chimneysweeper only saying aye aye blacky growl away blacky  makes no odds   sturdily continued his work and as the fiend had no chance of resisting so coarse an antagonist without a serious struggle he was presently compelled to change his ground  warm work cried the victorious chimney sweeper taking off his wig and wiping his head with the sleeves of his dress pure warm work this  cecilia once again freed from her persecutor instantly quitted her place almost equally desirous to escape the haughty turk who was peculiarly her aversion and the facetious chimneysweeper whose vicinity either on account of his dress or his conversation was by no means desirable she was not however displeased that the white domino and the schoolmaster still continued to attend her  pray look said the white domino as they entered another apartment at that figure of hope is there any in the room half so expressive of despondency  the reason however answered the schoolmaster is obvious that light and beautiful silver anchor upon which she reclines presents an occasion irresistible for an attitude of elegant dejection and the assumed character is always given up where an opportunity offers to display any beauty or manifest any perfection in the dear proper person  but why said cecilia should she assume the character of hope could she not have been equally dejected and equally elegant as niobe or some tragedy queen  but she does not assume the character answered the schoolmaster she does not even think of it the dress is her object and that alone fills up all her ideas enquire of almost any body in the room concerning the persons they seem to represent and you will find their ignorance more gross than you can imagine they have not once thought upon the subject accident or convenience or caprice has alone directed their choice  a tall and elegant youth now approached them whose laurels and harp announced apollo the white domino immediately enquired of him if the noise and turbulence of the company had any chance of being stilled into silence and rapture by the divine music of the inspired god  no answered he pointing to the room in which was erected the new gallery and whence as he spoke issued the sound of an hautboy there is a flute playing there already  o for a midas cried the white domino to return to this leathereared god the disgrace he received from him  they now proceeded to the apartment which had been lately fitted up for refreshments and which was so full of company that they entered it with difficulty and here they were again joined by minerva who taking cecilias hand said lord how glad i am you have got away from that frightful black mask i cannot conceive who he is nobody can find out it is monstrous odd but he has not spoke a word all night and he makes such a shocking noise when people touch him that i assure you it is enough to put one in a fright  and pray cried the schoolmaster disguising his voice how came thou to take the helmet of minerva for a fools cap  lord i have not cried she innocently why the whole dress is minervas dont you see  my dear child answered he thou could as well with that little figure pass for a goliath as with that little wit for a pallas  their attention was now drawn from the goddess of wisdom to a mad edgar who so vehemently ran about the room calling out poor toms a cold that in a short time he was obliged to take off his mask from an effect not very delicate of the heat  soon after a gentleman desiring some lemonade whose toga spoke the consular dignity though his broken english betrayed a native of france the schoolmaster followed him and with reverence the most profound began to address him in latin but turning quick toward him he gayly said  monsieur jai lhonneur de representer ciceron le grand ciceron pere de sa patrie mais quoique jai cet honneur la je ne suis pas pedant  mon dieu monsieur je ne parle que le francois dans la bonne compagnie and politely bowing he went on  just then cecilia while looking about the room for mrs harrel felt herself suddenly pinched by the cheek and hastily turning round perceived again her friend the chimenysweeper who laughing cried only me dont be frightened have something to tell you  had no luck  got never a husband yet cannot find one looked all over too sharp as a needle not one to be had all catched up  i am glad to hear it sir said cecicia somewhat vexed by observing the white domino attentively listening and i hope therefore you will give yourself no farther trouble  pretty duck cried he chucking her under the chin never mind dont be cast down get one at last leave it to me nothing under a plum will not take up with less good by ducky good by must go home now  begin to be nodding  and then repeating his kind caresses he walked away  do you think then said the white domino more highly of mr briggs for discernment and taste than of any body  i hope not answered she for low indeed should i then think of the rest of the world  the commission with which he is charged returned the domino has then misled me i imagined discernment and taste might be necessary ingredients for making such a choice as your approbation would sanctify but perhaps his skill in guarding against any fraud or deduction in the stipulation he mentioned may be all that is requisite for the execution of his trust  i understand very well said cecilia a little hurt the severity of your meaning and if mr briggs had any commission but of his own suggestion it would fill me with shame and confusion but as that is not the case those at least are sensations which it cannot give me  my meaning cried the domino with some earnestness should i express it seriously would but prove to you the respect and admiration with which you have inspired me and if indeed as mr briggs hinted such a prize is to be purchased by riches i know not from what i have seen of its merit any sum i should think adequate to its value  you are determined i see said cecilia smiling to make most liberal amends for your asperity  a loud clack of tongues now interrupted their discourse and the domino at the desire of cecilia for whom he had procured a seat went forward to enquire what was the matter but scarce had he given up his place a moment before to her great mortification it was occupied by the fiend  again but with the same determined silence he had hitherto preserved he made signs of obedience and homage and her perplexity to conjecture who he could be or what were his motives for this persecution became the more urgent as they seemed the less likely to be satisfied but the fiend who was no other than mr monckton had every instant less and less encouragement to make himself known his plan had in nothing succeeded and his provocation at its failure had caused him the bitterest disappointment he had intended in the character of a tormentor not only to pursue and hover around her himself but he had also hoped in the same character to have kept at a distance all other admirers but the violence with which he had overacted his part by raising her disgust and the indignation of the company rendered his views wholly abortive while the consciousness of an extravagance for which if discovered he could assign no reason not liable to excite suspicions of his secret motives reduced him to guarding a painful and most irksome silence the whole evening and cecilia to whose unsuspicious mind the idea of mr monckton had never occurred added continually to the cruelty of his situation by an undisguised abhorrence of his assiduity as well as by a manifest preference to the attendance of the white domino all therefore that his disappointed scheme now left in his power was to watch her motions listen to her discourse and inflict occasionally upon others some part of the chagrin with which he was tormented himself  while they were in this situation harlequin in consequence of being ridiculed by the turk for want of agility offered to jump over the new desert table and desired to have a little space cleared to give room for his motions it was in vain the people who distributed the refreshments and who were placed at the other side of the table expostulated upon the danger of the experiment morris had a rage of enterprise untameable and therefore first taking a run he attempted the leap  the consequence was such as might naturally be expected he could not accomplish his purpose but finding himself falling imprudently caught hold of the lately erected awning and pulled it entirely upon his own head and with it the new contrived lights which in various forms were fixed to it and which all came down together  the mischief and confusion occasioned by this exploit were very alarming and almost dangerous those who were near the table suffered most by the crush but splinters of the glass flew yet further and as the room which was small had been only lighted up by lamps hanging from the awning it was now in total darkness except close to the door which was still illuminated from the adjoining apartments  the clamor of harlequin who was covered with glass papier machee lamps and oil the screams of the ladies the universal buz of tongues and the struggle between the frighted crowd which was enclosed to get out and the curious crowd from the other apartments to get in occasioned a disturbance and tumult equally noisy and confused but the most serious sufferer was the unfortunate fiend who being nearer the table than cecilia was so pressed upon by the numbers which poured from it that he found a separation unavoidable and was unable from the darkness and the throng to discover whether she was still in the same place or had made her escape into another  she had however encountered the white domino and under his protection was safely conveyed to a further part of the room her intention and desire were to quit it immediately but at the remonstrance of her conductor she consented to remain some time longer the conflict at the door said he will quite overpower you stay here but a few minutes and both parties will have struggled themselves tired and you may then go without difficulty mean time can you not by this faint light suppose me one of your guardians mr briggs for example or if he is too old for me mr harrel and entrust yourself to my care  you seem wonderfully well acquainted with my guardians said cecilia i cannot imagine how you have had your intelligence  nor can i answered the domino imagine how mr briggs became so particularly your favorite as to be entrusted with powers to dispose of you  you are mistaken indeed he is entrusted with no powers but such as his own fancy has suggested  but how has mr delvile offended you that with him only you seem to have no commerce or communication  mr delvile repeated cecilia still more surprised are you also acquainted with mr delvile  he is certainly a man of fashion continued the domino and he is also a man of honor surely then he would be more pleasant for confidence and consultation than one whose only notion of happiness is money whose only idea of excellence is avarice and whose only conception of sense is distrust  here a violent outcry again interrupted their conversation but not till cecilia had satisfied her doubts concerning the white domino by conjecturing he was mr belfield who might easily at the house of mr monckton have gathered the little circumstances of her situation to which he alluded and whose size and figure exactly resembled those of her new acquaintance  the author of the former disturbance was now the occasion of the present the fiend having vainly traversed the room in search of cecilia stumbled accidentally upon harlequin before he was freed from the relics of his own mischief and unable to resist the temptation of opportunity and the impulse of revenge he gave vent to the wrath so often excited by the blunders forwardness and tricks of morris and inflicted upon him with his own wooden sword which he seized for that purpose a chastisement the most serious and severe  poor harlequin unable to imagine any reason for this violent attack and already cut with the glass and bruised with the fall spared not his lungs in making known his disapprobation of such treatment but the fiend regardless either of his complaints or his resistance forbore not to belabour him till compelled by the entrance of people with lights and then after artfully playing sundry anticks under pretense of still supporting his character with a motion too sudden for prevention and too rapid for pursuit he escaped out of the room and hurrying down stairs threw himself into an hackney chair which conveyed him to a place where he privately changed his dress before he returned home bitterly repenting the experiment he had made and conscious too late that had he appeared in a character he might have avowed he could without impropriety have attended cecilia the whole evening but such is deservedly the frequent fate of cunning which while it plots surprise and detection of others commonly overshoots its mark and ends in its own disgrace  the introduction of the lights now making manifest the confusion which the frolic of harlequin had occasioned he was seized with such a dread of the resentment of mr harrel that forgetting blows bruises and wounds not one of which were so frightful to him as reproof he made the last exhibition of his agility by an abrupt and hasty retreat  he had however no reason for apprehension since in every thing that regarded expense mr harrel had no feeling and his lady had no thought  the rooms now began to empty very fast but among the few masks yet remaining cecilia again perceived don quixote and while in conjunction with the white domino she was allowing him the praise of having supported his character with more uniform propriety than any other person in the assembly she observed him taking off his mask for the convenience of drinking some lemonade and looking in his face found he was no other than mr belfield much astonished and more than ever perplexed she again turned to the white domino who seeing in her countenance a surprise of which he knew not the reason said half laughing you think perhaps i shall never be gone and indeed i am almost of the same opinion but what can i do instead of growing weary by the length of my stay my reluctance to shorten it increases with its duration and all the methods i take whether by speaking to you or looking at you with a view to be satiated only double my eagerness for looking and listening again i must go however and if i am happy i may perhaps meet with you again  though if i am wise i shall never seek you more  and then with the last stragglers that reluctantly disappeared he made his exit leaving cecilia greatly pleased with his conversation and his manners but extremely perplexed to account for his knowledge of her affairs and situation  the schoolmaster had already been gone some time  she was now earnestly pressed by the harrels and sir robert who still remained to send to a warehouse for a dress and accompany them to the pantheon but though she was not without some inclination to comply in the hope of further prolonging the entertainment of an evening from which she had received much pleasure she disliked the attendance of the baronet and felt averse to grant any request that he could make and therefore she begged they would excuse her and having waited to see their dresses which were very superb she retired to her own apartment  a great variety of conjecture upon all that had passed now and till the moment that she sunk to rest occupied her mind the extraordinary persecution of the fiend excited at once her curiosity and amazement while the knowledge of her affairs shown by the white domino surprised her not less and interested her more  chap iv an affray the next morning during breakfast cecilia was informed that a gentleman desired to speak with her she begged permission of mrs harrel to have him asked up stairs and was not a little surprised when he proved to be the same old gentleman whose singular exclamations had so much struck her at mr moncktons and at the rehearsal of artaserse  abruptly and with a stern aspect advancing to her you are rich he cried are you therefore worthless  i hope not answered she in some consternation while mrs harrel believing his intention was to rob them ran precipitately to the bell which she rang without ceasing till two or three servants hastened into the room by which time being less alarmed she only made signs to them to stay and stood quietly herself to wait what would follow  the old man without attending to her continued his dialogue with cecilia  know you then he said a blameless use of riches such a use as not only in the broad glare of day shall shine resplendent but in the darkness of midnight and stillness of repose shall give you reflections unimbittered and slumbers unbroken tell me know you this use  not so well perhaps answered she as i ought but i am very willing to learn better  begin then while yet youth and inexperience new to the callousness of power and affluence leave something good to work upon yesterday you saw the extravagance of luxury and folly to day look deeper and see and learn to pity the misery of disease and penury  he then put into her hand a paper which contained a most affecting account of the misery to which a poor and wretched family had been reduced by sickness and various other misfortunes  cecilia open as day to melting charity having hastily perused it took out her purse and offering to him three guineas said you must direct me sir what to give if this is insufficient  have thou so much heart cried he with emotion and has fortune though it has cursed thee with the temptation of prosperity not yet rooted from thy mind its native benevolence i return in part thy liberal contribution this taking one guinea doubles my expectations i will not by making thy charity distress thee accelerate the fatal hour of hardness and degeneracy  he was then going but cecilia following him said no take it all who should assist the poor if i will not rich without connections powerful without wants upon whom have they any claim if not upon me  true cried he receiving the rest and wise as true give therefore whilst yet thou have the heart to give and make in thy days of innocence and kindness some interest with heaven and the poor  and then he disappeared  why my dear cried mrs harrel what could induce you to give the man so much money dont you see he is crazy i dare say he would have been just as well contented with sixpence  i know not what he is said cecilia but his manners are not more singular than his sentiments are affecting and if he is actuated by charity to raise subscriptions for the indigent he can surely apply to no one who ought so readily to contribute as myself  mr harrel then came in and his lady most eagerly told him the transaction  scandalous he exclaimed why this is no better than being a housebreaker pray give orders never to admit him again three guineas i never heard so impudent a thing in my life indeed miss beverley you must be more discreet in future you will else be ruined before you know where you are  thus it is said cecilia half smiling that we can all lecture one another today you recommend economy to me yesterday i with difficulty forbore recommending it to you  nay answered he that was quite another matter expense incurred in the common way of a mans living is quite another thing to an extortion of this sort  it is another thing indeed said she but i know not that it is therefore a better  mr harrel made no answer and cecilia privately moralizing upon the different estimates of expense and economy made by the dissipated and the charitable soon retired to her own apartment determined firmly to adhere to her lately adopted plan and hoping by the assistance of her new and very singular monitor to extend her practice of doing good by enlarging her knowledge of distress  objects are however never wanting for the exercise of benevolence report soon published her liberality and those who wished to believe it failed not to enquire into its truth she was soon at the head of a little band of pensioners and never satisfied with the generosity of her donations found in a very short time that the common allowance of her guardians was scarce adequate to the calls of her munificence  and thus in acts of goodness and charity passed undisturbed another week of the life of cecilia but when the fervor of selfapprobation lost its novelty the pleasure with which her new plan was begun first subsided into tranquillity and then sunk into languor to a heart formed for friendship and affection the charms of solitude are very shortlived and though she had sickened of the turbulence of perpetual company she now wearied of passing all her time by herself and sighed for the comfort of society and the relief of communication but she saw with astonishment the difficulty with which this was to be obtained the endless succession of diversions the continual rotation of assemblies the numerousness of splendid engagements of which while every one complained every one was proud to boast so effectually impeded private meetings and friendly intercourse that which ever way she turned herself all commerce seemed impracticable but such as either led to dissipation or accidentally flowed from it  yet finding the error into which her ardour of reformation had hurried her and that a rigid seclusion from company was productive of a lassitude as little favorable to active virtue as dissipation itself she resolved to soften her plan and by mingling amusement with benevolence to try at least to approach that golden mean which like the philosophers stone always eludes our grasp yet always invites our wishes  for this purpose she desired to attend mrs harrel to the next opera that should be represented  the following saturday therefore she accompanied that lady and mrs mears to the haymarket escorted by mr arnott  they were very late the opera was begun and even in the lobby the crowd was so great that their passage was obstructed here they were presently accosted by miss larolles who running up to cecilia and taking her hand said lord you cannot conceive how glad i am to see you why my dear creature where have you hid yourself these twenty ages you are quite in luck in coming tonight i assure you it is the best opera we have had this season there is such a monstrous crowd there is no stirring we shant get in this half hour the coffeeroom is quite full only come and see is it not delightful  this intimation was sufficient for mrs harrel whose love of the opera was merely a love of company fashion and show and therefore to the coffeeroom she readily led the way  and here cecilia found rather the appearance of a brilliant assembly of ladies and gentlemen collected merely to see and to entertain one another than of distinct and casual parties mixing solely from necessity and waiting only for room to enter a theater  the first person that addressed them was captain aresby who with his usual delicate languishment smiled upon cecilia and softly whispering how divinely you look to night proceeded to pay his compliments to some other ladies  do pray now cried miss larolles observe mr meadows only just see where he has fixed himself in the very best place in the room and keeping the fire from every body i do assure you that is always his way and it is monstrous provoking for if ones ever so cold he lollops so that ones quite starved but you must know there is another thing he does that is quite as bad for if he gets a seat he never offers to move if he sees one sinking with fatigue and besides if one is waiting for ones carriage two hours together he makes it a rule never to stir a step to see for it only think how monstrous  these are heavy complaints indeed said cecilia looking at him attentively i should have expected from his appearance a very different account of his gallantry for he seems dressed with more studied elegance than any body here  o yes cried miss larolles he is the sweetest dresser in the world he has the most delightful taste you can conceive nobody has half so good a fancy i assure you it is a great thing to be spoke to by him we are all of us quite angry when he will not take any notice of us  is your anger said cecilia laughing in honor of himself or of his coat  why lord dont you know all this time that he is an ennuye  i know at least answered cecilia that he would soon make one of me  o but one is never affronted with an ennuye if he is ever so provoking because one always knows what it means  is he agreeable  why to tell you the truth  but pray now dont mention it  i think him most excessive disagreeable he yawns in ones face every time one looks at him i assure you sometimes i expect to see him fall fast asleep while i am talking to him for he is so immensely absent he dont hear one half that one says only conceive how horrid  but why then do you encourage him why do you take any notice of him  o every body does i assure you else i would not for the world but he is so courted you have no idea however of all things let me advise you never to dance with him i did once myself and i declare i was quite distressed to death the whole time for he was taken with such a fit of absence he knew nothing he was about sometimes skipping and jumping with all the violence in the world just as if he only danced for exercise and sometimes standing quite still or lolling against the wainscoat and gaping and taking no more notice of me than if he had never seen me in his life  the captain now again advancing to cecilia said so you would not do us the honor to try the masquerade at the pantheon however i hear you had a very brilliant spectacle at mr harrels i was quite au desespoir that i could not get there i did mon possible but it was quite beyond me  we should have been very happy said mrs harrel to have seen you i assure you we had some excellent masks  so i have heard partout and i am reduced to despair that i could not have the honor of sliding in but i was accable with affairs all day nothing could be so mortifying  cecilia now growing very impatient to hear the opera begged to know if they might not make a trial to get into the pit  i fear said the captain smiling as they passed him without offering any assistance you will find it extreme petrifying for my part i confess i am not upon the principle of crowding  the ladies however accompanied by mr arnott made the attempt and soon found according to the custom of report that the difficulty for the pleasure of talking of it had been considerably exaggerated they were separated indeed but their accommodation was tolerably good  cecilia was much vexed to find the first act of the opera almost over but she was soon still more dissatisfied when she discovered that she had no chance of hearing the little which remained the place she had happened to find vacant was next to a party of young ladies who were so earnestly engaged in their own discourse that they listened not to a note of the opera and so infinitely diverted with their own witticisms that their tittering and loquacity allowed no one in their vicinity to hear better than themselves cecilia tried in vain to confine her attention to the singers she was distant from the stage and to them she was near and her fruitless attempts all ended in chagrin and impatience  at length she resolved to make an effort for entertainment in another way and since the expectations which brought her to the opera were destroyed to try by listening to her fair neighbors whether those who occasioned her disappointment could make her any amends  for this purpose she turned to them wholly yet was at first in no little perplexity to understand what was going forward since so universal was the eagerness for talking and so insurmountable the antipathy to listening that every one seemed to have her wishes bounded by a continual utterance of words without waiting for any answer or scarce even desiring to be heard  but when somewhat more used to their dialect and manner she began better to comprehend their discourse wretchedly indeed did it supply to her the loss of the opera she heard nothing but descriptions of trimmings and complaints of hairdressers hints of conquest that teemed with vanity and histories of engagements which were inflated with exultation  at the end of the act by the crowding forward of the gentlemen to see the dance mrs harrel had an opportunity of making room for her by herself and she had then some reason to expect hearing the rest of the opera in peace for the company before her consisting entirely of young men seemed even during the dance fearful of speaking lest their attention should be drawn for a moment from the stage  but to her infinite surprise no sooner was the second act begun than their attention ended they turned from the performers to each other and entered into a whispering but gay conversation which though not loud enough to disturb the audience in general kept in the ears of their neighbors a buzzing which interrupted all pleasure from the representation of this effect of their gaiety it seemed uncertain whether they were conscious but very evident that they were totally careless  the desperate resource which she had tried during the first act of seeking entertainment from the very conversation which prevented her enjoying it was not now even in her power for these gentlemen though as negligent as the young ladies had been whom they disturbed were much more cautious whom they instructed their language was ambiguous and their terms to cecilia were unintelligible their subjects indeed required some discretion being nothing less than a ludicrous calculation of the age and duration of jointured widows and of the chances and expectations of unmarried young ladies  but what more even than their talking provoked her was finding that the moment the act was over when she cared not if their vociferation had been incessant one of them called out come be quiet the dance is begun and then they were again all silent attention  in the third act however she was more fortunate the gentlemen again changed their places and they were succeeded by others who came to the opera not to hear themselves but the performers and as soon as she was permitted to listen the voice of pacchierotti took from her all desire to hear any thing but itself  during the last dance she was discovered by sir robert floyer who sauntering down fops alley stationed himself by her side and whenever the figurante relieved the principal dancers turned his eyes from the stage to her face as better worth his notice and equally destined for his amusement  mr monckton too who for some time had seen and watched her now approached he had observed with much satisfaction that her whole mind had been intent upon the performance yet still the familiarity of sir robert floyers admiration disturbed and perplexed him he determined therefore to make an effort to satisfy his doubts by examining into his intentions and taking him apart before the dance was quite over well he said who is so handsome here as harrels ward  yes answered he calmly she is handsome but i dont like her expression  no why what is the fault of it  proud cursed proud it is not the sort of woman i like if one says a civil thing to her she only wishes one at the devil for ones pains  o you have tried her then have you why you are not in general much given to say civil things  yes you know i said something of that sort to her once about juliet at the rehearsal was not you by  what then was that all and did you imagine one compliment would do your business with her  o hang it who ever dreams of complimenting the women now that is all at an end  you will not find she thinks so though for as you well say her pride is insufferable and i who have long known her can assure you it does not diminish upon intimacy  perhaps not  but there is very pretty picking in  000 l per annum one would not think much of a little encumbrance upon such an estate  are you quite sure the estate is so considerable report is mightily given to magnify  o i have pretty good intelligence though after all i dont know but i may be off she will take a confounded deal of time and trouble  monckton too much a man of interest and of the world to cherish that delicacy which covets universal admiration for the object of it is fondness then artfully enlarged upon the obstacles he already apprehended and insinuated such others as he believed would be most likely to intimidate him but his subtlety was lost upon the impenetrable baronet who possessed that hard insensibility which obstinately pursues its own course deaf to what is said and indifferent to what is thought  meanwhile the ladies were now making way to the coffeeroom though very slowly on account of the crowd and just as they got near the lobby cecilia perceived mr belfield who immediately making himself known to her was offering his service to hand her out of the pit when sir robert floyer not seeing or not heeding him pressed forward and said will you let me have the honor miss beverley of taking care of you  cecilia to whom he grew daily more disagreeable coldly declined his assistance while she readily accepted that which had first been offered her by mr belfield  the haughty baronet extremely nettled forced his way on and rudely stalking up to mr belfield motioned with his hand for room to pass him and said make way sir  make way for me sir cried belfield opposing him with one hand while with the other he held cecilia  you sir and who are you sir demanded the baronet disdainfully  of that sir i shall give you an account whenever you please answered belfield with equal scorn  what the devil do you mean sir  nothing very difficult to be understood replied belfield and attempted to draw on cecilia who much alarmed was shrinking back  sir robert then swelling with rage reproachfully turned to her and said will you suffer such an impertinent fellow as that miss beverley to have the honor of taking your hand  belfield with great indignation demanded what he meant by the term impertinent fellow and sir robert yet more insolently repeated it cecilia extremely shocked earnestly besought them both to be quiet but belfield at the repetition of this insult hastily let go her hand and put his own upon his sword while sir robert taking advantage of his situation in being a step higher than his antagonist fiercely pushed him back and descended into the lobby  belfield enraged beyond endurance instantly drew his sword and sir robert was preparing to follow his example when cecilia in an agony of fright called out good heaven will nobody interfere and then a young man forcing his way through the crowd exclaimed for shame for shame gentlemen is this a place for such violence  belfield endeavoring to recover himself put up his sword and though in a voice half choked with passion said i thank you sir i was off my guard i beg pardon of the whole company  then walking up to sir robert he put into his hand a card with his name and direction saying with you sir i shall be happy to settle what apologies are necessary at your first leisure and hurried away  sir robert exclaiming aloud that he should soon teach him to whom he had been so impertinent was immediately going to follow him when the affrighted cecilia again called out aloud oh stop him  good god will nobody stop him   the rapidity with which this angry scene had passed had filled her with amazement and the evident resentment of the baronet upon her refusing his assistance gave her an immediate consciousness that she was herself the real cause of the quarrel while the manner in which he was preparing to follow mr belfield convinced her of the desperate scene which was likely to succeed fear therefore overcoming every other feeling forced from her this exclamation before she knew what she said  the moment she had spoken the young man who had already interposed again rushed forward and seizing sir robert by the arm warmly remonstrated against the violence of his proceedings and being presently seconded by other gentlemen almost compelled him to give up his design  then hastening to cecilia be not alarmed madam he cried all is over and every body is safe  cecilia finding herself thus addressed by a gentleman she had never before seen felt extremely ashamed of having rendered her interest in the debate so apparent she courtsied to him in some confusion and taking hold of mrs harrels arm hurried her back into the pit in order to quit a crowd of which she now found herself the principal object  curiosity however was universally excited and her retreat served but to inflame it some of the ladies and most of the gentlemen upon various pretenses returned into the pit merely to look at her and in a few minutes the report was current that the young lady who had been the occasion of the quarrel was dying with love for sir robert floyer  mr monckton who had kept by her side during the whole affair felt thunderstruck by the emotion she had shown mr arnott too who had never quitted her wished himself exposed to the same danger as sir robert so that he might be honored with the same concern but they were both too much the dupes of their own apprehensions and jealousy to perceive that what they instantly imputed to fondness proceeded simply from general humanity accidentally united with the consciousness of being accessory to the quarrel  the young stranger who had officiated as mediator between the disputants in a few moments followed her with a glass of water which he had brought from the coffeeroom begging her to drink it and compose herself  cecilia though she declined his civility with more vexation than gratitude perceived as she raised her eyes to thank him that her new friend was a young man very strikingly elegant in his address and appearance  miss larolles next who with her party came back into the pit ran up to cecilia crying o my dear creature what a monstrous shocking thing you have no idea how i am frightened do you know i happened to be quite at the further end of the coffeeroom when it began and i could not get out to see what was the matter for ten ages only conceive what a situation  would your fright then have been less said cecilia had you been nearer the danger  o lord no for when i came within sight i was fifty times worse i gave such a monstrous scream that it quite made mr meadows start i dare say he will tell me of it these hundred years but really when i saw them draw their swords i thought i should have died i was so amazingly surprised you have no notion  here she was interrupted by the reappearance of the active stranger who again advancing to cecilia said i am in doubt whether the efforts i make to revive will please or irritate you but though you rejected the last cordial i ventured to present you perhaps you will look with a more favorable eye toward that of which i am now the herald  cecilia then casting her eyes around saw that he was followed by sir robert floyer full of displeasure both at this introduction and at his presence she turned hastily to mr arnott and entreated him to enquire if the carriage was not yet ready  sir robert looking at her with all the exultation of newraised vanity said with more softness than he had ever before addressed her have you been frightened  every body i believe was frightened answered cecilia with an air of dignity intended to check his rising expectations  there was no sort of cause answered he the fellow did not know whom he spoke too that was all  lord sir robert cried miss larolles how could you be so shocking as to draw your sword you cannot conceive how horrid it looked  why i did not draw my sword cried he i only had my hand on the hilt  lord did not you indeed well every body said you did and i am sure i thought i saw fiveandtwenty swords all at once i thought one of you would be killed every moment it was horrid disagreeable i assure you  sir robert was now called away by some gentlemen and mr monckton earnest to be better informed of cecilias real sentiments said with affected concern at present this matter is merely ridiculous i am sorry to think in how short a time it may become more important  surely cried cecilia with quickness some of their friends will interfere surely upon so trifling a subject they will not be so mad so inexcusable as to proceed to more serious resentment  which ever of them said the stranger is most honored by this anxiety will be mad indeed to risk a life so valued  cannot you mr monckton continued cecilia too much alarmed to regard this insinuation speak with mr belfield you are acquainted with him i know is it impossible you can follow him  i will with pleasure do whatever you wish but still if sir robert    o as to sir robert mr harrel i am very sure will undertake him i will try to see him tonight myself and entreat him to exert all his influence  ah madam cried the stranger archly and lowering his voice those french beads and bristol stones have not i find shone in vain  at these words cecilia recognized her white domino acquaintance at the masquerade she had before recollected his voice but was too much perturbed to consider where or when she had heard it  if mr briggs continued he does not speedily come forth with his plum friend before the glittering of swords and spears is joined to that of jewels the glare will be so resplendent that he will fear to come within the influence of its rays though perhaps he may only think the stronger the light the better he shall see to count his guineas for as   in ten thousand pounds  ten thousand charms are centred in an hundred thousand the charms may have such magic power that he may defy the united efforts of tinsel and knighterrantry to deliver you from the golden spell  here the captain advancing to cecilia said i have been looking for you in vain partout but the crowd has been so accablant i was almost reduced to despair give me leave to hope you are now recovered from the horreur of this little fracas  mr arnott then brought intelligence that the carriage was ready cecilia glad to be gone instantly hastened to it and as she was conducted by mr monckton most earnestly entreated him to take an active part in endeavoring to prevent the fatal consequences with which the quarrel seemed likely to terminate  chap v a fashionable friend as soon as they returned home cecilia begged mrs harrel not to lose a moment before she tried to acquaint mr harrel with the state of the affair but that lady was too helpless to know in what manner to set about it she could not tell where he was she could not conjecture where he might be  cecilia then rang for his own man and upon enquiry heard that he was in all probability at brookess in st jamessstreet  she then begged mrs harrel would write to him  mrs harrel knew not what to say  cecilia therefore equally quick in forming and executing her designs wrote to him herself and entreated that without losing an instant he would find out his friend sir robert floyer and endeavor to effect an accommodation between him and mr belfield with whom he had had a dispute at the operahouse  the man soon returned with an answer that mr harrel would not fail to obey her commands  she determined to sit up till he came home in order to learn the event of the negotiation she considered herself as the efficient cause of the quarrel yet scarce knew how or in what to blame herself the behavior of sir robert had always been offensive to her she disliked his manners and detested his boldness and she had already shown her intention to accept the assistance of mr belfield before he had followed her with an offer of his own she was uncertain indeed whether he had remarked what had passed but she had reason to think that so circumstanced to have changed her purpose would have been construed into an encouragement that might have authorized his future presumption of her favor all she could find to regret with regard to herself was wanting the presence of mind to have refused the civilities of both  mrs harrel though really sorry at the state of the affair regarded herself as so entirely unconcerned in it that easily wearied when out of company she soon grew sleepy and retired to her own room  the anxious cecilia hoping every instant the return of mr harrel sat up by herself but it was not till near four oclock in the morning that he made his appearance  well sir cried she the moment she saw him i fear by your coming home so late you have had much trouble but i hope it has been successful  great however was her mortification when he answered that he had not even seen the baronet having been engaged himself in so particular a manner that he could not possibly break from his party till past three oclock at which time he drove to the house of sir robert but heard that he was not yet come home  cecilia though much disgusted by such a specimen of insensibility toward a man whom he pretended to call his friend would not leave him till he had promised to arise as soon as it was light and make an effort to recover the time lost  she was now no longer surprised either at the debts of mr harrel or at his particular occasions for money she was convinced he spent half the night in gaming and the consequences however dreadful were but natural that sir robert floyer also did the same was a matter of much less importance to her but that the life of any man should through her means be endangered disturbed her inexpressibly  she went however to bed but arose again at six oclock and dressed herself by candle light in an hours time she sent to enquire if mr harrel was stirring and hearing he was asleep gave orders to have him called yet he did not rise till eight oclock nor could all her messages or expostulations drive him out of the house till nine  he was scarcely gone before mr monckton arrived who now for the first time had the satisfaction of finding her alone  you are very good for coming so early cried she have you seen mr belfield have you had any conversation with him  alarmed at her eagerness and still more at seeing by her looks the sleepless night she had passed he made at first no reply and when with increasing impatience she repeated her question he only said has belfield ever visited you since he had the honor of meeting you at my house  no never  have you seen him often in public  no i have never seen him at all but the evening mrs harrel received masks and last night at the opera  is it then for the safety of sir robert you are so extremely anxious  it is for the safety of both the cause of their quarrel was so trifling that i cannot bear to think its consequence should be serious  but do you not wish better to one of them than to the other  as a matter of justice i do but not from any partiality sir robert was undoubtedly the aggressor and mr belfield though at first too fiery was certainly ill used  the candor of this speech recovered mr monckton from his apprehensions and carefully observing her looks while he spoke he gave her the following account  that he had hastened to belfields lodgings the moment he left the operahouse and after repeated denials absolutely forced himself into his room where he was quite alone and in much agitation he conversed with him for more than an hour upon the subject of the quarrel but found he so warmly resented the personal insult given him by sir robert that no remonstrance had any effect in making him alter his resolution of demanding satisfaction  and could you bring him to consent to no compromise before you left him cried cecilia  no for before i got to him  the challenge had been sent  the challenge good heaven  and do you know the event  i called again this morning at his lodgings but he was not returned home  and was it impossible to follow him were there no means to discover whither he was gone  none to elude all pursuit he went out before any body in the house was stirring and took his servant with him  have you then been to sir robert  i have been to cavendishsquare but there it seems he has not appeared all night i traced him through his servants from the opera to a gaminghouse where i found he had amused himself till this morning  the uneasiness of cecilia now increased every moment and mr monckton seeing he had no other chance of satisfying her offered his service to go again in search of both the gentlemen and endeavor to bring her better information she accepted the proposal with gratitude and he departed  soon after she was joined by mr arnott who though seized with all the horrors of jealousy at sight of her apprehensions was so desirous to relieve them that without even making any merit of obliging her he almost instantly set out upon the same errand that employed mr monckton and determined not to mention his design till he found whether it would enable him to bring her good tidings  he was scarce gone when she was told that mr delvile begged to have the honor of speaking to her surprised at this condescension she desired he might immediately be admitted but much was her surprise augmented when instead of seeing her ostentatious guardian she again beheld her masquerade friend the white domino  he entreated her pardon for an intrusion neither authorized by acquaintance nor by business though somewhat he hoped palliated by his near connection with one who was privileged to take an interest in her affairs and then hastening to the motives which had occasioned his visit when i had the honor he said of seeing you last night at the operahouse the dispute which had just happened between two gentlemen seemed to give you an uneasiness which could not but be painful to all who observed it and as among that number i was not the least moved you will forgive i hope my eagerness to be the first to bring you intelligence that nothing fatal has happened or is likely to happen  you do me sir said cecilia much honor and indeed you relieve me from a suspense extremely disagreeable the accommodation i suppose was brought about this morning  i find answered he smiling you now expect too much but hope is never so elastic as when it springs from the ruins of terror  what then is the matter are they at last not safe  yes perfectly safe but i cannot tell you they have never been in danger  well if it is now over i am contented but you will very much oblige me sir if you will inform me what has passed  you oblige me madam by the honor of your commands i saw but too much reason to apprehend that measures the most violent would follow the affray of last night yet as i found that the quarrel had been accidental and the offense unpremeditated i thought it not absolutely impossible that an expeditious mediation might effect a compromise at least it was worth trying for though wrath slowly kindled or long nourished is sullen and intractable the sudden anger that has not had time to impress the mind with a deep sense of injury will when gently managed be sometimes appeased with the same quickness it is excited i hoped therefore that some trifling concession from sir robert as the aggressor    ah sir cried cecilia that i fear was not to be obtained  not by me i must own he answered but i was not willing to think of the difficulty and therefore ventured to make the proposal nor did i leave the operahouse till i had used every possible argument to persuade sir robert an apology would neither stain his courage nor his reputation but his spirit brooked not the humiliation  spirit cried cecilia how mild a word what then could poor mr belfield resolve upon  that i believe took him very little time to decide i discovered by means of a gentleman at the opera who was acquainted with him where he lived and i waited upon him with an intention to offer my services toward settling the affair by arbitration for since you call him poor mr belfield i think you will permit me without offense to his antagonist to own that his gallantry though too impetuous for commendation engaged me in his interest  i hope you dont think cried cecilia that an offense to his antagonist must necessarily be an offense to me  whatever i may have thought answered he looking at her with evident surprise i certainly did not wish that a sympathy offensive and defensive had been concluded between you i could not however gain access to mr belfield last night but the affair dwelt upon my mind and this morning i called at his lodging as soon as it was light  how good you have been cried cecilia your kind offices have not i hope all proved ineffectual  so valourous a don quixote returned he laughing certainly merited a faithful esquire he was however gone out and nobody knew whither about half an hour ago i called upon him again he was then just returned home  well sir  i saw him the affair was over and in a short time he will be able if you will allow him so much honor to thank you for these enquiries  he is then wounded  he is a little hurt but sir robert is perfectly safe belfield fired first and missed the baronet was not so successless  i am grieved to hear it indeed and where is the wound  the ball entered his right side and the moment he felt it he fired his second pistol in the air this i heard from his servant he was brought home carefully and slowly no surgeon had been upon the spot but one was called to him immediately i stayed to enquire his opinion after the wound had been dressed he told me he had extracted the ball and assured me mr belfield was not in any danger your alarm madam last night which had always been present to me then encouraged me to take the liberty of waiting upon you for i concluded you could yet have had no certain intelligence and thought it best to let the plain and simple fact outrun the probable exaggeration of rumor  cecilia thanked him for his attention and mrs harrel then making her appearance he arose and said had my father known the honor i have had this morning of waiting upon miss beverley i am sure i should have been charged with his compliments and such a commission would somewhat have lessened the presumption of this visit but i feared lest while i should be making interest for my credentials the pretense of my embassy might be lost and other couriers less scrupulous might obtain previous audiences and anticipate my dispatches  he then took his leave  this white domino at last then said cecilia is the son of mr delvile and thence the knowledge of my situation which gave me so much surprise  a son how infinitely unlike his father  yes said mrs harrel and as unlike his mother too for i assure you she is more proud and haughty even than the old gentleman i hate the very sight of her for she keeps every body in such awe that there is nothing but restraint in her presence but the son is a very pretty young man and much admired though i have only seen him in public for none of the family visit here  mr monckton who now soon returned was not a little surprised to find that all the intelligence he meant to communicate was already known and not the more pleased to hear that the white domino to whom before he owed no good will had thus officiously preceded him  mr arnott who also came just after him had been so little satisfied with the result of his enquiries that from the fear of increasing cecilias uneasiness he determined not to make known whither he had been but he soon found his forbearance was of no avail as she was already acquainted with the duel and its consequences yet his unremitting desire to oblige her urged him twice in the course of the same day to again call at mr belfields lodgings in order to bring her thence fresh and unsolicited intelligence  before breakfast was quite over miss larolles out of breath with eagerness came to tell the news of the duel in her way to church as it was sunday morning and soon after mrs mears who also was followed by other ladies brought the same account which by all was addressed to cecilia with expressions of concern that convinced her to her infinite vexation she was generally regarded as the person chiefly interested in the accident  mr harrel did not return till late but then seemed in very high spirits miss beverley he cried i bring you news that will repay all your fright sir robert is not only safe but is come off conqueror  i am very sorry sir answered cecilia extremely provoked to be thus congratulated that any body conquered or any body was vanquished  there is no need for sorrow cried mr harrel or for any thing but joy for he has not killed his man the victory therefore will neither cost him a flight nor a trial today he means to wait upon you and lay his laurels at your feet  he means then to take very fruitless trouble said cecilia for i have not any ambition to be so honored  ah miss beverley returned he laughing this will not do now it might have passed a little while ago but it will not do now i promise you  cecilia though much displeased by this accusation found that disclaiming it only excited further raillery and therefore prevailed upon herself to give him a quiet hearing and scarce any reply  at dinner when sir robert arrived the dislike she had originally taken to him increased already into disgust by his behavior the preceding evening was now fixed into the strongest aversion by the horror she conceived of his fierceness and the indignation she felt excited by his arrogance he seemed from the success of this duel to think himself raised to the highest pinnacle of human glory triumph sat exulting on his brow he looked down on whoever he deigned to look at all and showed that he thought his notice an honor however imperious the manner in which it was accorded  upon cecilia however he cast an eye of more complacency he now believed her subdued and his vanity revelled in the belief her anxiety had so thoroughly satisfied him of her love that she had hardly the power left to undeceive him her silence he only attributed to admiration her coldness to fear and her reserve to shame  sickened by insolence so undisguised and unauthorised and incensed at the triumph of his successful brutality cecilia with pain kept her seat and with vexation reflected upon the necessity she was under of passing so large a portion of her time in company to which she was so extremely averse  after dinner when mrs harrel was talking of her party for the evening of which cecilia declined making one sir robert with a sort of proud humility that half feared rejection and half proclaimed an indifference to meeting it said i dont much care for going further myself if miss beverley will give me the honor of taking my tea with her  cecilia regarding him with much surprise answered that she had letters to write into the country which would confine her to her own room for the rest of the evening the baronet looking at his watch instantly cried faith that is very fortunate for i have just recollected an engagement at the other end of the town which had slipped my memory  soon after they were all gone cecilia received a note from mrs delvile begging the favor of her company the next morning to breakfast she readily accepted the invitation though she was by no means prepared by the character she had heard of her to expect much pleasure from an acquaintance with that lady  chap vi a family party cecilia the next morning between nine and ten oclock went to st jamessquare she found nobody immediately ready to receive her but in a short time was waited upon by mr delvile  after the usual salutations miss beverley he said i have given express orders to my people that i may not be interrupted while i have the pleasure of passing some minutes in conversation with you before you are presented to mrs delvile  and then with an air of solemnity he led her to a seat and having himself taken possession of another continued his speech  i have received information from authority which i cannot doubt that the indiscretion of certain of your admirers last saturday at the operahouse occasioned a disturbance which to a young woman of delicacy i should imagine must be very alarming now as i consider myself concerned in your fame and welfare from regarding you as my ward i think it is incumbent upon me to make enquiries into such of your affairs as become public for i should feel in some measure disgraced myself should it appear to the world while you are under my guardianship that there was any want of propriety in the direction of your conduct  cecilia not much flattered by this address gravely answered that she fancied the affair had been misrepresented to him  i am not much addicted he replied to give ear to any thing lightly you must therefore permit me to enquire into the merits of the cause and then to draw my own inferences and let me at the same time assure you there is no other young lady who has any right to expect such an attention from me i must begin by begging you to inform me upon what grounds the two gentlemen in question for such by courtesy i presume they are called thought themselves entitled publicly to dispute your favor  my favor sir cried cecilia much amazed  my dear said he with a complacency meant to give her courage i know the question is difficult for a young lady to answer but be not abashed i should be sorry to distress you and mean to the utmost of my power to save your blushes do not therefore fear me consider me as your guardian and assure yourself i am perfectly well disposed to consider you as my ward acquaint me then freely what are the pretensions of these gentlemen  to me sir they have i believe no pretensions at all  i see you are shy returned he with increasing gentleness i see you cannot be easy with me and when i consider how little you are accustomed to me i do not wonder but pray take courage i think it necessary to inform myself of your affairs and therefore i beg you will speak to me with freedom  cecilia more and more mortified by this humiliating condescension again assured him he had been misinformed and was again though discredited praised for her modesty when to her great relief they were interrupted by the entrance of her friend the white domino  mortimer said mr delvile i understand you have already had the pleasure of seeing this young lady  yes sir he answered i have more than once had that happiness but i have never had the honor of being introduced to her  miss beverley then said the father i must present to you mr mortimer delvile my son and mortimer in miss beverley i desire you will remember that you respect a ward of your fathers  i will not sir answered he forget an injunction my own inclinations had already outrun  mortimer delvile was tall and finely formed his features though not handsome were full of expression and a noble openness of manners and address spoke the elegance of his education and the liberality of his mind  when this introduction was over a more general conversation took place till mr delvile suddenly rising said to cecilia you will pardon me miss beverley if i leave you for a few minutes one of my tenants sets out tomorrow morning for my estate in the north and he has been two hours waiting to speak with me but if my son is not particularly engaged i am sure he will be so good as to do the honors of the house till his mother is ready to receive you  and then graciously waving his hand he quitted the room  my father cried young delvile has left me an office which could i execute it as perfectly as i shall willingly would be performed without a fault  i am very sorry said cecilia that i have so much mistaken your hour of breakfast but let me not be any restraint upon you i shall find a book or a newspaper or something to fill up the time till mrs delvile honors me with a summons  you can only be a restraint upon me answered he by commanding me from your presence i breakfasted long ago and am now just come from mr belfield i had the pleasure this morning of being admitted into his room  and how sir did you find him  not so well i fear as he thinks himself but he was in high spirits and surrounded by his friends whom he was entertaining with all the gaiety of a man in full health and entirely at his ease though i perceived by the frequent changes of his countenance signs of pain and indisposition that made me however pleased with his conversation think it necessary to shorten my own visit and to hint to those who were near me the propriety of leaving him quiet  did you see his surgeon sir  no but he told me he should only have one dressing more of his wound and then get rid of the whole business by running into the country  were you acquainted with him sir before this accident  no not at all but the little i have seen of him has strongly interested me in his favor at mr harrels masquerade where i first met with him i was extremely entertained by his humor  though there perhaps as i had also the honor of first seeing miss beverley i might be too happy to feel much difficulty in being pleased and even at the opera he had the advantage of finding me in the same favorable disposition as i had long distinguished you before i had taken any notice of him i must however confess i did not think his anger that evening quite without provocation  but i beg your pardon i may perhaps be mistaken and you who know the whole affair must undoubtedly be better able to account for what happened  here he fixed his eyes upon cecilia with a look of curiosity that seemed eager to penetrate into her sentiments of the two antagonists  no certainly she answered he had all the provocation that illbreeding could give him  and do you madam cried he with much surprise judge of this matter with such severity  no not with severity simply with candor  with candor alas then poor sir robert severity were not half so bad a sign for him  a servant now came in to acquaint cecilia that mrs delvile waited breakfast for her  this summons was immediately followed by the reentrance of mr delvile who taking her hand said he would himself present her to his lady and with much graciousness assured her of a kind reception  the ceremonies preceding this interview added to the character she had already heard of mrs delvile made cecilia heartily wish it over but assuming all the courage in her power she determined to support herself with a spirit that should struggle against the ostentatious superiority she was prepared to expect  she found her seated upon a sofa from which however she arose at her approach but the moment cecilia beheld her all the unfavourable impressions with which she came into her presence immediately vanished and that respect which the formalities of her introduction had failed to inspire her air figure and countenance instantaneously excited  she was not more than fifty years of age her complexion though faded kept the traces of its former loveliness her eyes though they had lost their youthful fire retained a luster that evinced their primeval brilliancy and the fine symmetry of her features still uninjured by the siege of time not only indicated the perfection of her juvenile beauty but still laid claim to admiration in every beholder  her carriage was lofty and commanding but the dignity to which high birth and conscious superiority gave rise was so judiciously regulated by good sense and so happily blended with politeness that though the world at large envied or hated her the few for whom she had herself any regard she was infallibly certain to captivate  the surprise and admiration with which cecilia at the first glance was struck proved reciprocal mrs delvile though prepared for youth and beauty expected not to see a countenance so intelligent nor manners so well formed as those of cecilia thus mutually astonished and mutually pleased their first salutations were accompanied by looks so flattering to both that each saw in the other an immediate prepossession in her favor and from the moment that they met they seemed instinctively impelled to admire  i have promised miss beverley madam said mr delvile to his lady that you would give her a kind reception and i need not remind you that my promises are always held sacred  but i hope you have not also promised cried she with quickness that i should give you a kind reception for i feel at this very moment extremely inclined to quarrel with you  why so madam  for not bringing us together sooner for now i have seen her i already look back with regret to the time i have lost without the pleasure of knowing her  what a claim is this cried young delvile upon the benevolence of miss beverley for if she has not now the indulgence by frequent and diligent visits to make some reparation she must consider herself as responsible for the dissension she will occasion  if peace depends upon my visits answered cecilia it may immediately be proclaimed were it to be procured only by my absence i know not if i should so readily agree to the conditions  i must request of you madam said mr delvile that when my son and i retire you will bestow half an hour upon this young lady in making enquiries concerning the disturbance last saturday at the operahouse i have not myself so much time to spare as i have several appointments for this morning but i am sure you will not object to the office as i know you to be equally anxious with myself that the minority of miss beverley should pass without reproach  not only her minority but her maturity cried young delvile warmly and not only her maturity but her decline of life will pass i hope not merely without reproach but with fame and applause  i hope so too replied mr delvile i wish her well through every stage of her life but for her minority alone it is my business to do more than wish for that i feel my own honor and my own credit concerned my honor as i gave it to the dean that i would superintend her conduct and my credit as the world is acquainted with the claim she has to my protection  i will not make any enquiries said mrs delvile turning to cecilia with a sweetness that recompensed her for the haughtiness of her guardian till i have had some opportunity of convincing miss beverley that my regard for her merits they should be answered  you see miss beverley said mr delvile how little reason you had to be afraid of us mrs delvile is as much disposed in your favor as myself and as desirous to be of service to you endeavor therefore to cast off this timidity and to make yourself easy you must come to ut often use will do more toward removing your fears than all the encouragement we can give you  but what are the fears cried mrs delvile that miss beverley can have to remove unless indeed she apprehends her visits will make us encroachers and that the more we are favored with her presence the less we shall bear her absence  pray son said mr delvile what was the name of the person who was sir robert floyers opponent i have again forgotten it  belfield sir  true it is a name i am perfectly unacquainted with however he may possibly be a very good sort of man but certainly his opposing himself to sir robert floyer a man of some family a gentleman rich and allied to some people of distinction was a rather strange circumstance i mean not however to prejudge the case i will hear it fairly stated and am the more disposed to be cautious in what i pronounce because i am persuaded miss beverley has too much sense to let my advice be thrown away upon her  i hope so sir but with respect to the disturbance at the opera i know not that i have the least occasion to trouble you  if your measures said he very gravely are already taken the dean your uncle prevailed upon me to accept a very useless office but if any thing is yet undecided it will not perhaps be amiss that i should be consulted mean time i will only recommend to you to consider that mr belfield is a person whose name nobody has heard and that a connection with sir robert floyer would certainly be very honorable for you  indeed sir said cecilia here is some great mistake neither of these gentlemen i believe think of me at all  they have taken then cried young delvile with a laugh a very extraordinary method to prove their indifference  the affairs of sir robert floyer continued mr delvile are indeed i am informed in some disorder but he has a noble estate and your fortune would soon clear all its encumbrances such an alliance therefore would be mutually advantageous but what would result from a union with such a person as mr belfield he is of no family though in that perhaps you would not be very scrupulous but neither has he any money what then recommends him  to me sir nothing answered cecilia  and to me cried young delvile almost every thing he has wit spirit and understanding talents to create admiration and qualities i believe to engage esteem  you speak warmly said mrs delvile but if such is his character he merits your earnestness what is it you know of him  not enough perhaps answered he to coolly justify my praise but he is one of those whose first appearance takes the mind by surprise and leaves the judgment to make afterward such terms as it can will you madam when he is recovered permit me to introduce him to you  certainly said she smiling but have a care your recommendation does not disgrace your discernment  this warmth of disposition mortimer cried mr delvile produces nothing but difficulties and trouble you neglect the connections i point out and which a little attention might render serviceable as well as honorable and run precipitately into forming such as can do you no good among people of rank and are not only profitless in themselves but generally lead you into expense and inconvenience you are now of an age to correct this rashness think therefore better of your own consequence than thus idly to degrade yourself by forming friendships with every shewy adventurer that comes in your way  i know not sir answered he how mr belfield deserves to be called an adventurer he is not indeed rich but he is in a profession where parts such as his seldom fail to acquire riches however as to me his wealth can be of no consequence why should my regard to him wait for it if he is a young man of worth and honor    mortimer interrupted mr delvile whatever he is we know he is not a man of rank and whatever he may be we know he cannot become a man of family and consequently for mortimer delvile he is no companion if you can render him any service i shall commend your so doing it becomes your birth it becomes your station in life to assist individuals and promote the general good but never in your zeal for others forget what is due to yourself and to the ancient and honorable house from which you are sprung  but can we entertain miss beverley with nothing better than family lectures cried mrs delvile  it is for me said young delvile rising to beg pardon of miss beverley for having occasioned them but when she is so good as to honor us with her company again i hope i shall have more discretion  he then left the room and mr delvile also rising to go said my dear i commit you to very kind hands mrs delvile i am sure will be happy to hear your story speak to her therefore without reserve and pray dont imagine that i make you over to her from any slight on the contrary i admire and commend your modesty very much but my time is extremely precious and i cannot devote so much of it to an explanation as your diffidence requires  and then to the great joy of cecilia he retired leaving her much in doubt whether his haughtiness or his condescension humbled her most  these men said mrs delvile can never comprehend the pain of a delicate female mind upon entering into explanations of this sort i understand it however too well to inflict it we will therefore have no explanations at all till we are better acquainted and then if you will venture to favor me with any confidence my best advice and should any be in my power my best services shall be at your command  you do me madam much honor answered cecilia but i must assure you i have no explanation to give  well well at present returned mrs delvile i am content to hear that answer as i have acquired no right to any other but hereafter i shall hope for more openness it is promised me by your countenance and i mean to claim the promise by my friendship  your friendship will both honor and delight me and whatever are your enquiries i shall always be proud to answer them but indeed with regard to this affair    my dear miss beverley interrupted mrs delvile with a look of arch incredulity men seldom risk their lives where an escape is without hope of recompense but we will not now say a word more upon the subject i hope you will often favor me with your company and by the frequency of your visits make us both forget the shortness of our acquaintance  cecilia finding her resistance only gave birth to fresh suspicion now yielded satisfied that a very little time must unavoidably clear up the truth but her visit was not therefore shortened the sudden partiality with which the figure and countenance of mrs delvile had impressed her was quickly ripened into esteem by the charms of her conversation she found her sensible well bred and high spirited gifted by nature with superior talents and polished by education and study with all the elegant embellishments of cultivation she saw in her indeed some portion of the pride she had been taught to expect but it was so much softened by elegance and so well tempered with kindness that it elevated her character without rendering her manners offensive  with such a woman subjects of discourse could never be wanting nor fertility of powers to make them entertaining and so much was cecilia delighted with her visit that though her carriage was announced at twelve oclock she reluctantly concluded it at two and in taking her leave gladly accepted an invitation to dine with her new friend three days after who equally pleased with her young guest promised before that time to return her visit  chap vii an examination cecilia found mrs harrel eagerly waiting to hear some account how she had passed the morning and fully persuaded that she would leave the delviles with a determination never more but by necessity to see them she was therefore not only surprised but disappointed when instead of fulfilling her expectations she assured her that she had been delighted with mrs delvile whose engaging qualities amply recompensed her for the arrogance of her husband that her visit had no fault but that of being too short and that she had already appointed an early day for repeating it  mrs harrel was evidently hurt by this praise and cecilia who perceived among all her guardians a powerful disposition to hatred and jealousy soon dropped the subject though so much had she been charmed with mrs delvile that a scheme of removal once more occurred to her notwithstanding her dislike of her stately guardian  at dinner as usual they were joined by sir robert floyer who grew more and more assiduous in his attendance but who this day contrary to his general custom of remaining with the gentlemen made his exit before the ladies left the table and as soon as he was gone mr harrel desired a private conference with cecilia  they went together to the drawing room where after a flourishing preface upon the merits of sir robert floyer he formally acquainted her that he was commissioned by that gentleman to make her a tender of his hand and fortune  cecilia who had not much reason to be surprised at this overture desired him to tell the baronet she was obliged to him for the honor he intended her at the same time that she absolutely declined receiving it  mr harrel laughing told her this answer was very well for a beginning though it would by no means serve beyond the first day of the declaration but when cecilia assured him she should firmly adhere to it he remonstrated with equal surprise and discontent upon the reasons of her refusal she thought it sufficient to tell him that sir robert did not please her but with much raillery he denied the assertion credit assuring her that he was universally admired by the ladies that she could not possibly receive a more honorable offer and that he was reckoned by every body the finest gentleman about the town his fortune he added was equally unexceptionable with his figure and his rank in life all the world he was certain would approve the connection and the settlement made upon her should be dictated by herself  cecilia begged him to be satisfied with an answer which she never could change and to spare her the enumeration of particular objections since sir robert was wholly and in every respect disagreeable to her  what then cried he could make you so frightened for him at the operahouse there has been but one opinion about town ever since of your prepossession in his favor  i am extremely concerned to hear it my fright was but the effect of surprise and belonged not more to sir robert than to mr belfield  he told her that nobody else thought the same that her marriage with the baronet was universally expected and in conclusion notwithstanding her earnest desire that he would instantly and explicitly inform sir robert of her determination he repeatedly refused to give him any final answer till she had taken more time for consideration  cecilia was extremely displeased at this irksome importunity and still more chagrined to find her incautious emotion at the operahouse had given rise to suspicions of her harboring a partiality for a man whom every day she more heartily disliked  while she was deliberating in what manner she could clear up this mistake which after she was left alone occupied all her thoughts she was interrupted by the entrance of mr monckton whose joy in meeting her at length by herself exceeded not her own for charmed as he was that he could now examine into the state of her affairs she was not less delighted that she could make them known to him  after mutual expressions guarded however on the part of mr monckton though unreserved on that of cecilia of their satisfaction in being again able to converse as in former times he asked if she would permit him as the privilege of their long acquaintance to speak to her with sincerity  she assured him he could not more oblige her  let me then said he enquire if yet that ardent confidence in your own steadiness which so much disdained my fears that the change of your residence might produce a change in your sentiments is still as unshaken as when we parted in suffolk or whether experience that foe to unpractised refinement has already taught you the fallibility of theory  when i assure you replied cecilia that your enquiry gives me no pain i think i have sufficiently answered it for were i conscious of any alteration it could not but embarrass and distress me very far however from finding myself in the danger with which you threatened me of forgetting bury its inhabitants and its environs i think with pleasure of little else since london instead of bewitching has greatly disappointed me  how so cried mr monckton much delighted  not answered she in itself not in its magnificence nor in its diversions which seem to be inexhaustible but these though copious as instruments of pleasure are very shallow as sources of happiness the disappointment therefore comes nearer home and springs not from london but from my own situation  is that then disagreeable to you  you shall yourself judge when i have told you that from the time of my quitting your house till this very moment when i have again the happiness of talking with you i have never once had any conversation society or intercourse in which friendship or affection have had any share or my mind has had the least interest  she then entered into a detail of her way of life told him how little suited to her taste was the unbounded dissipation of the harrels and feelingly expatiated upon the disappointment she had received from the alteration in the manner and conduct of her young friend in her she continued had i found the companion i came prepared to meet the companion from whom i had so lately parted and in whose society i expected to find consolation for the loss of yours and of mrs charltons i should have complained of nothing the very places that now tire might then have entertained me and all that now passes for unmeaning dissipation might then have worn the appearance of variety and pleasure but where the mind is wholly without interest every thing is languid and insipid and accustomed as i have long been to think friendship the first of human blessings and social converse the greatest of human enjoyments how ever can i reconcile myself to a state of careless indifference to making acquaintance without any concern either for preserving or esteeming them and to going on from day to day in an eager search of amusement with no companion for the hours of retirement and no view beyond that of passing the present moment in apparent gaiety and thoughtlessness  mr monckton who heard these complaints with secret rapture far from seeking to soften or remove used his utmost endeavors to strengthen and increase them by artfully retracing her former way of life and pointing out with added censures the change in it she had been lately compelled to make a change he continued which though ruinous of your time and detrimental to your happiness use will i fear familiarize and familiarity render pleasant  these suspicions sir said cecilia mortify me greatly and why when far from finding me pleased you hear nothing but repining should you still continue to harbor them  because your trial has yet been too short to prove your firmness and because there is nothing to which time cannot contentedly accustom us  i feel not much fear said cecilia of standing such a test as might fully satisfy you but nevertheless not to be too presumptuous i have by no means exposed myself to all the dangers which you think surround me for of late i have spent almost every evening at home and by myself  this intelligence was to mr monckton a surprise the most agreeable he could receive her distaste for the amusements which were offered her greatly relieved his fears of her forming any alarming connection and the discovery that while so anxiously he had sought her every where in public she had quietly passed her time by her own fireside not only reassured him for the present but gave him information where he might meet with her in future  he then talked of the duel and solicitously led her to speak open of sir robert floyer and here too his satisfaction was entire he found her dislike of him such as his knowledge of her disposition made him expect and she wholly removed his suspicions concerning her anxiety about the quarrel by explaining to him her apprehensions of having occasioned it herself from accepting the civility of mr belfield at the very moment she showed her aversion to receiving that of sir robert  neither did her confidence rest here she acquainted him with the conversation she had just had with mr harrel and begged his advice in what manner she might secure herself from further importunity  mr monckton had now a new subject for his discernment every thing had confirmed to him the passion which mr arnott had conceived for cecilia and he had therefore concluded the interest of the harrels would be all in his favor other ideas now struck him he found that mr arnott was given up for sir robert and he determined carefully to watch the motions both of the baronet and her young guardian in order to discover the nature of their plans and connection mean time convinced by her unaffected aversion to the proposals she had received that she was at present in no danger from the league he suspected he merely advised her to persevere in manifesting a calm repugnance to their solicitations which could not fail before long to dishearten them both  but sir cried cecilia i now fear this man as much as i dislike him for his late fierceness and brutality though they have increased my disgust make me dread to show it i am impatient therefore to have done with him and to see him no more and for this purpose i wish to quit the house of mr harrel where he has access at his pleasure  you can wish nothing more judiciously cried he would you then return into the country  that is not yet in my power i am obliged to reside with one of my guardians to day i have seen mrs delvile and    mrs delvile interrupted mr monckton in a voice of astonishment surely you do not think of removing into that family  what can i do so well mrs delvile is a charming woman and her conversation would afford me more entertainment and instruction in a single day than under this roof i should obtain in a twelvemonth  are you serious do you really think of making such a change  i really wish it but i know not yet if it is practicable on thursday however i am to dine with her and then if it is in my power i will hint to her my desire  and can miss beverley possibly wish cried mr monckton with earnestness to reside in such a house is not mr delvile the most ostentatious haughty and selfsufficient of men is not his wife the proudest of women and is not the whole family odious to all the world  you amaze me cried cecilia surely that cannot be their general character mr delvile indeed deserves all the censure he can meet for his wearisome parade of superiority but his lady by no means merits to be included in the same reproach i have spent this whole morning with her and though i waited upon her with a strong prejudice in her disfavour i observed in her no pride that exceeded the bounds of propriety and native dignity  have you often been at the house do you know the son too  i have seen him three or four times  and what do you think of him  i hardly know enough of him to judge fairly  but what does he seem to you do you not perceive in him already all the arrogance all the contemptuous insolence of his father  o no far from it indeed his mind seems to be liberal and noble open to impressions of merit and eager to honor and promote it  you are much deceived you have been reading your own mind and thought you had read his i would advise you sedulously to avoid the whole family you will find all intercourse with them irksome and comfortless such as the father appears at once the wife and the son will in a few more meetings appear also they are descended from the same stock and inherit the same selfcomplacency mr delvile married his cousin and each of them instigates the other to believe that all birth and rank would be at an end in the world if their own superb family had not a promise of support from their hopeful mortimer should you precipitately settle yourself in their house you would very soon be totally weighed down by their united insolence  cecilia again and warmly attempted to defend them but mr monckton was so positive in his assertions and so significant in his insinuations to their discredit that she was at length persuaded she had judged too hastily and after thanking him for his counsel promised not to take any measures toward a removal without his advice  this was all he desired and now enlivened by finding that his influence with her was unimpaired and that her heart was yet her own he ceased his exhortations and turned the discourse to subjects more gay and general judiciously cautious neither by tedious admonitions to disgust nor by fretful solicitude to alarm her he did not quit her till the evening was far advanced and then in returning to his own house felt all his anxieties and disappointments recompensed by the comfort this long and satisfactory conversation had afforded him while cecilia charmed with having spent the morning with her new acquaintance and the evening with her old friend retired to rest better pleased with the disposal of her time than she had yet been since her journey from suffolk  chap viii a tete a tete the two following days had neither event nor disturbance except some little vexation occasioned by the behavior of sir robert floyer who still appeared not to entertain any doubt of the success of his addresses this impertinent confidence she could only attribute to the officious encouragement of mr harrel and therefore she determined rather to seek than to avoid an explanation with him but she had in the mean time the satisfaction of hearing from mr arnott who ever eager to oblige her was frequent in his enquiries that mr belfield was almost entirely recovered  on thursday according to her appointment she again went to st jamessquare and being shown into the drawing room till dinner was ready found there only young mr delvile  after some general conversation he asked her how lately she had had any news of mr belfield  this morning she answered when i had the pleasure of hearing he was quite recovered have you seen him again sir  yes madam twice  and did you think him almost well  i thought answered he with some hesitation and i think still that your enquiries ought to be his cure  o cried cecilia i hope he has far better medicines but i am afraid i have been misinformed for i see you do not think him better  you must not however replied he blame those messengers whose artifice has only had your satisfaction in view nor should i be so malignant as to blast their designs if i did not fear that mr belfields actual safety may be endangered by your continued deception  what deception sir i dont at all understand you how is his safety endangered  ah madam said he smiling what danger indeed is there that any man would not risk to give birth to such solicitude mr belfield however i believe is in none from which a command of yours cannot rescue him  then were i an hardhearted damsel indeed not to issue it but if my commands are so medicinal pray instruct me how to administer them  you must order him to give up for the present his plan of going into the country where he can have no assistance and where his wound must be dressed only by a common servant and to remain quietly in town till his surgeon pronounces that he may travel without any hazard  but is he seriously so mad as to intend leaving town without the consent of his surgeon  nothing less than such an intention could have induced me to undeceive you with respect to his recovery but indeed i am no friend to those artifices which purchase present relief by future misery i venture therefore to speak to you the simple truth that by a timely exertion of your influence you may prevent further evil  i know not sir said cecilia with the utmost surprise why you should suppose i have any such influence nor can i imagine that any deception has been practiced  it is possible answered he i may have been too much alarmed but in such a case as this no information ought to be depended upon but that of his surgeon you madam may probably know his opinion  me  no indeed i never saw his surgeon i know not even who he is  i purpose calling upon him tomorrow morning will miss beverley permit me afterward the honor of communicating to her what may pass  i thank you sir said she coloring very high but my impatience is by no means so great as to occasion my giving you that trouble  delvile perceiving her change of countenance instantly and with much respect entreated her pardon for the proposal which however she had no sooner granted than he said very archly why indeed you have not much right to be angry since it was your own frankness that excited mine and thus you find like most other culprits i am ready to cast the blame of the offense upon the offended i feel however an irresistible propensity to do service to mr belfield  shall i sin quite beyond forgiveness if i venture to tell you how i found him situated this morning  no certainly  if you wish it i can have no objection  i found him then surrounded by a set of gay young men who by way of keeping up his spirits made him laugh and talk without ceasing he assured me himself that he was perfectly well and intended to gallop out of town tomorrow morning though when i shook hands with him at parting i was both shocked and alarmed to feel by the burning heat of the skin that far from discarding his surgeon he ought rather to call in a physician  i am very much concerned to hear s account said cecilia but i do not well understand what you mean should on my part follow it  that answered he bowing with a look of mock gravity i pretend not to settle in stating the case i have satisfied my conscience and if in hearing it you can pardon the liberty i have taken i shall as much honor the openness of your character as i admire that of your countenance  cecilia now to her no little astonishment found she had the same mistake to clear up at present concerning mr belfield that only three days before she had explained with respect to the baronet but she had no time to speak further upon the subject as the entrance of mrs delvile put an end to their discourse  that lady received her with the most distinguishing kindness apologized for not sooner waiting upon her and repeatedly declared that nothing but indisposition should have prevented her returning the favor of her first visit  they were soon after summoned to dinner mr delvile to the infinite joy of cecilia was out  the day was spent greatly to her satisfaction there was no interruption from visitors she was tormented by the discussion of no disagreeable subjects the duel was not mentioned the antagonists were not hinted at she was teized with no selfsufficient encouragement and wearied with no mortifying affability the conversation at once was lively and rational and though general was rendered interesting by a reciprocation of good will and pleasure in the conversers  the favorable opinion she had conceived both of the mother and the son this long visit served to confirm in mrs delvile she found strong sense quick parts and high breeding in mortimer sincerity and vivacity joined with softness and elegance and in both there seemed the most liberal admiration of talents with an openness of heart that disdained all disguise greatly pleased with their manners and struck with all that was apparent in their characters she much regretted the prejudice of mr monckton which now with the promise she had given him was all that opposed her making an immediate effort toward a change in her abode  she did not take her leave till eleven oclock when mrs delvile after repeatedly thanking her for her visit said she would not so much encroach upon her good nature as to request another till she had waited upon her in return but added that she meant very speedily to pay that debt in order to enable herself by friendly and frequent meetings to enter upon the confidential commission with which her guardian had entrusted her  cecilia was pleased with the delicacy which gave rise to this forbearance yet having in fact nothing either to relate or conceal she was rather sorry than glad at the delay of an explanation since she found the whole family was in an error with respect to the situation of her affairs  end of
