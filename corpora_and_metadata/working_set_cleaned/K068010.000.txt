there was nothing wantin for necessary use commodity and pleasure i seemed good to him then to make one that might use them to his glory and take delight in rejoicing in them wherefore when natures ornaments were all complete he brought man into the world as into his own possession an that he might not be disconsolate nor solitary gave him a woman for a helper and compnion infusing into them a fource of love an desire toward each other and of procreating their likeness having prepared for that purpose a swelling humor or spirit and organical parts and that the one through fear of neglect should not be induced to decline the society of the other he added allurements and desire of mutual embracings that so they might in procreation be sweetly affected and delighted by wondrous ways for unless this was natural to all kind of creatures they would be regardless of posterity and proceation would cease whereby mankind would quickly be lost and the affairs of mortals of no continuance but that this passionate desire might strongly operate as well in sensual felicity as on the imagination god has firmly impressed it on all creatures subject thereto both male and female but more especially on man and lest it should prove unruly in him and not easily subdued he has thought it convenient to prescribe him bounds and confine him to the use of the matrimonial bed that so they might not defile themselves with wandering lust who want the gift of continency wherefore so soon as copulation is finished and the woman happens to prove with child great is natures cunning in furnishing the embryo with convenient nutriment that at the set time when nine months are run over man that ruler and ornament of the sublunary world may come forth in relation to which mystery of

what it was designed for viz the benefit and advantage of the mdest of either sex not desiring that this book should fall into the hands of any obscene and wanton person whose folly or malice may turn that into ridicule that loudly proclaims the infinite wisdom of an omnipotent creator who by his mighty working is able to subdue all things to himself  gloria deo in excelsis aristotles masterpiece or the secrets of generation displayed etc chap i of marriage and at what age virgins and youths are capable of the marriage bed and the reasons that prompts them to desire it with the signs of barrenness and how long a man or woman are capable of having children that marriage is an honorable state ordained by god in paradise and since confirmed by our blessed savior who wrought his first miracle at a wedding i hope no body will deny therefore it is convenient that parents will take care of their daughters chastity and when they find them inclinable to marriage not violently to restrain their affections but rather to provide for them if possible such husbands as may be for their advantage and with whom they may live comfortably in that blessed state lest being crossed in their purposes and delayed they part with their honor dishonorable ways  the propension and inclination of maids to marriage is to be discovered by many symptoms for when they arrive to maturity which is usually about the   th or   th year of their age according to their respective habits or constitutions then their menses or natural purgations begin to flow and the blood which is no longer taken to augment their bodies abounding incites their minds and imaginations to venery external causes also may promote and excite them to it for the spirits being brisk and in a manner inflamed when they arrive at this age if they eat salt sharp things spices etc whereby the body becomes still more and more heated then the inclination and proneness to venerial embraces is very great nay sometimes almost inseparable and a due use of these enjoyments being denied to virgins very often produces very dismal effects as green and weaselcolour short breathings tremblings of the  etc but if they happen to be married to their own content those afflictions vanish and their native beauty returns more gay than before nor is their eager gazing and desiring to associate themselves with men a less sign that nature prompts them to desire what she ordained their due of which being sometimes by obdurate parents debarred in a lawful way they break the bounds of modesty rather than endure such violent agitations and conflicts within themselves and so satiate their desires in unlawful love the same may in all particulars be observed in young brisk widows whom death that enemy of sweet conjugal love has separated from the bosom of their husbands  at    years of age commonly the menses in virgins begin to flow and their they are capable of conceiving and so contitinue generally to fortyfour at what time for the most part they are no longer capable of generation unless such as are exceeding healthful strong of body and have used themselves to temperance who have appeared to be delivered of children till    years but such prodigies rarely happen although the menses continue longer in some women than in others but many times such efflux proceeds not from any natural cause but by reason of some violent straining or other violence and does often endanger the life of the party and therefore young men that marry women surmounting the age aforesaid if they expect children unless by miracle must labor against the wind though if an old man that is not worn out by diseases and incontinency marry a brisk lively lass there is hopes even to threescore and ten and some that are extraordinary lusty till fourscore  hypocrates that famous and learned physician is of opinion that a youth at    years or between that and    having much vital strength may be capable of getting children and that force and heat of procreating matter continually increases till     0 and    and at the end of the latter begins to flag the seed by little and little becoming unfruitful the natural spirits being extinguished and the humors dried up and in general most physicians to this day do observe it but as to particulars as i have before mentioned it often happens otherwise nay it is reported by a credible author that in the reign of ereus king of swedeland a man was married at an hundred years old to a bride of thirty and had many children by her but looked so fresh that such as knew him not took him not to exceed that age  in campania where the air is temperate serene and calm men of  0 year usually marry young virgins and have children by them which argues that age in men hinders not procreation unless they be exhausted in their youth and their members shrivelled up if any ask why a woman is sooner barren than a man i answer the cause is the natural heat which is more predominant in the latter than in the former for since a woman is more moist than a man as her monthly purgations do most evidently demonstrate as also the softness of her body it is also apparent that he does exceed her in native heat and as for that heat it is the chief thing that concocts the humors into good and proper aliment which the woman wanting grows fat when a man by reason of that heat melts his fat by degrees and his humors are dissolved and by the benefit thereof they are elaborated into seed and this may for the better confirmation of what i propose be added that the woman generally is not so strong as a man nor so wise and ingenious in contriving her affairs whereby the faculties are hindered in their operation and so i conclude my assertion  chap ii general and particular rules laid down by learned physicians how to proceed in getting a male or female child and of the embryo and perfect birth and the fittest season for copulation when a young likely couple have entered the holy state of wedlock and are desirous of mutual enjoyment for generationsake which is the chief end for which wedlock was ordained and rather covet to be blessed with one sex than another let them know fitst for certain that the success of such things depends upon divine providence though secondary causes must be active and instrumental therein and those are especially two first the genital humor which is brought by the arteriae praeparantes to the testes in the form of blood and there elaborated into seed by the seminifical faculty resident in them to which may be added the appetite and desire to copulation which fires the imagination with unusual fancies or by the sight of a brisk charming beauty whose wit and liveliness may much entice and more inflame the courage but if nature be enfeebled then are there fit artificial remedies to restore it viz such meats as most conduce to the affording such aliment as proves to make seed abound and restore the decays of nature that the faculties may freely operate for as dung and good muturing restores ground that is worn out and heartless even so seasonable and proper diet operates to the restoring the faint heart weak spirit coldness and dryness of the genital parts and reduces the weakness of the nerves to their temperament and removes impediments obstructing the procreation of children then since diet may and will after the evil state of the body to a better it is necessary that such as are subject to barrenness should eat such meats only as tend to render them fruitful and among such things as are inducing and stirring up thereto are all meats of good juice that nourish well and make the body lively and full of sap of which faculty are all hot moist meats for according to galen the substance of seed is made of the pure concocted and windy superfluity of blood from whence we may conclude there is in many things a power to accumulate or heap up seed as also to augment it and other things of force to cause erection as heneggs pheasants woodcocks gnatsappers thrushes blackbirds young pigeons sparrows patridges capons almonds pinenuts raysons currants all strong wines moderately taken especially those made of the grapes of italy but erection is chiefly caused and provoked by styrium eringoes cresses erysimum parsnip artichoaks turnips rapes asparagus candyd ginger gallinga acorns bruised to powder and drank in muscadine scallions seashellfish etc all these though excellent restoratives will not have present operation but you must use yourself to them for a considerable time or else you will reap little or no benent by them the act of coition being over  wheren the force of imagination is certainly very prevalent in the causing of the child to be of this or that sex the woman say the ancients must gently repose on her right side with her head lying low and her body sinking down that by sleeping in that posture the cell on the right side of the matrix may prove the place of conception in which is the greatest force of generative heat which is the chief inducement to the procreation of male children and rarely fails to answer the expectation of those that experience it especially if they keep themselves warm and without much motion leaning for the most part to the right and drinking a little of spirit of saffron and juice of hysop in a glass of mallaga or aligant when they lie down and rise for the space of a week now the fittest time they say for the procreation of male children is when the sun is in leo and the moons in virgo scorpio or sagittarius  this order they will also have observed for a female child by lying as aforesaid on the left side and strongly fancying a female in the time of procreation especially if the woman drink the decoction of female mercury   days from the  st day of purgation the male mercury both herbs so called having the like operation in case of a male child for the juice or decoction of those simples are of force the one to purge the right and the other the left side of the womb and thereby open the receptacles making way for the seminary of generation and the best time to copulate for this sex is when the moon is in the wane and the sign in libra or aquarius for then they will be of a most gentle affable temper very fair and perfect in all their members avicenna an author of good repute describes the time of procreation thus when says he the menses are spent and the womb is cleansed which is commonly   days or   at most if a man lie with his wife from the first day she is purged to the fifth she will conceive a male but from the fifth to the eight a female and from the eighth to the twelfth a male again but after that number of days perhaps neither distinctly but both in an hermophradite  in a word they that would be commended to their wedlock actions and be happy in the fruit of their labor must observe to copulate at distance of time not too often nor yet too seldom for both these hurt fruitfulness alike for to eject immoderately weakens a man and wastes his spirits and too often causes the seed by long continuance to be ineffectual and not manly enough and thus much for the first general and particular from whence i shall proceed to the second which is to give the reader to understand how the child is formed in the womb and what accidents it is incident to how nourished and how brought forth  certain it is there are various opinions concerning this matter therefore i shall for the satisfaction of the curious lay down the opinion of the learned as thus man consists of an ovum or eg impregnated in the ovaria or testieles of the woman by the more subtle part of mans seed but there is a forming faculty and virtue in the seed from a divine and heavenly gift it being abundantly endued with vital and etherial spirit which gives shape and form to the embryo so that all the parts and bulk of the body which is made up in the space of many months and is by degrees framed and formed into a decent and comely figure of a man do consist in that and are adumbrated thereby on which holy david contemplating fell into his divine rapture and admiration expressed in psalm     i will praise thee o lord because i am wonderfully made thy works are wonderful my soul searches and knows it right well thou know all my bones when i was fashioned in the secret place and when i was wonderfully formed in my mothers womb thy eyes beheld me yet unmade and in thy book were all my members written which day by day were fashioned thy knowledge is wonderful unto me whereby i was made i cannot understand it etc and physicians that have narrowly contemplated mans nature constitute four different times wherein this microsm or little world is framed and perfected in the womb  the first is immediately after coition and is said to be perfected in the first week if no efflux happen which sometimes fall out through the slipperiness of the matrix or the head thereof that shifts over like a rosebud opening on a sudden by reason of some cold distemper or overweariness in travel  the second time of forming is constituted when nature and the force of the womb by the use of her own imbred forces and virtue makes a manifest mutation in the conception so that all the substance seems congealed flesh and blood which happens about the twelfth and fourteenth day after copulation and though this concreation or fleshly mass abound with hot fiery blood yet it remains undistinguishable without form of figure and may be called the rough draught or embrio and well likened to seed which is sown in the ground which through kindly heat and moisture grows up by degrees into a perfect form either in plant or grain or as when a potter fashons a vessel out of a rude lump of clay  the third time to make up this fabric is set when the principle parts show themselves evidently and perspiciously as the heart from whence proceeds the arteries the brain from which the nerves proceed like many small threads running through the whole body and the liver whose office it is to separate the bile from the blood brought to it by the vana portae the two first are the seeds and fountains of life that nourish and support each part of the body in framing which the faculty of the womb is busied from the time of conception to the eighteenth day of the first month  but lastly which time reaches to the    or  0th day the outward parts are seen exquisitely elabourted and distinguished by joints and then the child begins to grow and pant from which progress of days by reason the limbs are divided and the whole frame is perfect it is no longer held an imperfect child or embrio that is a concretion that springs forth but is held to be a perfect and absolute child males for the most part are perfect by the  0th day but females seldom till the    or    day and the reason why the one is sooner perfected than the other is that the heat of the womb is greater in producing the male than the female for heat extends the humor like soft wax diffusing and dilating it and then by its force contracting framing and fashoning it so heat and vigor of the body and alacrity of nature in the man makes the male to move in   months but the female rarely under   at which time also his hair and nails comes forth and the child begins to stir kick and tumble in the womb so that the motion is plainly perceived and the woman are troubled with nauseating and loathing of their meat and oftentimes covet and greedily long for things contrary to nutriment as coals rubbish chalk lime starch oatmeal raw flesh and fish or the like which desire proceeds from a former contraction of evil humors occasioning impure blood in their contained vessel within and often occasions abortion and miscarriages some women as it has been noted by diverse authors of credit have been so extravagent in their longings that they have coveted hobnails leather mans flesh horseflesh and the flesh of diverse ravenous beasts for want of which they have cast their birth untimely or the child has continued dead in the womb for many days to the eminent hazard of the womans life but to proceed in this great mystery i shall unfold by what means the infant is sustained in the womb and what posture it there remains in  the disputes among both philosophers and physicians with what and by what way the faetus is nourished have been very great some affirming by blood only from the vmbilical vein others only by chyle received in by the month but the truth is it is nourished diversely according to the different degrees of perfection that an ovum or egg passes from a conception to a faetus ready for the birth  but before we proceed it will not be amiss to explain what we mean by this ovum or egg you must know then that there are in the generation of the faetus two principles active and passive the active is the mans seed which is elaborated in the testicles out of the arterial blood and animal spirits the passive principle is an ovum or egg impregnated by the mans seed for to say that woman has true seed is false and erroneous but the manner of conception is thus the most spirituous part of mans seed in the act of generation reaching up to the ovarium or testicles of the woman which contain diverse eggs sometimes more sometimes fewer secundates one of them which being conveyed by the oviducts to the bottom of the womb presently begins to swell bigger and bigger and imbibes the moisture that is sent plentifully thither after the same manner that seeds in the ground suck the fertile moisture thereof to make them sprout  when the parts of the embryo begin to be a little more perfect and the chorion becomes so thick that the liquor cannot soak through it the vmbilical vessels begin to be formed and to extend the side of the amnios which they pass through and also through the allantides and chorion and are implanted in the placenta which gathering upon the chorion joins into the vterus and now the arteries that before sent out the nutritious juice into the cavity of the womb open by the orifices into the placenta where they deposite the said juice which is drunk up by the vmbilical vein and conveyed by it first to the liver of the foetus and then to the heart where its more thin and spirituous part is turned into blood whilst the grosser part of it descending by the aorta enters the vmbilical arteries and is discharged into its cavity by those branches of them that run through the amnios  as soon as the mouth stomach and gullet etc are formed so perfecty that the faetus can swallow it sucks in some of the grosser nutritious juice that is deposited in the amnios by the vmbilical arteries which descending into the stomach and intestines is received by the lacteal  as in adust persons  the faetus being perfected at the times before specified in all its parts it lies equally balanced in the midst of the womb as in the center all on a head and being something long is turned round so that the head a little inclines and it lays his chin on its breast his heels and ancles upon its buttocks its hands on its cheeks and its thumbs to its eyes but its legs and thighs are carried upwards with its hams bending so that they touch the bottom of its belly the former and that part of the body which is over against us as the forehead nose face are turned toward the mothers back and the head inclining downwards toward the cocyx or rumpbone that joins to the os sacrum which bone together with os pubis in the time of the birth part and are loosned whence t is that male children commonly come with their faces downwards or with their heads turned somewhat oblique that their faces may be seen but the famale children with their faces upwards though someimes it happens that births follow not acording to natures order but children ome forth with their feet straddling their necks bowed and their heads lying oblique with their hand stretched out which greaty endangers themselves and the mother iving the midwife great trouble to introuce them into the world but when all things proceed orderly and naturally the child when natures set bounds are accomplished is desirous to break its bounds and come forth of the womb and by inclining himself he rowls downward for he cannot longer be obscured in those hidingplaces and the heat of the heart cannot subsist without external respiration wherefore being grown great he is more and more desirous of nutriment and light when coveting the etherial air he by strugglig to obtain it breaks the membranes and coverings whereby he was restrained and fenced against attrition and for the most part with bitter pangs of the mother issues forth to view the days commonly in the ninth month for then the matrix divided and the os pubis being loosned the woman strives what she can to cast forth her burden and the child doing the like to get forth by the help of its inbred strength the birth comes to be perfect but if the child be dead the more dangerous is the delivery though nature as a kind commiserator often helps the womens weakness herein but the child that is quick and lively labors no less than the woman  now these are births at seven or eight months and some women go to the tenth month but of these and the reason of them i shall speak more largely in another place and at present proceed to unravel other mysteries of nature  chap iii  reason why children are often like their parents and what the mothers imagination contributes thereto whence grows the kind viz whether the man or woman is the cause of the male or female child etc that if a woman in the act of copulation affords most seed her likeness will ve the greater impression upon the child  if on the contrary then will follow the ntrary effects or if a proportionable uantity proceed from either then will  similitude depend upon neither  lactantius is of opinion that when a ans seed falls on the left side of the womb  male child may be gotten but by rean it is the proper place for a female there ill be something in it greatly resembling  woman viz it will be fairer whiter and smoother nor very subject to have hair on the body or chin long lank hair on the head voice small and sharp and the courage feeble and arguing yet further he says that a female may perchance  procreated if the seed fall on the right de but then through extraordinary heat  will be very large boned full of courage endued with a big voice and have her chin and bosom hairy not being  clear as other of the sex subject to quarel with her husband when married for the superiority etc in case of the similitude nothing is more powerful than the imagination of the mother for if she conceive in her mind or do by chance faste her eyes upon any object and imprint it i her memory the child in its outward part frequently has some representation theof so whilst a man and woman are in the act of copulation if the woman earnestl behold his countenance and fix her mind thereon without all peradventure the child will resemble the father nay so powerful is its operation that though  woman be in unlawful copulation yet  fear or any thing else causes her to fix he mind upon her husband the child wi resemble him tho he never got it the same effect according to the opinion of the learned proceeds from imagination i cause of warts moldspots stains dashes and the figures of strange things though indeed they sometimes happen through fright or extravagant longing many women there are that seeing a hare cross them when great with child will through the strength of imagination bring forth a child with a hairy lip some children again ar orn with flat noses wry mouths great lubber lips and illshapd bodies and most scribe the reason to the strange conceit of he mother who has busied her eyes and mind upon some illshaped or distorted creatures therefore it properly behooves all women with child to avoid any montrous sight or at least to have a steadfast mind not easily fixed upon any thing more than another and this opinion pliny onfirms in his  th book of natural things and the    th chapter the famous sir thomas more likewise confirms it and discants merrily on a passage of his times wherein  person having diverse children would own none but what was like him when n the end it was proved by the assveration of the mother that all except that were of is own begetting but whilst another man was mounted in his saddle she fearng that he would come and detect her in he act had her imagination so fixed on him that as she conceived the similitude ould proceed from no other cause wherefore it is apparent that likeness can confirm o child to be a lawful fathers own yet  manners wit and apprehension of the mind daily examples teach us that children are commonly of the same condition with their progenitors and of the same nature but there is much in this whether venery be used with great or weak  for many are less inclined to it and not  hot and consequently not so desirous  copulation but rather decline it unle civility to their wives cause them to copliance therein and then they proceed faining and drowsily whence it happens th the children fall short of their parents nture wit and manners and hence it is the wise men frequently beget stupid slothf children of eeble minds because they ar not much given to those delights but  i said on the contrary when the progentors are hot in venerious actions and dliberally and abundantly employ themselves therein it oftentimes happens that the children are of the same desires manner and actions of the mind with their parents and thus much for the first point now  shall proceed to the second which is  show what share each of the parents have in begetting the child etc and first we wi give the opinion of the ancients about it  though it is apparent say they tha the seed of man is the chief efficient and beginning of action motion and generation yet that the woman does afford seed and effectually contributes in tha particular to the procreation of the child i evinced by strong reasons in the fir place seminary vessels had been give them in vain and genital testicles interverted if the woman wanted seminal excressence for being nature does nothing in vain therefore it must be granted that they were made for the use of seed and procreation and fixed in their proper places both the testicles and receptacles of seed whose nature and force is to operate and afford fruitful virtue to the seed and to prove this there needs no stronger argument say they than that if a woman do not use copulation to eject her seed she oftentimes falls into strange diseases as appears by young widows and virgins a second reason they urge that although the society of a lawful bed consist not altogether in these things yet it is apparent that the female sex is not better won and appear more blithe and jocund than when they are often satisfied this way which is an inducement to believe that they have greater pleasure and receive more content than a man for since by nature much delight accompanies ejection by the breaking forth of the swelling spirit and the stiffness of the nerves in which case the operation of the womans part is double she suffering both ways even by ejection and reception whereby she is more recreated and delighted in the venereal act  hence it is they say that the child more frequently resembles the mother than the father because the mother confers the most toward its generation and they think it may be further instanced from the great love they bear them for that besides their contributing seminal matter they during the time they are in the womb feed and nourish the child with the purest fountain of blood which opinion galen confirms by allowing the child to participate more of the mother than the father and refers the difference of the sex to the influence of menstrual blood but the reason of the likeness he attributes to the force of the seed for as plants receive more from fruitful ground than from the industry of the husbandman so the infant in more abundance receives from the mother than the father for first the seed of both is heaped and fostered in the womb and there grows to perfection being nourished with blood and hence they will have it that children for the most part affect their mother best for it proceeds from the nearness of nature by a natural instinct because the mothers force was most employed about em for   months and sometimes  0 she nourishes the child with her purest blood then her love toward it newly born and the likeness do clearly demonstrate that the woman affords seed and that women do contribute more toward making the child than men but in all this the ancients were very much in an error for the testicles so called in womem do not afford any seed but are two eggs analogous to those of fowls and other creatures neither have they any such office as those of men but are indeed ovarium wherein those eggs are nourished by the sanguinary vessels dispersed through them and from whence one or more as they are fecundated by the mans seed separated and are conveyed into the womb by the ovi duces the truth of this is plain for if you boil them their liquor will have the same color taste and consistency with the whites of birds eggs to say they want shells is nothing at all for the eggs of fowls while they are in the ovary nay after they have fallen down into the vterus have no shell and though when they are laid they have one yet that is no more than a fence which nature has provided them against outward injuries while they are hatched without the body whereas those of women being hatced within the body need no other fence than the womb by which they are sufficiently guarded  and thus much for the clearing of this point also and now to the third thing proposed viz whence grows the kind and whether the man or the woman is the cause of the male or female infant  the primal cause as justly due in this and all other cases we must ascribe to god the ruler and disposer of all things yet many things by his high sufferance proceed in regular order by the rules of nature and are carried on by their inbred motion according to their usual and natural course without variation though indeed by favor from on high sarah conceived isaac hannah samuel and elizabeth john the baptist but these were to fulfill the almightys decree nor since those times have the prayers of the righteous been unsuccessful in obtaining children but passing over such supernatural and extraordinary causes that have their peculiar effects i shall proceed to speak of things natural and common the ancient physicians and philosophers say that since there are two principles out of which the body of man is made and which render the child like the progenitors and to be of one or the other sex viz seed common to both sexes and menstrual blood proper to the woman only the similitude say they must needs consist in the force of the male or female seed so that it proves like to the one or the other as more or less plenty is afforded by either but that the difference of sex is not referred to the seed but to the menstrual blood which is proper to the woman for were that force say they altogether retained in the seed the mans seed being of a hotter quality than the womans male children would be superabundant and none of the other sex or very rarely would be propagated whereof the kind of the creature is attributed to the temperament of the active qualities which consist in heat and cold and to the substances or nature of the matter under them that is to the flowing of the menstrual blood now the seed say they affords both force to procreate and form the child and matter for its generation and that in the menstrual blood there is both matter and force for as the seeds most helps the material principles so likewise the menstrual blood the potential seed is says galen blood well concocted by the vessels that contain it so that blood is not only the matter of generating the child but also seed in possibility that menstrual blood has both principles as matter and faculty of offering the ancients say further that the seed is not the strongest effient the matter of it being very little in quantity but that the potential or efficient faculty of it is very feeble wherefore if the material part or principle of generation according to which the sex is made were only say they in the menstrual blood then would the children be all or mostly females as if the efficient force was in the seed they would be all males but that since both have operation in menstrual blood matter predominates in quantity and in the seeds force and virtue deservedly says galen the child receives its sex rather from the mother than from the father although his seed do contribute something to the material principles though more weakly but as for similitude although imagination say the ancients be of extraordinary force it is referred rather to the father than the mother as to the quality of the seed at or for a short time after copulation but continues not long so to do for that the womans seed receiving faculty from the menstrual blood for the space of nine months overpowers the mans as to that particular because the menstrual blood flowing into the vessels rather cherishes and augments the one than the other from which it may be more easily conjecturd that the woman not only affords matter to make the child but force and virtue to perfect the conception though the womans seed be fit nutriment for the mans by reason of the moisture and thinness of it being more fit to frame and make up conception thereby for as with soft wax and moist clay the workman can frame what he intends so say they the mans seed mixing with the womans as also with the menstrual blood helps effectually to make the form and perfect part of man but with all the respect and difference imaginable to the wisdom of the ancients we must needs say that their ignorance in anatomy has led them into many and great mistakes and their hypothesis of the formation of the embryo from a commixture of seeds and the nutrition of it from the menstruous blood being altogether false their opinion in this case must needs be false also  therefore to conclude this chapter we say that although a strong imagination of the mother may sometimes determine the sex that is make it male or female according as her imagination is yet the main agent in this case is the plastic or formative principle which is the efficient in forming the child that gives it this or that sex according to those laws and rules that are prescribed to it by the wise creator of all things  chap iv a serious discourse of the soul of man that it is not propagated from the parents but is infused by god and can neither die nor corrupt and what day of childbearing it is infused of the immortality thereof and certainty of its resurrection the soul of man is of so divine a nature and excellency that man himself cannot any wise comprehend it it being the infused breath of the almighty immortal and incomprehensible but by him that gave it it being as it well may be termed a part of himself for moses by holy inspiration relating the oginal of man tells us that god had breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and beme a living soul now as for all other creatures at his word they were made and had life but the creature that god has appointed to set over his works was favored with the more immediate hand of the almighty forming him out of the dust of the earth and secondly condescending to breath into his nostrls the breath of life which implies that there was more care and if we may so tem it labor used about man than about all other creatur on cated things he only partaking and participating with the divine nature being made in his likeness bearing the image of god that is in innocence and purity whilst he stood firm but in his fall that lively image was defaced yet such was the infinite love of god toward him that although he rebelled against him he would not altogether cast him off but found a way to restore him nay so much in esteem was he thought not deserving the least favor that the son of god the second person in the glorious trinity when the fullness of time was come laying aside his crown of stars left the right hand of glory majesty and the bright effulgence that adorned him and descending took upon him our nature o infinite and unspeakable love nay more endured shame reproach scourging buffetting spting on and the death of the cross that he might bruise the head of the serpnt and deliver the beloved man from the jaws and brink of utte ruin and the better to conirm his love toward us is ascended on high leading captivity captive where he is so far from forgetting us that he is become our mediato and makes daily intercession for us to the father whose offendd jstice he has satied as to the original sin but to come nearer to my purpose  if man would understand the excellency of the soul for as it is capable of comprehending it self let him after serious recollection descend into himself and search diligently his own mind and there he shall find so many admirable gifts and excellent ornaments that it must needs strike him with wonder and amaz meant as reason understanding true choice ability of wit memory and diverse other faculties that absolutely approve the soul to be more admirable than that any should imagine it be finite or subject to annihilation yet by reason of its many offices and operations whilst in the body it is specified under sundry denominations for as s augustine says when it enlivens the body it is called the soul when it gives it knowledge the judgment the mind when it recalls things past the memory whilst it discourses and discerns reason whilst it contemplates the spirits whilst it is in the sensitive parts the senses and as these are the principal offices whereby the soul declares its power and performs it actions for placed in the highest part of the body and the nearest heaven it difuseth or disperseth effectually its force into every member not propagated from the parents nor mixed with gross matter but the infused breath of the almighty immediately proceeding from him nor passing from one to another as fondly and absurdly the pythagoreans have insinuated in their opinions about the transmigration of the soul and so vain were they that they did not only imagine the souls of the deceased men passed into newborn infants but into beasts also and from thence it was they forbid the eating of flesh and abstained themselves from so doing lest as they fondly fansied they might as tertullian records it eat their grandfather in a calf but such frivolous and superstitious notions are to be rejected by christians and those true ones observed which are both reasonable and agreeable to humane capacities for orthodox divines conclude in general that the soul is given to any infant by infusion when he or she is perfected in the womb which happens about the   th day after conception especially for males that in likelihood will be born at the end of nine months but in femals who are of a weaker constitution and not so soon formed and be perfected through the defect of heat not till the  0th day  and although this day in all cases cannot be perfectly set down yet hypocrates has undertaken to give his absolute opinion when the child has its perfect form whom it begins to move and when born if in due season for in his book of the nature of infants he affirms that if it be a male and he be perfect on the thirtieth day and move at the sixtieth he will come forth at the seventh month but if he be perfectly formed on the    th day he will move on the  0 th and be born in the   th month again if he be perfectly formed on the    th day he will move on the  0 th day and be born in the ninth month now from these passing of days and months it plainly appears that the day of forming being doubled makes up the day of moving and that day three times reckoned makes up the day of birth  as for example where    perfect the form if you double it it makes  0 the day of motion and three times  0 amounts to   0 days or   months allowing  0 days to one month and so you must consider the rest but as for the female it is longer perfecting in the womb and the mother ever goes longer with a boy than a girl so that there is difference in the account for a female formed in  0 days moves not till the  0 day and is born in the   month when she is formed in the  0 day she moves not till the  0 day and is born in the   month but if she be perfectly formed on the    day she moves on the  0 and is born in the   th month but she that is formed on the  0 th day moves on the  00 th day then will she be born in the  0 th month and thus i have more largely demonstrated it to the reader that he may know the reasonable soul is not propagated by the parents but is infused by god when the child has its perfect form and is exactly distinguished in its lineaments  now as the life of every other creature as it is testified in the    th chap of leviticus is in the blood so the life of man consists in the soul the which although subject to passion by reason of the gross composure of the body in which it has a temporary confinement yet it is immortal and cannot in it self corrupt or suffer change it being a spa of the divine mind and a bla of almighty breath that distinguishes man from other creatures and renders him immoal and that every man has a peculiar soul it plainly appears by the vast difference between the wit judgment opinion manners affections etc in men and this david observes when he says god has in particular faoned the hearts and minds of all men and has given to every one its own being and a soul of its own nature hence solomon rejoiced that god had given him a happy soul and body agreeable and suitable to it  it has caused many disputes amongst the learned especially philosophers in what part of the body the soul chooses to reside and some have given their opinion that its residence is in the middle of the heart and from thence communicates its self to every part which solomon in the fourth of his proverbs seems to assert when he says keep thy heart with all thy diligence because life proceeds therefrom but many curious physicians searching the works of nature in mans anatomy etc do give their opinion that its chief seat is in the brain from whence proceed the senses faculties and actions diffusing the operation of the soul through all parts of the body whereby it is enlivened with heat and force but it does communicate particular force to the heart by arteries carotides or sleepy arteries that part upon the throat the which if they happen to be broke or cut cause barrenness and if stopped an apoplexy for there must necessarily be some ways through which the spirits animal and vital may have intercourse and convey native heat from the soul for although the soul is said to reside in one place it operates in every part exercising every member which are the souls instruments by which she manifests her power but if it so happen that any of the original parts are out of tune the work is confused as it may appear in case of idiots madmen etc though in some of them the soul by forcibly working recovers her supernatural vigor and they become right after a long despondency of mind and in some it is lost in this life for as fire under ashes or the sun obscured from our sight by thick clouds afford not their full luster so the soul overwhelmed in moist or faulty matter is darkened and reason thereby overclouded and although reason shines less in children than in those that are arrived to maturity yet no man must imagine that the soul is an infant and grows up with the child for then would it again decay but it suits it self to the weakness of nature and the imbecility of body wherein it is placed that it may the better operate and as the body is more and more capable of receiving its influence so it shows it self in its proper luster having force and endowments at the time it enters the former child in the womb for the substance of it can receive nothing less and thus much to prove that the soul comes not from the parents but is infused by god and the next thing now to be handled is its immortality and thereby i shall demonstrate the certainty of its resurrection  that the soul of man is a divine ray infud by god i have already made apparent and now come to show you that whatever immediately proceeds from him must participate of his nature and from thence consequently be as immortal as the original for although all other creatures are endued with life and motion yet want they a reasonable soul and from thence it is concluded that life is in their blood and that being corruptible they perish and after expiring are no more but man being endued with a reasonable soul and stamped with the divine image is of a different nature and though his body be corruptible yet his soul cannot perish but must when it is expelled its earthly tabernacle return to god that gave it either to receive reward or punishment now that the body can sin of it self is impossible because wanting the soul it cannot act nor proceed to any thing either good or evil for could it do so additional sins might be accumulated even in the grave but it is plain that after death there is a cessation for as death leaves us so judgment finds us and st john in the fifth chapter of his gospel tells us that the hour shall come that all that are in the grave shall hear his voice and they that have done well shall com forth to the resurrection of life and they that have done evil to the resurrection of condemnation and holy job in the    and    chapter speaking to the same purpose says for i know that my redeemer lives and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth and though after  skin worms destroy this body et in my flesh shall i see god when i shall see or my self and mine eyes shall behold and not ther though my reins be consumed within  by this it is plainly proved that the soul is made of immortal essence incapable of death having a place assigned it after its separation from the body tll the day of the general resurrection not in the rave in a mansion prepared by the almighty for its reception and that through the mightyworking of him that is able to subdue all things to himself it shall gain enter the same body that was laid own though the dust thereof be scattered to  four winds of heaven nay such force  vigor shall it have that it shall as  were take up the body for job posively says i shall rise out of the earth at the  day etc which being applicable to  future tense may be meant two ways  shall or will arise plainly foreseeing  resurrection he claimed it as the proise of his creator nay so far were the eathens by the light of nature from ubting the immortality of the soul that plato in his phaedo thus reasons viz what consists out of elements says he is immortal and can never die the soul is not made of elements nor of created matter but came from god and therefore it cannot dye etc then may it be without difficulty granted that the body which has been a long companion of the souls will once again enjoy it never more to be separated for the body at the resurrection shall be incorruptible and so as far from a capacity of perishing any more than the soul made so by him that first created it for st paul speaking of the resurrection says he shall change our vile bodies and make them like his glorious body the consideration of which make him in another place cry out o the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of god how unsearchable are his judgments and his ways past finding out for who has known the mind of the lord or who has  his counselor for by him and through  and to him are all things nay the resurrection of a mans body may be proved by the renewing of many inconsiderable creatures and their returning to life after they seem dead nay some of them thereby also changed as who has not observed that when a grasshopper is grown old and has cast his skin a lively new shrill insect will come forth of it from a dying and uggish caterpiller comes out a lively ainted butterfly from ants a winged ly the silkworm having spent her owels in weaving out her web after may days seeming dead and motionless beomes a butterfly proving for increase  laying a number of eggs and then exires but above all the phaenex that  learned lactantius writes of may put  in mind if not confirm to us the reurrection for after she has lived in the arabian fields as some affirm about  00 ears and finding her self wasted with ge and infirmity she gathers the sprigs f cassi myrrh frankincense and other romatick combustables when laboring ith her wings she firing them by the eat of the sun which in those countries  excessive she expires upon the funeral ile when out of her ashes springs a orm and from that worm another aenez to supply her place nay further  we not behold grain thrown into the round continue there for a season as if st and dead but when warmth and moiure gives it force it springs up and bears  hundredfold yea herbs and plants hilst winter with his icy arms grasps  earth seem dead retiring as it were to the grave and wait the resurrection  the spring but to conclude as to this point the infinite love toward man may convince him that he was not made to be annihilated since the second person of the trinity condescended to take his nature upon him even he who is the wisdom of the father and of whom the wise man testifies it the  d of proverbs viz i was with god in the beginning before any thing  made i was with him from eternity when  compassed in the depth by law i was  when he sustained the heavens above and  earth beneath i was with him ordering  things and was continually delighted before him recreating my self in the earth and  delight was with the sons of men  chap v of monsters and monstrous births and the reson thereof according to the opinion of sudry learned men with serious considerati whether monsters are endued with reasona souls that many monstrous births ha happened contrary to the course  nature is evident not only in this  in former ages wherefore i shall ta some pains for the satisfaction of  reader to enquire into the cause of such preposterous forms  now a monstrous habit or shape of body is contracted diverse ways as from fear sudden frights exstraordinary passion he influence of the stars the mothers strange imaginations and diverse phantasms which the mind conceive deform the body and render the children of an improer shape and many times not perfect in either sex sometimes the whole course of nature is changed either when the principles of generation are vitiated on the organs unfit so that the natural faculties to propogate and form the child cannot perform their office exactly for as the most ingenious artist can bring nothing to perfection if his materials be bad or out of order so nature wanting the force of her faculties or not having fit matter must of necessity proceed to preposterously in forming the child as in the art of melting metals it may be observed if the matter be impure and not well cleansed the vessels or receiver oblique and full of windings not well joined the corners set awry and full of chinks or plates if loosed or holds ill together it is apparent men cast illshaped figures so if the womb or the matter be unfit or ill tempered it is impossible without an extraordinary overruling providence but above all unseasonable or intemperate venery is the cause of so many monstrous shapes  so the low country women especially those living near the seaside being restless and troubled in copulation bring forth misshapen embroys or rude and deformed burdens not only without motion but some that pant and are alive and these most commonly happen in case of sailors or mariners who coming home rashly marry or run upon their wives without any due regard to their menstrual flux or the wombs cleansing it self to the season of the year or the moon or suns progress through the celestial signs not are the women without regard to the health or shape of their posterity less desirous to receive them after a long separation which is not only exceeding hurtful to themselves from thence proceed not monstrous and untimely births only but dangerous diseases often to those who rashly proceed the first say the antiants is because the seed mixing with menstrual blood contract an unnatural mass of corrupt matter which either turns to miscarrage abortion or a monstrous and deformed birth for by that means the faculty of the womb say they loses its force to generation and success of breeding the child or if it try to come to any thing it is at most some monstrous form not shaped like a man unless in some parts which after a long continuance in the womb will come forth with great pain and labor not like to this there is an efflux that greatly trobles such as by their inconsiderate rashness are subject to it  our women because conception begins in the forth moon when the menses flow down by force and that planet in conjunction call it a moonbirth or many kinds and some are of opinion that this copulation may be made without the help of a man by force of imagination in those that are extremely lascivious for that by often feeling and touching their husbands at the same time strongly fancying themselves in the act their seed flows to the blood and is by the heat of the womb formed into a foul mass but arrives at no perfection and to the same purpose is it when men strive against the stream entering into copulation in the forth and silent moon and in the forth day of its conjunction for then not observing natures rules he either loses his labor or generates a monstrous birth or if it chance which is almost next to a miracle to be perfect it is by the latins called a birth of the fourth moon because the product is commonly unhappy in all the series of its life having had its entrance by generation contrary to natures orders which moses considering or being so commanded by god strictly commanded the hebrew men not to touch a woman that was unclean of her blood and those that have been so rashly profligate of either sex have many times by sad experience found their wilful folly too late but especially the female sex for by the violent concussion and motion used in copulation and evil mixture the contagion by degrees will seize upon the whole body causing the pox and leprosy the like effects i has upon men if the woman be infected especially if he deal with whores at such times who commonly are infected and may be accounted so many walkingcontagions or emissaries of the prince o darkness for the destruction of mankind and at this day the greatest pest and grievance of the nation  these things rightly considered no man need wonder at so many misshapen births and monstrous people with scaldheads bowed and distorted legs arms and backs wry necks crumpled feet incident to swellings in the groin buboes and emeroids as also that their minds are dull stupid forgetful foolish mad and unreasonable which attended the effects of unseasonable and unreasonable venery which every creature but man observes in the season nature has allotted and when their female have conceived they desire no longer but rest satisfied  therefore let man who is endued with a rational soul and ought above all other creatures to have dominion over his appetite and affection consider how cruel he is to his posterity that brings such mischief upon them and chiefly they are here to be understood that are conceived in the fourth moon when the womans natural flux is upon her therefore all men ought to restrain neither should the woman dare to copulate with man as better knowing when that is upon her than some rash inconsiderate and unexperienced novices of the masculine gender do for the children then conceived want all or most of those gifts and properties that children begotten at seasonable times are endued withal being capable of nothing that is good nor great and if it so happen they do any thing well they have ill success in their undertakings by reason their natural faculties are short not by their own but their parents fault who undecently in procreation violate natures law whence it is that many things are wanting to them or else give them sparingly and with some ill qualities that others obtain bountifully and then suffer no less loss in their mind for they want almost their common senses and are extreme dull without the sharpness of wit quickness of invention council and prudence that others have laviius leminus a famous physician tells of a monstrous birth from his own knowledge the relation of which i take in his words as i find them in his book of generation in former years says he there was a woman an islander who had married a mariner that took physic of me and after copulation having conceived by him her belly began to swell to such a vast magnitude that one would have thought it could not have held to support the burden when nine months were expired the midwife was called and first with great trouble she was delivered of a rude lump which i conceive was a superfatation after a lawful conception there was fastened unto it on both sides two handles like two arm for the length and the fashon of them it panted and seemed to be alive as sea fishes called vatica and by the dutch elschowe which float in the sea in summer in infinite numbers and being taken out they run abroad and when you handle them melt with a burning and prickling left behind them whence they had their name after this a monster came forth of her womb with a crooked back long round neck and fiery eyes and a pointed tail being very nimblefooted for as soon as it came forth it gave the affrighted midwife the slip and run up and down the room to seek a hiding place till at last one woman more courageous than the rest fell upon it with a cushion and smothered it this monster had sucked the blood from the child which came forth after it being a male and so eaten the flesh that it scarcely lived to be christened nor could the woman be in a long time restored to her strength and farther adds that upon his enquiry she told him that it had proceeded as she thought from unreasonable and extraordinary and insatiate venery hereupon says he i prescribed her a wholesome course of life and medicines to restore her forces for she was become wonderful lean  these and many such like things should teach all men and women to use decency and orderly proceedings in their mutual embracings lest nature wronged thereby monstrous births ensue in which respect some lascivious people are much to be condemned who suppose they may do what they list and will by no means have their pleasure bounded and above all pocket and gouty people are most lascivious the one through the heat contracted in the blood and the other through the polite windiness passes through the veins and afflicts the nerves others again observe not whether their stomach be full or empty or the meat be raw or digested whether it be by day or night nay never regard the season or opportunity of time but as their lusts and desires prompts them but such insatiable lechers are or at least seem to be wilfully ignorant to what end they were created male and female which was to beget children and propagate their kind not for obscene purposes and beastly pleasures but at last they pay for their unruly lust when the disorder of body as aches gout and many diseases contracted thereby rack and torment them  the last thing in this chapter to be considered is whether monstrous births have reasonable souls and whether such shall appear at the day of resurrection in discussing of which i shall cite the opinions of such learned divines and physicians as have made curious search and diligently weighed these great mysteries and first it is their opinion not jointly but several that all those that are like men according to the rder of generation deduced from our primitive parents proceeded by natural means from either sex though they are deformed and of monstrous shape having notwithstanding a reasonable soul shall when they have run the date of mortality be capable of resurrection to immortality but those that proceed not from man but by the womans unnaturally mixing with other creatures shall not participate of immortality but perish as brute beasts because such a monstrous birth is not capacitated to receive a divine part or soul which should entail him to the resurrection  there are indeed amongst the number of men and women that tread the terrestial globe diverse that are monstrously deformed and of horrid aspect with distorted jaws and goggleeyes and many other marks of deformity but these though by their parents rashness in indecent or unseasonable copulation or the defect of nature being thus disordered yet are they referred to the number of men and women because they speak understand and act which demonstrate them to have reasonable souls and therefore shall they stand upon the earth at the last day and at the resurruction all deformity shall be done away and they shall appear in perfect shape and the organical parts render the soul that shall then return a free scope to act and operate but imperfect and abortve births or mischances where the limbs are not fashoned or very imperfect want a reasonable soul it not being as yet infused by the almighty shall have no part in the resurection  many phisicians there are and indeed most of them make diffrence between a mischance and abortion the former of which say they is when there is a conception but through the slipperiness or weakness of the womb it drops out ever any shape is contracted being only a rude unframed mass properly called rudiments of a child that should have been and a shadow of what was begun but abortion often times shows the parts of the infant perfectly composed which if it be cast forth by fright or untimely force and has not accomplished the day to receive the soul then it shall not participate of immortality but if it be quick and cast out though it live not an our after it is first enlivened then it has received an imortal soul for although many things are wanting in it and it come not to its full magnitude yet in the resurrection all shall be made up that time would have produced and as children have many things inpossibility that with times progress shows themselves as teeth nails hair and fullstature of body which increases by degrees and come to perfections so in the resurection all things that are defective shall be made perfect whosoever therefore is both of the seed of man and not of some foul matter or vicious humor concurring though his shape be monstrous yet as i said he shall rise again from death to life all defects being repared by the divine powers that then will manifest it self no less then in creation nay more for st austin is of the opinion it is easier to create men then to raise them when they are dead etc though the earthly matter wherever scattered is not perished in sight of god who can with his word recall it from the four winds of heaven and restore it to its pristin vigor nay though vanished into air and other elemnets or what leanness or hunger have consumed or diseases have wasted or what is burnt to ashes or is passed in the first principles or in the substance of some other body for the flesh shall be restored to whom it was taken as his due that was borrowed from him by he mighty working of him who is able o subdue all things to himself those that are men shall find this to be true and those monstrous shapes that proceed from them endued with rational souls and participating the same nature with them shall participate the same benefit of the resurrection  chap vi a more peculiar and exact treatise of this happy estate of matrimony as it is appointed by and the true felicity that redounds thereby  either sex and to what end it was ordained certainly the joining of hearts in a matrimonial state is of all conditions the happiest for then a man has whom to unravel his thoughts to as well as a sweet companion in his labor he has an ternus sensus another self one in whose breast as in a safe cabinet is reposed his inmost secrets especially where reciprocal love and inviolate faith is centred for there no cares fears jealousies mistrust o hatred can ever interpose for what man as it is observed in holy writ ever hated his own flesh and indeed a wife is no less  rightly considered for our grand paren well observed she is or ought to be so esteemd of every honest man bone of hi bone and flesh of his flesh etc nor wa it the least care of the almighty to ordain so near a union and especially for two causes the first for increase of posterity the second to bridle and bound mans wandering desires and affections nay that they might be yet happier when god had joined them together he blessed them as it is in the  d of genesis colamela no mean author considering and contemplating on this happy state tells us out of the economy of xenophon that matrimonial conjunction appointed by nature is not only the most pleasant but profitable course of life that may be entered on for the preservation and increase of posterity wherefore since the harbor of marriage is most safe sure and delightful station of mankind who is exceeding prone by the dictates of nature to propagate his like he does in no wise provide amiss for his own tranquillity who enters it especially when he comes to maturity of years for there are many abuses and errors in marriage contrary to what is ordained the which in the ensuing chapter i shall expose to view but to proceed  seeing our blessed savior and his apostles detested obscene and unlawful lusts and pronounced those to be excluded the kingdom of heaven that polluted themselves with adultery and whoring i cannot conceive any objection be made hereto or what face such lewd persons can have to color their impieties who hating matrimony make it their study how they may live freely and licentiously without marriage but certainly in so doing they rather seek to themselves torment anxiety and disquietude than certain pleasure besides the hazard of their immortal souls for certain it is that mercenary love or as the wise man calls them harlots smiles cannot he true and sincere and therefore not pleasant but rather a net laid to betray such as thrust them into all mischief as solomon observes by the young man who turned aside to an harlots house going said he as a bird to the snare of the fowler or as an ox to the slaughter till a dart is struck through the liver nor in this case can they have children those sweet and endearing pledges of conjugal love or if they have they will rather redound to their shame than comfort harlots likewise are like swallows singing and chattering to their morning walk and summer season of prosperity but the black stormy winter of adversity coming they take wing and pass into other regions to expand themselves before a warmer sun but a virtuous chaste wife fixing entire love upon her husband and submitting to him as her head and him by whose direction she ought to steer in all lawful courses will like a faithful companeon share paitiently with him in both adversities run with cheerfulness through all difficulties and dangers though never so hazardous to preserve or assist him in poverty sickness or whatever else is incide to human frailty acting acording to her duty in all things when a roud imperious harlot will do no more hen she list even in the prosperous day and is lik a horseleach ever craving and ever satis fied still seeming displeased if she ave not every thing she desires not regardng the ruin and misery of him she with flatterng and feigning charms pretends to admire and  upon him using to confirm her hypocrisy with crocodiles tears vows and swoonings when her gallant is to depart for a while  seems to deny her imodrate desire but his lasts no longer then she can gratify her appetite and prey upon his fortunes conradus gesner tells us a story that  young man traveling from athens to hebes met by the way a beautiful lady  to his appearance she seemed adorned with all perfections of beauty glittering with gold and precious stones who salued him and invited him to her house in an djacent vilage pretending to be exceedingly namourd of him and declard she had a long ime watched the opportunity to find him aone that she might declare the extreme passion she conceived for him when he came to her house he found it to appearance very sumptuously built and gloriously furnished with whatever could seem costly and gay which so far wrought upon his covetous inclination that he resolved to put off his intended journey and comply with her desire but whilst she was leading him to see the pleasant places came by  holy pilgrim who peceiving in what danger the youth was resolved to see him in his righ senses and show him what he imagined real was quite otherwise so that by powerful prayer the mist was taken from before the youths eyes whenas he beheld his lady ugly deformed and monstrous and tha whatever had appeared gloreous and beautiful was only trash then he made her confes what she was and her design upon the young man which she did saying she was a lamiae or fury and that she had enchanted hi on purpose to get him unto her power that she might devour him this passage may  fitly alluded to harlots who draw thos that follow their misguided lights into places of danger and difficulty even til they have shipwracked their fortunes and leave them to struggle with the tempestuous waves of adversity but on the contrary a loving chaste and eventempered wife seeks what she may to peve such danger striving on the one hand to preserve it as much as the other does to destroy it and in a word as there is no content in the embraces of a harlot so there is no joy greater than in reciprocal love and the indearing embraces of a loving obedient and chaste wife nor is that the principal end for which matrimony was ordained but further that man might lawfully procreate his like and increase his generation to replenish the earth to conclude a virtuous wife is a crown and ornament to her husband and her price is above rubies but the ways of an harlot are deceitful  chap vii of errors in marriage and what they too frequently are and the prejudice that arises thereby if any be desirous to enter into the holy state of matrimony let them observe their ability and constitution of body and not run themselves rashly upon inconveniences for those who marry too young may rightly be termed to marry unseasonably not considering their inability nor examining the force of nature as diverse there are before they are ripe for the consummation of so weighty a matter who either rashly of their own accords by the instigation of bawds procures or marriagebrokers or forced thereto by their parents who covet a larg dowrey take upon them this yoke to their great prejudice lavinus lemnius says that he has known some of them who before the expiration of a year have been thereby so infeebled and weakened that all their vital moisture was exausted so that he was upon their applying themselves to him obliged with medicaments to restore their strength that was fallen and sunk down wherefore his advice is that it is no way convenient to suffer children or such as are not of age to mary or get children but whosoever proposes to marry must chieft observe this that he choose one to his companion and partner in his felicity that is of an honest stock and proceeding from temperate parents though her dowry be not so large as he could wish that he observe the conversation and find therein that she is chaste well bred and of good manners for a woman as the comedian says if she has good conditions she has portion enough that of alcamena in plautus is a witty saying which all maids and others of the female sex should retain show in remembrance i do not think says she that to be my dowry which is called so but chastity modesty and a settled desire to fear god to love my parents and agree with my kindred to obey my husband to be bountiful and to do good to such as are virtuous and honest now if she proved as good as she promised such a wife was to be valued above the price of rubies  it is duty incombent upon parents to be careful in bringing up their children in the way of virtue and have ever a regard that they fully not their honor and reputation especially the females and most of all virgins when they grow up to be marriageble for if through the unnatural severity of rigid parents they be crossed and frustrated in their love many of them out of a mad humor if temptations lie in their way throw themselves into the unchaste arms of a subtle charming tempter being through ahe softness of good nature and strong desire to pursue their appetites easily induced to believe mens flatteries and feigned vows of promised marriage to cover the shame and then too late the parents find the effects of their rash severity which brought a lasting stain upon their family now as it is an error in marrying too young so it is unequality of marriage between age and youth as a young man who to make his fortune marries to a woman that for age might be his grandmother between whom for the most part jealousies and discontents happen nor is it possible such women should have children be the man never so sprightly and young the like may be said though with a little more excuse when an old doting fellow marries a young virgin in the summer season of her youth and vigor who whilst he strives and vainly strains to please her is the sooner wedded to the grave for as in childhood or green youth it is unfit and unreasonable to think of marriage so in old age to marry unequal is altogether the same for they that enter upon it too soon are soon exhausted and fall into consumption and diverse other diseases and those that procrastinate and marry unseemly fall into the like ill conveniences on the other side having only the honor to be dubbed a knight of the forked order and have their names enrolled in the collony of cuckoldom especially if their wives have not been trained up in the paths of virtue and lie to much open to importunity and temptation of lewd and debanched men and thus much for errors or oversights in rash and unseasonable preposterous marriages  chap viii the opinions of the learned concerning children conceived and born within the space of seven months with lively arguments upon the subject to prevent suspicions of incontinency and the bitter contests that thereon too often arise between man and wife to which is added rules for knowing the disposition of mans body by the general parts certain it is that many bitter quarrels have arisen through misunderstanding when solid reason would have rectified the judgment and have prevented the conception of such an evil and from whence does this arise but through suspicion and jealousy when indeed it is many times founded upon a slender foundation as the new married womans being brought to bed before the expiration of nine months which is vulgarly taken from the time of conception to the birth to remove which groundless suspicion i shall endeavor not that i it is common dare i avouch but that it is possible and has been frequently known that children have been born at seven months but the matter being wholly left  the lawyers who decide controversies to the phisicians to judge of it is in their power to determine by inspecting the child whether it is a child of seven eight nine or ten months paul the councellor has this passage in his ninettenth book of pleadings viz it is now a received truth that a perfect child may be born in the seventh month by the authority of the learned hypocrates and therefore we must believe that a child born at the end of the seventh month in lawful matrimony may be lawfully begotten galen in chap   of his third book handles this argument but rather according to mens opinion then according to the truth of the business or from natural reasons who supposes there is no certain time set for bearing cheldren and from the authority of pliny who makes mention of a woman that went thirteen months with child but as to what concerns the seventh month says lemnus i know many married people in holland that had twins who lived extreme old age their bodies lusty and their minds apt and lively wherefore their opinion is foolish and of no moment who asserts that at seven months a child cannot be perfect and long lived and that he cannot in all parts be perfect till the ninth month and thereupon this learned author proceeds to tell a passage from his own knowledge as follows of late says he there happened a great disturbance amongst us which ended not without bloodshed and was occasioned by a virgin whose chastity had been violated descending of  noble family and ever before that time held to be of unspotted fame now seveal there were who charged the matter upon a person of note viz a judge president of a city in flanders who strongly denied the fact saying that he was ready o swear it upon the holy evangelist that he never had carnal copulation with her and that he would by no means therefore e taken for the father of the child that was not his and further alleged that he erily believed that it was a child born in even months and that himself was many miles distant from the mother of it when t was conceived whereupon the judges before whom the hearing was decreed that the child should be viewed by the ble physicians as also experienced women and that they should make their report who having made diligent inquiry all of them with one accord concluded the child without respecting who was the father was a child born within the space of seen months that it was carried in the mothers womb but twenty seven weeks and ome odd days but if she could have carried it to   months the childs parts and limbs would have been more firm and strong and the structure of the body more compact and fast for the skin was exceeding loose and the breast bone that defends the heart and the swordlike gristle that lies over the stomach were hige than naturally they should be not plain bu crooked and sharpridged or pointed lik those of young chickens that are hatche in the beginning of the spring and ben a female infant it wanted its nails upon her fingers and the utmost joints of he fingers upon which from the musculou or cartilaginous matter of the skin nai that are very smooth do come and by degrees harden she had instead of nails thin skin or film as for her toes the was not the least appearance of nails bout them by reason that they wanted  heat that was communicated to the figers from the nearness of the heart the and the like weighty matters being considred and above all one gentlewoman  quality that assisted affirms that  had been the mother of    children an that diverse of them had been born an lived at   months they without favor any made their report that the infant  a child of   months annd so must be acounted though it was born within the venth month for that in such cases the revolution or circuit of the mood ought to be observed which perfects it self in   bare weeks or somewhat less than    days in which space of her revolution the blood being agitated by the moons force the courses of the woman flow from them which being spent and the matrix cleansed from the menstrual blood which happens on the  th day then if on the  th day a man lie with his wife the copulation is most natural and the conception best and a child then gotten may be born in the  th month and prove very healthful so that upon this report the supposed father was pronounced innocent upon proof that he was  00 miles distance all that month in which the child was begot and as for the mother she strongly denied that she knew the father being forced in the dark and that through fear and surprise was left in ignorance  as for coition it ought not be had unless the parties be in health lest it turn to the disadvantage of the children so begotten creating in them through the abundant ill humors diverse lingering and languishing diseases wherefore health is no where better to be discerned than by the genitals of the man wherefore midwives and other skilful women in former days were wont to see the testicles of children thereby to conjecture or guess at their temper or state of body and young men may know thereby the signs or symptoms of life and death for if the cases of the testicles be loose and feeble and the gods fall down it denotes the natural faculties and the vital spirits which are the proper props of life are fallen but if the secret part be wrinkled and raised up it is a sign all will be well but that the event may exactly answer the prediction it is necessary to consider what part of the body the disease possesses for if it chance to be the upper part that is afflicted as the head or stomach then will it not so well appear by the members which frequently are unconcerned with such grievances but the lower part of the body exactly sympathizing with them their liveliness on the contrary makes it apparent for natures force and the spirits that have their intercourse first manifest themselves therein which occasions midwives to feel the genitals of children to know in what part the grief is resident and whether life or death be portended thereby the symptoms being strongly communicated by the vessels that have their intercourse with the principal seat of life  chap ix the cause of the green sickness in virgins with its symptoms and directions for its cure together with the chiefest occasion of barrenness in women and by what means to remove the cause and render them fruitful the former of these inconveniences is too apparent in virgins especially such as are of a phlegmatic complexion evidently showing it self by discoloring the face in making it look green pale or of a dusky yellow which proceeds from raw undigested humors nor only does it appear to the eye but sensibly afflicts such as it possesses with difficulty of breathing pains in the head palpitations of the heart unusual beatings and small throbings of the arteries in the temples neck and back many times casting them into fevers if the humor be very vicious also loathing of meat and the distension of the hypocondriack part by reason of the inordinate efflux of the menstruous blood to the greater vessels and by reason of the abundance of humor the whole body is often troubled with swelling or if not at least the thighs legs and ankles all above the heels and also there is a weariness of the whole body without any reason at all for it  the galenits say that this distemper proceeds chiefly from the obstruction of those vessels that are about the womb occasioned by the abundance of gross viscid and crude humors arising from the several inward causes but there are also outward  which have a share in the production of i as taking cold in the feet drinking of water intemperance in diet and also the eating of things wholly contrary to nature viz raw or burnt flesh ashes coals old sos chalk wax nutshells mortar lime oatmeal tobaecopipes which occasion not only a suppression of the menses but likewise obstructions through the whole body therefore the first thing necessary to eradicate the cause is matrimonial conjunction and such copulation that may prove to the satisfaction of her that is afflicted for by that means the menses will begin to flow according to their natural and due course and the humors being diffused and dispersed will soon waste themselves and then no more matter being administered to increase them they will vanish and a good temperament of body will return but in case such a conjunction cannot be had so soon as necessity requires then let the damsel blood in the ankle and if she be about    you may likewise do it in the arm though suffer her not to bleed overmuch especially if the blood be good if the disease be of any continuance then it is to be eradicated by purgation perpetration of the humor being first considered which may be done by the virgins drinking decoction of cuaiacum with dittany of creet but the best purge in this case ought to be made of aloes agarick  rhubr and then for strengthening the bowels and opening obstructions chlyheet medicines are chiefly to be used the diet must be moderate and sharp things as vinegar etc to be by all means avoided and for the unobstructing of the humor take prepared steel bezoarstone the root of scorzonera and the oil of crystal in small wine and let the diet be moderate but in no wise let vinegar be used therewith nor upon any other occasion and in so doing observing the humors will be dilated dissipated and transfused by which means the complexion will return and the body be lively and full of vigor and now since barenness daily occasions discontent and that discontent creates difference between man and wife or by immoderate grief frequently calls the woman into one or other violent distemper i shall somewhat largely treat thereof  sterility proceeds from diverse causes but most commonly from some defect in the organs of generation upon the womans part it most commonly happens from the strict closure of the mouth of the womb which will not admit the seed and sometimes from the straitness of the sharebone which denies entrance to the penis sometimes also from ulcers or exorescences in the neck of the womb to these may be added too much fatness which straitens the passage of the matrix  most of the ancients are of opinion that conception is hindered commonly by the humidity and moisture of the womb when by reason thereof it cannot retain the seed or by bad humors heaped up there and corrupting it or strange defect of the menstruous blood but certain it is that it proceeds either from some tumor ulcer excrescence or by some faults or other of the womb ovaria or oviducts for if the eggs are not impregnated with the aura virilis or seminal spirits there can be no conception the testicles of women having no such office as those of men but containing eggs analogous to those of fowl and other creatures  now if the orifice of the womb be closed that the seed cannot enter or rather the two wings or nymphae so far that the penis cannot pass the neck of the womb it must be opened with an instrument and subject to this defect in nature are many women especially in hot countries but most of all in egypt where the chyrurgeons are forced with silver instruments to make way for the instrument of generation a thing not altogether unpracticable in england  in case the neck of the womb be so strait that the yard cannot enter then is the case to be  whter t be naturally  from some swelling or  thin or without and if any  it is or the most part  it be a natural straitness  tent dipped in oil  of eggs and drink  sweetened with sugar candy  and evening and by the operatin thereof the womb will in all parts  or if it so happen in a young  nature will increase the passage and  produce things fitting to their  satisfactin but let no man by viole endeavor to force the passage  the vessels nay endanger  it self which has been broke with such violent intrusion and so cost the woman her life  if the neck of the womb be ulcerated or any excrescences happen there which equally hinder copulation then may they be known by the pain and shooting upon the least compressure and the issuing forth of putrid humor and sometimes blood if the ulcers be great and the menses flow the water hot pains arising in the forepart of the head and oftentimes they occasion gentle fevers  and all these obstructins of generation happen diverse ways sometimes from external causes viz rash physic hard labors or excessive copulation and sometimes from internal as the corruption of the secudine the courses too long retained or obstructed heat and overflowing of the vrinal vessels viulent gonorrheas pox inflammations turned into aposthumes humors flowing from diverse parts of the body and settling there all which must be duly considered  now some are in the outward part and may be the easier come at and external applicaions are most convenient to be applied thereto but those that cannot be come at must be cured if possible by injection the best injection in this case is as follows viz  break four eggs and take the whites only the which heat with an equal quantity of rose water mingled with plantainwater litharge of gold camphire boleamoniack ceus of each a dram half a dram of green coperas all which well beaten dissolved and mixed together strained through a fine cloth and with a syring eject it morning and evening till the gref cease and if it smart that it cannot well be endured you may sometimes inject warm milk to cleanse the putrified matter  others there are that are not so violent and therefore admit of any easy cure not being so deep known by a putrid greenish matter that flows from them to cure this take water wherein barley has been boiled honey of roses new milk and sugar with the decoction of lentils and after that gentle astringents must be applied some again are sordid having much contagious humor flowing from them to cure which stronger medicaments must be applied others there are that eat into the flesh having a green contagion flowing from them to cleanse which aloes and wormwood concocted in white wind are most requisite  another sort of ulcers there are which appear long eating away the skin from off the neck of the womb and are discerned by the blood and pain they occasion immediately upon the concression appearing in the neck of the womb much like chilblains occasioned by ill lying extraordinary venery by violent inflammation or flux of sharp humors the best cure after a gentle purge is an astringent clyster and after that to anoint them with the grease that fryes out of a ladle often used in a kitchen when it is held to the fire mixed with vnguentum album or pomatum if the defect be in the seed through tenderness of age in the woman then the best remedy is convenient diet moderate exercise and temperate air together with the patience in the man till nature in process of time operates so effectually that all things appear and conspire to mutual satisfaction  if the woman be stricken in years and the time of breeding children be past which in some happens sooner and others later according to their several constitutions but generally between    and    unless strong preparatives viz an extraordinary diet easy lodging and a moderate exercise restore them those women must despair of further generation for as the learned in this art frequently observe where is neither buds nor blossoms can be no fruit  if sterility be occasioned by obstructions in the vessels which it often does then the cause must be enquired into and this often happens the which is known by the small desire to venery and that little or no satisfaction received thereby a settling in the courses and a slimy phlegmatic matter mixed therewith as also by their inordinate flowing occasioned by the plenty of humors collected in the womb which by reason of the abundance of windy vapors contracted therein cause obstructions to which may be added a cold phlegmatic constitution and from thence it is that sudden paleness arises in the face to remedy this the party must alter her diet not eating any cold raw phlegmatic substance but rather such things as are apt to stir up choleric hot humors in the body as anniseeds or carrawayseeds in her bread store of pennyroyal in her broth let her likewise each morning for a week together make a posse in which she must boil the roots of birthwort angelica sage rosemary cinnamon and borage the taking the male herb mercury dittany centaury marigolds cubebs saffron mugwort and clovegilliflowers of each a handful boil them in white wind and eject the concoction by little and little at sundry times as the cold or obstruction can be perceived anointing the belly and reins of the back one day with oil of cinnamon next with the oil of nutmeg or mace and the third with the oil of myrrh and so continuing to do for a  together when the woman lies down nature will be wonderfully restored and recover such force as to remove the obstruction  many there are that conceive barrenness is frequently caused by inchantation but those opinions are altogether frivolous and vain  if the womb be defective in its retentive faculty men frequently labor in vain in such a case the women must avoid sorrow anger or much sleep eating new cheese milk and raw food especially lettuce endive spinach beets nuts cherries pussane onions garlic and the like they all being hurtful to generation nor must she drink nor use vinegar nor eat the fat of met too frequently but the womb must be cleansed from the overaundant moisture with the decoction of hatstongue an herb so called cummin fennel and aniseed and strengthened with the syrup of wormwood and for a gentle operative purge in this case take half an ounce of laudanum beeswax sheeps suet and agarick of each a like quantity melt and bruise them after which make them up into little pills and take three in the morning and next to them take of this confection to the bigness of a nutmeg viz the shavings of ivory ashkeys yellow and wild rpeseed silvermontanus with red and white behen of each one dram cinnamon galinga longpepper cloves and mace balsamwood rosemaryflowers blatiae bezaria gentlemarjoram and pennyroyal of each   scruples balm bugloss citrons reils of each   scruples pearl dissolved or beaten to powder one scruple musk two grains white sugar one pound and an half bruise them and sees them over a gentle fire in as much malmsey as will make them into a confection this confection is indeed of a most singular and approved one in all cases on barrness where cold or obstructions of the vessels do occasion weakness in the womb  other causes of barrenness there are when the womb grows ft as we have said before o that the caul swelling and bearing beyond its bounds with its fatness obstructs the passage into the womb to prevent which the woman must not sleep overmuch especially in the daytime nor feed riotously but exercise her self in walking or moderate exercises and often use purgation and strong glisters made of herbs and drugs that are hot and dry which will in a short time remove such obstructions  but a more dangerous cause of barrenness than yet i have named are the whites which are contracted by an inordinate erudition of an excrementous humor collected through the vitiousness of the blood incident to young and old at such times as they are capable of generation and therefore the cure must be hastened by reason that in short time it derides art and renders women inevitably barren occasioning leanness consumption melancholy dropsy falling of the womb swooning  which renders it difficult and dangerous in long continuance though in the beginning it may be easily removed in the cure of this let phlebotomy or bloodletting be avoided for as much as the bad humor must be by no means recalled to dense the blood the disease it self being a sufficient weakening of the body and vital spirits first then to discuss the humor in order to its expurgation take two ounces of guaiacum the like quantity of china and leutickwood boil them in water and honey drinking a pint fresh made every morning then to dry up the contraction of the vessels or humors that lodged there take the root of filipendula beat it to powder and drink it in white wind morning and evening as also for astringents use bones burnt and beat to powder likewise the ashes of capons dung ejected after a long time steeping in fair water the patient must likewise avoid sleeping upon her back lest the humor descend and contract in the vessels of the womb but let her be rubbed often to disperse them that they settle not in any one place  sometimes this occasion of barrenness happens through the violent attraction of the womb and then appears signs of afflictions of the womb the flux not being so great to cure which suffumations are the most proper and those may be made of frankincense laudanum santalum or mastick the woman upon such occasion having great regard to her self that she take not cold or proceed to intemperate diet  many women there are whose violent lusts contracts a heat that either destroys the eggs or hinders them from being impregnated in this case it is requisite to avoid hot air soft lying hot meats and spices and requisite to bleed in the basilick vein purge moderately with decoctum epithymi and juice of roses each two drams and a half whey half a pint mix them together and drink them fasting in the morning and so to continue   hours after or for want of the former you may take trifera saasenica and rhubarb of each half a dram pulverized and mixed with   ounces of syrup of roses violets or endive but the most excellent restorative to cool and moderate the temper in this case is dietdrink made as follows viz take pistachianuts and eringoroots of each half an ounce of saffron a dram lignumaloes galinga carophilata mace red and white behen and balmflowers of each   scruples shavings of ivory rhind of cassia each   scruples syrup of confected ginger    ounces white sugar   ounces add to these    ounces of balmwater and set them over a gentle fire permitting them to sees then take it off suffer it to cool and put more water to it stirring the ingredients lastly increasing them with a scruple and a half of musk and amber then strain the liquid part and boil t up again into a conserve of which let the woman eat three times a day but not exceeding the bigness of a walnut at a time the times most convenient are mornings noons and nights and this let her continue till she inds her body in temper  another sort of barrenness proceeds from the obstruction of those vessels through which the monthly purgatione low in which case open the basilick vein and take from thence a moderate quantity f blood after which take hiera composita and opponax of each half a dram and  dram of syrup of gilliflowers make them into   pills take them in the moring and sleep upon them a considerable ime then drink off half a pint of sugared water and   hours after a proportion of syrup of vinegar compounded for want of this take syrup of eupatory   quarers of an ounce female mugwort and elecampaneroot of each an ounce with syrup of vinegar a proportionable quantiy mix them together and take them when made into an electuary morning and evening to the quantity of a hazelnat at a time and if the courses flow not within a short time after let a pessary of musk amber wood of alloes and ash keys of each two grains saffron half a scruple hares renet an ounce be put into the womb tentwise and continue there for the space of a day and it will remove the obstruction cause the course to flow and in a short time render the woman capable of generation and thus reader have i with much caution performed my promise in these particulars and the next thing i shall proceed to amongst other matters relating to the mystery of generation are the signs of virginity etc  chap x virginity what it is in what it consists and how violated together with the opinions of the learned in the point of mutation of sexes in the womb during the operation of nature in framing the body seeing many ignorant people have boasted of their knowledge as to the first particular and some virgins have undergone hard censure through the ignorant determinations of such as have taken upon them to discuss the matter i thought it altogether necessary to clear the point that so for the future the conceited might not be indulged in their own opinion nor by traducing others prejudice the female sex whose virtues are frequently such as do not require our admiration but imitation then since the mysterious word iginity has puzzled many to define it i an the cause from whence it arises for  word barely in it self signifies the ime chief or best of any thing but as  the point in hand the main matter bears  following construction it is observed  the curious searchers into natures seets that in young maids or females in  sinus pudoris or in that place that is by me called the neck of the womb is that endulous production vulgarly called  hymen but more rightly the claustrum irginale and in french it is termed the teon de rose or roies bud for that it uch resembles the bud of a rose expaned or a clovegilliflower from whence derived the word deflora to deslower  the deflowering of virgins because most  of opinion that the virginity is altogeer annihilated when this duplication is actured and dissipated by violence and at when it is found perfect and entire  penetration has been made also some earned physicians are of opinion that ere is not either hymen or skin expaned containing blood in it which diverse magine in the first copulation flows from he fractured expanse  now this claustrum virginale or flow is as it were composed or consisting o caruncles or little buds like myrtleberr which in virgins are full and plump but women flag and hang loose and these  placed in the four angles of the sinus doris joined or held together by  membranes and ligatures like fibr each of them situate in the intesticles spaces between each caruncle with wh in a manner they are proportionably stended which membranes being once  lacerated denote devirgination and macurious coxcombs prying into this  the first night of their marriage and findi their wives defective in this point ha ever after held them in evil esteem concding it happened through the effect of coplation with some other who had been etertained in the chambers of venus n one i knew that upon this vain fancy to such conceit that he would never go to  with his wife when to undeceive  idiots it is affirmed by the learned  such fracture may happen diverse ways accidents as well as copulation with  viz by extraordinary straining viole coughing immoderate sneezing stoppi of urine and violent motion of the vesse in forcibly sending down the humou which pressing for passage break the gatures or membrane so that the intireness or fracture of this thing commonly taken for the virginity or maidenhead is no absolte sign of dishonesty though crtain it is that in coplation it is more frequenty broke than othewie  once at in assize hld for the county of rutland a young man was put upon trial of life and death which yal was founded upon an idctment for forcing a virgin when  dvers questons asked and the maid sweaing positively to the matter naming the time place and manner of the action it was upon mature elbration resolved that she should be searched by a skifl chyrurgion and two midwives who were to make their report upon their oaths which after due examination they accordingly did affirm that the membranes were entire and not dilacerated and that it was their opinion for that reason that her body had not been penetrated which so far wrought upon the jury that the prisoner was acquitted and the maid afterward confessed she swore against him ot of revenge because he had promised to marry her and then declined it and thus much concerning virginity and now i shall proceed to the second particular which is reader to show you the opinions of diverse learned men in relation to natures operation in changing sexes in the womb  this point is of much necessity by reason of the different opinions of men relating to it therefore before any thing positive can be asserted it will be altogether convenient to recite what has been delivered as well in the negative as the affirmative and first of the first severus plinius who argues for the negatives writes thus the genital parts says he of both sexes are one so unlike other in substance composition situation figure action and use that nothing is more unequal and by how much more all other parts of the body the breast excepted which in women swell more because of their secondary use have an exact resemblance so much the more in resemblance are the genital parts of one sex compared with the other unalike and if their figure be thus different much more is their use the venerial appetite also proceeds from different causes for in men it proceeds from a desire of emission and in women from a desire o completion in women also the chief of those parts are concave and apt to receive but in men they are only por and in a woman solid  these things considered i cannot bu wonder added he how any one can imagine that the genital member of femal births should be changed into those that be ong to males since by those parts only he difference and distincton of sexes is made nor can i well impute the reason of his vulgar error to any thing but the miake of unexpert midwife who have een deceived by the evil confirmation of he parts which in some male births may ave happened to have had some small protrusion not to have been discerned as ppeard by the example of a child christened at paris by the name of joan as fit had been a girl when as afterward  proved a boy and on the contrary the overfar extension of the clytoris in female births may have occasioned the like miakes thus far plyny proceeds in the neative yet notwithstanding his negation here are not wanting diverse learned phycians that have asserted the affirmative of which number galen is one a man says  is different from a woman in nothing se but having his genital members without  body and this is certain that if nare having formed a man would convert im into a woman she has no other task to perform but to turn his genital members inward and a woman into a man y doing the contrary but this is to be nderstood of the child when it is in the womb and not perfectly formed for diverse times nature has made a femal child and it has so remained in the belly o the mother for a month or two and afterwards plenty of heat increasing in the genital members upon some oceasion they have issued forth and the child has becom a male yet retaining some certain gestures unbefitting the masculine sex as femal actions a shrill voice and more feeble tha ordinary contrariwise nature havin often made a male and cold humor flowing to it the genitals have been inverted yet still retaining a manlike fashion both in voice and gesture  now these opinions considered i am rather inclinable to believe the latter as thing altogether probable for there is no that vast difference between the member of the two sexes as pliny would have  believe there is for the woman has in manner the same members with the  though they appear not outwardly but  inverted for the convenience of generaton the main difference being that one more solid than the other and that the chief reason of changing sexes is and mu be attributed to heat or cold suddenly  slowly contracted which operates according to its greater or lesser force and the much for these two particulars leavin which i shall proceed to lay down seasonble and necessary instructions or directions for midwives etc opening in that discourse a cabinet of many rare secrets not vulgarly known and indeed only fitting to be known to such as may observe and put them in practice for the public good and n no wise convert them to obscenity  chap xi a midwife how she ought to be qualified those that undertake this great task ought by no means to enter upon it rashly or unadvisedly but with all imaginable caution well weighing and preconsidering that she is ccountable for all the mischief that befalls rough her wilful ignorance or neglects therefore let not unskilful women take upon them this office barely upon pretense of their maturity of years and childbearing for in such for the most part there are diverse things wanting that ought to be observed which is the occasion so many women and children are lost now as for a midwife in relation to her person these things ought to be observed viz she must not be too old nor too young neither xtraordinary fat nor weakened by leanness ut in a good habit of body not subject to diseases fear nor sudden frights her body wellshaped and neat in her attire her hand smooth and small her nails ever pared short not suffering any rings to be upon fingers during the time she is doing her office nor any thing upon her wrists that may obstruct and to these ought to be added activity and a convenient strength with much caution and diligence no subject to drowsiness nor impatience  as for her manners she ought to be courteous affable sober chaste and not subject to passion bountiful and compassionate to the poor and not covetous where she attends upon the poor and not covetous when she attends upon the rich  her temper cheerful and pleasant tha she may the better comfort her patients i their afflictions no must she at any tim make overmuch haste though her busness be urgent in another place left by endangering the mother or child she disgrac her self and forfeit heavens blessing upon her endeavors for the future  of spirit she ought to be prudent wa and cunning but above all to have the fear of god before her eyes and to employ the talent he has lent her to  glory  chap xii things worthy to be observed by midwives tending to their advancement and what they ought to avoid etc let her that undertakes this office attended with many circumstances of danger and disgrace take good heed to what i shall relate in the first place let her be diligent to leave nothing unsearched which may be advantageous to her practice never imagining her self so perfect but she may add to her knowledge by study and experience yet never let her apply any remedies in that case unless she has tried them or known them tried with success or at least is conscious of their force that they will do no harm doing nothing in that nature to practice upon poor or rich but speaking freely of what she knows and giving reason for the further confirmation thereof by no means daring to give directions for such medicine as will cause abortion to pleasure those that have unlawfully conceived which to do is a high degree of wickedness and may be ranked with murder but if any come to her with specious pretenses let her send them to able physicians and neither for fair words nor lucre be won to hearken to them if she be sent for let her know to whom she goes and be careful therein lest by laying any one that has an infctious disease as the pox etc she get it and so spoil other women as a midwife once did who laying a strumpet that had an inveterate pox which occasioning a bubo upon her right hand and she not leaving off her calling spoiled diverse women not the women only but the men also to whom it was communicated by their wives which made them think hard of each other and for a long time could not imagine how it happened but at last it was discovered by an able physician and the midwife for ever after debarred her practice and not so only but followed with curses even to her grave she must likewise observe that she entertains no greatbellyd women at bed and board in her house lest thereby she bring a scandal upon her self and so lose her practice if the birth at any time be hard and difficult she must not be dismayed but cheer up the woman and try her utmos skill to make the labor easy directions for which shall hereafter be inserted nor must she ever think of any thing but doing well and using her utmost skill causing all necessary things that are proper for the work consolation of the woman and reception of the child to be in a readiness and above all let her use her diligence either by persuasion or otherwise to keep the woman from being unruly in her pangs lest thereby she destroy both her self and her child and not in any wise to proceed too hastily in her business but wait gods leisure in all things and by no means let her suffer her wits to scatter by dismay or doubt if things go not well for fear it disorders the senses and a person that keeps her wits together is capable of giving assistance in weighty affairs for when we are most at a plunge then there is most need of prudence to set things right and seeing she can never be an expert midwife that has no farther knowledge than of the external parts i shall not think it amiss briefly with modesty to proceed in describing the generative part of a woman as they have been anatomized by the learned of the present and past ages and show the use of such vessels etc as are contributing generation  chap xiii of the genitals of women external and internal to the vessels of the womb was it not for the benefit of practitioners and professors of the art of midwifry i should above all things spare to treat of these particulars because they may be turned by some lascivious and lewd persons into ridicule but they being absolutely necessary to be known i will hope the best and proceed in order  the parts that offer themselves to view without any deduction at the bottom of th belly are the fissra magna or the great chink with its libia or lips the mns veneris and the hair these parts are called by the general name of pudend because when they are bared they bring pudr or shame upon a woman the fissura magna reaches from the lower part of os pubis to within an inch of the anus it is less and closer in maids than in those that have born children and has two lips which toward the pubes grow thicker and more full or preturbeant and meeting upon the middle of the os pubis make that rising that is called mons veneris or the hill of venus  the next things that offer are the nymphae and clytoris the former of which is of a membrany and filmy substance spongy soft and partly fleshy being of a bloody color in the shape of wings two in number though from their rise they are joined in an acute angle poducing there a fleshy substance which clothes the clyeoris and many times they spread so a that incision is required to make way for the mans instrument of generation  the clytoris is a substance in the upper part of the division where the two wings concur and is the sat of venereal pleasure being like a yard in situation substance composition and erection growing sometimes out of the body two inches but that never happens unless through extreme lust or extraordinary accident but to proceed this clytoris consists of two spongy and skinny bodies containing a distinct original from the pubis bone the head of it being covered with a tender skin having a hole or passage like the penis or yard of a man though not quite through in which and the bigness it only differs from it  the next things in course are the fleshy knobs and the great neck of the womb and these knobs are behind the wings bein four in number much resembling myrtleberries being placed in quadrangle one against the other and in this place i incerted to the orifice of the bladder which opens it self into the fissure to evacuate the urine for securing of which from cold or the like inconveniency one o these knobs are placed before it and shut up the passage  the lips of the womb that next appear being separated disclose the neck thereof in which two things are to be observed viz the neck it self and the hymen but more properly the claustrum virginale of which i have before discoursed but the neck of the womb is to be understood the channel that is between the aforesaid knobs and the inner bone o the womb which receives the penis like a sheath and that it may the better be dilated for the pleasure of procreation the substance of it is sinew and a little spongy and in this concavity are diverse folds o orbicular plghts made by tunicles wrinkled like an expanded rose in virgins they plainly appear but women that have been used often in copulation they are extinguished so that the inner side o the wombs neck appears smooth and i old women it becomes more hard and grisly and now note that although thi channel be sometimes writhed and crooked sinking down yet in the time of copulation labor or the monthly purgations and is erected and extended which overextension occasioneth the great pain in childbirth  the hymen or claustrum virginale is that which closes the neck of the womb being as i have before cited in the chapter relating to virginity broken in the first copulation its use being rather to stay the untimely courses in virgins than to any other end and commonly when it is broke in copulation or by any other accident a small quantity of blood flows with some between the duplicity of the two tunicles which constitute the neck of the womb there are many vens and arteries running along and arising from the vessels descending on both sides the thighs and passing into the neck of the womb being extremely large and the reason of their largeness is for that the neck of the bladder requires to be filled with abundance of spirit thereby to be extendd and dlated for its better taking hold of the penis great heat being required in such motions which becoming more intense by the act of friation does consume a considerable uantity of moisture in supplying which large vessels are altogether necessary  another cause of the longness of those vessels there is viz by reason the mense have their way through them which often occasion women with child to continue their purgations for although the womb is shut up yet the passage in the neck of the womb through which these vessels pass are open in this cause there is further to be observed that as soon as you penetrate the pudedum there appears two little pits or holes wherein is contained an humor which by being expunged in the time of copulation greatly delights the woman  chap xiv a description of the wombs fabric the preparing vessels and testicles in women as also of the deferent or ejaculatory vessels etc in the lower part of the hypogastrion where the hips are widest and broadest they being greater and broader thereabouts than those of men which is the reason they have likewise broader buttocks than men is the womb joined to its neck and is placed between the bladder and strait gut which keeps it from swaying or rolling yet give it liberty to stretch and dilate it self and again to contract as nature in that case disposes it its figure is in a manner round and not unlike a gourd lessening a little and growing more acute toward one end being knit together by its proper ligaments its neck likewise is joined by its own substance and certan membranes that fasten it to os sacrum and the sharebone as to its largeness that much differs in woman especialy the difference is great between such as ave born children and such as have orn none in substance it is so thick that  exceeds a thumbs breadth which after conception it is so far from decreasing that it augments to a greater proportion and the more to strengthen and confirm it it is interwoven with fibers overthwart strait and winding and its proper vessels are veins arteries and nerves and amongst these are two little veins which pass from the spermatick vessels to the bottom of the womb and two larger from the hypogastricks which visit both the bottom and the neck the mouth of these veins piercing as far as the inward concavity  the womb has also two arteries on both sides the spermatick vessels and the hypogastricks which still attend or accompany the veins and besides these there are diverse little nerves and intwined in the form of a net which extend throughout even from the bottom to the pudenda themselves being chiefly placed for sense and pleasure moving in sympathy between the head and womb  now it is to be farther noted that b reason of two ligaments that hang on either side of the womb from the sharebone and piercing through the peritonaeum an are joined to the bone it self that the womb is moveable upon sundry occasions often falling low or rising high as for the neck of womb it is of an exquisite feeling so that if it be any time out of order by being troubled with a schirrous brawn overfatness moisture or relaxation the womb is subjected thereby to barrenness in those that are with child there frequently stays a most glutinous matter in the entrance to facilitate the birth for at the time of delivery the mouth of the womb is opened in a strange manner to such a wideness as is conformable to the bigness of the child suffering an equal dilation from the bottom to the top  as for the preparatery or spermatick vessels in women they are made of two veins and   arteries not differing from those in a man but only in their largeness and manner of insertion for as to their number there are so many veins and the like proportion of arteries as in men the right vein issuing from the trunk of the hollow vein descending and the left from the emulgent vein and on the side of them are two arteries which grow from the aorta  as to the longitude and latitude of these vessels they are narrow and shorter in women than in men only observe where they are wrinkled or crumpled they are more wreathed and conorted than in men as shrinking together by reason of their shortness they may by their looseness be the better stretched out when occasion requires it and these vessels in women are carried on with an oblique course through the leser guts to the testicles or stones but are in the midway divided into two branches the greater going to the stones constituing the various or windy body and wonderful inoculating the lesser branch endng in the womb in the side of which it dsperseth it self and ciefly at the higher part of the bottom of the womb for the nourishment thereof and that part of the courses may purge through these vessels and seeing the testicles in women are seated near the womb for that cause these vessels fall not from the peritonaeum neither make they such passages as in men nor extend themselves to the sharebone  the stones in women commonly called the testicles perform not the same action as men they are also different in their situation magnitude temperament substance form and covering as for their seat it is in the hollowness of the abdomen neither are they extremely pendulous but rest upon the muscles of the loins that so they may by contracting the greater heat be more fruitful their office being to contain the ova or eggs which being impregnated by the mans seed engender man yet they differ from those of men in figure by reason of their lessness or flatness at either end not being so ound or oval the external superficies being likewise more unequal appearing like the composition of a great many knots and kernels mixed together there is also another difference in their substance they being much more soft and pliable loose not so well compacted  their magnitude and temparament being also different for they are much colder and lesser then those in men as for their covering or enclosure it likewise differs extremely for as mens are wrapped or covered in diverse tunicles by reason they are externally pendulous and subject to diverse injuries unless so fenced by nature so womens stones being internal and less subject to casualty are covered with one tunicle or membrance the which though it closely adhere to them yet are they likewise half covered with the peritonaeum  the different or ejaculatory vessels are two obscure passages and on either side nothing differing from the spermatick veins in substance rise they do on one part from the bottom of the womb not eaching from the other extremity either to the stones or any other part but shut up and unpassable adhering to the womb as the colon does to the blind gut and winding half way about the testicles are every way remote to them yet though they touch them not they are tied to them by certain membranes resembling the wings of a bat or fluttermouse through which certain veins and arteries passing from the end of the testicles in these beginning or may be termed here to have their passages proceeding from the corners of the womb to the testicle and are accounted the proper ligament by which the testicles and womb are united and strongly knit together and these ligaments in women are the cremesters in men of which i shall speak more largely when i come to describ the masculine parts conducing to generation  chap xv a discourse of the use and action of the several parts in women appropriated to generation etc the externals commonly called the pudenda are designed to cover the great orifice and that to receive the penis or yard in the act of cotion and give passage to the birth and urine the use of the wings and knobs like mirtleberries are for the security of the internal parts shutting the orifice and neck of the bladder and by their swelling up cause titulation in those parts and also to obstruct the unvoluntary passage of the urine  the action of the cftoris in women is like that of the penis in men viz erection and its outer end is like the glans of the penis viz and has the same name and as the glans in man is the seat of the greatest pleasure in copulation so is this in women whence it is called amoris dulcedo and aestum veneris  the action and use of the neck of the womb is also equal with that of the penis viz erection occasioned diverse ways first in case of copulation it is erected and made strait for the passage of the penis to the womb secondly whilst the passage is repleated with spirit and vital blood it becomes more strait for embracing the penis as for the convenience of erection it is twofold first forasmuch as if the neek of the womb was not erected the yard could have no convenient passage to the womb secondly it hinders any hurt or damage that might ensue through the violent concussion of the yard during the time of copulation  as for the vessels that pass through the neck of the womb their office is to repleat it with blood and spirit that still as the moisture consumes the heat contracted there in copulation it may by those vessels be renewed but their principal business is to convey nutriment to the womb  the womb it self has many properties attributed to it as first retention of the fecundated egg which is properly called conception  secondly to cherish and nourish it til by the help of nature it has framed the child and brought it to perfection and then it strongly operates in sending forth the birth when the time of its remaining there is expired dilating and spreading it self in a wonderful manner and indeed is the field of mans generation being designed for no other purpose and so aptly removed from the senses that nothing of injury can proceed from thence retaining in it self a power and strength to operate and cast forth the bith unless by accident or the like it be rendered deficient when to strengthen and enable it besides the helps of nature sundry remedies are to be applied by skilful hands direction for which shall be hereafter mentioned  the use of the preparing vessels is this the arteries convey the blood to the testicles where part of it is spent in the nourishment of them and the production of those little bladders which do in all things resemble eggs through which the vasa praeparantia run and are obliterate in them and as for the veins their office is only to bring back what blood remains from the uses aforesaid  the vessels in this kind are much shorter in women than in men by reason of their nearness to the stones which defect is yet legthenned and made good by the many intricacies or windings to which those vessels are subject for in the middle way they drive themselves into two branches though different in magnitude for one being greater than the other passes by the stone  the stones in a woman are very useful for when they are defective generation is at an end for although those little bladders which are on their outward superficies contain nothing of seed as the followers of galen and hipocrates did erroneously imagine yet they contain several eggs commonly to the number of twenty in each testicle one of which being impregnated by the most spirituous part of the mans seed in the act of coition descends through the oviducts into the womb and from thence in process of time becomes a living child  their figure is not exactly round but flat and dispersed on the sides in their lower part oval but in their upper where the blood vessels enter them more plain and have but one membrane to encompass em probably that the heat may have the easier access  chap xvi of conception and the infallible signs thereof as also whether it be a male or female that is conceived or both at once commonly called twins the next thing convenient to be observed in this treatse and as it falls in course is conception and its symptoms very material and worthy  more not only by  but all oung women nw the signs of onception three or four days after convenient and satisfactory are  pains n the head vertigo and dimness of the eye the apple  the eyes crease the eyes themselves swell and become of a dull or dark color the veins waxng red and shut with blood again if the eyes sink or eyebrows grow loose various colors appear in the eyes and little red pimples suddenly arise in the face and almost as suddenly disappear thirdly if the veins between the eyes and nose are extended with blood the veins under the tongue look greenish the neck flusheth with heat the backbone cold the veins and arteries swell and the pulses are observed more easily fourthly if the veins in the breast appear blackish and afterward turn yellow the teats look fiery and upon drinking cold drink the woman feels it as it were in her breast fifthly if she on a sudden fall to loathing her meat and drink coveting things unreasonably and not fit for sustenance be troubled with pukings weakness of stomach sore declining and there be little worms found about the navel sixthly if the lower part of the belly swell and weakness be contracted in her loins with inward gripings and retention of the courses   days after copulation after which act there is a cold and trembling seizes on the members external seventhly it is a certain sign of conception if the midwife putting up her finger find the interior neck of the womb exactly closed if the womb wax round and swell the courses stay the thighs swell with some pain the whole body grows weak the face at times becomes pale the urine white with a little cloud after some standing at the top of it if many atoms appear in it eighthly if urine be put in a glass three days and the woman have conceived certain live things will appear to stir in it if a bright needle be put in a whole night and she have conceived diverse little red specks will be thereon but if not it will be blackish or rusty nor are these imaginations but the proved assertions of the learned in physic and skilful in midwifry who have made it their study to search into the depths of natures secrets and next comes a nicer point to be treated of not without the patronage of such whose wisdom and inefatigable labor have rendered them famous to posterity the which take as follows  after conception and the child be come o some perfection so that the sex may be distinguished if it happen to be a malechild then the right eye of the women will to appearance move swifter and sparkle more than the left the right pap will rise swell and be more hard than the left and the teats color will change more suddenly and the increase of the milk will be speedy and if it be milked out and set in the sun it will look like pearl contracting it self into a more solid matter than ordinary or if upon milking it out you cast it upon the womans urine  will sink to the bottom her right cheek will often glow and be more ruddy than the let and indeed the whole color of the face more lively than at other times she feels less sadness than if she conceived a female and when first the child stirs it is more brisk and strong in its motion than the other having commonly its first motion on the right side on the  0th day if her courses flow the  0th day after conception if her belly be more acute toward the navel and as she goes she puts her right leg foremost and rising observe to ease her self on the right side more than on the left  now in case a female be conceived the tokens are averse to those for the most part the first motion rarely happening before the   th day after conception and then it is made on the left side females are carried with more pains than males through defect of heat in the womb to attract the substance also the thighs and genital members of the woman swell more than ordinary her color departs and her longings are extreme and her courses flow the thirtieth day after conception  if twins are conceived which many times happens through the impregnating o two eggs at the same time the sign thereof will not appear till the third or fourth month after conception and then the first appearance will be by the motion of the infants both ways that is on either side of the womb at once for they receive their souls at one and the same time also if her two flanks swell higher than the middle of the belly if there does appea a line or as it were a division from the navel to the groin making a kind of a channel or if a woman with more than ordinary pain support her burden and thus much may suffice for these from whence i shall proceed to give the reader  insight into false conceptions that frequently deceive women especially such as re overdesirous of children  chap xvii of false conceptions and how to know them having already treated of true conceptions the next thing noteworthy  what relates to false conceptions and n this case women are sometimes deluded hinking themselves with chiid when their bellies only swell with the retention of their natural purgations that fall not according to their usual times or else by a lump of indigested flesh for the most rt like the gizzard of a fowl greater or esser according to the time of its continuance there which is frequently four months and is called a mooncalf  at other times they are deceived by moles which are twofold viz the true and a false the former of which is fleshy body filled with many veels streaked with white green or black lines  deficient of membranes but encompasse with diverse yet without growth motion bones bowels or any internals receivi its nourishment through certain vessels nowithstanding it les as we may say the life of a plant without any figue or ord engendered in the concavity of the matrix it has no burden or navelstring fastened  it as a child always has forasmuch as  mole it self adheres to the womb by which means it receives nourishment from it vessels  the latter of these viz the false mol may be divided into four distinctions as folowing first the windy mole being contraction or conflux of wind secndl the watery mole being a gathering  water thirdly the humorous mole  conflux of diverse humors and fourthl the membranous mole being many membranes in the form of a bag filled wi blood and of these in their order  galen holds that the mole is bred when the mans seed is weak barren imperfect or too little in quantity and for the mo part choked through the abundance of the menstruous blood which is gross thic and unfit for the framing of a child  that instead thereof is bred a lump of fles that by little and little increases being wrapped in its own membrane which nature effects as desirous to bring forth any thing rather than be idle  the windy mole is occasioned through defect of heat in the womb and parts adjacent as the liver and spleen which engender a polite or windy vapor which fills the membranous part and puffs up the concavity of the matrix  the watery mole is engendered of diverse apt confluences of thin matter or watery fluxes which passing through the vessels evacuates into the womb having its original from the spleen liver or parts adjoining or rather it proceeds from the weakness of the matrix which cannot assimilate the blood that s brought to nourish it part whereof s turned into water and not being avoided stays in the womb  the humorous mole is engendered by moist attracted humors as the whites or certain watery purgation which distill from the menstruous veins and gathering into a glutinous substance stay in the concavity of the womb  the membranous mole is no other than a contraction of blood within a skin or membrane to which is fastened many white and transparent vessels filled with blood the which coming forth and being thrown into water the blood goes out and the membrane rumples together shrinking on a heap like coagulate seed  now mow most or all of these conceptions have many signs or symptoms coheren with the true as the depravity of appetite puking swelling suppression of the menses swelling of the breast and belly so that many are at a plunge to distinguish them for indeed it is not easily to be done though in these following matters there i distinction viz in case of a false conception the breasts swell and fall again not containing any milk the face is frequently puffed up the arms the groin and the thighs grow meagre and lanker the belly waxes hard as if dropsical being almost of an equal roundness with many prickings at the bottom scarcely admitting of intermission which breaks the rest o the woman so afflicted diverse other sign there are to know it by especially the tru or fleshy mole as thus a maleinfant begins to move at the beginning of the third month for the most part and the femal at the end of the third or beginning o the fourth now when any motion happens the woman ought to consider whether she has any milk in her breasts if she have it is a sign of a true conception bu the contrary of a false one it is also the sign of a true conception if the chil move freely and lively in all parts of the womb for although there is a motion in a false conceeption yet it is dull and not quick nor active in motion the motion not being in it self but in the expulsive faculty of the mother and further if the woman observe she may perceive it fall always to the side she lies on and she lying on her back if her belly be stroaked down the burden will descend and not have for want of inbred force power to recover its station but what confirms it more is that nine months expired no travel ensues but her belly still increases whilst all the rest of the body grows lean and out of order  the signs of the windy mole are diverse as the sudden stretching of the belly like a bladder yet soft and spungy especially near the groins and swelling thereof when if it be struck it sounds like a drum and that the swelling is sometimes more and sometimes less so that according to its increase and decrease the woman feels more heavy or more light  the watery mole is known by its distention of the belly and especially when she lies upon her back the sides thereof are more swelled than the middle or the bottom which grows flatter by reason the watery humor falls to the sides moving up and down as if it were a fluctuation o water and much to the same purpose a the symptoms of the humorous mole only with the distinction that the flanks and thighs are more stretched by the watery mole than by the other because the water being thinner than the humor or not confined in cells flows thither and that which in case of a watery mole comes through natures conduit is clear when in case of a humorous mole the water is red and of a blood color  further observe in case of a false conception the courses come not down and the navel of the mother advances it self little or nothing which in the true conception is otherwise  other false conceptions there are occasioned by diverse tumors which the ignorant take for moles when they are only rotundities and swelling the belly which are not discovered till the womb be opened and then though the womb be not all out of order there does appear at one or both corners thereof little ags full of water in others there are to be seen a heap of kernels or superfluous flesh like a cluster of grapes in the womb causing it to swell yet in such cases the courses are observed to proceed in due order which denotes the womb to be in good order  another excrescency of flesh there is which some call a pendant mole being a piece of fleshy substance hanging within the interior neck of the womb being in breadth about a finger at the place where it is fastened increasing bigger and bigger toward the bottom like a small bell possessing the whole orifices nay sometimes appearing outward to a great bigness  chap xviii instructions for women how to govern themselves during their being with child these instructions being exceeding necessary i thought fit to lay them down for a rule to such as are desirous of selfpreservation and indeed for want of due observance diverse diseases afflict childbearing women nay the child is frequently lost or if it come to a perfect birth proves sickly and disordered through the mothers misobservance  in the first place then the woman with child ought to choose a temperate air not affected with fogs arising from marshes ditches ponds lakes or rivers and not to go abroad in too hot nor too cold weather nor when the south wind blows strong for that wind above all others disrbs and disorders women with child oftentimes causing abortion and next to it the north wind is hurtful causing catarrhs coughs and rheums which opening the body causes the woman to bring forth before her time in short if any evil vapor be drawn in during purgancy it causes diverse diseases  in case of diet she ought to be very cautious in choosing such meats as create wholesome nourishment all meats that are moderately dry being taken so to do and let her observe not to fast immoderately for that renders the child sickly and weak and often for want of nourishment constrains it to be born before its time nor on the other hand must she be too gluttonous for that again stuffs it and causes it to swell beyond its natural bounds  all meats either too hot or too cold and moist are to be avoided as salads spiced meats and the extraordinary use of other meats which makes the children come forth oftentimes without nails which is a sign of short life the most wholesome meats in this case are pigeons turtles larks partridges pheasants veal mutton or any such meat that is of good juice and contributing to kindly nourishment as also such fruits as are sweet and of easy digestion as cherries pears damsons etc but let her avoid such things as subject her body to windiness  her longings if extravagant she must restrain at least as much as in her lies not eating any thing that is filthy or contrary to nourishment nor let her sleep immediately after meals and not at all in the daytime if she can avoid it the night being preferable in such cases when she may sleep her fill so it exceed not nine hours  her exercise ought to be moderate for violent motion either in walking or otherwise molests and disturbs the womb riding in a coach especially upon the stones or in uneven way the last three months are dangerous as also extraordinary sounds or noises and above all the ringing of bells and discharging of guns  laughing crying or immoderate anger or any other passion is extremely hurtful nor in the first four months after conception ought she to lie with her husband forasmuch as the act of copulation moves and shakes the womb and consequently the fruit therein and causes the courses to descend she must likewise in the   th and   th month abstain but in the   th and   th it is not forbidden but rather to be encouraged by reason as physicians affirm it opens the passage and thereby facilitates the birth and the better to help it the woman ought to take such things as may keep her ody soluble as syrrups and other loosening matters as may help nature in its operation especially let her observe when she grows any thing big to lay aside her busk and go loose that the child may have free scope for two reasons first that it may not be hurt and secondly that it being unrestrained may come to its full growth  chap xix further considerations how women ought to govern themselves during pregnancy it is further to be observed that after delivery the breasts frequently grow extreme large and swell overmuch to prevent which and to avoid the danger of too much blood which causes curdled or crudy milk so that from the effects thereof diverse diseases arise in the breast so soon as the woman perceives her self with child let her wear about the neck a small necklace of gold or steel or a small ingot of the latter to hang between her two breasts fomenting her breasts a quarter of an hour every morning with water distilled from sageperewinkle ground ivy being bloodwarm  in her fourth month when the motion is great and her belly swells big she may wath it with a swathband anointed with pomatum or the like to make which i shall give direction and in so doing she will keep it smooth and free from wrinkles as also from hanging down like a tripe after delivery  the receipt take of the gall of a kid and of a sow of each   ounces and capons grease and goose grease of each one ounce and an half and having melted them put thereto a quarter of a pint of water after which strain them through a linen cloth into fair water casting it to and fro therein till it be white at what time add to it the marrow of a red deer one ounce and lay it in redrosewater    hours after the expiration of which you may use it in anointing the swath as aforesaid as also the belly  if the ingredients aforesaid cannot be gotten then the following leniments are effectual though the former is better viz  take of muttonsuet adjoining to the kidnes and dogsgrease each two ounces whaleoil an ounce and of sweetalmondoil the like quantity wash them well after they are melted together in the water of germander or new white wind and anint the belly therewith or the swahband ordained to support it  but for such as are not desirous to anoint their bellies may use the following bath or decoction  take of all the sots of mallow and of motherwort each two handfuls lillyroots the white ones to the weight of three ounces melilot and camomile of both two handfuls limeseeds quinceseed and fenugreeckseed three ounce proportionable of each boil them in spring water and bathe therewith  if the woman during her pregnancy feel but little motion in her womb let her make a ult as follows and bind it upon her navel and it will greatly strengthen infant viz  take the powder of roses red coral and gilliflowers of each three ounces mastick a drm and of angelicaseeds two drams two grains of ambergrise and one of musk all which being well beaten put them into a linen bag expanded and quilted that they may be in every part of it placing it upon the navel  chap xx rules to be observed upon a womans lying down and her delivery etc having thus far proceeded in what as i conceived is highly necessary to be known by the professors of this art i shall gradually proceed to what remains and first to inform the reader what is necessary to be observed upon the womans lying down in order to her delivery  the hour according to computation of time and the disposition of the body approaching let the woman send for a skilful midwife not delaying so to do but rather too soon than too ate at what time let her prepare a little bed or couch of a moderate height and so situate that it be far from the dor near the fire and convenient for the midwife and her assistants to pass round and be iding on every side as occasion requires having change of linen and a small cricket or little log of timber to rest her feet against she having more force when they are bowed than otherwise  having thus provided when the woman feels her pains come if the weather be not extreme cold let her walk leisurely about the room resting her self by turns upon the bed expecting so the coming down of her water which is a humor that is contracted in one of the outward membranes and flows thence when it is broke by the struggling of the child or some other accident there being no direct time affixed for its efflux though for the most part it flows not above two hours before the birth motion likewise will cause the womb to open and dilate it self when lying along in bed will prove troublesome yet if she be much spent and weakened she may take some gentle cordial to refresh her self if her pains will permit  if her travel be tedious to revive her spirits she may take any broth of chickens or mutton and after it a poachd egg but must not take any thing to excess as for the posture women are delivered in they are diverse some lying in their bed others siting in a chair supported and held by others or resting upon the side of the bed or chair some again upon their knees being supported under their arms but the safest and most cemmodious way is in the bed whenas the midwife ought to observe these following rules  let her see that the woman be laid upon her back her head a little elevated by the help of a pillow having the like help to support her reins and buttocks and that her rump lie high for if she lie low she cannat be well delivered then let her keep her knees and thighs as far asunder as she can her legs bowed together her buttocks the soles of her feet and heels being fixed upon a little log of timber placed for that purpose that she may have the greater force to strain now in case her back be exceeding weak a swathband may be cast under it the band being four double and about    inches broad and this must be held by two persons who with steady hands and equal motion must raise her up at the time the pains happen but if they be not exact in their motion it is better evaded and at the same time let two women hold her shoulders that she may the better strain out the birth with more advantage and the better to facilitate it let a woman stroke or press the upper part of her belly gently and by degrees nor must the woman her self be fainthearted but courageous and of a good heart forcing her self by straining and stopping her breath  in case of delivery the midwife must wait with patience till the childs head or other members burst the membrane for through ignorance or haste to be gone to other women as some have done the midwife tear the membranes with her nails she endangers both the woman and the child for it lying dry and wanting that slipperiness that should facilitate it its egress comes forth with greater pain  when the head appears the midwife must gently hold it between her two hands and draw the child at such times as the womans pangs are upon her and at no other slipping by degrees her four fingers under its armpits not using a rogh hand in drawing it forth lest by such means the child through its tenderness receive any deformity of body  as soon as the child is taken forth which is commonly with its face downwards let it be laid upon its back that it may more freely receive external respiration then cut the navelstring with a sharp instrument about three inches from the body tying that which adheres to the belly with a silken string as near as you can then cover the head and stomach of the child well suffering nothing to come upon the face  the child being thus drawn forth and in health lay it aside and let the midwife regard the patient in drawing or causing to come forth the secundine and this may be done by wagging and stirring them up and down and afterward with a gentl hand drawing them forth or if the work be difficult let the woman hold salt in her hands shut them close and breath hard into them whereby she shall know whether the said membranes be broken or not the like may be known by causing a strain or vomiting by putting one finger down her throat by straining or moving her inferior parts being all observed to be done out of hand if this fail she may take a draught of raw elderwater or the yolk of a raw egg or smell to a piece of assa foetida if she be troubled with the windcholick a remedy for which i shall hereafter prescribe if she have taken cold it is a great obstruction to the coming down of the secundines and in such cases the midwife ought to chafe the womans belly with a gentle hand which breaks not only the wind but obliges the secundines to come down and these proving ineffectual the midwife must dilate with her hand the exterior orince of the omb and gently draw it forth having discoursed of common births or such as for the most part are easy i shall proced to give directions in case of extremity  chap xxi in case of extremity what ought to be observed especially to women who in their travel are accompanied with an efflux of blood convulsion or fits of the wind in case of extremity greater regard must be had than at other times and first of all the situation of the womb and her posture of lying must be cross the bed being held by such as have strength to prevent her slipping down or moving her self in the operation of the manmidwife or surgeon her thighs must be sundered as wide as may be and so held whilst her legs invert and bend backward toward her hips her head leaning upon a bolster and the reins of her back supported with the like her rump and buttocks likewise elevated observing to cover her stomach belly and thighs with warm linen to keep them from cold wind  the woman being in the posture aforesaid let the operator put up his hand if he finds the neck of the womb dilated and remove the contracted blood that obstructs the passage of the birth and having by degrees with much gentleness made way let him tenderly move the infant his head being first anointed with sweet butter or a harmless pomatum and if the waters are not come down then without any difficulty may they be let forth when if the infant attempts to break forth with the head foremost or cross he may gently turn it to find the feet which having done let him draw forth one and fasten it to a ribband then put it up again and by degrees find the other when bringing them as close and as even as may be and between whiles giving the woman leave to breathe urging her to strain in helping nature to perfect the birth he may draw it forth and the better to do it that his hold may be surer he must fasten or wrap a linen cloth about the childs thighs observing to bring it into the world with its face downward  in case of a flux of blood if the neck of the womb be open it must then be maturely considered whether the infant or the secundines come first which often the latter happening to do stop the mouth of the womb and hinder the birth to the endangering both the woman and child in such a case i say the secundine must be be removed by swift turn and indeed they have by their so coming down deceived many who feeling their softness supposed the womb was not dilated and by their being so deceived the woman and child or at least the latter has been lost the secundines removed the child must be sought for and drawn forth as has been directed and if in such a case the woman or child die the midwife or surgeon is blameless because they did their true endeavor  if it appear upon enquiry that the secundine comes first let the woman be delivered with all convenient expedition because great flux of blood will follow for then the veins are opened and upon this account two things are to be considered first the bigness or smallness of the secundines advancing if the former and the head of the child appear first it must be guided and directed toward the neck of the womb as in case of natural births but if there through the weakness of the child or mother appear any difficulty in the delivery the best way is to search for the feet and thereby draw it forth but if the latter the secundines may be put back with a gentle hand and the child first taken forth  another matter is more worthy viz if the secundine be far advanced so that it cannot be put back and the child follow it close then are the seundines to be taken forth with much care as swift as may be and laid aside without cutting the entail that is fastened to them for by that you may be guided to the infant the which whether alive or dead must be drawn orth by the feet with all expedition though t is not to be acted unless in case of great necessity for in other cases the secundine ught to come last  as for a dead child in drawing it forth et these directions be carefully observed by he surgeon viz if the child be found tead with its head foremost the danger is he greater and more difficult will be the delivery for it is an apparent sign the womans strength begins to fail her and that the child being dead and wanting its bred force can be no ways assisted to ts delivery wherefore the most certain and safe way is for the chirgeon to put up his lets hand sliding it as hollow in the palm s he can into the neck of the womb ino the lower part thereof toward the feet and that between the head of the infant and the neck of the matrix when having a hook in the right hand chuch it close and slip it up above the left hand between the head of the child and the lat of his hand fixing it in the bone of the temple toward the eye or else in the hollow of the eye or for want of conveniently coming at these in the occipital bone observing still to keep the left hand in its place with it gently moving and stirring the head and so with the righ hand and hook draw the child forwar admonishing the woman to put forth he utmost strength still drawing when the womans pangs are upon her the hea being drawn forth he must with all spee slip his hand under the armholes of the child and take it quite forth giving the things to the woman viz a toast of  white bread in a quarter of a pint of ipcras wine  now the former application and endeavour failing and the following medcines will not enable the woman to ca forth the birth you may proceed to instruments after another manner first when the woman is in her bed let her receiv the ensuing portion hot abstaining from all manner of meats and rest till she fe the operation which is this  take blue figs to the number of seven  them in pieces adding to them fenugreek motherwort and seeds of rice of each fi drams water of pennyroyal and mothewort six ounces of each boil them till  half be consumed and having strained the again add trochisces of myrrh a dram an of saffron three grains sweetning the liqu with loafsugar and spicing it with cinnamon having rested upon this let her labor gain as much as may be and if she be not et successful make a suffumation of castor oppoponax sulpher and assa foetida of uch half a dram beating them into powder  wetting them with the juice of rue ntil they become stiff then burn them upon coals so that the smoke or the fume  only come to the matrix and no furer  if these effect not your desire then his emplaster is very fitly to be applied  take of galbanum an ounce and a half olocynthis without grains two drams  juice of motherwort and rue of each half an ounce and two ounces of virginswax bruise and melt them together reading them as a sar cloth to reach from  navel to os pubis spreading likewise  the flanks at the same time making  nvenient pessary of wool closing it in bag of silk and dipping it in a concocn of round brthwort savin colocynhis with grains staves  black helee of each a dram and of rue a little rig or two  these things failing and the woman  danger let the chyrurgeon use his nstrument to dilate and widen the womb  which purpose the woman must be set  a chair so that she may turn her crupper as much from its back as is convenie drawing up her legs as close as she ca out spreading her thighs as wide as may or if through her weakness it appear mo convenient that she be laid upon the be with her head downwards her butto raised and her legs drawn up as much can be at what time the chyrurgeon wi his spiculum matrices or his apertory  dilate or widen the womb and draw o the child and secundines together if be possible after which the womb  be well washed and anointed and the wman laid in her bed comforted there  spices pleasent meats and cordials  course must be taken in the delivery of dead children likewise with moles cundines or otherwise false births  will not of themselves come forth in  season or if the instruments aforesaid  not sufficiently widen the womb the other instruments as the drakes bill a long pincers ought to be used  if it so happen that any inflamati swelling or concreet blood be contrac in the matrix under the film of those tmours either before or after the bir where the matter appears thinner  midwife with a penknife or incision strument may launch it and press out  corruption healing it with a pessary dped in oil of red roses  if at any time through could or some violence the child happen to be swelled in any part or have contracted a watery tumor yet if it remain alive such means ought to be used as are least injurious to the child or mother but if it be dead that tumor must be let out by incision o facilitate the birth  as it often happens that children come with their feet foremost and the hands dilating themselves from the hips in such  case the midwife must be well provided of necessary ointments to stroke and anoint he infant with thereby to help its coming forth lest it return again into the womb before it can be drawn forth holding at the same time both the arms of the infant close to the hips that so the child may ssue forth after its own manner but if then  prove too big then the womb must be well anointed the woman may likewise ke sneezing powder to cause her the more to strain and at the same time those that attend may gently stroke down her belly to make the birth defend and eep the child when advanced from rering back  sometimes it falls out that the child oming with its feet foremost has its arms xtended above its head the which so appening the midwife must not receive in that posture but put it back into the womb unless the passage be extraordinar wide and then she must anoint both the child and the womb nor is it safe to dra it forth before it is put into due for which must be done after this manner  woman lying upon her back with  head depressed and her buttocks elevate the midwife with a gentle hand must compress the belly of the woman towar the midrif by that means to put back  infant observing to turn the face of  child toward the back of the mother rasing up its thighs and buttocks towar her navel thereby to bring it to a mo regular and natural production  if a child happen to come forth wi one foot the arm being extended alo the side and the other foot turned bacward then must the woman be instan braught to bed and laid in the post aforesaid at what time the midwife  carefully put back the foot so appeari and the woman rock her self from one  to the other till she find the child is tued but she must not alter her posture  turn upon her face after which she  expect her pains and must have  assistance cordials especially not bei wanting to revive and support her spir  at other times it so comes to pass that he child lies cross in the womb and falls upon its side if it so happen the woman ust not be urged in her labor neither an any expect the birth in that manner therefore the midwife when she so perves it must use great diligence to reduce  to its right form or such a form in the womb as its possible to deliver it spally by moving the buttocks and giding  head to the passage but if she be suessful herein let her again try by roking erself to and fro and wait with patience ll it change its manner of lying  sometimes it falls out that the child haens the birth with its legs and  istorted or expanded in which as in the ormer the woman must rock her self but ot with any violence till she find the egs and arms fall to their proper stations  may be done by a gentle compression  the womb but if neither of them preail the midwife with her hand must close  legs of the infant and if possible she  reach them do the like to the arms and so draw it forth though if it could be duced of it self to the composure or poure of a natural birth it is better  if the infant comes forward with both nees foremost the hands hanging down on the thigh then must the miwie put both knees upwards till the feet appear taking hold of which with her lef hand let her keep her right hand on the side of the child and in that posture endeavor to bring it forth but if she cannot then must the woman rock her self till the child is in a more convenient posture for delivery  when it happens that the child presses forward with an arm extended upon the thighs and the other elevated over his head the feet likewise streached out a length in the womb the midwife in such a posture must not attempt to receive the child but must lay the woman upon the bed in the manner often before recited making a soft and gentle compression upon he belly to oblige the infant to retire and if on its own accord it retire not ther must the midwife thrust it back by the shoulders and bring the arm that wa stretched above the head to its right place for certain it is most dangerous in these extremities in this therefore the midwife ougt to take more care herein the ordinary and first she must observe well to anoint her hands then the womb o the woman either with some sweet butter or some convenient pmatom thrustin up her hands as near as she can to the arm of the infant and reduce it to the sid but if she cannot recall it then must the woman be laid on her bed there to repose for a while and then again be conducted to a seat prepared for the most convenience in that affair by which time perhaps he child may be reduced to a better posture the which when the midwife finds he must draw the arms cloase to the hips and so recive it  if an infant come with its buttocks foremost being in a manner duble then the midwife anointing her hands must thrust t up and by degrees heaving up the buttocks and after them the back strive to turn the head to the passage but be not over hasty in so doing lest the infant retiring should shape it worse therefore if it cannot be turned with the hand the woman must to bed and rock her self taking such comfortable things as may support her spirits till she perceive the child urn  if a child come forward with its shoulders the neck being bowed as it often happens as also the hands and feet stretched upwards in such a case the midwife must with much diligence move the shoulders that she may direct the head to the passage and the better to perfect it he woman must rock her self etc these and such like methods are to be observed in all single births and the same may be observed in case of twins or treble births for as the single birth has but one natural way and many unnatural forms even so it happens with the birth of many children wherefore the midwife must observe if twins be in the womb and press foreward according to the natural form that she receive that first which is nearest the passage not letting the other go lest by retiring it should chang the form nor must she when one is born delay to bring forth the other and this birth in the natural form is the more easy because the children are most commonly less then the single births and consequently require a lesser passage but if this birth happen in an unnatural form it is the more difficult and dangerous in the birth of twins let the midwife be exceeding careful that the secundines be naturally brought forth lest in such a case the womb being delivered of its burden falls and by its so doing the secundines continue there longer than is requisite to the indangering of the woman  if it so happen that the woman is pregnant with twins and one come naturally and the other unnaturally as the one with the head the other with the feet foremost then must the midwife consider to deliver the naturalbirth first and then i she cannot turn the other draw it out in the posture it presses forward but if that with the feet downwards be much before the other then may she deliver that first turning the head on the other side  in this case the midwife must be diligent to search that instead of twins it be not a monstrous birth as a body with two heads or two bodies joined together which she may observe if both the hands come foremost by putting up her hands between them as high as she can and if she find they are twins she must gently put one of them aside to make way for the other taking at first that which is most advanced having regard to the other that he change not its situation  now to prevent the first childs being in danger of its life the midwife as soon as it is come forth must tie the navelstring as has been before directed and also bind it again with a long and large fillet to that part of the navel that is fastened to the secundines the more readily to find them  the second infant born let her diligently inquire whether there be not two secundines for by the shortness of the ligaments it often happens that it retires back to the damage of the woman wherefore least in such a case the womb should close it is most expedient to hasten them forth with all convenient speed  if two infants are joined togather by the body as sometimes monstrously falls out then although the heads come foremost yet it is convenient if possible to turn them and draw them forth by the feet observing when they come to the hips to draw them forth as swift as may be and in this case great care ought to be observed in anointing and widening the passage  and thus much for extremity or unnatural births and the next thing i shall proceed to is how to order the woman after natural or unnatural births or delivery  chap xxii what ought to be observed after delivery presently after delivery in case of a natural birth especially if the woman has had hard labor it is convenient to wrap her in the skin of a sheep taken off before it is cold putting the flesh side to her reens and belly or for want of this the skin of a hare or coney being flayed off as soon as killed may be applied to her belly and in so doing the dilation made in the birth will be closed up and the melancoly blood expelled from those parts and these may be contributed in summer the space of an hour and in winter too after which let the woman be swathed with a fine linen cloth about a quarter of a yard in breadth chafing her belly before with oil of st jonswort after that raise up the matreix with a linen cloth many times folded then with a lettle pillow or quilt over her flanks then use the swath somewhat above the hnches winding it pretty stif applying at the same time a warm cloth to her nipples nor presently applying remedies to drive back the milk by reason the body at such a time is disordered and as it were out of frame for there is neither vein nor artrey which does not strongly beat where such remedies to drive back the milk being all of a dissolving nature it is improper to apply them to the breast during such confusion and disorder lest by so doing evel humors be stayed or contracted into the breast wherefore twelve hours ought to be the least space allowed for the circulation and settlement of the blood and what was cast upon the lungs by the vehement agitation during the labor to retire to its proper receptacles  a while after delivery you may make a restrictive of the yolk of two eggs and a quartter of a point of white wine an ounce of oil of saint johnswort as much of the oil of roses plantain and rose water of each one ounce bray them together fold a linen cloth and dip it therein warm it before a gentle fire and apply it to the breast and the pains of those parts will be greatly eased  present sleep is not convenient but about four hours after delivery she may take broth candle or what other liquid matter is nourishing and afterward if she be disposed to sleep it may be safely permitted and this is as much in case of a natural birth as ought immediately to be done  in case of extremity or an unnatural birth these rules ought to be observed in the fiist place let the woman keep a temperate diet by no means overcharging her self aftr such an excessive evacuation and to say true her diet must be equal to that of wounded persons not being ruled or giving credit to unskilful nurses who admonish them to feed lustily the better to repair the loss of blood for that blood is not for the most part pure but such as has been detained in the vessels or membranes better avoided for the health of the woman than kept unless there happens an extraordinary flux of blood for if her nourishment be overgreat it will endanger her falling into a fever nay more it will increase the milk to superfluity which crudling sometimes turns to aposthumes wherefore it is requisite for the first five days especially that she take moderately panado broth poachd eggs gelly of chickens or calves feet french barlybroath each day somewhat increasing her allowance if she intend to be a nurse to her child she may take a little more then ordinary to increase the milk by degrees which must be of no continuance but drawn off either by the child or otherwise in this case likewise let her have coriander or fennelseeds boiled in her barlybroath but by any means for the time specified let her abstain from meat if no fever trouble her she may drink now and then a small quantity of white wind or claret as also syrup of maidenhair or other syrup that is astringent taking it in a little water well boiled and after the suspicion of a fever or fear of contraction of humors in the breast she may be nourished more plentifully with the broth of pullets capons pigeons mutton veal etc which must not be till after eight days from the day of delive is over at what time the womb unless some accident hinder has purged it self it will be then likewise expedient to give her cold meat sparingly that so she may be enabled to gather strength she during the time resting quiet and free from disturbance not sleeping in the day time if she can avoid it if there happen any obstruction in the evacuation of the excrement a glyster may be adminstred to help the defect made after the manner following  receipt take of both the mallows and pelletory of the wall a handful of each cammomile and mellylot flowers of each a handful annyseeds and fennelseeds of each two ounces boil them in the decoction of a sheeps head and take of this three quarts disolving in them of common honey and course sugar two ounces strained well and administer it glysterwise but if it not operate to your mind then may you take an ounce of catholicox  chap xxii what ought to be done to the child when newly born with diverse other matters relating thereto the navel of the child having been before recited the midwife must cleanse the infant not only in the face but likewise the whole body anointing the groin hips buttocks with oil of sweet almonds or oil of ross to make the skin supple and clse the pores thereby to exclude the penetration of the air and strengthen the members nor would it be amiss if she should take the decoction of roses or rosecakes and red sage decocted in white wind and bathe the child therewith the decoction being bloodwarm  the infant being thus well anointed or supplied and well dried wrap it up warm and give it a spoonful of sugar and mollago or a scruple of mithridate or venicetreacle dissolved in half a spoonful of canary and after it a lettle carduswater observing to bathe or anoint it each morning as aforesaid if the child have extreme throws immediately after it comes into the world it must be rubbed with juice of pellitry or the decoction unto which fresh butter is melted or for want of that spinagejuice with hogs grease applied to the navel with new laid eggs mixed or cemented with nut oil laying them likewise to the navel or you may administer a clyster made with milk the yolk of an egg and a small quantity of sugar which will undoubtedly ease the pain  now some children are born of evil constituted parents or are defective through the evil nourishment the woman has unadvisedly taken during her pregnancy which occasions the child to be much afflicted with phlegmatic humors to expel which you may lay the child on one side and then turn it to the other for if you lay it upon the back it will be subject to suffocation or strangling by the ascent of the humor the belly must above all things be kept soluble causing the infant to void the blood kept in the intrails from the time of its being in the womb by giving it a small quantity of suppository of black soap mixed with fresh butter to take away the acrimony of it after which immediately let the infant take a spoonful of syrup of violets which will oblige phlegm to pass down but if heat be defective add to the syrup half the quantity of oil of sweet almonds bathing the belly and stomach of it as it is undressed  if it happens that the childs cods be full of wind the child must be gently moved to and fro and the cods anointed with oil of mirrh giving it the liquid anniseeds boiled in small drink if they be swelled or extended with water rub and chafe the skin with fresh butter and the water will swet out but what is more to be regarded than any other thing is the choosing a good nurse for upon that choice depends the thriving or not thriving of the child and in such cases these things ought to be regarded viz observe that she be not dull sighted squinteyed have down cast looks that she be not consumptive or subject to fits that her breath is pure that no noisome vapor be conveyed to the lungs of the child that she be not infected with bloaches boyls blains or that she or her husband never were afflicted with the french disease that she is not given to excessive drinking or gluttony nor in the least subject to epilepsie or falling evil for the nurse being in a manner the second mother to the child it drawing from her good or evil humors especial care must therefore be taken that the nurse be good conditioned moderate in meat and drink wakeful and vigilant not fretful nor subject to passion that her milk be clean and sweet flowing sufficiently her breasts well fixed and large not overfleshy nor she overfat and above all that she be not too desirous of carnal copulation by which means the milk will be rendered unwholsom having thus far proceeded in these affairs i shall through gods blessing lay down diverse necessary matters for the preservation of childing women and infants thereby to prevent the hazard and loss which too often happens in such cases  chap xxiv to know the exact time of delivery by signs that precede it and how to cause the woman to retain the birth in the business of generation nothing is more to be regarded by the woman than the time of her conception and quickening that thereby she may be enabled to be exact in the time of her delivery every natural delivery being at the end of   months especialy if at the time or near it the woman is wont to have her natural purgations or that the time fall out with the full or new moon nay though a day or two before or after for these things so falling out not only hasten but facilitate delivery and the knowledge of this must extend to the woman for many reasons first that she may prepare and dispose of her self for so great a task second for that at such a time diverse maladies are incident to her nor can their cause be penetrated into unless those things be well known etc now one thing necessary the better to enable the woman to understand it is the time of natural courses for in case she have forgot or by not rightly understandeng their natural efflux or is puzzled therein by reason of some unnatural retention or extraordinary evacuation she may rectify her judgment by these directions viz from the age of    to    women have their courses according to the most natural courses of the new moon from    to  0 in the first quarter from  0 to    or    in the full moon and from that time to the time they cease in the last quarter  beside what is beforementioned she will be made sensible of the approaching time by pain in her groin thighs the small of her back the lower part of her navel together with swelling and hardness in the said places shivering and quaking throut the body as if possessed with an ague and suddenly after with flushing heat feebleness and lassitude smll sweats on the face and flushings of the blood there and her body will be in a manner restless she shall perceive the child move downward with more force than ordinary and a bloody water will distill from the inferior parts in case of these forerunners she may be assured her time is at hand when as she must not delay sending for her midwife whose office it is to order her to the best advantage directions for which i have already given for wonderful it is that nature has so well ordered her works that the matrix opens not unless upon some extraordinary casualty before the time perfixd and not till then do these signs appear but appearing they ought to be much regarded if the woman desires her own safety and the preservation of the child  in case the woman be subject to miscarriage or to come before her time let her take mint roses marjorum of each a small handful bruise them together put them in a bag flat and hang it about the womans neck so that it might reach to the pit of her stomach and it

directions how to make them for the first wash take a good handful of young chervil boil it in two pints of water which having done add to it a spoonful of honey of roses and let the midwife use it at her discretion and it will draw down the purgations heal and cleanse the afflicted part there are some that use milk instead of water affirming that it greatly mitigates the pain but by those whom experience has taught better it is rejected this having been used eight days the second wash may be made  take provence roses moist if you can but if not the dry cakes put them into a litele linen bag and boil them sufficiently in half a pint of water and half a pint of whitewine and use it as the former for other eight days viz the liquid part well strained  the third and last wash must be made of

grise put the paste into a bag of shamy dip it in black wine tempring it well and use it upon the place where the searcloths have been laid on after that wash the said places with black wine wherein oringe flowers have been steeped and it will cleanse these parts to admiration  chap xxvii how to expel the cholick from women in childbirth and the violent gripings that attend the first dilivery these pains frequently afflict the woman no less then the pangs of her labor and are by the ignorant taken many times the one for the other sometimes again they join forces and happen at the same instant which is occasioned by the crude matter in the stomach contracted through indignation and while such a pain lasts the woman advances nothing toward her travel to expel the fits o the cholick therefore  take two ounces of sweet almonds oy and an ounce of cinnamon water with three or four drops of spirit of ginger and let the woman drink it off and if this work not your desire make a clyster of camom balm leaves olive oil and new milk boil the former in the latter and having strained it very well administer it as it is usual in such cases nor are fomentations proper for dispelling wind amiss  if the pain prove the griping in the guts continuing long after delivery or if i happen upon the courses deending by reason of the smallness of the veins which onvey the blood into the

almost as before and this happens through too much neglect and carelessness in not having regard to foment them as also apply a thing convenient to the privities by which means windiness and vapors

inflammations of the breast and its cure the inflammation in the breast is no other than the hard swelling accompanied with a shooting pain also a heating and redness and is mostly caused by the abundance of blood drawn or flowing to the breast and sometimes but rarely it is occasioned by the suppression of the menses the hemorrhoids or some bruise received by a blow or the like and is known by a certain redness and burning heat causing the whole to be feverish and out of order to cure it then first let the diet be comforting moistening and of good nourishment as the broth of pullets capons cocks chickens veal etc wherein endive borage purslain or letuce has been boiled and if she can get it let the woman drink juice of pomegranats but for want of that barlywater wherein anniseeds have been boiled but let her refrain drinking of wine and strong liquors as likewise hot spices and if she find any obstruction in her excremental evacuation let her take a softning or mollifying clyster and sleep at seasonable times as much as she can another way to remedy it is by diverting the humors which may be done by rubbing the body in all adjacent places letting blood in the foot scarification of the legs or vesicatories applied in those places especially if the menses are stopped or ready to come down if not it is requisite to bleed in the arm  but if what has been mentioned prevail not to remove the humors make a cataplasm of the leaves of melilot and nightshade each a handful and when boiled in spring water add to them bean meal   ounces oil of sweet almonds and oatmeal of each an ounce and apply them to the breast observng so to do before the breast be extraordinarily inflamed  chap xxxiv a tumor in the breast its cause and cure of tumors there are several sorts but first of the flagitious tumor the cause of which proceeds from a thick and unnatural vapor arising from the menstrual blood which is retained corrupted in the matrix and that again occasioned by the suppression of the courses or when nature is defective in discharging them into their proper place in due time as also from corruption of humors whereby are engendered evil vapors and their passing by several ways causes the breast to swell or distend as if it were a true swelling and is known by a shooting pain and disorder of heart by reason of the wind that oppresses it the left breast being for the most part more swelled than the right communicating pains to the arms and shoulders as likewise the ribs on the same side the breast being white and shining sounding like a drum if touched gently and swelled in all parts alike to cure this as also the windy tumor you must order to observe a moderation in diet and thereby crudities may be avoided and all such things as contract windy humors in the veins suffering her to drink water wherein cinnamon and anniseeds have been boiled as also the rind of citron and then let her observe to take such things as are proper to provoke the courses in doing which she will find the humors abate then let her take celundine camomile groundsil and groundjuice stamp them and boil them in white wine and in so doing you will ease the pain and restore the breast as for diseases and accidents incident to young children there are few women of any experience but are skilful in curing and ordering them wherefore for brevities sake i shall pass them over and proceed to anatommize the genital parts of a man that one thing remaining necessary in this trreatise as also to instance what men and women ought to marry that their issue may be fair healthful and prosperous  chap xxxv the anatomy of the organs of generation in man the yard which is called in latin penis a pendendo because it hangs out of the organal part is made of skin tendons veins arteries sinews and great ligaments and is long round and on the upper side flattish seated under the ossa pubis and designed by nature partly for making of water and partly for conveying the seed into the matrix to which end there open into it small pores through which the seed passes to it from the vesiculae seminales and also the neck of the vesica vrinari which pours out the urine in making of water besides the common parts as the cirticle the skin and the membrana carnosa it has in these proper or internal parts as the two nervous bodies the septum the vrethra the glans four muscles and the vessels the nervous body so called are surrounded with a thick white nervous membrane but their inner substance is spungy consisting chiefly of veins arteries and nervous fibers interwoven together like a net and when the nerves are repleat with animal spirits and the arteries with hot and spiritous blood then the penis is distended and becomes erect but when the influx of the spirits ceases then the blood and remaining spirits absorded by the veins and so the penis becomes limber and flaggy below these nervous bodies lie the vrethra and whenever the nervous bodies swell it swells also the muscles of the penis are four two shorter arising from the coxendix and serving it erection are therefore called erectres and two larger proceeding from the spincter of the arms and serve to dilate the vrethra from miction and ejection of the seed and are therefore called dilatantes or wideners at the end of the penis is the glans covered with a very thin membrane by means of which and its nervous substance it becomes most exquisitely enible and is the principal seat of pleasure in copulation the outmost covering of the glans is called praeputium a praeputanda from being cut off it being that which the jews cut off in circumcision and it is ed in the lower part of it to the glans by the fraenum or bridle the penis is also stocked with veins arteries and nerves and that part that is next above it toward the belly is called the pubes and its lateral parts is called inguina the groins  the testicles or stones so called because they testify one to be a man elaborate the blood brought to them by the spermatick arteries into seed they have coats of two sorts and invest both the testes cuticula and true skin and is called scrotum hanging out of the abdomen like a purse the inner common coats in the membrana carnosa the proper coats are also two the outer called eltroides or virginales the nner albiginea into the outer are inserted the cremister muscles to the upper part of the testes are fixed the epididymedes or prostata from whence arise the vasa deferentia and ejectoria which when they come near the neck of the bladder deposite the seed into the vesiculae seminales these vesiculae seminales are two each like a bunch of grapes and emit the seed into the vrethra in the act of copulation  near them are the prostata about the bigness of a walnut and joined to the neck of the bladder authors cannot agree about the use of them but most are of opinion that they afford an oily slippery and fat humor to besmear the vrethra whereby to defend it from the acrimony of the seed and is made like the arteria spermatica and also two the veins which carry back the remaining blood are two and have the name of venae spermaticae  chap xxvi what women ought to marry with what men that they might have children in respect of married women that prove childless hypocrates advises this experiment to be tried to know whether the defect be on the womans part or on he husbands which is to make her suffumigations with incense or storax with a garment loose wrapped about her which may hang down on the ground in such sort that no vapor nor fume may issue out and if within a while after she feel the savor of the incense in her mouth she may then conclude that the barrenness comes not through her own defect but through her husbands forasmuch as the fumes found the passage open whereby it pierced up the nostrils but although this proof perform that effect which hypocrates speaks of namely the piercing up to the inner part of the mouth yet is this no infallible argument of the husbands barrenness nor of the fruitfulness of the wife since want of children may arise through an unapt disposition in them both in respect of the correspondency of qualities for it has oftentimes appeared that a man that could not have children by one wife has had them by another the like also has befallen women  hypocrates gives us his opinion concerning the correspondency that ought in that respect to be betwixt man and wife in these words if the hot and dry answer not the cold and moist in measure and quantity that is if there meet in the womb two seeds the one hot the other cold the one dry the other moist extended in equal degree there can be no generation for so mavelous a work as the formation of man says he could not be performed without proportionable commixture of seed to exemplify this assertion of his the ancient physicians go on and say that a woman who is wilely illconditioned shrillvoicd lean swarthycoloured and deformed which are the signs of cold and moist in the first degree may conceive by a man who is ignorant goodnatured sweetvoicd corpulent having little hair a wellcolurd face and a handsome body which are the signs of hot and dry in the first degree in regard she retains a mean in all those signs abovementioned is most like to be fruitful because she comes nearest in proportion to men of each several temperature but from the first of these unions or conjoining of man and woman are most likely to issue the wisest children say they because the dryness of the mother corrects and amendeth the defect of the father but this being chiefly grounded upon that old opinion of the commixture of the seed of the man and woman together and of the childs being formed from thence we think fit to reject it and to affirm that youth strength and vigor a sound body and a mind free from cares with a mutual love and amity betwixt the man and woman seldom fail of their desired effects  chap xxxvii a word of advice to both sexes in the act of copulation the act of copulation being ordained by nature as the ground of all generation and without which no birth can be produced somewhat must be said of it but we shall cloth it in the modest dress that the chastest ears may hear without being put to the trouble of a blush  it is convenient on this occasion to cherish the body with generous restoratives to charm the imagination with music to drown all cares in good wine that so the mind being elevated to a pitch of joy and rapture the sensual appetite may be more freely encouraged to gratify it self in the delights of nature for melancholy and grief and whatsoever is troublesome to the senses and fancy are enemies to the pastime of the nuptialbed yet is it necessary to avoid excesses in eating and drinking for if the body be overchargd with wine or meat the spirits will become dull and unactive and unable to prform their office this you may take for a good rule that a little of what is good and welldigested breeds good blood good blood creates good spirits and when a man is invigorated with a plentiful stock of such he is able to do miracles also when the husband and wife meet with an equal ardour in their conjugal embraces it is very rare if it be not attended with conception but when that act is over all is not done for that it may have the better suceess the husband must not presently separate himself from his wifes embraces lest the air should suddenly strike in and so prevent the issue of their labors and when the man departs the woman ought to compose her self to all the rest and quietness imaginable and to avoid heavy thoughts of what may cause any disturbance and especially she ought to avoid coughing and sneezing both which are great hindrances to conception after the act of copulation  parry says that in the year he saw in paris a boy nine years old born near guise he had but two fingers on his right hand his arm was well proportioned from the top of his shoulders to bis wrist but from thence to the fingers ends it was very deformed he wanted his legs and thighs etc as in the page following  the effigies of a monstrous child by reason of the defect of the matter of seed   in stecquer a village of saxony they say a monster was born with four feet eyes mouth and nose like a calf with a round and red excrescence of flesh on the forehad and also a piece of flesh like a hood hung from his neck upon his back and it was deformed with its thighs torn and cut as here shown    an dom      there was generated of a woman and a dog an issue which from the navel upward perfectly resembled the shape of the mother but thence downward the sire i c the dog this monster was sent to the pope that then reigned as voluterane writes caedane also mentions it wherefore i have given you the figure thereof    jovianus pontanus tells us in      jan   there was a man child born in gormany having   arms and as many legs as in this figure    in the year of our lod      in which year upon easter day near ravenna was fought that mortal battle in which the popes fores were ovverthrown a monster was born in ravenna having a horn upon the crown of his head and besides two vvings and one foot alone most like the feet of birds of birds of prey and in the knee thereof one eye the privities of male and female the rest of the body like a man as you may see by the figure    finis the effigies of a maid all hairy and an infant that was black by the imagination of their parents
