dissertation on firstprinciples of government by thomas pain author of common sense rights of man age of reason etc  paris printed at the english press rue de vaugirard no   0 third year of the french repuplic  dissertation on firstprinciples of government there is no subject in which mankind are more universally interested than in the subject of government his security be he rich or poor and in a great measure his prosperity is connected therewith it is therefore his interest as well as his duty to make himself acquainted with its principles and what the practice ought to be  every art and science however imperfectly known at first has been studied improved and brought to what we call perfection by the progressive labors of succeeding generations but the science of government has stood still no improvement has been made in the principle and scarcely any in the practice till the american revolution began in all the countries of europe except in france the same forms and systems that were erected in the remote ages of ignorance still continue and their antiquity is pile in the place of principle it is forbidden to investigate their origin or by what right they exist if it be asked how has this happened the answer is easy they are established on a principle that is false and they employ their power to prevent detection  notwithstanding the mystery with which the science of government has been enveloped for the purpose of enslaving plundering and imposing upon mankind it is of all things the least mysterious and the most easy to be understood the meanest capacity cannot be at a loss if it begins its enquiries at the right point every art and science has some point or alphabet at which the study of that art or science begins and by the assistance of which the progress is facilitated the same method ought to be observed with respect to the science of government  instead then of embarrassing the subject in the outset with the numerous subdivisions under which different forms of government have been classed such as aristocracy democracy oligarchy monarchy etc the better method will be to begin with what may be called primary divisions or those under which all the several subdivisions will be comprehended  the primary divisions are but two  first government by election and representation secondly government by hereditary succession all the several forms and systems of government however numerous or diversified class themselves under one or other of those primary divisions for either they are on the system of representation or on that of hereditary succession as to that equivocal thing called mixed government such as the late government of holland and the present government of england it does not make an exception to the general rule because the parts separately considered are either representative or hereditary  beginning then our enquiries at this point we have first to examine into the nature of those two primary divisions if they are equally right in principle it is mere matter of opinion which we prefer if the one be demonstratively better than the other that difference should direct our choice but if one of them be so absolutely false as not to have a right to existence the matter settles itself at once because a negative proved on one thing where two only are offered and one must be accepted amounts to an affirmative on the other  the revolutions that are now spreading themselves in the world have their origin in this state of the case and the present war is a conflict between the representative system founded on the rights of the people and the hereditary system founded in usurpation as to what are called monarchy royalty and aristocracy they do not either as things or as terms sufficiently describe the hereditary system they are but secondary things or signs of the hereditary system and which fall of themselves if that system has not a right to exist were there no such terms as monarchy royalty and aristocracy or were other terms substituted in their place the hereditary system if it continued would not be altered then by it would be the same system under any other titulary name as it is now  the character therefore of the revolutions of the present day distinguishes itself most definitively by grounding itself on the system of representative government in opposition to the hereditary no other distinction reaches the whole of the principle  having thus opened the case generally i proceed in the first place to examine the hereditary system because it has the priority in point of time the representative system is the invention of the modern world and that no doubt may arise as to my own opinion i declare it before hand which is that there is not a problem in euclid more mathematically true than that hereditary government has not a right to exist when therefore we take from any man the exercise of hereditary power we take away that which he never had the right to possess and which no law or custom could or ever can give him a title to  the arguments that have hitherto been employed against the hereditary system have been chiefly founded upon the absurdity of it and its incompetency to the purpose of good government nothing can present to our judgment or to our imagination a figure of greater absurdity than that of seeing the government of a nation fall as it frequently does into the hands of a lad necessarily destitute of experience and often little better than a fool it is an insult to every man of years of character and of talent in a country the moment we begin to reason upon the hereditary system it falls into derision let but a single idea begin and a thousand will soon follow insignificance imbecility childhood dotage want of moral character in fine every defect serious or laughable unite to hold up the hereditary system as a figure of ridicule leaving however the ridiculousness of the thing to the reflections of the reader i proceed to the more important part of the question namely whether such a system has a right to exist  to be satisfied of the right of a thing to exist we must be satisfied that it had a right to begin if it had not a right to begin it has not a right to continue by what right then did the hereditary system begin let a man but ask himself this question and he will find that he cannot satisfy himself with an answer  the right which any man or any family had to set itself up at first to govern a nation and to establish itself hereditarily was no other than the right which robespierre had to do the same thing in france if he had none they had none if they had any he had as much for it is impossible to discover superiority of right in any family by virtue of which hereditary government could begin the capets the guelphs the robespierres the marats are all on the same standing as to the question of right it belongs exclusively to none  it is one step toward liberty to perceive that hereditary government could not begin as an exclusive right in any family the next point will be whether having once began it could grow into a right by the influence of time  this would be supposing an absurdity for either it is putting time in the place of principle or making it superior to principle whereas time has no more connection with or influence upon principle than principle has upon time the wrong which began a thousand years ago is as much a wrong as if it began to day and the right which originates to day is as much a right as if it had the sanction of a thousand years time with respect to principles is an eternal now it has no operation upon them it changes nothing of their nature and qualities but what have we to do with a thousand years our life time is but a short portion of that period and if we find the wrong in existence as soon as we begin to live that is the point of time at which it begins to us and our right to resist it is the same as if it had never existed before  as hereditary government could not begin as a natural right in any family nor derive after its commencement any right from time we have only to examine whether there exist in a nation a right to set it up and establish it by what is called law as has been done in england i answer no and that any law or any constitution made for that purpose is an act of treason against the rights of every minor in the nation at the time it is made and against the rights of all succeeding generations i shall speak upon each of those cases first of the minor at the time such law is made secondly of the generations that are to follow  a nation in a collective sense comprehends all the individuals of whatever age from just born to just dying of these one part will be minors the other aged the average of life is not exactly the same in every climate and country but in general the minority in years are the majority in numbers that is the number of persons under twenty one years is greater than the number of persons above that age this difference in number is not necessary to the establishment of the principle i mean to lay down but it serves to show the justice of it more strongly the principle would be equally good if the majority in years were also the majority in numbers  the rights of minors are as sacred as the rights of the aged the difference is altogether in the different age of the two parties and nothing in the nature of the rights the rights are the same rights and are to be preserved inviolate for the inheritance of the minors when they shall come of age during the minority of minors their rights are under the sacred guardianship of the aged the minor cannot surrender them the guardian cannot dispossess him consequently the aged part of a nation who are the lawmakers for the time being and who in the march of life are but a few years a head of those who are yet minors and to whom they must shortly give place have not and cannot have the right to make a law to set up and establish hereditary government or to speak more distinctly an hereditary succession of governors because it is an attempt to deprive every minor in the nation at the time such a law is made of his inheritance of rights when he shall come of age and to subjugate him to a system of government to which during his minority he could neither consent nor object  if a person who is a minor at the time such a law is proposed had happened to have been born a few years sooner so as to be of the age of twenty one years at the time of proposing it his right to have objected against it to have exposed the injustice and tyrannical principles of it and to have voted against it will be admitted on all sides if therefore the law operates to prevent his exercising the same rights after he comes of age as he would have had a right to exercise had he been of age at the time it is undeniably a law to take away and annul the rights of every person in the nation who shall be a minor at the time of making such a law and consequently the right to make it cannot exist  i come now to speak of government by hereditary succession as it applies to succeeding generations and to show that in this case as in the case of minors there does not exist in a nation a right to set it up  a nation though continually existing is continually in a state of renewal and succession it is never stationary every day produces new births carries minors forward to maturity and old persons from the stage in this ever running flood of generations there is no part superior in authority to another could we conceive an idea of superiority in any at what point of time or in what century of the world are we to fix it to what cause are we to ascribe it by what evidence are we to prove it by what criterion are we to know it a single reflection will teach us that our ancestors like ourselves were but tenants for life in the great freehold of rights the feeabsolute was not in them it is not in us it belongs to the whole family of man through all ages if we think otherwise than this we think either as slaves or as tyrants as slaves if we think that any former generation had a right to bind us as tyrants if we think that we have authority to bind the generations that are to follow  it may not be inapplicable to the subject to endeavor to define what is to be understood by a generation in the sense the word is here used  as a natural term its meaning is sufficiently clear the father the son the grandson are so many distinct generations but when we speak of a generation as describing the persons in whom legal authority resides as distinct from another generation of the same description who are to succeed them it comprehends all those who are above the age of twenty one years at the time we count from and a generation of this kind will continue in authority between fourteen and twenty one years that is until the number of minors who shall have arrived at age shall be greater than the number of persons remaining of the former stock  for example if france at this or any other moment contain twenty four millions of souls twelve millions will be males and twelve females of the twelve millions of males six millions will be of the age of twenty one years and six will be under and the authority to govern will reside in the first six but every day will make some alteration and in twenty one years every one of those minors who survive will have arrived at age and the greater part of the former stock will be gone the majority of persons then living in whom the legal authority resides will be composed of those who twenty one years before had no legal existence those will be fathers and grand fathers in their turn and in the next twenty one years or less another race of minors arrived at age will succeed them and so on  as this is ever the case and as every generation is equal in rights to another it consequently follows that there cannot be a right in any to establish government by hereditary succession because it would be supposing itself possessed of a right superior to the rest namely that of commanding by its own authority how the world shall be hereafter governed and who shall govern it every age and generation is and must be as a matter of right as free to act for itself in all cases as the age and generation that preceded it the vanity and presumption of governing beyond the grave is the most ridiculous and insolent of all tyrannics man has no property in man neither has one generation a property in the generations that are to follow  in the first part of rights of man i have spoken of government by hereditary succession and i will here close the subject with an extract from that work which states it under the two following heads  first of the right of any family to establish itself with hereditary power  secondly of the right of a nation to establish a particular family  with respect to the first of those heads that of a family establishing itself with hereditary powers on its own authority independent of the nation all men will concur in calling it despotism and it would be trespassing on their understanding to attempt to prove it  but the second head that of a nation that is of a generation for the time being establishing a particular family with hereditary powers it does not present itself as despotism on the first reflection but if men will permit a second reflection to take place and carry that reflection forward even but one remove out of their own persons to that of heir offpring they will then see that hereditary succession becomes the same despotism to others which the first persons reprobated for themselves it operates to preclude the consent of the succeeding generation and the preclusion of consent is despotism  in order to see this matter more clearly let us consider the generation which undertakes to establish a family with hereditary powers separately from the generations which are to follow  the generation which first selects a person and puts him at the head of its government either with the title of king or any other nominal distinction acts its own choice as a free agent for itself be that choice wise or foolish the person so set up is not hereditary but selected and appointed and the generation which sets him up does not live under an hereditary government but under a government of its own choice were the person so set up and the generation who sets him up to live for ever it never could become hereditary succession and of consequence hereditary succession can only follow on the death of the first parties  as therefore hereditary succession is out of the question with respect to the first generation we have next to consider the character in which that generation acts toward the commencing generation and to all succeeding ones  it assumes a character to which it has neither right nor title for it changes itself from a legislator to a testator and affects to make a will and testament which is to have operation after the demise of the makers to bequeath the government and it not only attempts to bequeath but to establish on the succeeding generation a new and different form of government under which itself lived itself as al ready observed lived not under an hereditary government but under a government of its own choice and it now attempts by virtue of a will and testament which it has not authority to make to take from the commencing generation and from all future ones the right and free agency by which itself acted  in whatever light hereditary succession as growing out of the will and testament of some former generation presents itself it is both criminal and absurd a cannot make a will to take from b the property of b and give it to c yet this is the manner in which what is called hereditary succession by law operates a certain generation makes a will under the form of a law to take away the rights of the commencing generation and of all future generations and convey those rights to a third person who afterward comes forward and assumes the government in consequence of that illicit conveyance  the history of the english parliament furnishes an example of this kind and which merits to be recorded as being the greatest instance of legislative ignorance and want of principle that is to be found in the history of any country the case is as follows  the english parliament of      imported a man and his wife from holland william and mary and made them king and queen of england having done this the said parliament made a law to convey the government of the country to the heirs of william and mary in the following words we the lordsspiritual and temporal and commons do in the name of the people of england most humbly and faithfully submit ourselves our heirs and posterities to william and mary their heirs and posterities for ever and in a subsequent law as quoted by edmund burke the said parliament in the name of the people of england then living binds the said people their heirs and posterities to william and mary their heirs and posterities to the end of time  it is not sufficient that we laugh at the ignorance of such law makers it is necessary that we reprobate their want of principle the constituent assembly of france      fell into the same vice as the parliament of england had done and assumed to establish an hereditary succession in the family of the capets as an act of the constitution of that year that every nation for the time being has a right to govern itself as it pleases must always be admitted but government by hereditary succession is government for another race of people and not for itself and as those on whom it is to operate are not yet in existence or are minors so neither is the right in existence to set it up for them and to assume such a right is treason against the right of posterity  i here close the arguments on the first head that of government by hereditary succession and proceed to the second that of government by election and representation or as it may be concisely expressed representative government in contradistinction to hereditary government  reasoning by exclusion if hereditary government has not a right to exist and that it has not is proveable representative government is admitted of course  in contemplating government by election and representation we amuse not ourselves in enquiring when or how or by what right it began its origin is ever in view man is himself the origin and the evidence of the right it appertains to him in right of his existence and his person is the title deed  the true and only true basis of representative government is equality of rights every man has a right to one vote and no more in the choice of representatives the rich have no more right to exclude the poor from the right of voting or of electing and being elected than the poor have to exclude the rich and wherever it is attempted or proposed on either side it is a question of force and not of right who is he that would exclude another that other has the same right to exclude him  that which is now called aristocracy implies an inequality of rights but who are the persons that have a right to establish this inequality will the rich exclude themselves no will the poor exclude themselves no by what right then can any be excluded it would be a question if any man or class of men have a right to exclude themselves but be this as it may they cannot have the right to exclude another the poor will not delegate such a right to the rich nor the rich to the poor and to assume it is not only to assume arbitrary power but to assume a right to commit robbery personal rights of which the right of voting for representatives is one are a species of property of the most sacred kind and he that would employ his pecuniary property or presume upon the influence it gives him to dispossess or rob another of his property of rights uses that pecuniary property as he would use firearms and merits to have it taken from him  inequality of rights is created by a combination in one part of the community to exclude another part from its rights whenever it be made an article of a constitution or a law that the right of voting or of electing and being elected shall appertain exclusively to persons possessing a certain quantity of property be it little or much it is a combination of the persons possessing that quantity to exclude those who do not possess the same quantity it is investing themselves with powers as a selfcreated part of society to the exclusion of the rest  it is always to be taken for granted that those who oppose an equality of rights never mean the exclusion should take place on themselves and in this view of the case pardoning the vanity of the thing aristocracy is a subject of laughter this selfsoothing vanity is encouraged by another idea not less selsish which is that the opposers conceive they are playing a sa me in which there is a chance to gain and none to lose that at any sat the doctrine of equality includes them and that if they cannot get more rights than those whom they oppose and would exclude they shall not have less this opinion has already been fatal to thousands who not contented with equal rights have sought more till they lost all and experienced in themselves the degrading inequality they endeavored to fix upon others  in any view of the case it is dangerous and impolitic sometimes ridiculous and always unjust to make property the criterion of the right of voting if the sum or value of the property upon which the right is to take place be considerable it will exclude a majority of the people and unite them in a common interest against the government and against those who support it and as the power is always with the majority they can overturn such a government and its supporters whenever they please  if in order to avoid this danger a small quantity of property be fixed as the criterion of the right it exhibits liberty in disgrace by putting it in competion with accident and insignificance when a broodmare shall fortunately produce a soal or a mule that by being worth the sum in question shall convey to its owner the right of voting or by its death take it from him in whom does the origin of such a right exist is it in the man or in the mule when we consider how many ways property may be acquired without merit and lost without a crime we ought to spurn the idea of making it a criterion of rights  but the offensive part of the case is that this exclusion from the right of voting implies a stigma on the moral character of the persons excluded and this is what no part of the community has a right to pronounce upon another part no external circumstance can justify it wealth is no proof of moral character nor poverty of the want of it on the contrary wealth is often the presumptive evidence of dishonesty and poverty the negative evidence of inuocence if therefore property whether little or much be made a criterion the means by which that property has been acquired ought to be made a criterion also  the only ground upon which exclusion from the right of voting is consistent with justice would be to inflict it as a punishment for a certain time upon those who should propose to take away that right from others the right of voting for representatives is the primary right by which other rights are protected to take away this right is to reduce a man to a state of slavery for slavery consists in being subject to the will of another and he that has not a vote in the election of representatives is in this case the proposal therefore to disfranchise any class of men is as criminal as the proposal to take away property when we speak of right we ought always to unite with it the idea of duties right becomes duties by reciprocity the right which i enjoy becomes my duty to guarantee it to another and he to me and those who violate the duty justly incur a forseicure of the right  in a political view of the case the strength and permanent security of government is in proportion to the number of people interested in supporting it the true policy therefore is to interest the whole by an equality or rights for the danger arises from exclusions it is possible to exclude men from the right of voting but it is impossible to exclude them from the right of rebelling against that exclusion and when all other rights are taken away the right of rebellion is made perfect  while men could be persuaded they had no rights or that rights appertained only to a certain class of men or that government was a thing existing in right of itself it was not difficult to govern them authoritatively the ignorance in which they were held and the superstition in which they were instructed furnished the means of doing it but when the ignorance is gone and the superstition with it when they perceive the imposition that has been acted upon them when they reflect that the cultivator and the manufacturer are the primary means of all the wealth that exist in the world beyond what nature spontaneously produces when they begin to feel their consequence by their usefulness and their right as members of society it is then no longer possible to govern them as before the fraud once detected cannot be reacted to attempt it is to provoke derision or invite destruction  that property well ever be unequal is certain industry superiority of talents dexterity of management extreme frugality fortunate opportunities or the opposite or the mean of those things will ever produce that effect without having recourse to the harsh ill sounding names of avarice and oppression and beside this there are some men who though they do not despise wealth will not stoop to the drudgery or the means of acquiring it nor will be troubled with the care of it beyond their wants or their independence whilst in others there is an avidity to obtain it by every means not punishable it makes the sole business of their lives and they follow it as a religion all that is required with respect to property is to obtain it honestly and not employ it criminally but it is always criminally employed when it is made a criterion for exclusive rights  in institutions that are purely pecuniary such as that of a bank or a commercial company the rights of the members composing that company are wholly created by the property they invest therein and no other rights are represented in the government of that company than what arise out of that property neither has that government cognizance of any thing but propety  but the case is totally different with respect to the institution of civil government organized on the system of representation such a government has cognizance of every thing and of every man as a member of the national society whether he has property or not and therefore the principle requires that every man and every kind of right be represented of which the right to acquire and to hold property is but one and that not of the most essential kind the protection of a mans person is more sacred than the protection of property and besides this the faculty of performing any kind of work or service by which he acquires a livelihood or maintains his family is of the nature of property it is property to him he has acquired it and it is as much the object of his protection as exterior property possessed without that faculty can be the object of protection to another person  i have always believed that the best security for property be it much or little is to remove from every part of the community as far as can possibly be done every cause of complaint and every motive to violence and this can only be done by an equality of rights when rights are secure property is secure in consequence but when property is made a pretense for unequal or exclusive rights it weakens the right to hold the property and provokes indignation and tumult for it is unnatural to believe that property can be secure under the guarantee of a society injured in its rights by the influence of that property  next to the injustice and illpolicy of making property a pretense for exclusive rights is the unaccountable absurdity of giving to mere sound the idea of property and annexing to it certain rights for what else is a  but sound nature is often giving to the world some extraordinary men who arrive at fame by merit and universal consent such as aristotle socrates plato etc these were truly great or noble but when government sts up a manufactory of nobles it is as absurd as if she undertook to manufacture wise men her nobles are all counterfeits  this waxwork order has assumed the name of aristocracy and the disgrace of it would be lessend if it could be considered only as childish imbecility we pardon foppery because of its insignificance and on the same ground we might pardon the foppery of titles but the origin of aristocracy was worse than foppery it was robbery the first aristocrats in all countries were brigands those of latter times sycophants  it is very well known that in england and the same will be found in other countries the great landed estates now held in descent were plundered from the quiet inhabitants at the conquest the possibility did not exist of acquiring such estates honestly if it be asked how they could have been acquired no answer but that of robbery can be given that they were not acquired by trade by commerce by manufactures by agriculture or by any reputable employment is certain how then were they acquired blusn aristocracy to hear your origin for your progenitors were thieves they were the robespierres and the jacobins of that day when they had committed the robbery they endeavored to lose the disgrace of it by sinking their real names under fictitious ones which they called titles it is ever the practice of felons to act in this manner they never pass by their real names  as property honestly obtained is best secured by an equality of rights so illgotten property depends for protection on a monopoly of rights he who has robbed another of his property will next endeavor to disarm him of his rights to secure that property for when the robber becomes the legislator he believes himself secure that part of the government of england that is called the house of lords was originally composed of persons who had committed the robberies of which i have been speaking it was an association for the protection of the property they had stolen  but besides the criminality of the origin of aristocracy it has an injurious effect on the moral and physical character of man like slavery it debilitates the human faculties for as the mind bowed down by slavery loses in silence its elastic powers so in the contrary extreme when it is bouyed up by folly it becomes incapable of exerting them and dwindles into imbecility it is impossible that a mind employed upon ribbands and titles can ever be great the childishness of the objects consumes the man  it is at all times necessary and more particularly so during the progress of a revolution and until right ideas confirm themselves by habit that we frequently refresh our patriotism by reference to first principles it is by tracing things to their origin that we learn to understand them and it is by keeping that line and that origin always in view that we never forget them  an enquiry into the origin of rights will demonstrate to us that rights are not gifts from one man to another nor from one class of men to another for who is he who could be the first giver or by what principles or on what authority could he possess the right of giving a declaration of rights is not a creation of them nor a donation of them it is a manifest of the principle by which they exist followed by a detail of what the rights are for every civil right has a natural right for its foundation and it includes the principle of a reciprocal guarantee of those rights from man to man as therefore it is impossible to discover any origin of rights otherwise than in the origin of man it consequently follows that rights appertain to man in right of his existence only and must therefore be equal to every man the principle of an equality of rights is clear and simple every man can understand it and it is by understanding his rights that he learns his duties for where the rights of men are equal every man must finally see the necessity of protecting the rights of others as the most effectual security for his own but if in the formation of a constitution we depart from the principle of equal rights or attempt any modification of it we plunge into a labyrinth of difficulties from which there is no way out but by retreating where are we to stop or by what principle are we to find out the point to stop at that shall discriminate between men of the same country part of whom shall be free and the rest not if property is to be made the criterion it is a total departure from every moral principle of liberty because it is attaching rights to mere matter and making man the agent of that matter it is moreover holding up property as an apple of discord and not only exciting but justifying war against it for i maintain the principle that when property is used as an instrument to take away the rights of those who may happen not to possess property it is used to an unlawful purpose as firearms would be in a similar case  in a state of nature all men are equal in rights but they are not equal in power the weak cannot protect himself against the strong this being the case the institution of civil society is for the purpose of making an equalization of powers that shall be parallel to and a guarantee of the equality of rights the laws of a country when properly constructed apply to this purpose every man takes the arm of the law for his protection as more effectual than his own and therefore every man has an equal right in the formation of the government and of the laws by which he is to be governed and judged in extensive countries and societies such as america and france this right in the individual can only be exercised by delegation that is by election and representation and hence it is that the institution of representative government arises  hitherto i have confined myself to matters of principle only first that hereditary government has not a right to exist that it cannot be established on any principle of right and that it is a violation of all principle secondly that government by election and representation has its origin in the natural and eternal rights of man for whether a man be his own lagiver as he would be in a state of nature or whether he exercises his portion of legislative sovereignty in his own person as might be the case in small democraties where all could assemble for the formation of the laws by which they were to be governed or whether he exercises it in the choice of persons to represent him in a national assembly of representatives the origin of the right is the same in all cases the first as is before observed is defective in power the second is practicable only in democracies of small extent the third is the greatest scale upon which human government can be instituted  next to matters of principle are matters of opinion and it is necessary to distinguish between the two whether the rights of men shall be equal is not a matter of opinion but of right and consequently of principle for men do not hold their rights as grants from each other but each one in right of himself society is the guardian but not the giver and as in extensive societies such as america and france the right of the individual in matters of government cannot be exercised but by election and representation it consequently follows that the only system of government consistent with principle where simple democracy is impracticable is the representative system but as to the organical part or the manner in which the several parts of government shall be arranged and composed it is altogether matter of opinion it is necessary that all the parts be conformable with the principle of equal rights and so long as this principle be religiously adhered to no very material error can take place neither can any error continue long in that part that falls within the province of opinion  in all matters of opinion the social compact or the principle by which society is held together requires that the majority of opinions becomes the rule for the whole and that the minority yields practical obedience thereto this is perfectly conformable to the principle of equal rights for in the first place every man has a right to gve an opinion but no man has a right that his opinion should govern the rest in the second place it is not supposed to be known before hand on which side of any question whether for or against any mans opinion will fall he may happen to be in a majority upon some questions and in a minority upon others and by the same rule that he expects obedience in the one case he must yield it in the other  all the disorders that have arisen in france during the progress of the revolution have had their origin not in the principle of equal rights but in the violation of that principle the principle of equal rights has been repeatedly violated and that not by the majority but by the minority and that minority has been composed of men possissing property as well as of men without property property therefore even upon the experience already had is no more a criterion of character than it is of rights it will sometimes happen that the minority are right and the majority are wrong but as soon as experience proves this to be the case the minority will increase to a majority and the error will reform itself by the tranquil operation of freedom of opinion and equality of rights nothing therefore can justify an insurrection neither can it ever be necessary where rights are equal and opinions free  taking then the principle of equal rights as the soundation of the revolution and consequently of the constitution the organical part or the manner in which the several parts of the government shall be arranged in the constitution will as is already said fall within the province of opinion  various methods will present themselves upon a question of this kind and though experience is yet wanting to determine which is the best it has i think sufficiently decided which is the worst that is the worst which in its deliberations and decisions is subject to the precipitancy and passion of an individual and when the whole legislature is crowded into one body it is an individual in mass in all cases of deliberation it is necessary to have a crops of reserve and it would be better to divide the representation by lot into two parts and let them revise and correct each other than that the whole should sit together and debate at once  representative government is not necessarily confined to any one particular form the principle is the same in all the forms under which it can be arranged the equal rights of the people is the root from which the whole springs and the branches may be arranged as present opinion or future experience shall best direct as to that hospital of incurables as chesterfield calls it the british house of peers it is an excressence growing out of corruption and there is no more affinity or resemblance between any of the branches of a legislative body originating from the rights of the people and the aforesaid house of peers than between a regular member of the human body and an ulcerated wen  as to that part of government that is called the executive it is necessary in the first place to fix a precise meaning to the word  there are but two divisions into which power can be arranged first that of willing or decreeing the laws secondly that of executing or putting them in practice the former corresponds to the intellectual faculties of the human mind which reasons and determines what shall be done the second to the mechanical powers of the human body that puts that determination into practice if the former decides and the latter does not perform it is a state of imbecility and if the latter acts without the predetermination of the former it is a state of lunacy the executive department therefore is official and is subordinate to the legislative as the body is to the mind in a state of health for it is impossible to conceive the idea of two sovereignties a sovereignty to will and a sovereignty to act the executive is not invested with the power of deliberating whether it shall act or not it has no discretionary authority in the case for i can act no other thing that what the laws decree and it is obliged to act conformably thereto and in this view of the case the executive is made up of all the official departments that execute the laws of which that which is called the judiciary is the chief  but mankind have conceived an idea that some kind of authority is necessary to superintend the execution of the lws and to see that they are faithfully performed and it is by confounding this superintending authority with the official execution that we get embarrassed about the term executive power  all the parts in the governments of the united states of america that are called the executive are no other than authorities to superintend the execution of the laws and they are so far independent of the legislative that they know the legislative only through the laws and cannot be controuled or directed by it through any other medium  in what manner this superintending authority shall be appointed or composed is a matter that falls within the province of opinion some may prefer one method and some another and in all cases where opinion only and not principle is concerned the majority of opinions forms the rule for all there are however some things deducible from reason and evidenced by experience that serve to guide our decision upon the case the one is never to invest any individual with extraordinary power for besides his being tempted to misuse it it will excite contention and commotion in the nation for the office secondly never to invest power long in the hands of any number of individuals the inconveniences that may be supposed to accompany frequent changes are less to be feared than the danger that a rises from long continuance  i shall conclude this discourse with offering some observations on the means of preserving liberty for it is not only necessary that we establish it but that we preserve it  it is in the first place necessary that we distinguish between the means made use of to overthrow despotism in order to prepare the way for the establishment of liberty and the means to be used after the despotism is over thrown  the means made use of in the first case are justified by necessity those means are in general insurrections for whilst the established government of despotism continues in any country it is scarcely possible that any other means can be used it is also certain that in the commencement of a revolution the revolutionary party permit to themselves a discretionary exercise of power regulated more by circumstances than by principle which were the practice to continue liberty would never be established or if established would soon be overthrown it is never to be expected in a revolution that every man is to change his opinion at the same momnt there never yet was any truth or any principle so irrsistibly obvious that all men believed it at once time and reason must cooperate with each other to the final establishment of any principle and therefore those who may happen to be first convinced have not a right to persecute others on whom conviction operates more slowly the moral principle of revolutions is to instruct not to destroy  had a constitution been established two years ago as ought to have been done the violences that have since desolated france and injured the character of the revolution would in my opinion have been prevented the nation would then have had a bond of union and every individual would have known the line of conduct he was to follow but instead of this a revolutionary government a thing without either principle or authority was substituted in its place virtue and crime depended upon accident and that which was patriotism one day became treason the next all these things have followed from the want of a constitution for it is the nature and intention of a constitution to prevent governing by party by establishing a common principle that shall limit and control the power and impulse of party and that says to all parties thus far shall thou go and no further but in the absence of a constitution men look entirely to party and instead of principle governing party party governs principle  an avidity to punish is always dangerous to liberty it leads men to stretch to misinterpret and to misapply even the best of laws he that would make his own liberty secure must guard even his enemy from oppression for if he violates this duty he establishes a precedent that will reach to himself  thomas pain  speech of thomas pain as delivered in the convention july        wherein he alludes to the preceding work on the motion of lanthenas that permission be granted to thomas pain to deliver his sentiments on the declaration of rights and the constitution thomas pain ascended the tribune and no opposition being made to the motion one of the secretaries who stood by mr pain read his speech of which the following is a literal translation  citizens  the effects of a malignant fever with which i was afflicted during a rigorous confinement in the luxembourg have thus long prevented me from attending at my post in the bosom of the convention and the magnitude of the subject under discussion and no other consideration on earth could induce me now to repair to my station  a recurrence to the vicissitudes i have experienced and the critical situations in which i have been placed in consequence of the french revolution will throw upon what i now propose to submit to the convention the most unequivocal proofs of my integrity and the rectitude of those principles which have uniformly influenced my conduct  in england i was proscribed for having vindicated the french revolution and i have suffered a rigorous imprisonment in france for having pursued a similar mode of conduct during the reign of terrorism i was a close prisoner for eight long months and remained so above three months after the era of the  0th thermidor i ought however to scate that i was not persecuted by the people either of england or france the proceedings in both countries were the effects of the despotism existing in their respective governments but even if my persecution had originated in the people at large my principles and conduct would still have remained the same principles which are influenced and subject to the control of tyranny have not their foundation in the heart  a few days ago i transmitted to you by the ordinary mode of distribution a short treatise entitled dissertation on the first principles of government this little work i did intend to have dedicated to the people of holland who about the time i began to write it were determined to accomplish a revolution in their government  rather than to the people of france who had long before effected that glorious object but there are in the constitution which is about to be ratified by the convention certain articles and in the report which preceded it certain points so repugnant to reason and incompatible with the true principles of liberty as to render this treatise drawn up for another purpose applicable to the present occasion and under this impression i presumed to submit it to your consideration  if there be faults in the constitution it were better to expunge them now than to abide the event of their mischievous tendency for certain it is that the plan of the constitution which has been presented to you is not consistent with the grand object of the revolution nor congenial to the sentiments of the individuals who accomplished it  to deprive half the people in a nation of their rights as citizens is an easy matter in theory or on paper but it is a most dangerous experiment and rarely practicable in the execution  i shall now proceed to the observations i have to offer on this important subject and i pledge myself that they shall be neither numerous nor diffusive  in my apprehension a constitution embraces two distinct parts or objects the principle and the practice and it is not only an essential but an indispensable provision that the practice should emanate from and accord with the principle now i maintain that the converse of this proposition is the case in the plan of the constitution under discustion the first article for instance of the political state of citizens v title ii of the constitution says  every man born and resident in france who being twentyone years of age has inscribed his name on the civic register of his canton and who has lived afterward one year on the territory of the republic and who pays any direct contribution whatsoever real or personal is a french citizen  i might here ask if those only who come under the above description are to be considered as citizens what designation do you mean to give the rest of the people i allude to that portion of the people on whom the principal part of the labor falls and on whom the weight of indirect taxation will in the event chiefly press in the structure of the social fabric this class of people are insinitely superior to that privileged order whose only qualification is their wealth or territorial possessions for what is trade without merchants what is land without cultivation and what is the produce of the land without manufacturers but to return to the subject  in the first place this article is incompatible with the three first articles of the declaration of rights which precede the constitutional act  the first article of the declaration of rights says   the end of society is the public good and the institution of government is to secure to every individual the enjoyment of his rights  but the article of the constitution to which i have just adverted proposes as the object of society not the public good or in other words the good of all but a partial good or the good only of a few and the constitution provides solely for the rights of this few to the exclusion of the many  the second article of the declaration of rights says   the rights of man in society are liberty equality security of his person and property  but the article alluded to in the constitution has a direct tendency to establish the converse of this position inasmuch as the persons excluded by this inequality can neither be said to possess liberty nor security against oppression they are consigned totally to the caprice and tyranny of the rest  the third article of the declaration of rights says   liberty consists in such acts of volition as are not injurious to others  but the article of the constitution on which i have observed breaks down this barrier it enables the liberty of one part of society to destroy the freedom of the other  having thus pointed out the inconsistency of this article to the declaration of rights i shall proceed to comment on that part of the same article which makes a direct contribution a necessary qualification to the right of citizenship  a modern refinement on the object of public revenue has divided the taxes or contributions into two classes the direct and the indirect without being able to define precisely the distinction or difference between them because the effect of both is the same  those are designated indirect taxes which fall upon the consumers of certain articles on which the tax is imposed because the tax being included in the price the consumer pays it without taking notice of it  the same observation is applicable to the territorial tax the land proprietors in order to reimburse themselves will rackrent their tenants the farmer of course will transfer the obligation to the miller by enhancing the price of grain the miller to the baker by increasing the price of flour and the baker to the consumer by raising the price of bread the territorial tax therefore though called direct is in its consequences indirect  to this tax the land proprietor contributes only in proportion to the quantity of bread and other provisions that are consumed in his own family the deficit is furnished by the great mass of the community which comprehends every individual of the nation  from the logical distinction between the direct and indirect taxation some emolument may result i allow to auditors of public accounts etc but to the people at large i deny that such a distinction which by the by is without a difference can be productive of any practical benefit it ought not therefore to be admitted as a principle in the constitution  besides this objection the provision in question does not affect to define secure or establish the right of citizenship it consigns to the caprice or discretion of the legislature the power of pronouncing who shall or shall not exercise the functions of a citizen and this may be done effectually either by the imposition of a direct or indirect tax according to the selfish views of the legislators or by the mode of collecting the taxes so imposed  neither a tenant who occupies an extensive farm nor a merchant or manufacturer who may have embarked a large capital in their respective pursuits can ever according to this system attain the preemption of a citizen on the other hand any upstart who has by succession or management got possession of a few acres of land or a miserable tenement may exultingly exercise the functions of a citizen although perhaps he neither possesses a hundredth part of the worth or property of a simple mechanic nor contributes in any proportion to the exigencies of the state  the contempt in which the old government held mercantile pursuits and the obliquy that attached on merchants and manufacturers contributed not a little to its embarrassments and its eventual subversion and strange to tell though the mischiefs arising from this mode of conduct are so obvious yet an article is proposed for your adoption which has a manifest tendency to restore a defect inherent in the monarchy  i shall now proceed to the second article of the same title with which i shall conclude my remarks  the second article says every french soldier who shall have served one or more campaigns in the cause of liberty is deemed a citizen of the republic without any respect or reference to other qualifications  it should seem that in this article the committee were desirous of extricating themselves from a dilemma into which they had been plunged by the preceding article when men depart from an established principle they are compelled to resort to trick and subterfuge always shifting their means to preserve the unity of their objects and as it rarely happens that the first expedient makes amends for the prostitution of principle they must call in aid a second of a more flagrant nature to supply the deficiency of the former in this manner legislators go on accumulating error upon error and artifice upon artifice until the mass becomes so bulky and incongruous and their embarrassment so desperate that they are compelled as their last expedient to resort to the very principle they had violated  the committee were precisely in this predicament when they framed this article and to me i confess their conduct appears specious rather than efficacious  it was not for himself alone but for his family that the french citizen at the dawn of the revolution for then indeed every man was considered a citizen marched soldierlike to the frontiers and repelled a foreign invasion he had it not in his contemplation that he should enjoy liberty for the residue of his earthly career and by his own act preclude his offri from that inestimable blessing no i wished to leave it as an inheritance to his children and that they might hand it down to their latest posterity if a frenchman who united in his person the character of a soldier and a citizen was now to return from the army to his peaceful habitation he must address his small family in this manner  sorry i am that i cannot leave to you a small portion of what i have acquired by exposing my person to the ferocity of our enemies and defeating their machinations i have established the republic and painful the reflection all the laurels i have won in the field are blasted and all the privileges to which my exertions have entitled me extend not beyond the period of my own existence thus the measure that has been adopted by way of subterfuge falls short of what the framers of it speculated upon for in conciliating the affections of the soldier they have subjected the father to the most pungent sensations by obliging him to adopt a generation of slaves  citizens a great deal has been urged respecting insurrections i am confident no man has a greater abhorrence of them than myself and i am sorry that any insinuations should have been thrown out upon me as a promoter of violence of any kind the whole tenor of my life and conversation gives the lie to those calumnies and proves me to be a friend to order truth and justice  i hope you will attribute this effusion of my sentiments to my anxiety for the honor and success of the revolution i have no interest distinct from that which has a tendency to meliorate the situation of mankind the revolution as far as it respects myself has been productive of more loss and persecution than it is possible for me to describe or for you to indemnify but with respect to the subject under consideration i could not refrain from declaring my sentiments  in my opinion if you subvert the basis of the revolution if you dispense with principles and substitute expedients you will extinguish that enthusiasin and energy which have hitherto been the life and soul of the revolution and you will substitute in its place nothing but a cold indifference and selfinterest which will again degenerate into intrigue cunning and effeminacy  but to discard all considerations of a personal and subordinate nature it is essential to the wellbeing of the republic that the practical or organic part of the constitution should correspond with its principles and as this does not appear to be the case in the plan that has been presented to you it is absolutely necessary that it should be submitted to the revision of a committee who should be instructed to compare it with the declaration of rights in order to ascertain the difference between the two and to make such alterations as shall render them perfectly consistent and compatible with each other
