an additional dialogue of the dead  an additional dialogue of the dead between pericles and aristides being a sequel to the dialogue between pericles and cosmo  alteram partem audi london printed for l davis and c reymers opposite graysinngate in holbourn mdcclx  advertisement though the study of history be instructive and useful yet in one respect it becomes the source of frequent error even when it is written with impartiality and truth this arises from a mistaken application of historical facts this error is apt to creep into all reasonings on every subject where men and manners are concerned but it is peculiarly apt to infect political reasonings above all others as the political interests of men make the principal subject of history so the political reasoner has recourse to history as the best support of his argument but though the politician is of all others the readiest to appeal to history yet he seems of all others most liable to be mistaken in his application of it to his own purpose because the political connexions and interests of men are above all others complicated and various hence as no two political constitutions were ever the same in all their circumstances though similar in many so all arguments drawn from a partial resemblance must be inadequate and inconclusive unless when it appears that no other circumstances took place by which that partial resemblance might be counteracted and it is effects destroyed yet it has been a practice too common among political reasoners from a partial resemblance between two states to infer a total one and because they have been like in some respects to draw conclusions as if they had been like in all here then appears a source of perpetual error  among all the political questions that can be debated in a free country there is none of greater importance than that which regards the character and influence of the body of a people nothing has been more usual among political reasoners than to represent the body of every people as the ready tools of demagogues and faction and since the endless factions of the athenian republic have been so often alleged as unanswerable proofs of this the intelligent reader will easily discern that the tendency of the following dialogue is to fix this argument to it is proper limits and prevent a too general application of a particular fact  an additional dialogue of the dead pericles and aristides aristides i am glad to have found you pericles since your conversation with cosmo which you know i overheard i have been revolving the subject of it in my mind and begin to think you left the matter short   pericles your sentiments on this subject will give me pleasure tell me aristides in what respect do you esteem the conclusion of our argument to have been defective   aristides with regard to yourself i think your conclusions were just i grant you that by weakening the power of the court of the areopagus you tore up that anchor which solon had fixed to keep his republic steadfast and firm against the storms of popular faction on this account i farther must allow that notwithstanding the integrity which you preserved in your public conduct and the great virtues which you exerted your place in elysium is justly below that of those who have governed republics or limited monarchies not merely with a concern for their present advantage but with a prudent regard to that balance of power on which their permanent happiness always depends   pericles if you allow me this it is all i contend for what could remain farther to be adjusted in the debate   aristides i am of opinion that the question was decided in too general a manner and that for want of a little more particularity of argument and proof conclusions might be plausibly drawn which would be very distant from the truth   pericles pray explain yourself a little farther aristides for as yet i do not clearly comprehend you   aristides what i mean is this that free states or limited monarchies though they may greatly resemble each other in their external construction may yet be so very unlike in their internal condition that no just conclusions could be drawn concerning their prosperity and welfare merely from their external resemblance thus we will suppose two states to be equally free in their legal constitution but let us farther suppose that the manners or principles which prevail in these two states are widely different and in that case i apprehend that if you regard only the legal form of the constitution without weighing the manners and principles of the members of the state you will be in great danger of imposing false conclusions on yourself and others   pericles i did not force any of these conclusions upon you they are of your own making   aristides it is true you did not force them upon me yet they are not of my own making for some of the shades who overheard your conversation have since told me that the general turn of your discourse obliquely led to these conclusions and therefore thought that it would become aristides to discuss this point with a little more precision   pericles i am ready to hear any thing you have to say on this interesting subject   aristides you will give me leave then to examine some things that passed in your discourse with cosmo   pericles pray be as free with them as you please i rely on the candor as well as justice of aristides   aristides i will endeavor to deserve your favorable opinion you may remember you said that by weakening the power of the court of areopagus you tore up that anchor which solon had fixed to keep his republic steadfast and firm against the storms of popular factions this i think was the first foundation of your argument   pericles it was   aristides is it a safe practice pericles to build an argument on a metaphor   pericles i should think it is provided the metaphor contain a just image of the fact in question   aristides that i allow but still the question remains whether the metaphor contain that just image or not so that we are not yet advanced a step toward the discovery of truth   pericles at least it is an illustration   aristides then i think it had better have come after the discovery i believe i can give you another metaphor which shall lead directly to the contrary conclusion it is a wise practice you say to keep fixed the anchor in general i grant you it is so yet you know that in times of tempest and distress the most experienced admiral when anchored near a rocky shore is forced to slip his cables and commit his fleet to the wide sea till he can anchor on a safer bottom   pericles that is a dangerous practice   aristides true and therefore never to be tried except in a time of extreme danger   pericles well i will grant you that a metaphor proves nothing   aristides that is the only purpose for which i intended mine we will proceed therefore with our argument and the sum of what i have to say will only tend to the proof of this single point that a free state or limited monarchy resembling that of athens in it is external form may yet be so differently circumstanced in it is internal condition that a conduct in many respects similar to yours shall be the only means of saving that state from ruin though your well meant conduct led the state of athens to it is destruction   pericles it seems to me aristides that you undertake a task of no small difficulty proceed i am all attention   aristides pray tell me pericles was the court of the areopagus wise courageous incorrupt and bent upon the public service in opposition to all selfinterested views when you set about to lessen it is authority   pericles to my confusion i must confess it was for in fact the annual magistrates the guardians of the laws the governors of the sacred rites and chieftains in war were all chosen by lot and they who had acquitted themselves well in the discharge of these trusts were advanced and taken into the court of the areopagus plutarch in his life of pericles    aristides you are right in your idea of this wise and disinterested court tell me farther now was the body of the athenian people sensible honest and united when you threw yourself into their arms and increased their power   pericles i cannot say much either for their good sense their uprightness or their union on the contrary i fear they were ignorant selfinterested and disunited nay i must farther confess that i myself was the cause and promoter of their vices and factious temper for i not only gained and ruled them by my eloquence as i confessed in my conversation with cosmo but by giving them the plunder and possession of the lands taken from the enemy and by squandering the public moneys formerly reserved for the uses of war in shows and plays for their entertainment and by giving them largesses or pensions i brought them from a sober modest and thrifty people who maintained themselves by their own labors to become riotous and debauched through these mistaken methods of policy thus it was that i turned them against the court of the areopagus plutarch in his life of pericles    aristides it gives me pleasure to find you so much more full and explicit in this affair than you were in your discourse with cosmo  so then you took power from a body of men wise disinterested and incorrupt to put it into the hands of men ignorant selfinterested and factious   pericles too true i did because i knew that my eloquence would with these other methods still more powerful subject the people to me and make them the instruments of all my desires whereas the areopagus had an authority and a dignity in it which i could not control   aristides so you said in your discourse with cosmo let us now reverse these facts and suppose the court of the areopagus had deserted the principles of their first institution that either luxury the love of gain or a spirit of false ambition had crept in among them and rendered them either incapable and corrupt and farther let us suppose that the body of the people had been sensible honest and united what had been the consequence   pericles the case indeed had been altogether different i would give all the wreaths i ever was honored with to have built my conduct on so noble a foundation   aristides i commend your wisdom though it comes too late the case indeed had been not only altogether different but altogether contrary instead of destroying the commonwealth you had restored the tottering fabric you had then taken power from folly and corruption to bestow it on sense and integrity and depend upon it in whatever body of men sense and integrity are found these are the anchors of the state   pericles your maxim looks plausible yet still i cannot but regard it as a dangerous practice to make a breach in the established constitution of a free state   aristides so do i and i think your principle is so far from overturning that it confirms my argument   pericles that appears to me a strange paradox   aristides tell me pericles is not a breach made in the political constitution of a free state when it is wholesome laws and institutions have lost their power and efficacy   pericles certainly   aristides and can they so entirely lose their power and efficacy in any other way as by the incapacity and corruption of those who govern   pericles i allow they cannot   aristides then you see that upon supposition that the court of the areopagus had lost their ability or public virtue it is they who first deprive the laws of their power and efficacy and consequently it is they who make the breach in the established constitution   pericles this seems to be true but still why should the people follow their example and by insisting on extraordinary powers and privileges make a second breach in the constitution   aristides o pericles you view the question with a partial eye what you call a second breach in the constitution is indeed no more than the natural effort of the sound parts of the body politic to throw off the morbific matter by which it is oppressed thus in the natural body all diseases come to their crisis and a cure is effected by the vigor and activity of the uninfected parts wherever then the disease lies either in the body politic or the body natural the sound parts must check and throw off that which is infected or death ensues  thus you see supposing the people to be sensible and honest and the court of areopagus corrupted or incapable the only means of saving the state is the power which the people have to check and reform the court of the areopagus   pericles but is not this unhinging the constitution   aristides so far from it that it is the only way of fixing it by bringing it back to it is first principles  how did this famed constitution first arise was it not by the united consent of the several ranks of the community each of which had their several privileges and powers appropriated on condition of applying them to the public good the court of the areopagus violates it is engagements the voice of an honest and abused people rouzes them from their fatal dream what is the natural consequence why surely the reformation of the court of the areopagus an honest and sensible people never desires more than redress of grievances and when that is obtained return cheerfully to subordination and adore their rulers   pericles this is at best an unstable and fluctuating state of things   aristides every political state must be in some degree fluctuating and unstable unless you load it with the chains of despotism but i maintain that the best security nay the only one to a free government lies in the upright manners and principles of it is constituent members and that whenever there is any deviation from these the only possibility of a restoration lies in the prevalence of the sound and virtuous part over that which is corrupted in whatever part of the community the infection may lie whether it be the court of the areopagus or the body of the people for as it was truly observed in your discourse with cosmo force or caprice may give immediate and temporary power but nothing can give a lusting authority except wisdom and virtue dialogues of the dead p        pericles but is not this a dangerous principle to instill into the body of the people that they have a right to control the errors of the court of areopagus does it not lead to sedition and anarchy and was not this the consequence of my mistaken conduct   aristides you are now puzzling the question again by making it general i reply then that in your particular case the practice was dangerous and fatal because the court of the areopagus was capable and honest the people of athens were incapable selfinterested and factious you therefore tore up the anchor of the state but suppose the court of the areopagus to have been incapable and venal and you have seen that the security of the republic was already lost you have seen to use your own metaphor in the way of illustration that the anchor of the state was already torn up and the only bottom on which it could be again safely cast was the rational influence of a sensible and honest people   pericles but supposing i had not corrupted the integrity of the athenian people do you think they could have remained secure against the influence of indiscreet or venal orators who encouraged by my example might have misled their honest intentions and rowzed them into sedition against an uncorrupted court of the areopagus   aristides tell me pericles what was the number of the people of athens   pericles i cannot be precise in this but i know that the number of those whose favor and influence i courted did not exceed that of a large audience i have often harangued them in one collective body   aristides what was their rank and what their employments in life   pericles they were composed as you know very well of laborers and mechanics all who were able to keep a horse were admitted into the seond order of the magistracy plutarch in the life of solon  and therefore the body of the people whose influence i courted was composed of such as were not able to keep a horse   aristides what was their capacity   pericles you will not expect much of that it was suited to their station   aristides your account is just and therefore i confess pericles that in my opinion they never could be secure against the seduction of indiscreet and venal orators their small number their continual necessities their general ignorance must for ever expose them to the delusions of a powerful rhetoric   pericles then i think my consequence stands good that the united voice even of an honest people can be no ground of security to a state   aristides i grant you it is not where the people are such in number station and incapacity as in your time the athenian people were but take heed lest you make your inference too general the only just consequence that can be drawn is this that a republic so circumstanced is absolutely void of all security for you see that in case the court of the areopagus was delinquent the people were not of sufficient capacity or weight to restore the balance of the state on the other hand supposing that court to be incorrupt you see that the people were liable to be seduced to it is destruction such a republic therefore was formed for continual factions while it lasted and then for a speedy death   pericles do you think aristides that by a change of circumstances these evils could admit of any remedy   aristides i think they might  in your discourse with cosmo you hinted at a limited monarchy i will therefore leave this imperfect form this embryo of a commonwealth to speak of a more august image of a government suppose therefore that the athenian state instead of a petty province had been a large populous and fertile country governed by a king and two courts vested with higher powers than that of the areopagus the court of the areopagus was judicial not legislative  that one of them had been hereditary the other chosen by the body of the people and that the legislative power was lodged in the united suffrages of these three    pericles you charm me by the very supposition  what a glorious republic    aristides do not you see pericles that all i have said concerning the state of athens would gain new strength under such a supposition   pericles my views must be narrow indeed if i could not see some differences arise pray go on   aristides in the first place what could shake such a kingdom as this if all the several powers maintained the purity and vigor of their institution   pericles methinks i see the picture of an eternal government   aristides but suppose that by the excess of commerce and an overflow of wealth or by any other cause a pernicious luxury should creep in and steal unperceived on the higher ranks suppose farther that the very genius of the constitution formed for the noblest ends should yet have a natural tendency toward political venality and corruption unless strongly guarded by a purity of principle and manners and suppose this political venality should in fact creep in along with luxury what consequences would you expect   pericles you terrify me by the representation i behold the state on the brink of ruin instead of ability courage and public spirit among the leading ranks i see them immersed in every fatal indulgence i see their councils divided their fleets and armies disgraced and some neighboring philip in possession of their forts and colonies   aristides where would you seek for the cure of these enormous evils   pericles certainly no cure can take place till ability courage and public spirit should arise on the ruins of their contraries   aristides your aim is good but the grand question is by what means this can be effected   pericles i fear the means must be violent i have heard you talk of a coercive power sufficient to reform corruption   aristides where do you think this might most probably be found   pericles i am casting about but i cannot find it my experience makes me afraid of the interposition of the people    aristides what even though they were honest and sensible why should you fear the influence of a general good sense and integrity   pericles i cannot conceive it probable that the lower ranks should be more sensible or more upright than their superiors in station   aristides i can suppse nay i do suppose that many of the higher ranks are sensible upright and worthy in several respects that they have many private virtues that justice and humanity are their allowed qualities that their chief defect lies in their want of public virtue in their neglect of the public happiness   pericles what probability could there be then that the people should attend to this when it was neglected by their leaders   aristides tell me pericles when there are honest inclinations in the soul whence can any obstructions arise to their due exertion   pericles why sure from some contrary inclinations which may tempt the mind from it is natural integrity   aristides you are right so then if in a state thus circumstanced the body of the people should be more steady than their leaders in their zeal for the public welfare this must be because they are not liable to the same temptations which might expose them to a like neglect of the general happiness   pericles what you say seems probable   aristides cannot you discern certain circumstances which would naturally arise and prove strong temptations to the great while the body of the people might for a time at least escape them   pericles let me weigh the matter  yes indeed from what you said before i think i can  you supposed as i remember that luxury had crept in    aristides go on i see you comprehend the argument   pericles i perceive the natural consequence of this must be that the higher ranks would be first infected with it and therefore must be exposed to temptations which the body of the people would escape one temptation must naturally arise from that unmanly or effeminate character which a refined luxury tends to introduce another from an intemperate desire of supplying expenses now grown exorbitant   aristides you say true but can you point out no farther temptations to which the leading ranks would be naturally exposed beyond the body of the people   pericles these are what offered themselves to my thoughts do you see any more   aristides many and strong ones  in a kingdom thus circumstanced extensive fertile mercantile rich and populous a countless number of lucrative offices must arise and be established for the protection and good order of the state   pericles i grant it   aristides what part of the community do you think would lay claim to these the superior ranks or the inferior   pericles doubtless the superior their education rank wealth and influence would naturally lead them to expect a preference   aristides and if you farther suppose that luxury and expense prevailed these posts would be more eagerly sought for in proportion as they were more lucrative   pericles true the profit i fear would often be a leading motive   aristides the higher ranks then would be naturally assiduous to recommend themselves to those who had the disposal of these profitable employments while the body of the people because generally excluded from all hope of being raised to them would be more independent of those in power   pericles i must needs grant it   aristides see you no consequences arise   pericles you have convinced me aristides i see that the higher ranks in such a state though equally possessed of private virtues must be much more exposed to the temptations of political venality and corruption than the body of the people   aristides that is the truth to which i meant to lead you   pericles yet still i fear the effects of popular power because by experience i know the influence of indiscreet and venal orators over the passions of a misguided infatuated multitude who thought their freedom consisted in encouraging calumnies against the best servants of the republic and conferring power on those who had no other merit than falling in with and soothing a popular folly dialogues of the dead p        aristides this objection as i said before may be of weight in a small republic such as that of athens was in your days or mine but supposing it to have been augmented into a great populous civilized and powerful kingdom such as i have now represented which contains more square leagues than attica contains acres more cities than attica contains villages more men of fortune than attica contains mechanics and the objection vanishes into nothing i can easily see how a busy orator may mount the rostrum and intoxicate an ignorant multitude that surrounds him and this pericles i fear was your imprudence nay perhaps my own in a small state like that of athens such an event as this must affect the public welfare but in a kingdom so enlarged and so enlightened as that which i have supposed the harangues of an orator to any surrounding audience of the people can no more affect the general welfare than the buzzing of an eloquent be can affect a province when he leads out the murmuring hive on the mountains of hybla or hymettus   pericles do you think the difference so great   aristides i do because in a city like that of athens the whole multitude of the community is easily collected in one body and therefore may be suddenly seduced by an orator into one ill purpose but in a great and populous kingdom the whole multitude of the community cannot be collected into one body nay nor into a hundred bodies and therefore cannot be suddenly seduced by an orator into one ill purpose   pericles i grant you the difference is in this respect essential   aristides there is another respect in which the difference is no less essential and important you have confessed pericles that the people or multitude which you seduced were a rabble of laborers and mechanics who had been accustomed to earn their bread by the sweat of their brows see above and plutarch in his life of pericles but if attica had been enlarged into so vast a kingdom as i have here supposed the body of the people would have been of a character far superior for besides those of the highest rank and fortune who would naturally form the two courts of the areopagus and aspire to the leading offices in the commonwealth besides these i say there would be an innumerable number of landed commoners the general body of the priesthood the rich merchants and wealthy plebeians of inferior rank all independent of the governing powers many of them of excellent ability as well as probity most of them of leisure and education sufficient to enable them to judge of the leading lines or features of an upright government especially in the great article of protection from foreign or domestic injuries and can you think it possible that the good sense and honesty of all these should be seduced into their own destruction by a designing or venal orator   pericles i must confess it is utterly incredible   aristides still farther as it would be thus impossible to seduce by eloquence so it would be no less impracticable to corrupt by bribes this whole body of men to the desertion of their own true interest a few nay indeed a number might be thus corrupted but this would never produce an united voice for the remaining part and that much the largest would loudly clamor and thus nothing but discord could arise to silence so many millions by repeated bribes would require ten times the wealth of croesus and more than ever man nay more than ever nation possessed   pericles you have reason in what you say i perceive now that nothing but a fair and open prosecution of the general interest could ever unite so great a people   aristides i am of your opinion and thus you see that as the small ignorant and needy body of the athenian people in such a state as you and i beheld it is the easiest of all to be seduced by eloquence or gained by bribes so upon it is being aggrandized into such a vast knowing and wealthy body as i have here supposed it would above all others have been secure against the attacks either of eloquence or corruption   pericles i perceive i have been confounding two things together as being altogether similar when in reality their qualities are altogether opposite and this merely because they are called by the same appellation the body of the people   aristides at length you see the foundation of your error   pericles i confess aristides that in my discourse with cosmo these distinguishing particularities were not sufficiently attended to i drew inferences and extended consequences to all free states without exception which could only be justly applied to a small republic circumstanced like that of athens   aristides you see then pericles that if athens had been a great rich literate and powerful republic under the appearance and name of a limited monarchy you could have had no chance for seducing the whole collective body of the people either by bribes or eloquence   pericles i allow it   aristides you see farther that in case of any delinquency in the courts of the areopagus if you had exerted your talents in support of the general welfare this great and grateful people with one united voice would have adopted and adored you yet only so long as you had made that general welfare the undoubted object of your labors   pericles it seems probable   aristides you see then that by building your power on so firm a foundation you would have been enabled to dispense rewards and punishments with justice and vigor that you could have displaced the incapable and unworthy and put into action those who were most fit to discharge the several offices of the commonwealth that you could by degrees have checked the venality and incapacity of the various ranks and thus have given the proper elasticity and tone to the several parts of the body politic   pericles all this i think possible to have been done   aristides but in doing all this you would have been so far from unhinging government that you would have newhinged it when it was falling so far from destroying the balance of power that you would have renewed it when it had been destroyed so far from acting with a view to present advantage only that you would have secured the future welfare of the state so far from consulting a mere temporary felicity that you would have fixed it on a principle of permanent happiness   pericles i cannot deny it   aristides haste then pericles and lest mistakes should grow inveterate by time inform cosmo of all that has passed between us   finis lately published by l davis and c reymers essays on the characteristics of the earl of shaftsbury the fourth edition  an
