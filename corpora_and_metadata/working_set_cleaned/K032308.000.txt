acquainted fellow   fain oh  that is too long a story at present   sir john fainwell  what the devil is this metamorphose for   fain love almighty love copying of the gods you know   sir john what game are you in pursuit of   fain the old standing dish a wife here is no hopes of war no rising in view and subalterns pay will make a man rub but slowly through the world i have got leave of my colonel to be absent from my post for two months in which time i intend to make my fortune  you know the widow headless   sir john very well ha  is not that her livery   fain yes faith i march in the number of her retinue   sir john to what end   fain that is uncertain if you know the widow you are no stranger to her taste in servants   sir john i know she keeps none but awkard country things   fain ay and is a perfect jockey in her family and takes as much pains to polish her train as they do to break their young colts now you must know i pass with her for as arrant a rustic as ever wielded

character of a footman   fain no no under the character of a gentleman of fifteen hundred pounds a year in gloucestershire of which country i pretend to be for having quartered heretofore in that shire i counterfeit the dialect very well   sir john but what service can this be to you   fain why i write to her as from mr worthy my man brings the letters and i deliver them as jeffrey her footman and when i find her in humor i intend to give her my picture in so simple a manner that she shall take it all for gospel   sir john but what signifies the copy how will you introduce the original   fain that has been done already i have made her several visits my man is now gone to her with a letter   sir john but suppose she should enquire after this mr worthy it is an easy matter to know all the gentlemen in gloucestershire and what estates they are possessed of too   fain she cannot trap me there if she does for between you and i there is such a person as mr worthy master of the very estate i mention who has given me leave to take his name  but i have discovered since i have been in her house that an irish baron is my rival   sir john then you are undone for i am told she declares against matrimony without a title who is he   fain my lord pharoahbank i think they call him of the county of tipperary   sir john i dont remember ever to have heard of any such nobleman   fain recommended they say by sir philip moneylove   sir john for which he is to have a valuable consideration for i am sure he does nothing out of honor or honesty i wish thee success with all my heart   fain i thank you freeman but prithee who are you in mourning for is the old knight at rest six foot deep ha jack   sir john he has been dead to me these seven years but is now so to all the world fainwell   fain sir john i give thee joy of four thousand pounds per annum embracing him   sir john i hope you will give me the estate too fainwell for i assure you i have not one foot of land by the death of my father   enter sam fain he did not disinherit thee sure   sir john neither better nor worse   sam i ever thought my old master would dye hard and take the left hand road   sir john ha what is sam with you still   sam you know sir i always stick as close to my masters as their breeches   sir john ay whilst there is any money in them but i remember you left me for fear of starving   sam starving oh no no  not starving sir though i must confess my waistband was three inches too wide for me   fain you saucy rascal ha ha well did you deliver my letter   sam yes i did sir and into the widows own hands and truly by what i can find sir you have nothing to hope for if i have any judgment   fain why what have you discovered   sam why i observed when she read your epistle she smiled scornfully thus  tossed your letter upon her toylet turned upon her heel tippd her maid a box of the ear for grinning and bad me tell you it required no answer   sir john cold comfort   fain not a jot the less for giving herself that air but is it possible that pure partyrage could make thy father so unkind sir john   sir john add to that some little wildnesses but the main thing that did my business was this when i found nothing would open his pursestrings i pretended to embrace his principles   sam i remember that time sir we lived in clover then many a delicious morsel of flesh have i served up and supped luxuriously out of your leavings sir   sir john but as the devil would have it one day in my cups i chanced to stumble into a nonjuring meeting with half a dozen honest officers at my back drove out the congregation tied the parson neck and heels locked the door and took the key in my pocket   fain good and what became of old sedition   sir john some of his flock returning to evening prayer broke open the door and freed him from durance amongst which number was my natural father   fain rather unnatural that was very unlucky sir john   sir john ay for that action not only lost me a paternal blessing but a paternal estate   fain which would have afforded thee many blessings wine and women sir john the only blessings in this world so your younger brother ned has the estate i suppose   sir john every acre my fortune is crammed into such a narrow circumference i can cover it with my thumb only  a single shilling   fain damned barbarity s death were he my brother i would cut his throat   sam there is the inside of a soldier for you aside   sir john so say passion and necessity but conscience and humanity offer to my cooler thoughts a brown musket rather i confess i long to exert the elder brother and beat him a little in order to which i have done all i could to provoke him to give me occasion but he avoids me as carefully as if he durst not fight though i know he is no coward   fain well heaven be praised i am not afraid of being disinherited i wear my fortune with my red coat and whilst there is one mischiefmaking priest in the world soldiers will never want bread   sam ay the priests have ever been fast friends to the soldiers nothing like a pulpitdrum  but it ruins the surgeons business quite   sir john ay how so   sam why where is the occasion for their retailing lancet when the other lets the nation blood by wholesale   fain my rascal has a kind of smattering after wit ha ha no more of your impertinence   sam impertinence these gentlemen will allow no body to say a good thing but themselves aside   sir john ha yonder is my brother coming this way how stately the rogue walks with three footmen at his heels   fain whilst thou have not so much as one scoundrel to pick up a wench for thee   sam oh for that sir with your leave he may always command his humble servant   fain he struts like an elder brother he wants nothing but your title sir john   sir john i wish i could transfer it for it is of no use to me honors a commodity not vendable among the merchants there is no drawback upon it   fain that is a mistake sir john i have known a statesman pawn his honor as often as merchants enter the same commodity for exportation and like them draw it back so cleverly that those who give him credit upon it never perceived it till the great man was out of post   sir john honors a stale cheat   fain it may pass at court or the groomporters but no citizen will lend a shilling upon it   enter ned freeman ned brother your servant if this young fellow had not been in a livery i should have sworn it had been ensign fainwell   fain the very numerical person you mention is as you see at your service mr freeman i believe you are surpised at the figure i make but there are reasons which another time shall be yours in the mean while i must entreat that wherever you see me you know me for nothing above my present appearance   ned whatever design you may have in view it shall never miscarry through any fault of mine  well how go matters in the north captain   sir john your party performed no wonders there   ned nay if you are entering upon party matters good bytye you know i always decline politics in your company   sir john it is the sign of an ill cause   ned then disputes will not mend it here  which color would you advise me to for a wedding suit   fain what just upon the brink of matrimony is it with the dutch lady you wrote such panegyricks on when you was in holland   ned what the old burgomasters daughter of haerlem no no that affairs ended long since she was a good natured fond fool and to say truth i did love her but the old carl her father did not like a younger brother for a soninlaw then and i am a better friend to my country than to take a dutch wife now i did him one piece of service i left some english blood in his family i met a gentleman at paris who told me she was brought to bed of a fine boy   sir john if i mistake not you made that lady a promise of marriage brother   ned could i do less for a maidenhead   fain it is the custom in holland after such a promise the girl never scruples to go to bed and thinks herself as much your wife as if the parson had said grace and if ever you are found in that country their laws will oblige you to perform articles   ned ay if they catch me in the corn let em put me in the pound   sir john whatever you think of such proceedings i assure you i should have very little confidence in that man who forfeited his faith and honor to a woman   ned preserve your opinion brother the ladies will like you never the better for it every female has vanity enough to believe her charms sufficient to secure what another lost   fain but who is the object of your present passion   sir john pray heaven it proves not where i guess aside   fain who is the beauty that inslaves you now   ned nay i am not so prodigiously enslaved as you imagine   sir john what and just going to be married   sam mr freeman speaks like an experienced traveller he is entering upon a journey for life the whip and spur are for the short stages of love it would kill the devil to ride full speed down a lane that has neither end nor turning   ned ha ha ha sam has a right notion of matrimony   sir john a lady must be extremely happy with such a husband but may we not know the lady   ned yes yes brother i am not ashamed of the lady she has beauty enough for a wife and one charm as desirable as a new mistress   fain videlicet   ned twenty thousand pounds   sir john ha that one article strikes through me   aside ned it is sir philip moneyloves daughter   sir john as i imagined  this blow wounds deeper than my being disinherited have you that ladys consent brother   ned i have her fathers and he has the disposal of her fortune though left by her grandfather she commands not a penny if she marries without his consent   sir john a most pernicious clause  yet if louisa his dutch mistress who i have sent for comes time enough i may chance to spoil your market   aside ned i think i stand very fair i have had his promise these ten days   sir john just the time that sir philip forbid me his house since when i have often watched him in and fearing the consequence i sent for his mistress and if there is the least grain of virtue left in that heap of muck and immorality sir philip i may yet prevent this hateful match aside   fain i wish you joy mr freeman    sir john wish him hell where he may taste in part the pains he gives me now  olivia  oh my olivia  aside   ned my brother has no relish for my good fortune  i perceive you affect gravity in my company sir john and seem to have no taste for any joy of mine  prithee how have i offended you may have reason to blame our father perhaps but how is that my fault i have really as much love for you as if you had been born a year after me and will treat you as well   fain that is to say he shall live like your brother    ned he shall live as he thinks fit sir i shall not pretend to direct him   fain but you must put it in his power  come shall i make a proposal   ned out with it   fain buy him a colonels post in the guards   ned i dont think to part with any money that way    sir john not without it were to serve a certain person you know where oh that vile restless principle of yours    ned shall never disturb you with a commission any where look ye brother you shall not want for what is necessary   sir john necessary i suppose you reserve to your own judgment how far that word may extend   ned it shall extend so far sir as becomes a brother who has the estate to him that has none   sam humph that is as much as to say in plain english you may starve or steal and be hanged for him aside   sir john as far as becomes your elder brother   ned i cannot say that for perhaps you may fancy my estate may become you better than it does me   sir john your estate going up to him   sam stepping between sir sir with your leave whereabouts do you think the soul of my old master may be now   ned that thought never entered my head sirrah i know where his material soul the estate is and how to spend it too so brother if you will be cheerful    sir john cheerful bid the directors when there is a run upon the bank be cheerful the merchant who hears the shipwreck of his freighted vessel or bid the mother weeping over the corpse of her departed son be cheerful  bid them be mad rather to avoid reflection  cheerful quotha   sam that is breaking a mans legs and then bidding him cut capers aside   fain philosophy is a noble study sir john but few of us poor rogues can pursue it   sir john with what elegance might my brother there display the beauty of patience and poverty   ned no faith jack i am no orator   keeps looking upon the papers sir john oh what serenity of mind attends four thousand pounds a year whilst passion pride and all the deadlysins fill up the train of a poor dog like me   sam that is true to a tittle i know it by my self aside   sir john poor olivia now i understand thy letter wherein thou said that we must part for ever but i will see thee now though certain death attend it though robbed of birthright by this younger brother let him not hope to take my mistress from me   such an attempt will far more dangerous prove he robs me of my life that robs me of my love  exit ned that is the color for my money   fain ay white is the bridegrooms color   ned ha what is my brother gone   fain so it seems  poor sir john    ned pox of this livery i should have been glad we could have dined together to day   sam now you talk of dining  your uncle called at your lodging this morning sir and bad me tell you he wonders how you bestow your time that you dont come and dine with him as usual    ned who is that   fain an uncle of mine to whom i had once some hopes of being heir   ned and what has stifled them   fain why the devil put matrimony in his head and spoiled my fortune    ned then he has children has he   fain one which happening to be redhaird and the parson of the parish being sandy my uncle not content with forbidding him his house bid adieu to the country and brought my aunt to town   sam an excellent place to preserve virtue in   ned how came he to suspect the doctor   fain why my aunt is a roman catholic you must know and i suppose my uncle had a mind to make a good protestant of her and brought the doctor to convert her but finding his arguments more prevalent for love than religion thought fit to remove her   ned ha ha ha where has he lodged her   fain he has taken a house in the pall mall within a door of my colonels    sam who has as good a hand at converting as the parson if he can find a way to come at her aside   ned in the pall mall if this should be my mistress now aside so the old fellow is very jealous of her you say   fain so jealous that he locks her up it seems resolving to father no children for the future but his own he allows her the sight of nothing that is male   ned it must be she this agrees exactly with her story aside such restraint sets all the wheels of invention at work and a million to nothing but she will find a way to use him as he deserves and how does she take it   sam oh not at all sir  you hear my master say she is locked up   ned her confinement i mean sirrah   sam oh her confinement   fain not seeing her the last time i dined there i inquired after her health and was answered she was indisposed yet i observed he cut her a plate of every thing that came to the table and sent up to her chamber which as the maid told me afterward is his constant custom of late when any body dines with him he is a true spanish husband   ned and if she proves but a true english wife his children may be nothing akin to him for all his caution is she handsome   fain so handsome that i could venture my soul with her and if i had her consent my uncle watchit should be advanced in honors  you understand me   ned watchit mum that is the name fainwell must not know where i live aside  you would not cuckold your uncle would ye   fain why not i think a well bred gentleman ought to have as much regard to the breed of his family as a foxhunter has to those of his dogs and horses where do you lodge mr freeman i must bring a schoolfellow of mine to wait on you one who has a play upon the stocks you must give him leave to dedicate to you it is young distich   ned ha little distich i shall be glad to see him when i have finished an affair which i have upon my hands at present i shall come somewhere to this end of the town but i am incog for a little while   fain what are you upon an intrigue   ned yes faith and with one of the prettiest women in town a citizens wife whose husband is tinctured with thy uncles distemper he permits her neither to pay or receive visits but in spite of his blockade i have found means to open a communication between my self and his female and hope i shall be able to spring a mine and blow up the fort of her chastity maugre all his iron guards   fain you talk like an engineer mr freeman but if she is so closely confined how got you acquainted with her   ned very accidentally you must know her house and that which i lodge in were formerly one so that there are doors remaining though fastened up  sitting one evening in my chamber reading i heard the voice of women and found by their discourse twas a lady complaining to her maid of her husbands ill usage if i were in your place says the maid i would be revenged of the old brute ay quoth the lady but show me the means  upon which having bored a hole in the door i put my mouth to it and cried the means is ready madam if you will consent to it she was a little surpised at first but we soon came to a right understanding   fain ha ha so she opened the door   ned not that door but the chambermaid who knew her business perfectly well after inquiring who lodged at next house in the morning knocked gently at this private door and calling me by my name gave me to understand that there was a door between her room and a garret in our house which if i could find the way to open i might have an opportunity of playing a game at picquet with her lady sometimes in her masters absence i took the hint agreed with my landlord for that garret and fell to work immediately the passage was soon opened and we came to an interview liked one anothers proposals called for the cards and sat down to play where i had the game all to nothing having point quint and quatorze the first deal had not the old fellow come in and forced us to throw up our cards   fain for which you both cursed him i suppose but you have found a time it is to be hoped to finish your game   ned i shall do this day i believe wish me success fainwell   fain i do with all my heart i know you used to be generous you will not expose her when you have corrupted her you may help your friends before she falls into the hands of the public   ned with all my heart now for the finishing stroke i will home and watch the old fellow out and then l affair il sera fait as the french say  which way are you going fainwell   fain every way i have some twenty howdyes to deliver the constant business of men of my cloth you know   ned ha yonder comes

embracing her   wid a fiddle of affection mr worthy i tell you i have been laced very tight once in my life but having made my fortune and got my liberty if ever i try again the matrimonial bodice the lace shall be taggd with a title i assure you   fain ah that will make a noise in the world but your pleasure like a squib will vanish in the bounce ha ha ha  to give twenty thousand pounds for the bare name of my lords lady whilst ten to one but your chambermaid supplies your ladyships place in his arms and rattles about streets in her berlin supported out of your ladyships fortune   wid you seem well acquainted with the map of this world   fain perfectly madam and have made this observation that women who love to indulge their vanity and yet hope for their dividend of pleasures are acting as inconsistent a part as they who give a loose to their fancy and at the same time think to preserve their reputation  i tell you madam a man of quality will no more throw all his love upon a wife than a farmer will sow all his land with the same grain the only way to engross your joys is to marry one of us countrygentlemen   wid to be rivaled by marchbeer tobacco and foxhounds   fain even those are preferable to cards dice and a wench as you would have experienced had not i come in   wid so now will he value himself upon my deliverance aside  well well mr worthy since this fellow proves a mere plebeian he is a worthless rascal but if he had really been a lord what is now impudence would only have been the violence of his love   fain humph a very pretty distinction  no madam i deny that position  love is soft and gentle as the morningsun in autumn mellowing inclination by degrees but its twinbrother like a footpad knocks you down and rifles you at once  he was impatient for your money only widow  i for this dear person  now why cannot you like me as well as a lord   wid like you for what   fain for what why for an unalterable faithful constant doting    wid hold hold sir your epithets are running away with your meaning  but to prevent your explaining it i must tell you that the very name of matrimony with a commoner will flatten our conversation and make us look very simple   fain ay but there is something so expressive in that simplicity that it gives a deeper impression than all the gildings of rhetoric ah my dear widow would you but return my love how many cupids should i behold dancing in these eyes nay and you should see strange things before morning    wid sha you talk foolishly   fain that is inherent to a lover   wid and so you would have me a fool too to keep you in countenance a very wise foundation for the fabric of matrimony  no no i tell you once for all though i do like your person you and i must never be conjured into the circle of a weddingring   fain and no other circle will do my business  i will try if she has really a liking for my person   aside wid well what have i put you in the dumps now are you considering what death will revenge you of an ungrateful mistress ha ha   fain no faith madam i will live to be revenged and balk your vanity   then farewell love farewell love and all soft pleasure honor calls and we must part  sings in a careless manner wid you are the merriest lover at parting   fain i am of bens mind madam resolve to be merry though the ship were sinking and since i must never hope to call you mine i here dismiss all the retinue of a formal lover such as vows ogles sighs dreams visions sonnets gingles epigrams couplets with a long etc  thus with infinite struggles i hope to entertain as mean an opinion of matrimony as your ladyship in a very little time   wid oh that he had a title to support this humor he should find i have no mean opinion of matrimony aside   fain and for the future shall look upon the parsons patchwork like a pilgrimage to mecca or jerusalem fit only for the superstitious and people who have periodical inclinations to fill up the vacancies of human life with a huge caravan of children a long journey dirty road through the turnpikes of jealousy anxiety suspicion animosity pinching cares and a thousand other inconveniences  by the way you have traveled the stage and i suppose know what i say to be true   wid ha  all is not right within this breast i begin to perceive his indifference gives me pain   aside fain i fancy the only object to give one a surfeit of matrimony would be to see a pair of distempered creatures in the corner of a room in close conspiracy to deceive one another very sincerely promising mutual love for fifty years ensuing when upon trial a months fruition makes either a caterwauling correspondence or a more peaceable and elegant way of separate beds  she seems nettled i will proceed aside  with this thought i comfort myself and here madam bid matrimony and you eternally farewell  who would be led for life   sings and hums that tune wid eternally  i wish i had never seen this fellow  lord how my heart sinks aside   fain come

dutch law our roving gentry bind how charming would it be for womankind then every nymph that has vouchsafed the favor might tie her lover up to good behavior and after she has put him to the test might take or leave him  as she liked it best you who are noosd let me advise beware give over your jealous freaks and trust the fair for lookye you may rant and play the devil there is naught but
