a pindarique ode humbly offered to the queen on the victorious progress of her majestys arms under the conduct of the duke of marlborough  to which is prefixed a discourse on the pindarique ode  by mr congreve   operosa parvus carmina fingo hor ode   l   tuque dum procedis io triumph non semel dicemus io triumph civitas omnis dabimusque divis thura benignis ibid london printed for jacob tonson within grays inn gate next grays inn lane   0   a discourse on the pindarique ode the following ode is an attempt toward restoring the regularity of the ancient lyrick poetry which seems to be altogether forgotten or unknown by our english writers  there is nothing more frequent among us than a sort of poems entitled pindarique odes pretending to be written in imitation of the manner and style of pindar and yet i do not know that there is to this day extant in our language one ode contrived after his model what idea can an english reader have of pindar to whose mouth when a child the bees pausan boeotic brought their honey in omen of the future sweetness and melody of his songs when he shall see such rumbling and grating papers of verses pretending to be copies of his works  the character of these late pindariques is a bundle of rambling incoherent thoughts expressed in a like parcel of irregular stanzas which also consist of such another complication of disproportioned uncertain and perplexed verses and rhimes and i appeal to any reader if this is not the condition in which these titular odes appear  on the contrary there is nothing more regular than the odes of pindar both as to the exact observation of the measures and numbers of his stanzas and verses and the perpetual coherence of his thoughts for though his digressions are frequent and his transitions sudden yet is there ever some secret connection which though not always appearing to the eye never fails to communicate it self to the understanding of the reader  the liberty which he took in his numbers and which has been so misunderstood and misapplied by his pretended imitators was only in varying the stanzas in different odes but in each particular ode they are ever correspondent one to another in their turns and according to the order of the ode  all the odes of pindar are songs of triumph victory or success in the grecian games they were sung by a chorus and adapted to the lyre and sometimes to the lyre and pind olym  0 pipe they consisted oftnest of three stanzas the first was called the strophe from the version or circular motion of the singers in that stanza from the right hand to the left or from the left to the right for the scholiasts differ in that as may be seen in pind schol introduc ad olymp and alex ab alexandro l   c    speaking of the ceremony of the chorus says cursum auspicati a laeva dextrorsum  ox a dextra laevorsum but the learned schmidius takes part with the first opinion as more consistent with the notions of the ancients concerning the motions of the heavenly spheres and agreeable to homer there cited by him see eras schmid prolegom in olymp and de carmin lyric the second stanza was called the antistrophe from the contraversion of the chorus the singers in performing that turning from the left hand to the right contrary always to their motion in the strophe the third stanza was called the epode it may be as being the aftersong which they sung in the middle neither turning to one hand nor the other  what the origin was of these different motions and stations in singing their odes is not our present business to enquire some have thought that by the contrariety of the strophe and antistrophe they intended to represent the contrarotation of the primum mobile in respect of the secunda mobilia and that by their standing still at the epode they meant to signify the stability of the earth pind schol and schmid ibid others ascribe the institution to theseus who thereby expressed the windings and turnings of the labyrinth in celebrating his return from thence  the method observed in the composition of these odes was therefore as follows the poet having made choice of a certain number of verses to constitute his strophe or first stanza was obliged to observe the same in his antistrophe or second stanza and which accordingly perpetually agreed whenever repeated both in number of verses and quantity of feet he was then again at liberty to make a new choice for his third stanza or epode where accordingly he diversified his numbers as his ear or fancy led him composing that stanza of more or fewer verses than the former and those verses of different measures and quantities for the greater variety of harmony and entertainment of the ear  but then this epode being thus formed he was strictly obliged to the same vid jul scal poetic ad fin cap    l   measure as often as he should repeat it in the order of his ode so that every epode in the same ode is eternally the same in measure and quantity in respect to it self as is also every strophe and antistrophe in respect to each other  the lyrick poet stesichorus whom longin de sub c    longinus reckons amongst the ablest imitators of homer and of whom quint inst l  0 c   quintilian says that if he could have kept within bounds he would have been nearest of any body in merit to homer was if not the inventer of this order in the ode yet so strict an observer of it in his compositions that the three stanzas of stesichorus became a common proverb to express a thing universally known  de vehementer indocto and imperito dici solitum erasm adag ne tria quidem stesichori nosti so that when any one had a mind to reproach another with excessive ignorance he could not do it more effectually than by telling him he did not so much as know the three stanzas of stesichorus that is did not know that an ode ought to consist of a strophe an antistrophe and an epode if this was such a mark of ignorance among them i am sure we have been pretty long liable to the same reproof i mean in respect of our imitations of the odes of pindar  my intention is not to make a long preface to a short ode nor to enter upon a dissertation of lyrick poetry in general but thus much i thought proper to say for the information of those readers whose course of study has not led em into such enquiries  i hope i shall not be so misunderstood as to have it thought that i pretend to give an exact copy of pindar in this ensuing ode or that i look upon it as a pattern for his imitators for the future far from such thoughts i have only given an instance of what is practicable and am sensible that i am as distant from the force and elevation of pindar as others have hitherto been from the harmony and regularity of his numbers  again we having no chorus to sing our odes the titles as well as use of strophe antistrophe and epode are obsolete and impertinent and certainly there may be very good english odes without the distinction of greek appellations to their stanzas that i have mentioned em here and observed the order of em in the ensuing ode is therefore only the more intelligibly to explain the extraordinary regularity of the composition of those odes which have been represented to us hitherto as the most confused structures in nature  however though there be no necessity that our triumphal odes should consist of the three aforementioned stanzas yet if the reader can observe that the great variation of the numbers in the third stanza call it epode or what you please has a pleasing effect in the ode and makes him return to the first and second stanzas with more appetite than he could do if always cloyed with the same quantities and measures i cannot see why some use may not be made of pindars example to the great improvement of the english ode there is certainly a pleasure in beholding any thing that has art and difficulty in the contrivance especially if it appears so carefully executed that the difficulty does not show it self till it is sought for and that the seeming easiness of the work first sets us upon the enquiry nothing can be called beautiful without proportion when symmetry and harmony are wanting neither the eye nor the ear can be pleased therefore certainly poetry which includes painting and music should not be destitute of em and of all poetry especially the ode whose end and essence is harmony  mr cowley in his preface to his pindarique odes speaking of the music of numbers says which sometimes especially in songs and odes almost without any thing else makes an excellent poet  having mentioned mr cowley it may very well be expected that something should be said of him at a time when the imitation of pindar is the theme of our discourse but there is that great deference due to the memory great parts and learning of that gentleman that i think nothing should be objected to the latitude he has taken in his pindarique odes the beauty of his verses are an atonement for the irregularity of his stanzas and though he did not imitate pindar in the strictness of his numbers he has very often happily copied him in the force of his figures and sublimity of his style and sentiments  yet i must beg leave to add that i believe those irregular odes of mr cowley may have been the principal though innocent occasion of so many deformed poems since which instead of being true pictures of pindar have to use the italian painters term been only caricaturas of him resemblances that for the most part have been either horrid or ridiculous  for my own part i frankly own my error in having heretofore miscalld a few irregular stanzas a pindarique ode and possibly if others who have been under the same mistake would ingenuously confess the truth they might own that never having consulted pindar himself they took all his irregularity upon trust and finding their account in the great ease with which they could produce odes without being obliged either to measure or design remained satisfied and it may be were not altogether unwilling to neglect being undeceived  though there be little if any thing left of orpheus but his name yet if boeotic page     pausanias was well informed we may be assured that brevity was a beauty which he most industriously labored to preserve in his hymns notwithstanding as the same author reports that they were but few in number  the shortness of the following ode will i hope atone for the length of the preface and in some measure for the defects which may be found in it it consists of the same number of stanzas with that beautiful ode of pindar which is the first of his pythicks and though i was unable to imitate him in any other beauty i resolved to endeavor to copy his brevity and take the advantage of a remark he has made in the last strophe of the same ode which take in the paraphrase of sudorius  qui multa paucis stringere commode novere morsus hi facile invidos spernunt and auris mensque pura omne supervacuum rejectat ode i daughter of memory immortal muse calliope what poet will thou choose of annas name to sing to whom will thou thy fire impart thy lyre thy voice and tuneful art whom raise sublime on thy aetherial wing and consecrate with dews of thy castalian spring ii without thy aid the most aspiring mind must flag beneath to narrow flights confined striving to rise in vain nor ever can hope with equal lays to celebrate bright virtues praise thy aid obtained even i the humblest swain may climb pierian heights and quit the lowly plain iii high in the starry orb is hung and next alcides guardian arm that orpheus was said to be the son of the muse calliope the poetical fiction of the harp of orpheus is this mercury the same day that he was born of maja in cyllene a mountain of arcadia found a living tortoise which he carried home with him to his cradle and immediately composed a harp of the shell a little after he stole the oxen of apollo this caused some difference between the deities but the matter being referred to jupiter he ordered mercury to return the oxen to the right owner on this there followed not only a reconciliation but friendship and apollo expressing an extreme pleasure at the invention of the harp mercury bestowed it on him as a pledge of his future friendship of this homer in his hymn to mercury speaks at large afterward apollo inventing another instrument called the cithera gave the lyra to orpheus the muses after the death of orpheus translated his harp into heaven where it became a constellation and is placed between the knee and left arm of engonasis or hercules harp to which thy orpheus sung who woods and rocks and winds could charm that harp which on cyllenes shady hill when first the vocal shell was found with more than mortal skill inventer hermes taught to sound hermes on bright latonas son by sweet persuasion won the wondrous work bestowed latonas son to thine indulgent gave the gift divine a god the gift a god the invention showed i to that highsounding lyre i tune my strains a lower note his lofty song disdains who sings of annas name the lyre is struck the sounds i hear o muse propitious to my prayer o well known sounds o melody the same that kindled mantuan fire and raised maeonian flame ii nor are these sounds to british bards unknown or sparingly revealed to one alone witness sweet spencers lays and witness that immortal song as spencer sweet as milton strong which humble boyn over tibers flood could raise and mighty william sing with wellproportiond praise iii rise fair augusta lift thy head with golden towers thy front adorn come forth as comes from tithons bed with cheerful ray the ruddy morn thy lovely form and fresh reviving state in crystal flood of thames survey then bless thy better fate bless annas most auspicious sway while distant realms and neighboring lands armed troops and hostile bands on every side molest thy happier clime is free fair capital of liberty and plenty knows and days of halcyon rest i as britains isle when old vexed ocean roars unshaken sees against her silver shoars his foaming billows beat so britains queen amidst the jars and tumults of a world in wars fixed on the base of her wellfounded state serene and safe looks down nor feels the shocks of fate ii but greatest souls though blessed with sweet repose are soonest touched with sense of others woes thus annas mighty mind to mercy and soft pity prone and moved with sorrows not her own has all her peace and downy rest resigned to wake for common good and succor humankind iii fly tyranny no more be known within europas blissful bound far as the unhabitable zone fly every hospitable ground to horrid nova zembla a miserable region in the frigid zone where there is neither tree nor herb but

right for now is come the promised hour when justice shall have power justice to earth restored again astrea reigns anna her equal scale maintains and marlbro wields her sure deciding sword i now could thou soar my muse to sing the man in heights sublime as when the mantuan swan her towering pinions spread thou should of marlbro sing whose hand unerring from his queens command far as the lucan in his third book v  0  gives it the indefinite epithete of multifidi istri but ovid trist   solus ad ingressus missus septemplicis istri and sidonius apollinaris gives it the same epithete on the like occasion with this ode when in his panegyric to majorianus caesar he tells him illicet aggrederis quod nullus tempore nostro augustus potuit rigidum septemplicis istri agmen in arma rapis  the ancient geographers differed very much in their account of the rise of this river so that on a double account the same epithets may be appropriated to it as are usual to the nile sevenmouthd isters

bavaria fled the field and veteran gauls unused to yield on blenheims plain imploring mercy lay and spoils and trophies won perplexed the victors way iii but could thy voice of blenheim sing and with success that song pursue what art could aid thy weary wing to keep the victor still in view for as the sun never stops his radiant flight nor sets but with impartial ray to all who want his light alternately transfers the day so in the glorious round of fame great marlbro still the same incessant runs his course to climes remote and near his conquering arms by turns appear and universal is his aid and force i attempt not to proceed unwary muse for o what notes what numbers could thou choose though in all numbers skilled to sing the heros matchless deed which belgia need not only be strictly understood of the seven provinces called belgium foederatum by the distinction made in the time of phil   but may also be interpreted with respect to that which was anciently called belgium comprehending the lower germany in regard of the great consequences attending such a victory belgia saved and brabant freed to sing ramillias day to which must yield cannae as inconsiderable a village as blenheim till in like manner made memorable and illustrious by the great and entire victory which hannibal obtained there over the romans cannaes illustrious fight and famed pharsalia famous for the overthrow of pompey by julius caesar a wonderful victory but may justly be said to yield to that of ramillies for the design and end of the first was to enslave mankind the manifest aim and event of the latter has been to set em at liberty pharsalias field ii in the short course of a diurnal sun behold the work of many ages done what verse such worth can raise luster and life the poets art to middle virtue may impart but deeds sublime exalted high like these transcend his utmost flight and mock his distant praise iii still would the willing muse aspire with transport still her strains prolong but fear unstrings the trembling lyre and admiration stops her song go on great chief in annas cause proceed nor sheath the terrors of thy sword till europe thou have freed and universal peace restored this mighty work when thou shall end equal rewards attend of value far above thy trophies and thy spoils rewards even worthy of thy toils thy queens just favor and thy countrys love finis
