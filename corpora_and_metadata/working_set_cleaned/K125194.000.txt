an answer to a paper concerning mr de foe against his history of the union sir i herewith send you a paper full of scurrilous reflections upon mr de foe and upon his work called the history of the union pretended to be done in defense of mr clark who it seems is thought to be injured in the account there given of the tumult at glasgow  i am very sorry to find a stranger so treated among us in scotland who i think has on many occasions in his writings very well deserved of this nation but i am still more concerned that this malignity of the pen should proceed to such a scurrilous piece especially in pretending to defend a gospel minister who if he retains any of the temper of his master will think himself very little obliged to the person that has wrote it to defend him in so rude and indiscreet a manner as it must be owned becomes no modest man to do  this occasions me to hope notwithstanding the general opinion of the people here that mr clark himself has no hand in it for first as the truth of it will want very strong confirmation and is impossible to be made out so the language of it would be more reflection upon a gospel minister than any thing mr de foe can have wrote concerning him  the scripture rule laid down by the apostle for a minister is so manifest in this case and so expressly forbids to return railing for railing and reviling for reviling that mr clark if he sees this paper or any body is so kind to him as to show it him can not but clear himself from being concerned in it in honor to his own reputation but this is worse still for to revile without being reviled is a part which no honest man will render much less a minister of the gospel reverend for learning grave in years and sober in education such as mr clark  but i wave all this persuading my self mr clark can have no hand in such a wretched piece of railing and falsehood and hasten to speak in short to the matter of fact which is all that requires an answer in this paper the other being too gross to deserve any notice  as to mr de foes work in a history of the transactions of the union many people here of the best capacity to judge have been witnesses to the preparations he has made for it and can testify for him in his absence   that he has been very careful has taken a great deal of pains and been at a great expense to perform the promise made in the introduction and which this person quotes viz to write with impartiality and truth    that he being gone away for england left the sheets behind him to the inspection of persons in our own country of unbyasst principles and unspotted reputation to whose revising and correction he submitted every thing he had wrote and therefore it can not be suggested that he has designedly made any errors to make up history or printed any thing that merits this authors hard words  but on the contrary while mr de foe has undertaken the writing an impartial history of fact he could not be so weak as to think that those people who perhaps acted a part in that affair which they may have reason since not to be pleased with in themselves should be pleased with his relating it however impartially and therefore i doubt not he expected all the ill usage he finds from persons whose actions will not bear a clear representation  as to the errors i am sorry the author that pretends to be mr clarks defender can find out so few real ones that he is fain to speak what is so far from being to be justified that i dare say mr clark will not own it himself  mr clark as a minister of the gospel can not be guilty of so much prevarication as to say himself that he did not speak the words mr de foe has quoted and i make no scruple to assure the world that he did speak the very words at least without variation of the sense and there are so many living witnesses now in the city of glasgow and some of them here in this city at this time who heard the words spoken that it is something which few people can understand must move this author to deny that for him which so many people know is matter of fact and is so easy to be proved  wherefore the gentleman who wrote this scurrilous paper is desired to reflect a little and go and ask mr clark about it i dare say that reverend person is a man of too much conscience and honesty not to acknowledge the words and if his memory should fail him so much as not to remember the words he will no doubt refer to his notes and find it there just as is related or with very little difference viz addresses will not do and prayers will not do there must be other methods it is true prayer is a duty but we must not rest there etc wherefore up and be valiant for the city of our god and that the reader may not depend upon the single testimony of this paper i may refer him to some of the chief inhabitants of glasgow many of whom were then in the church and will i make no question be such friends to truth and to the stranger that is abused as to make it out  further if the author of this paper now meant can engage mr clark to bring this matter before the assembly which is now sitting as a charge of slander by mr de foe i do promise in his absence to bring unquestioned witnesses before the said assembly to prove the said words upon him and till he does so mr de foe can not be charged with slandering him  it is plain also the paper it self acknowledges the fact tho he couches it as if he were ashamed of it saying that mr clark cited   chronicles         samuel  0    but does not think fit to put down the words of the said texts which are as follows arise therefore and be doing and the lord be with thee  and  be of good courage and let us play the men for our people and for the cities of our god and the lord do that which seems him good indeed he was right crafty to hide these words  for had mr clark said no more than this it had answered all mr de foe alleages which he also expresses with as much tenderness to mr clark as could be viz that this was constructed by the rabble to excite them to tumults  and who could say less or what could that people think who were before irritated about their addresses being refused but that when he said arise and be doing be of good courage and play the men and at last up and be valiant but that he meant they should take arms etc  now in order to do mr de foe some justice in this i must necessarily observe how odd it is for this author to publish this scurrilous pamphlet   on a man that he knows to be absent and not able to reply to him   against a book that is not yet published that so the people being ignorant of the manner of expressing it may believe all he says  and by what clandestine way he has come to the sight of the imperfect sheets i dare say he will be ashamed to own  however as i think mr de foe as a historian could not have been faithful to the matter of fact no nor to the magistrates and good people of glasgow who were then misrepresented to the whole island nay to their sovereign too and lay under the scandal of a factious mutinous people without relating the steps by which that tumult grew up as the honestest way to vindicate them  so i think he has been so far from reproaching or abusing mr clark that he took all the precautions possible to prevent his readers supposing mr clark did it in design  as to what connection of circumstances there might be to render his design suspected to others mr de foe uses him most discreetly and if in one line he calls him a weak good man which is the utmost they can pretend i forbear for his own sake to enter into an enquiry here whether it were a weakness in him at that time to use such expressions or no referring it to them who know what influence his words however well and innocently designed had upon the people and how within one hour after they were spoken the whole city was in an uproar and confusion i am sure it is a weakness in any of his friends to bring him thus on the stage again at such a time as this especially let them consider of that as they like  but that you may not take my word for mr de foes discreet usage of him i shall quote the words in his history as he has printed this case and let any man judge if he has used the reverend minister ill or no his words are thus p  0 and which if fairly quoted his paper would have answered it self  on thursday the  day of  the fast appointed by the commission of the assembly was kept in glasgow mr ck minister of the trone kirk preached from the words in ezra      and i proclaimed a fast at the river of ahava that we might afflict our selves before our god to seek of him a right way for us and for our little ones and for all our substance  i shall convince the gentleman concerned that this account is not made for a satyr upon him it is too serious a subject and when both he and those who heard him reflects on how much more his unhappy temper at that time forced from him than i set down here all which i have by me verbatim as he spoke it he will i say be convinced that i talk no more than in the obligation of a historian to truth of fact i am bound to do  i am not at all apprehensive of having the truth of these words questioned having received them from the mouths of more than two or three of the principal inhabitants of glasgow who heard them spoken and if the misplacing a word should be snatched at i venture to say that this was the full purport of the expression without the least variation as to the weak good man that spoke them i will not suggest that he foresaw the consequence of them or had any such thing in his design tho it calls for some charity to guess his meaning the kindest thing i can say of them is that he did not mean at all what followed but spoke in his haste for god forbid i should suggest he meand to raise a rebellion and to bring his country into all that blood and confusion which if gods goodness had not prevented it had certainly followed  the sermon ended about eleven a clock and the people were so enflamed before that by one of the clock the mob were gotten together their drum was beat in the back streets and all the confusions we are now to speak of followed    thus far the history speaks and here any man may see how discreetly mr de foe has used mr clark how he has declared over and over that he does no way charge his design  and that is more than all the people of glasgow will do though they have as much respect for their ministers as other people nay he endeavors to clear him so much as of foreseeing the consequence and in that gives him the style of weak good man if this author will not have him to be a good man that is none of mr de foe s fault and if he will not own his weakness in ill timeing that discourse mr clark is very little obliged to him for it certainly must be owned as a weakness or justified as a design and let him take it which way he pleases  there is a seeming error indeed in printing the word of for after but mr de foe is cleared of this effectually for that he left a blank for the day of the month to be filled up at the press which they have still left open and his original copy being here in town to refer to  makes it out the errata also at the revising of the sheets supply it all which this accuser it seems has not seen but speaks without book  for the words being read either way are right even by his own charge  thus  first for on thursday the day of the fast read on thursday the day after the fast   mr de foe knew as well as the scurrilous author the fast was on a tuesday and therefore printed the thursday which was the day of the sermon and cannot fairly be supposed to mean the fast day and so secondly the blank being filled up it will be right another way thus  on thursday the   of november the day after the fast who would believe such a shift as this should be made use of as a refuge to protect the rest of the allegations it is the matter of fact not the day of the month that is material and that is but foully wiped off indeed  as to persons dealing with the provost of glasgow before this sermon about addressing which he calls a fourth error the provost is a man of too much candor to assist their suggestions and it is referred to him to determine whether it be truth or no let them enquire at the peril of their credit  the third charge is a full test of the honesty of this author and may direct any honest man to make a judgment of him  p   par   he says  his de foes third error is p  0 that about one of the clock after sermon on the fast day the mob got together and beat up the drums  this cannot be mr clark he has more honesty he would not have spoken so without book he dared not to impose such abominable falsity on the world at least i hope so  for in mr de foes book the sheet lying now before me and as quoted above it is nothing so the words are thus  sermon being ended about eleven of the clock  by one of the clock the mob were gotten together their drum was beat etc  and this is true  let any man judge of the rest of this sheet by this specimen  and therefore i think this may serve for a full answer to his mighty book of errors for such indeed it may be justly esteemed  all the rest of his paper is filled with fire and brimstone abusing the magistrates of glasgow and railing at mr de foe who if he was here perhaps might speak for himself but this i must say for him that whereas he pretends to charge him with reproaching a minister of the gospel  if the author of that paper had read out that part of the history of the union which treats of the management of the ministers of scotland he will find mr de foe has done the ministers in general so much justice and their characters so much honor in that book as well as on all occasions in his other writings as will sufficiently evidence him to be both a reverencer of their office a lover of their persons and a friend to their interest  as to his reflections on the history it self in general which he strives to disparage though he has not seen it he is referred to solomon who mr clark can tell him ranks them among his fools who judge of a matter before they hear it  his motion to have the government suppress it shows his good will to mr de foe on one hand and which if he were here no question he would laugh at sufficiently but on the other is a satyr on his friend mr clark as if he were ashamed his actions on that occasion should come to the view of the world  and indeed mr clark i think will have little reason to thank him for what he has done in this case for that i shall take effectual care in the vindication of truth to have a more particular account of that whole case put into this history this mr de foe at first designed wherein the accuser may have further occasion of vindicating some body who is generally thought to have had but bad luck formerly at vindicating himself  as to the rude and indiscreet language given him in the paper as it justly offends the ears of the hearers and fouls the mouth of the reader so i shall observe the method mr de foe himself takes in all such cases i e take no notice of it it is not worth while it hurts the author not mr de foe in the least only this i must say as my own observation in all matters of debate  wise men argue and fools rail edinburgh printed by the heirs and successors of andrew anderson
