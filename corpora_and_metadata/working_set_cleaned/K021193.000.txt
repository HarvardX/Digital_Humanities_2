observations on a particular kind of scarlet fever that lately prevailed in and about st albans in a letter to dr mead  by nathanael cotton md  london printed for r manby and hs cox on ludgate hill mdccxlix  observations etc sir st albans feb          i take the liberty to send you a few observations on a particular kind of scarlet fever that has lately obtained in this place and some towns adjacent the only circumstances which can entitle this sheet to the trouble of your perusal are the novelty of the subject and a careful representation of facts nor shall i obtrude upon you any vague conjectures or precarious hypotheses relating to the causes of this disease much less take up your valuable moments in the pursuit of useless unmeaning quotations from other authors  about the latter end of sept      a scarlet fever began to appear in this town at first children only were seized with it but afterward it attacked adults the manner of seizure was not always one and the same there was some diversity herein as likewise in the symptoms and stages of the disease its period also was sometimes various in various patients and as there was a difference in the time so likewise there was in the manner of its terminating  in general the first symptoms were sickness vomiting and purging but these symptoms seemed pretty much confined to children a sore throat either attended these discharges of the intestinal tube or immediately followed the tonsils parotids and maxillary glands hastily swelled to a considerable degree in some the tonsils only were inflamed and swelled in some a swelling of the parotids accompanied the inflammatory tumors of the tonsils in some all the glands abovementioned tumefied at the same time upon looking into the mouth there were frequently seen especially after the disease was a little advanced ulcuscula scattered up and down the fauces which were pretty broad upon and about the tonsils superficial at least all that i saw were superficial and covered with a whitish slough the eyes appeared watery and the countenance particularly the eyelids were puffed up as in the measles in many the neck arms and hands were puffed up and swelled likewise and it is not improbable that the trunk of the body was also swelled if we could as easily have discerned such a general enlargement as we could the enlargement of a particular member in some a cough also accompanied the preceding symptoms but there was a great difference as to the cough for in some it was slight and rather abated as the disease advanced while in others it increased and grew severer each day than the preceding  the scarlet efflorescence differed as to degree and time of its appearance in some it appeared immediately on the attack of the disease and that not always gradually as many eruptive disorders do but in some it was sudden universal and of an intense red as intensely red sometimes upon its first appearance as when the disease was further advanced in some there intervened one or more days between the first sickening and the scarlet efflorescence and in some this efflorescence was partial and gradual in its advances the legs and thighs were spotted up and down with spots of various dimensions some as large or larger than a sixpence while the trunk of the body was covered with such an infinite number of them and so closely set together that no interstices appearing the body was in some persons as red almost as if it had been dipped in blood in others again the scarlet efflorescence was trifling as to the degree of color and so very slightly was the skin tinged that the disease was known more from the collateral symptoms than from the efflorescence yet the sameness of some symptoms happening in a family to one or two where the rest had the disease complete abundantly satisfied me as to the genius of the distemper  from this diversity of symptoms i have found some practitioners inclined to think that this disease could not with propriety be called a scarlet fever but i imagine that such disputes are about words only for although there is a considerable difference between the present scarlet fever and that milder one which sydenham describes yet if an increased number of symptoms and a more exasperated degree thereof would authorize a physician to alter the name of the difease i fear that confusion would be the consequence of such a liberty for the same reasons the small pox might suffer a change in its name because there is not so great or a greater difference between a former and the present scarlet fever than there is between small pox and small pox more especially if the comparison be made between the mildest degree of the distinct and the most violent degree of the confluent sort but if a man consults morton as well as sydenham he will find that the febris scarlatina of the former differs greatly from the febris scarlatina of the latter as to the appearance degree and period of the disease for however mildly sydenham represents this distemper morton scruples not emphatically to term it a plague and his reasons are the severity of some of the symptoms in his eleventh case toward the close speaking of a patient he has these words a peste inquam evasit and afterward he goes on thus quantum tonsillas uvulam fauces nares et quamdiu intumuisse vidi quam turgida nonnunquam labia et quam sordida scabie obducta et exulcerata ab eadem causa animadverti  i might observe that this scarlet eshorescence not only differed as to degree in different persons but in one and the same person there was often this diversity the efflorescence on the face neck and breast was even with the superficies of the skin  rysipelaslike at least so far as the eye could discover while in other parts the eruptions were more prominent and carried the exact appearance of a rash with this difference only that they were very red and the cuticle felt with all the asperity of fishskin that spectacle cases and the like are frequently made of  i now proceed to the fever which in most was high that is to say intense thirst and the sensation of a burning heat upon the skin were the prevailing complaints of the greater part of those who labored under the disease but even with all this extraordinary heat and increased celerity of the bloods motion the tongue was commonly moist furred but slightly and here and there a person not very thirsty some underwent extreme anxiety and inquietude some were delirious for four or more days together without one lucid interval or slumber incessantly talking incoherently others were comatous and when awaked to drink immediately relapsed to sleep again only a few complained of headachs and even some of those who were afterward most delirious did not complain of previous pain in the head several were sleepless whole days and nights successively without any delirium almost all complained of great dejection of spirits and sudden loss of strength which leads me to speak of the pulse  the pulse in general was very quick and very small which circumstance in conjunction with lowness of spirits and impaired strength contributed a good deal to embarrass the method of cure for however the inflammatory disposition of the blood might seemingly call for bleeding the untoward symptoms abovementioned seemed either to forbid this discharge or to permit it in such small quantities that little service could reasonably be expected from it and in fact i found that bleeding though recourse was had to it at the beginning was very little beneficial toward the cure of the fever though often serviceable to the inflamed throat but of bleeding more hereafter let me here add that there were a few whose pulse was quick and not weak and in this case i ordered plentiful bleeding and even repeated it if the difficulty of deglutition was considerable i remember two patients particularly the one about eleven years of age the other about eighteen each of whom i blooded the second and third day of the disease the first bleeding was followed with little or no benefit to either of them the next day finding their tonsils still greatly swelled and inflamed and apprehending danger of suffocating in a few hours i directed a further quantity of blood to be taken away which presently abated these complaints their blood was sizey each time of bleeding but though in these and a few more persons the blood was sizey yet in others it was not so notwithstanding they were bled after the disease was pretty far advanced for it is well known that even in the small pox and many other inflammatory diseases the blood when taken away at the beginning is frequently not sizey though found to be so upon bleeding some days afterward nor can i recollect that any ill effect followed upon bleeding where i directed it though there frequently occurred cases where the smallness of the pulse and lowness of the spirits deterred me from it but then these circumstances were so obvious and glaring that they could not escape an inattentive practitioner  the urine was seldom high colored not even the urine of adults it was generally the complexion of water saturated with a paler clay and when the fever abated the urine as usually separated and deposited a thick claycoloured sediment in some indeed who were remarkably delirious the urine was limpid and pale as is common under such circumstances but as the patient mended the urine had a better color and consistence and threw down a plentiful sediment  there was some diversity in the terminating of this disease both as to the time and manner when it was not very violent it terminated in some measure on the fourth or fifth day that is the disease at that period had arrived to its height and was on the decline in few or none did the fever leave the patient so totally but it recurred once twice or more the evenings following and grew so mild at each return as to be little more than barely noticed at which time too all the glandulous swellings commonly vanished but in some although the fever evidently remitted of its severity on the fourth or fifth day its returns were of more hours duration and higher in degree and a large share of inquietude continued even to the eighth or ninth day in one person particularly the delirium continued after the fever was off the skin cool the efflorescence dying away and the pulse slow and regular in another when the fever was past its height the parotids began to swell for the first time and continued to enlarge for three days successively when suddenly they subsided in a nights time one half of their increased magnitude in two persons after the fever was quite removed and the appetite for food returned the tumor of the parotids still continued which daily increased in their bulk and gradually grew harder till a fortnight or three weeks afterward the right parotid of the one and the left parotid of the other suppurated largely  the distemper left a great many very low spirited complaining of an ill taste in their mouth with loss of strength and a slowly recovering appetite the cuticle of almost all peeled off as in other scarlet fevers and many complained for a long time that their bodies were as sore within as without such a sensibility indeed they suffered as rendered them quite unhappy  in some the nervous system was shattered to such a degree that the dejection of spirits which had accompanied the disease through all its stages still continued when the distemper was over and the patient dreaded the approach of the evening with an unusual kind of horror assuring me that the shadows which were consequent upon the lighting up of candles affected their minds with extravagant terrors and perturbations and i well remember that in a child near three years old this circumstance was so very remarkable that upon the candles entering the room and the shadows arising thereupon the boy appeared with a ghastly stare and cried with a vehemence not to be pacified on discovering the moving shades on the walls of the chamber  i now proceed to the cure the method whereof was different in different patients when the disease began with sickness and purging as it generally did i commonly ordered a salt of wormwood mixture with the testaceous powders in it upon which the vomiting and diarrhoea usually stopped and truly i hardly remember that they ever returned again then if the inflammation and swelling of the tonsils and parts adjacent required and the pulse permitted i directed bleeding and repeated it as the symptoms indicated if this method did not take speedy effect i ordered a vesicatory between the shoulders and for internals i commonly prescribed draughts of sperma ceti and nitre with plentiful dilution by means of barleygruel white wine whey and other liquors sometimes too i ordered linctuses gratefully acidulated with spirit of vitriol or in lieu of linctuses black current jelly in order to keep the parts soft and flexible and to remove or abate that aridity which is an attendant of inflamed parts especially such as are exposed to the air and the tonsils may be justly regarded in this view because the nostrils being generally stopped the patient was obliged to inspire through his mouth  and by this method alone the distemper when not violent went through its stages with success but if subsultus tendinum deliria and other threatening symptoms appeared i immediately applied blisters likewise to the arms and if symptoms were not obviated hereby but the pulse also began to sink i directed a vesicatory to the head and exchanged the nitre for warmer medicines such as the pulvis bezoardicus contrayervae comp and confectio cardiaca  if the ulcers on the tonsils and fauces were fouler than common detersive and astringent gargarisms were found to be of service by contributing much to bring away the sloughs and facilitate deglutition  if the fever ran high and the body was very costive i ordered an emollient clyster but the observations made on bleeding held true likewise here for the usual weakness of the patient and depression of spirits seemed to hint that these intestinal discharges were the less necessary and the scarlet efflorescence seemed likewise to forbid a too great laxity being brought upon the intestines  and now i shall conclude by throwing together a few general observations which could not conveniently be classed under the foregoing articles  opiates had no beneficial influences to remove watchfulness this perhaps is not to be wondered at during the febrile ebullition though sydenham recommends paregorics under the worst symptoms that he has mentioned of this disease but in three persons or more where the fever was in great part or altogether off i gave opiates aromatized to one that i might calm the delirium and to others that i might procure sleep after many nights watching but all to no purpose  i bled one patient whose pulse was tolerably strong to remove the delirium and loquacity that still continued after the fever was seemingly gone but no benefit arising in a few hours after bleeding i ordered blisters to the arms administered more cordial medicines than before and that night the patient slept several hours without waking and afterward mended apace  the blood had no size upon it the serum was a bright citron and bore a due proportion to the crassamentum as in health  in others under pretty much the same circumstances as the foregoing but where the pulse was not so strong indeed i omitted bleeding and prescribed vesicatories and generous medicines but no sleep ensued hereupon  i was called to a child of four years old the second day of the disease he appeared quite bereaved of sense almost suffocated and at the point of death immediately i ordered him to be blooded to six ounces speedily after which he revived and came to himself the child was naturally subject to enlarged tonsils but this symptom of strangling hastily came on i think within the space of half an hour or thereabouts on the fourth day at two in the afternoon it returned again with greater severity if possible than before though several blisters that had been applied discharged most copiously the tonsils were swelled to that degree as threatened every minute to preclude all admission of air whereupon a surgeon was called in who attempted to relieve the child by making incisions on these glands and so far the operation answered the end that the boy who appeared before in danger every moment of being suffocated lived till about seven in the evening the operation was followed by a pretty deal of blood and a little purulent matter which was very offensive to the smell  there were two things remarkable in blistering the one was that oftentimes no good effect accrued hereby to the fever though the pulse by these means was generally raised and the difficulty of deglutition somewhat abated the spirits too were improved by these applications and indeed in a disease so seemingly threatening perhaps it would be imprudent to omit these applications for although the fever did not yield to them so as to shorten its stages yet it is probable that symptoms were hereby prevented from rising to a more dangerous height and in general it was true that few were delirious whose complaints of the throat obliged them to the early application of blisters however this observation did not always hold good for there were a few who had blisters timely applied and nevertheless a subsequent delirium not prevented  another remark worth noticing was the great length of time that the blisters continued to discharge in some for eight or ten days successively and in some much longer  in general few sweated plentifully till toward the conclusion of the cure i e till the fever was past its height the younger the patients the earlier and the more they sweated and so vice versa  the appearance of the efflorescence seemed to command but little regard as to the method of cure for i have seen some persons raving with the eruption fully out and intensely red and i have seen others equally delirious with the eruption sparing and pale so that latterly i did not much consult the appearance of the efflorence but i ordered bleeding etc as other circumstances indicated  it is a general law in eruptive disorders that the more liberally the eruption comes out the securer is the patient rendered thereby and yet so little did this rule hold true here that in two patients who died the efflorescence was universal and florid to the last and in one of them that anxietas circa praecordia which is usually most urgent in other eruptive fevers before the eruption breaks out was in this case as exquisite when the efflorescence had attained its highest color as before the efflorescence made its appearance  under the article of cure i should have observed that the universal soreness within which multitudes complained of was alleviated much by solutions of sperma ceti light oleaginous mixtures broths etc and when the cough continued bleeding and asses milk removed this complaint  but the most troublesome symptom which occurred after the fever was removed was that great dread upon the spirits mentioned before which occasioned the unhappy patient to fear the approach of the evening here no nervous medicines as they are called seemed to take any immediate effect but air and a restorative diet gradually restored the person to better spirits  from the whole that i have advanced upon this disease i think it appears that general rules of cure were precarious and uncertain and that particular rules were not ascertainable on account of the various appearances and symptoms of the disease and the various constitutions of various patients and this perhaps furnishes a hint why mankind are so often disappointed in the perusal of medicinal writers we are apt to expect too much from them indeed more than it is possible for the art to supply when authors write generally upon these subjects they seldom write very usefully and when they write particularly we grow weary of their prolixity and perhaps after the pains of turning over a variety of volumes we still find that the particular case we wanted is either not mentioned at all or too partially and superficially to serve our purposes  so that it is in medicine as in navigation rules may be laid down and charts exhibited but when a man has made himself master of all these he will often find himself among shelves and quicksands and must at last have recourse to his own natural sagacity to extricate himself out of these difficulties  when obscurities arise and emergencies press every practitioner knows how poor and insufficient all systematic authors are and how tedious and oftentimes unavailing the best observators the necessity therefore and superiority of a physicians own
