the conduct of some people about pleading guilty with some reasons why it was not thought proper to show mercy to some who desired it  london printed and sold by j baker at the blackboy in paternoster row      price sixpence  the conduct of some people about pleading guilty when the house of commons first exhibited impeachments against the seven lords taken at the defeat of the rebels at preston and sent the articles against them up to the house of lords the lords according to the usual course of proceedings in such cases appointed the impeached lords to attend and allowed them time to give in their answer  while this part was depending it was the common discourse of the town that giving them time was but a piece of needless formality a kind of banter upon their circumstances a thing of no signification that indeed it gained them a few days to live and to prepare for another world which was the only thing they ought to have in their view but that it was of no other effect for what can they plead said the people who spoke of those things with any judgment were not they taken in arms were they not in open rebelion and made prisoners in the action surrendered at discretion to our generals and brought immediately bither from the very place of battle can such men bring any plea what can they have to say  though this was the discourse without doors yet with the persons themselves there was other thoughts and particularly with their friends and the debates that happened upon this subject as well among themselves as among other people may be very useful for us to know something of as well to let us into the secret history of their conduct as to inform us who were in their interest and upon what foot their friends endeavored to save them  i believe no man will suppose that gentlemen of such quallity as these were without some friends who in their present extremity would interest themselves for them and who applied with the uttermost diligence to gain to them the favor of such other persons as might be supposed on any account whatever to be capable of serving them  it was easy to see who would befriend them of course  viz those engaged by party who were on their side by inclination these were not only to be depended upon for their votes in favor of the gentlemen in distress but to be moved to use their interest for the bringing others of a second party who were something indifferent over to the same sentiment there was a third party from whom nothing was expected and therefore to such little application was to be made but they were if possible to be outnumberd  the space the criminal gentlemen had between their commitment to the tower and the day of their impeachment was the time to be employed to form those interests and to come to an understanding about the strength of their friends and as there were no moments to be lost so neither was it ill employed they took care to solicit treat with and engage every man that by any possible methods they could come at to act in their interest in so critical a juncture and to do their best for them if possible to avert the stroke of justice at last and for this no body can blame them it was not many days before the impeachments that we were told with great assurance that the lords in the tower had made such an interest that they were under no apprehensions of dying at all and that it only remained to determine what method should be taken to make the mercy they were to receive appear rational in those that granted it and be satisfactory to the nation  and if it is true that they had upon those applications some private assurance given them that by the strength of their interest among the nobility the whole house of lords would be brought to address his majesty to show them mercy who can blame them for promising themselves their lives especially considering the native clemency of his majesty and the inclination all good kings have to spare the blood of their people  but in all these measures there has been so much intriegue such nicety of management such subtilty of application and such industry used on one hand and such court fineness such discovery of persons and principles on the other that it must be very diverting as well as improving to give some account of it to the world  the measures as i have said having been taken to form their interest and those measures having succeeded even beyond their expectation the first thing to be observed is how agreeable to all good men and especially to men of honor and quality it is to be applied to for showing mercy to men in distress in a court so gallant so soft so humane i had almost said so christian as that of this kingdom what wonder is it that an humble application by persons of honor under misfortunes found powerful advocates and made sensible impressions upon the minds of some great persons in the kingdom  clemency and charity are the glory the one of nobility the other of christianity and when these are the powerful arguments to be used when these are the keys how easy is it to unlock the breasts of such persons who are filled with principles of honor and christianity i had much rather give these for the reasons why the applications of the distressed lords gained them so easy and so general an access to the hearts of some whose posts and trusts perhaps might seem to have engaged them another way and of whom it might have been expected that their concern for the safety and peace of their royal master the honor of his government and the good of their country should have opened their eyes to the necessity of public justice at that time than have it to say of any that it rather opened their ears to the petitions of those who had put their hands to the horrid work of their countrys destruction and made them intercessors for those who had raised a civil war in its bowels striking at the person and family of our sovereign the foundation of the protestant interest and at the very root of the constitution  i am very loath also to entertain an opinion so gross in it self and so remote from charity which nevertheless some have started  viz that it was listening to a frailer part of their inclination which brought some gentlemen into this matter that all the clemency of their tempers and softness of their dispositions would not have prevailed over their sense of duty if there had not been more glittering motives whose power they had not selfdenying virtue enough to resist though if this was their temptation i must still acquit the aggressors i mean the lords in the tower for who in their circumstances would have spared their ammunition where knew the fort would be reduced by undermining without the hazard of storming  and as on the one hand i believe at least hope this is no more than a slander upon the gentlemen of whom it is spoken so i dare say the reasons some people have to suggest such a thing even to themselves are rather taken from what they have formerly heard of the influence money has had upon those persons in times past to lead them against principle than from any real intelligence they have now had of the fact  it may be true that the suspicion is increased by the knowledge the world has had of the contrary disposition of the persons spoken of in days of old  viz how in former times when the administration of public affairs has been in some of their hands they have been found as deaf to the importunities of the miserable as inexorable to supplicating virtue and distressed innocence as any asian mute commissioned to the exercise of the bowstring how they have been eminent for vindictive tempers and the operations of the spleen as any that have since acted their parts and therefore it has been said that it must be from some other principle than that of humanity and compassion that those persons however great should be prevailed with to plead for clemency and mercy to men under the worst of circumstances and sentenced for crimes which must necessarily not only taint their honor and families who are guilty but must cast some just reproach upon those who interest themselves to save them but as those are but suggestions i say no more of them  but to return to the fact as it stands historically in our view certain it is if fame lie not that the powerful applications for mercy for these men whether by the influence of the ladies tears the sense of the misfortunes of so many persons of quality or any meaner importunities i cannot say had found means to make impressions upon some nearer the throne than they themselves had i believe any hopes of and as this was an agreeable surpise to the unfortunate gentlemen so we shall see the less reason to wonder at their future conduct on that account and this is partly the reason why i have entered into this part at the beginning of this tract  nothing is more certain than that before this the lords seeing little room to expect any interest could be made for their escape had entertained serious thoughts of dying and were rather something disconcerted than otherwise determined as to what answer they should give to the impeachments which were brought against them  indeed as some of them expressed it i mean one already executed they hardly expected the house of commons would have given themselves the trouble of impeachments in a case which was so plain and required so little ceremony but rather have let the law take its ordinary course by indictment and plea and have left them to the house of peers who must necessarily have condemned them  it has been said also by some of their party that the same gentlemen had resolved to act what they call the hero  viz to have given the fact in evidence at their trial and justified the rebellion upon principles of jacobitism the foundations of which like blasphemous tenets in religious disputes are not fit to be mentioned that this had been to have acted the desperadoe and to have cast themselves entirely away beyond the reach of mercy and out of the power of intercessors nay even out of the rational power of the royal clemency itself is most certain how it could denominate them heroes would have been their business to show i must acknowledge i do not see any thing of that kind in it  however we found this notion was so revitted in the mind of one person if of no other of them that nothing could for some time divert his thoughts from it and we have diverse accounts of his conduct in that part how he talked of death a la cavalier how he made the scaffold appear to his fancy no more than a scene in a tragedy which had nothing in it but a formality to make his passing off from the world a little judicial how he thought that death there could have no worse a face than it had in the streets of preston where he had looked on its phyz with very little apprehension and was not at all afraid to see it again  as these were the views which for some time these gentlemen had so neither were they easy to be brought to entertain other notions indeed when the time was limited that they were obliged to give in some plea or other and that they began to look on the thing with a nearer and perhaps a more serious view they appeared not all alike determindd but all the consequence of this was that it only made them a little more encliind to listen to the advice of their council and friends and to act by such measures as reason and the nature of their circumstances called for  this ended in their pleading guilty to the impeachment and throwing themselves in the most moving and submisive manner possible upon the kings mercy imploring the intercession of their peers who were their judges and of the commons who were their accusers a thing which as is said one of those now gone said was much more difficult to do than to die  i have heard many wise and good men say that let the ends which the said gentlemen proposed to themselves in it be what they would that plea was the only step they could have taken entirely to give peace to their own minds and have good men believe they were restored to an honest and just principle the first because by it they had tried the only step left them to save their lives and which they could not possible be fully satisfied in omitting and the last because the contrary had been a justifying and defending the crime of rebellion which on no just principle could be defended and as i am well informed these arguments were pressed upon them with great earnestness by their friends so i have been told also that the first especially made a great impression upon them in the case i speak of  but there was a yet more powerful argument to induce them to this plea and this is said to be represented to them by the agents they had employed as before to obtain the intercession and favor of the great persons of which i mentioned something at first and this contains the best piece of secret history which perhaps has come to light in all this affair  suppose a b to be a lady deeply interested in the case before us and applying to one n o for his interest and favor in behalf of the condemned lords while other friends are soliciting as hard with other great persons let us digest their discourse as near as we can to the real dialogue that past between them allowing that we can relate no more than memory and our faithful intelligence could convey  note suppose the balm infused by other means to soften oding passions and prevent fermentation of natural morese humor a b a distressed lady introduced by a favorite throws her self at the feet of n o with abundance of tears and in a short address bespeaks him thus  my lord said she i come to implore your pity to a number of distressed but noble persons and particularly to my lord  they are well assured of the powerful influences your lordship has as well in the councils of  as in the p and without your lordships assistance they are inevitably lost  n o madam i am very sorry it is so little in my power to help your lord  but i have been already spoken to i suppose at your ladyships request by my lord  and i bid him assure you that if my lord d will be advised i shall do all for him that lies in my power  a b my lord  as these distressed prisoners have no friend so able to advise them as your lordship so you may be assured they will put their lives and honor into your lordships hand and be guided entirely by your advice  n o why madam i am told they make a difficulty of pleading guilty to the impeachments i do not see how it is possible any one can serve them if they decline pleading guilty  a b my lord  i cannot answer that particular farther than this it is no doubt hard to them to plead guilty especially to all the enlargements and aggravations in the impeachments though they are otherwise in no condition to repel the evidence  n o but they may plead guilty in general terms they acknowledge they were in arms marched so and so and were taken in fight as the impeachment expresses it this they cannot deny and pleading guilty then is no more than confessing what it is to no purpose to deny  a b but my lord pleading guilty is owning that taking arms for king james is rebellion  n o look you madam i am as much for king ja as my present circumstances will allow but in this case it is impossible to help them without it but madam my lord duke oflook you madam i am as much for king ja  has appointed to meet me this evening about this affair your ladyship may depend upon it that we will consider of the best method to serve my lord  and we hope he will not scruple any thing that we shall convince his lordship is for his interest  a b i humbly thank your lordship i know my lord depends entirely upon your assistance and is wholly given up to your measures  my lady returns to the tower and finds there another person who we shall know by the letters l r who had found means to visit the lord d in his imprisonment  this person it seems had likewise been with some great lords on the same errand that my lady had been with n o and having as we are informed received much the same answer was expostulating with my lord d about pleading guilty which the other strenuously opposed  my lord says l r how is it possible any peer can serve you if you have not first acknowledged the fact pardon craved implies guilt confessed no man can ask mercy for you while you stand upon your justification my lord d seemed a little moved at that proposal and with some warmth replied but my lord do you consider the very plea is a renouncing my sovereign how can a man of honor stoop to that nay how can any man of honor offer such a thing to us says l r my lord your lordship knows that n o was always a sincere friend to the chevalier he bid me assure you that he is still so in his heart you know he gave innumerable evidences of it formerly in the time of his administration and if he has seemingly appeared in another interest now for some time you know well the motives inducing and also that it is with due reserves and that he waits only an occasion to declare himself and you must be content if you will save your life my lord now you are in their power to do as my lord n o does viz double and turn and show the smooth face or the rough as occasion offers and i confess i do not see why you should make it a difficulty  my lord d as if he was surpised returned no difficulty my lord do you consider that it is perjury in the abstract and though i am a catholic i have no dispensation for breaking lawful oaths i ought to die rather than entertain a thought of it to this l r returned coldly i am sorry for it my lord it is certain if you cannot do this part you must dye there is no man living can interpose for you  it seems however that lord d was not willing either to leave the point or to leave off the discourse and therefore still held him in suspense my lord says he you may be sure i am willing to save my life but can i be guilty of perjury how can n o offer such a thing to me  l r told him he could not say how far these things might deserve the name of perjury and brought in this famous argument do not we that are protestants says he as firmly adhere to the interest of king j as any of you and yet you see we are obliged to take all the oaths abjurations associations etc that they put upon us  lord d told him gravely he could not enter into that case i examine no mans principles said he but my own i have always acted upon an honorable foot hitherto and i think a man of honor can no more renounce his king than his god  l r seemed at a full stop at this as indeed any protestant might well be and as if the case was at a point replied that he could not enter into a dispute about opinions and principles but says he if this cannot be then i beg your lordship will tell me if i can serve you any other way  my lord d not willing still to to quit the discourse replied with this question why may not the lords interpose for mercy to us after a trial if we are found guilty  this discovered his full design but l r opened the case more fully to his satisfaction as follows says he all that are your friends now will no doubt do so my lord but the business lies another way it must not be a few friends but a majority of the house that can do you any service and do you not think there will be a manifest difference in the inclination of the peers to you from the influence of your conduct and as you behave well or ill  lord d seemed not to understand him and desired him to explain himself  why suppose  says l r on one hand you plead not guilty justify your selves from your loyalty as you call it to the chevalier which by consequence must be in the highest manner provoking to the present government as it insists upon the title of their enemy and pretends to disown the settlement here do you think my lord said he as many will incline to compassion and as many will think you merit to be spared as will be moved on the other hand to a generous clemency when they see so many unhappy noblemen throwing themselves entirely at their feet and imploring their intercession for unfortunate men who cry for mercy pray consider this case sedately my lord  perhaps indeed says my lord there may be some difference in that  a great deal my lord continued l r and there are a great many reasons for it we are to work upon humane nature in this case not upon party principles if the house were to go by party you are lost you must not think that all those who may be brought to pity you are of your side if they were it were no matter how you pleaded but we are to move the compassions of men to your persons who are enemies to your cause and with such differing measures must be taken in a word my lord i must own it is my opinion that no other way can save you act as you think fit  my lord d as if he seemed to yield and that he was convinced by these reasonings returned thus well and if i do plead guilty what will he do for me and what must i do else  why my lord said l r if you plead guilty you first cast your self upon the mercy of the king then you must make a short handsome application to the peers to intercede with his majesty for his pardon  and must i call him king and majesty says l d  it must be so my lord says l r there can be no putting in a word for you unless you think fit to come this length and your lordship knows it to be so as well as i the nature of the thing requires it to which lord dseeming moved again returned smartly and will not your lordship say your self that i deserve more to dye than a common thief if i can stoop to such mean things to save my life  says l r i see my lord the nicety of honor will be your destruction i am sorry for your own part and yet more sorry for the injury such an obstinacy will be to the rest of the noble lords who are your fellow prisoners who i fear will fare the worse for it  you stab me with that expression replied my lord d rather than they shall suffer by me i will comply with any thing though i would not for any danger of my own  l r told him he knew that thought would touch his tender part that it was indeed a reflection which any person of honor would immediately make that it was hard to let our opiniatre endanger the lives honors and estates of our friends  to this lord d as if yielding said little but enquired into the farther circumstances of the proposal and says he if we do agree to prevaricate and merely to save our lives take this dishonorable step for such we must esteem it as we shall speak against the testimony of our own hearts when we do it i say when we do thus what then  says l r then my lord the persons we have been with viz n o b and n and several other persons of honor of the first magnitude have promised to bestir themselves  but what is it they can do says l d still unsatisfied  rather my lord says the other what is it they cannot do  but may we not have some view of their measures says l d  yes yes my lord says l r you know they have a right to advise the king and if they espouse your interest you will find perhaps they may be brought to address the king in parliament to pardon you which if you can obtain your business is over for you hardly ever found an example where any person who the parliament addressed to have spared was executed although the crime might be equal if not superior  indeed says l d the design seems well laid an address will certainly do our business but must we not apply to the house of commons too  l r returned you may do so if you please but we cannot answer for them in this case for though the house of commons do often make or pass acts of oblivion yet in cases thus particular we do not find often that the house relents the commons are the accusers and are justly incensed at the rebellion and they cannot so reasonably concern themselves to interpose between the king and those that have offended but if the lords do it we doubt not but it will be sufficient in this case and we hope the commons may be brought not to oppose it if they cannot be brought to address in your favor  says l d well then we must for once stoop to be ros and deny our prince and our principle to save our lives but my heart misgives and tells me that it will never do heaven cannot approve it and will not bless it and take it from me when we have done so it will not thrive and it will be the only sin of my life i shall have to make confession of upon the scaffold for thither i shall come and its better to come there gallantly and with the clear soul of a man of honor than basely loaded with guilt and confusion and bearing testimony against our selves that we have acted dishonourably to save our lives and not saved them neither  he spoke this with great earnestness and almost with tears standing in his eyes and his friend could not but perceive it which made him very passionately embrace him telling him he saw with what reluctance he did it and if it had been in his power to have served him any other way he would rather have died than have proposed it to him  by such arguments as these and by the solicitations of those friends who stirred for them who thought it necessary for their safety the lord d is said to be prevailed upon to go into those measures which he publicly repented of when he found them ineffectual  how far both they and their friends also were mistaken in their measures we shall take notice of by and by  it is necessary to observe here that after these things were over and the prisoners had pleaded guilty spoken very handsomely and submitted in the lowest manner to the peers begging their lordships to interpose with his majesty for mercy to them as by their speeches which are made public and to which i refer may be seen i say after this was over then the moments seemed to be come in which the promises of n o and other their friends were if ever to be performed  the ladies with all the most moving and passionate representations acted their part to perfection none can say they did not do their duty to the utmost the powerful interest they made among all the men of influence showed they were not wanting all that prayers and tears could do was done without doors at length the petition was brought into the house of lords and being received it introduced a debate  i am not allowed to take notice of any thing that was transacted within the house other than by generals to wit that their friends did all that could be expected of them and that it was possible to do and so far has clemency and a merciful disposition the ascendant over the noble persons who compose that illustrious body that those lords who spoke in favor of the condemned lords had great advantages few caring to interpose to put a stop to the royal goodness or obstruct the channel of mercy to the miserable  this we may suppose favored their petition and the lords agreed to address his majesty for mercy with such a reserve to his majestys pleasure and their conduct as might tell them however that there was yet something farther to be looked for from them if they expected mercy how this was expressed is to be seen in the address to which we refer  the condemned lords it was said did not receive the news of this address with that pleasure that their friends who saw not so far into it as some of them did expected which perhaps was the reason why one said of them too warmly that they were not grateful to their friends  nor did they receive it all alike some who penetrated into things farther than others seeing perhaps room for their deliverance in it and others just the contrary so that while this address put some of them in hopes that they might deserve mercy and consequently have room to expect it others of them saw room only to despair this deserving mercy being a term which they had different notions of from other men  it began now to appear to them that they were deceived when they thought that the bitterness of death was past that the peers though they were prevailed with to harbor some merciful dispositions toward them were very far from offering to impose upon the government or to press for mercy but on such express terms as his majesty should find to be for the honor of his government and the safety of his kingdom so that it remained for these gentlemen to convince his majesty that they were proper objects of mercy before they could comfort themselves much from what was past  this part leads us to the second part of our work viz to mention something of the reasons so far as we have got insight into that matter withoutdoors why the king though mercifully inclined and heartily sorry for the necessity which his majesty finds himself under to give the public justice so much vent yet could not see it reasonable to extend that mercy which was so earnestly solicited for to that particular person of whom these papers may seem to speak  the speech or paper left behind by the lord derr though it does not speak it in words yet intimates very plainly that there has been a long train of treasons a secret management of parties and persons in the preparing the late rebellion and concerting measures for it and that there appeared a great desire in some people to have it out and no doubt it is the true interest of the present government to discover those things and the discovery whereof might indeed contribute to the preventing more of these unhappy gentlemen coming into like circumstances with these and so in effect be of service to their friends that these gentlemen were privy to and partly in those treasons there is little reason to question what else can be the meaning of the words in the lord der speech that some means have been proposed to me for saving my life which i looked on as inconsistent with honor and conscience and therefore i rejected them it is evident then that he was able to have complied with the means proposed otherwise it would have been a prevarication to say that therefore he rejected them if he had been incapable to have complied if he had not been in the said train of treasons if he had not been able to make discoveries he could with more truth and much more to his own vindication have said that it was not in his power and that therefore those proposals were ineffectual to him  but while on the other hand he rejected the proposal that was made to him by which his life might have been saved who was cruel to my lord derwentwater but my lord derwentwater and who caused him to be executed the king or himself  it is not worth while to examine here what he calls inconsistent with honor and conscience if it was not inconsistent with his honor and conscience to rise in arms that is as far as lay in him to depose murder and destroy the king and all his royal family it cannot be inconsistent with the greatest clemency in his majesty to bring such to the block but on the other hand it was the highest testimony imaginable of royal clemency to offer such men their lives upon their testifying their sorrow for the crime by giving a true and faithful confession of all the parts of the design as far as they were really concerned in it while they deny this what token of contrition what satisfaction of future loyalty can they give they pleaded guilty say their party and threw themselves upon mercy and such are generally thought more proper objects of mercy than others but let us examine what is meant here by pleading guilty for except only the form i deny that they pleaded guilty at all  my lord derwentwater very ingenuously explains what he understands by his pleading guilty it is in his speech at the bar the   th of february the said earl acknowledges with a real sorrow that at the time in the articles mentioned he was in arms and with others did march through and invade several parts of this kingdom the law indeed accepts this as pleading guilty because the fact being acknowledged the law determines from it both the guilt and the penalty but what is this toward a penitent or toward such a confession as must merit pardon  when a prisoner pleads guilty to the judge he needs to own nothing but the fact the court as i said determines all the rest  but when a prisoner pleads guilty to his offended prince to move and implore his clemency and mercy it is not the fact but the crime that he must charge himself with it behooves him to come and acknowledge it thus sir i own my self a rebel to you just authority i am now willing to become your faithful subject to recognize your authority and confess all my rebellion  but in all these gentlemens pleading guilty there is not one word of confessing the crime though there is of confessing the fact that they were in arms but do not own that they were rebels nay my lord kenmure is so honest if the paper said to be left behind him be genuine as to acknowledge he prevaricated in his pleading guilty  now let any divine tell us nay even let a popish priest tell us if this be sound in divinity does god himself pardon any sinners that does not confess their offenses or that confess one part but will not confess all what claim to mercy can any christian make upon any scriptures foundation but upon a full and sincere confession i say full and sincere he that hides his sin shall not prosper but he that confesses and forsakes shall find mercy prove        now these gentlemen have indeed confessed the fact and what is there in that were they not evident and easy to be proved was it in their power to deny any part were they not all taken in the field of battle with the sword of rebellion in their hands what thanks to them for that plea but if they had come ingenuously and confessed the treason acknowledged the crime of it laid open the train of it given in a full account of the rise and progress of it and then have expressed their sorrow that they should be guilty of such a horrid crime had this been done and mercy had been refused them indeed they would have had some room to talk of severity though none then of injustice  but this way of confessing does not in my opinion reach the case at all they have made no confession of the rebellion though they have of their being in arms in a word they have acknowledged themselves rebels in or sense but they have not acknowledged that they are sensible of their being rebels or that it is rebellion in their own sense and pray what does all this amount to for my share i do not see they have pleaded guilty with any view but that of the scaffold  the confession of a penitent is quite another thing his confession will be complete will be sincere and he will be more afflicted for the crime than the punishment  again he that confesses his guilt must confess all his guilt and all his treason and he cannot be said to make an ingenuous confession that conceals any thing he knows which may be for the detecting the treason if any part lies concealed or that may be for the safety and advantage of the prince against whom he has offended  and here comes in the objection this is against my honor and conscience because it will impeach my friends break the wicked compact the engagement or oath of secresy taken with other traitors and what then the consequence is he takes his word again as the scots call it relapses to a rebel in inclination and begs pardon that he has acknowledged that little that he has  in a word if these gentlemen were not spared it was because they would have their lives upon their own terms or not at all they would have mercy shown to them for sins unconfessd is there any one of them that has given a full narrative of all the treasons they have committed they have acknowledged the capital part indeed which as we may say they could not avoid or get clear of but what else have they confessed have they told the government any one thing which they did not know before had my lord derwentwater made such an ingenuous acknowledgment of all he knew of the rebellion i am bold to say he would have merited some mercy and for that reason i believe he would have found it  but this manner of confession say they would have betrayed friends brought great men and great families to ruin and perhaps a great many of them too and it is below the honor of a nobleman to turn informer  it were to be wished such men would put the circumstances they have brought themselves to into the balance and consider that with the point of honor they speak of if they had stood out either in their defense or if after conviction had resolved to meet death as from the hand of an enemy then indeed it could not be expected that they should make any such thing as a confession but when they lie prostrate at the foot of majesty condemned by the law acknowledging the fact and imploring mercy this is quite another thing and that these men should reject the conditions upon which mercy was offered them this is perfectly inconsistent with the nature of their submission and aggravates the crime they were guilty of before and makes the necessity of dealing with them in a course of strict justice and this may be another reason against mercy  it is below the majesty of the government to name the folly and madness of their friends as a reason for their execution and yet it deserves some notice too no sooner were these men with the rest of the preston prisoners come up and had been a little while in prison but their friends laughed loudly at the government telling them in their teeth that they durst not put them to death as if the power that was able to break them in the field should not be able to punish them when in prison but so preposterous have they been in this part that they have pusht the government almost upon the necessity of bringing them to the block to satisfy the world that they dare do it  this is very hard upon their friends and has made their being brought to the block very reasonable in the present government if not absolutely necessary and it is worth while for them to consider it on several accounts   how just the king had been to have executed many more and have given that insolence of their friends as the reason of it and   whether though for time past it has not been done yet that if the king should think fit to execute some merely upon the importunity of this circumstance who otherwise his majestys goodness might incline him to pardon i say whether their blood though not innocent would not be so to those people and be laid at their door  in the mean time there is a more forcible reason still to give why his majesty may not have thought fit to extend that mercy to these men which otherwise perhaps they might have found viz the continued threatenings of the party still to renew their attempts to return with a greater force and to revive the rebellion promising to rescue their sufferers out of the hand of public justice and to return the treatment they have met with  let any one judge whether a threatening enemy is an object of mercy and whether it would consist with the honor of his majestys government and the safety of his kingdom to pardon enemies that are insulting him when out of his hands and conditioning with him even when they are in  it must be allowed that clemency is the glory of a king and mercy the honor of his government but clemency is to be directed by wisdom as the sword is to be managed by council rebellious subjects unhumbled can never be the proper subject of the princes clemency neither is justice executed upon obstinate rebels any breach of moderation in government  and how is a rebel humbled that owns not his rebellion to be a crime how is he an object of mercy that will not accept of his life but upon his own conditions it is time to capitulate when they are not in the hands of justice my lord nithisdale who has made his escape is in a much proper posture to ask mercy after the manner they did than they were he that implores mercy must first put himself into the condition that denominates him a proper object of mercy or he has but little reason to expect it  his majesty no doubt has yet more and more forcible reasons for not granting the mercy that was petitioned for to the late lord derwentwater etc but if not i cannot think but these will make it evident to all the world that it was not reasonable for them to expect mercy in the circumstances they were in or safe for his majesty to grant it i hope those who are left will take care to behave more suitable to their own interest and to deserve better the mercy they expect  finis
