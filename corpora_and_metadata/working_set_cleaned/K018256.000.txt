is added a map of the world in which is delineated the voyages of robinson crusoe  printers device showing representation of a ship  london printed for w tailor at the ship in paternoster row mdccxix  the preface the success the former part of this work has met with in the world has yet been no other than is acknowledged to be due to the surprising variety of the subject and to the agreeable manner of the performance  all the endeavors of envious people to reproach it with being a romance to search it for errors in geography inconsistency in the relation and contradictions in the fact have proved abortive and as impotent as malicious  the just application of every incident the religious and useful inferences drawn from every part are so many testimonies to the good design of making it public and must legitimate all the part that may be called invention or parable in the story  the second part if the editors opinion may pass is contrary to the usage of second parts every way as entertaining as the first contains as strange and surprising incidents and as great a variety of them nor is the application less serious or suitable and doubtless will to the sober as well as ingenious reader be every way as profitable and diverting and this makes the abridging this work as scandalous as it is knavish and ridiculous seeing while to shorten the book that they may seem to reduce the value they strip it of all those reflections as well religious as moral which are not only the greatest beautys of the work but are calculated for the infinite advantage of the reader  by this they leave the work naked of its brightest ornaments and if they would at the same time pretend that the author has supplied the story out of his invention they take from it the improvement which alone recommends that invention to wise and good men  the injury these men do the proprietor of this work is a practice all honest men abhor and he believes he may challenge them to show the difference between that and robbing on the highway or breaking open a house  if they cannot show any difference in the crime they will find it hard to show why there should be any difference in the punishment and he will answer for it that nothing shall be wanting on his part to do them justice  just published the  th edition of the life and strange surprising adventures of robinson crusoe of york mariner who lived eight and twenty years all alone in an uninhabited island on the coast of america near the mouth of the great river oroonoque having been cast on shore by shipwreck wherein all the men perished but himself with an account how he was at last as strangely delivered by pirates written by himself to this edition is added a map of the world in which is delineated the voyages of robinson crusoe printed for w tailor at the ship in paternoster row  nb the pretended abridgment of this book clandestinely printed for t cox at the amsterdam coffeehouse consists only of some scattered passages incoherently tacked together wherein the authors sense throughout is wholly mistaken the matters of fact misreprented and the moral reflections misapplied it is hoped the public will not give encouragement to so base a practice the proprietor intending to prosecute the venders according to law  a map of the world on which is delineated the voyages of robinson cruso map of the world  the farther adventures of robinson crusoe etc that homely proverb used on so many occasions in england viz that what is bred in the bone will not go out of the flesh was never more verified than in the story of my life any one would think that after thirtyfive years affliction and a variety of unhappy circumstances which few men if any ever went through before and after near seven years of peace and enjoyment in the fullness of all things grown old and when if ever it might be allowed me to have had experience of every state of middle life and to know which was most adapted to make a man completely happy i say after all this any one would have thought that the native propensity to rambling which i gave an account of in my first setting out into the world to have been so pre dominate in my thoughts should be worn out the volatile part be fully evacuated or at least condensed and i might at    years of age have been a little inclined to stay at home and have done venturing life and fortune any more  nay farther the common motive of foreign adventures was taken away in me for i had no fortune to make i had nothing to seek if i had gained ten thousand pound i had been no richer for i had already sufficient for me and for those i had to leave it to and that i had was visibly increasing for having no great family i could not spend the income of what i had unless i would set up for an expensive way of living such as a great family servants equipage gayety and the like which were things i had no notion of or inclination to so that i had nothing indeed to do but to sit still and fully enjoy what i had got and see it increase daily upon my hands  yet all these things had no effect upon me or at least not enough to resist the strong inclination i had to go abroad again which hung about me like a chronical distemper particularly the desire of seeing my new plantation in the island and the colony i left there run in my head continually i dreamed of it all night and my imagination run upon it all day it was uppermost in all my thoughts and my fancy worked so steadily and strongly upon it that i talked of it out of sleep in short nothing could remove it out of my mind it even broke so violently into all my discourses that it made my conversation tiresome for i could talk of nothing else all my discourse run into it even to impertinence and i saw it my self  i have often heard persons of good judgment say that all the stir people make in the world about ghosts and apparitions is owing to the strength of imagination and the powerful operation of fancy in their minds that there is no such thing as a spirit appearing or a ghost walking and the like that peoples poring affectionately upon the past conversation of their deceased friends so realizes it to them that they are capable of fancying upon some extraordinary circumstances that they see them talk to them and are answered by them when in truth there is nothing but shadow and vapor in the thing and they really know nothing of the matter  for my part i know not to this hour whether there are any such things as real apparitions specter or walking of people after they are dead or whether there is any thing in the stories they tell us of that kind more than the product of vapors sick minds and wandering fancies but this i know that my imagination worked up to such a height and brought me into such ecstasies of vapors or what else i may call it that i actually supposed my self often times upon the spot at my old castle behind the trees saw my old spaniard fridays father and the reprobate sailors i left upon the island nay i fancied i talked with them and looked at them so steadily though i was broad awake as at persons just before me and this i did till i often frighted my self with the images my fancy represented to me one time in my sleep i had the villainy of the   pyrate sailors so lively related to me by the first spaniard and fridays father that it was surprising they told me how they barbarously attempted to murder all the spaniards and that they set fire to the provisions they had laid up on purpose to distress and starve them things that i had never heard of and that indeed were never all of them true in fact but it was so warm in my imagination and so realizd to me that to the hour i saw them i could not be persuaded but that it was or would be true also how i resented it when the spaniard complained to me and how i brought them to justice tried them before me and ordered them all three to be hanged what there was really in this shall be seen in its place for however i came to form such things in my dream and what secret converse of spirits injected it yet there was very much of it true i say i own that this dream had nothing in it literally and specifically true but the general part was so true the base villanious behavior of these three hardened rogues was such and had been so much worse than all i can describe that the dream had too much similitude of the fact and as i would afterward have punished them severely so if i had hanged them all i had been much in the right and should have been justifiable both by the laws of god and man  but to return to my story in this kind of temper i had lived some years i had no enjoyment of my life no pleasant hours no agreeable diversion but what had some thing or other of this in it so that my wife who saw my mind so wholly bent upon it told me very seriously one night that she believed there was some secret powerful impulse of providence upon me which had determined me to go thither again and that she found nothing hindered my going but my being engaged to a wife and children she told me that it was true she could not think of parting with me but as she was assured that if she was dead it would be the first thing i would do so as it seemed to her that the thing was determined above she would not be the only obstruction for if i thought fit and rosolvd to go  here she found me very intent upon her words and that i looked very earnestly at her so that it a little disordered her and she stopped i asked her why she did not go on and say out what she was going to say but i perceived her heart was too full and some tears stood in her eyes speak out my dear said i are you willing i should go no says she very affectionately i am far from willing but if you are resolved to go says she and rather than i will be the only hindrance i will go with you for though i think it a most preposterous thing for one of your years and in your condition yet if it must be said she again weeping i will not leave you for if it be of heaven you must do it there is no resisting it and if heaven makes it your duty to go he will also make it mine to go with you or otherwise dispose of me that i may not obstruct it  this affectionate behavior of my wifes brought me a little out of the vapors and i began to consider what i was a doing i corrected my wandering fancy and began to argue with my self sedately what business i had after threescore years and after such a life of tedious sufferings and disasters and closed in so happy and easy a manner i say what business i had to rush into new hazards and put my self upon adventures fit only for youth and poverty to run into  with those thoughts i considered my new engagement that i had a wife one child born and my wife then great with child of another that i had all the world could give me and had no need to seek hazards for gain that i was declining in years and ought to think rather of leaving what i had gained than of seeking to increase it that as to what my wife had said of its being an impulse from heaven and that it should be my duty to go i had no notion of that so after many of these cogitations i struggled with the power of my imagination reasoned my self out of it as i believe people may always do in like cases if they will and in a word i conquered it composed my self with such arguments as occurred to my thought and which my present condition furnished me plentifully with and particularly as the most effectual method i resolved to divert my self with other things and to engage in some business that might effectually tie me up from any more excursions of this kind for i found that thing return upon me chiefly when i was idle had nothing to do or any thing of moment immediately before me  to this purpose i bought a little farm in the country of bedford and resolved to remove my self thither i had a little convenient house upon it and the land about it i found was capable of great improvement and that it was many ways suited to my inclination which delighted in cultivating managing planting and improving of land and particularly being an inland country i was removed from conversing among ships sailors and things relating to the remote part of the world  in a word i went down to my farm settled my family bought me ploughs harrows a cart wagon horses cows sheep and setting seriously to work became in one half year a mere country gentleman my thoughts were entirely taken up in managing my servants cultivating the ground enclosing planting etc and i lived as i thought the most agreeable life that nature was capable of directing or that a man always bred to misfortunes was capable of being retreated to  i farmed upon my own land i had no rent to pay was limited by no articles i could pull up or cut down as i pleased what i planted was for my self and what i improved was for my family and having thus left off the thoughts of wandering i had not the least discomfort in any part of life as to this world now i thought indeed that i enjoyed the middle state of life that my father so earnestly recommended to me and lived a kind of heavenly life something like what is described by the poet upon the subject of a country life free from vices free from care age has no pain and youth no snare   but in the middle of all this felicity one blow from unforeseen providence unhinged me at once and not only made a breach upon me inevitable and incurable but drove me by its consequences into a deep relapse into the wandering disposition which as i may say being born in my very blood soon recovered its hold of me and like the returns of a violent distemper came on with an irresistible force upon me so that nothing could make any more impression upon me this blow was the loss of my wife  it is not my business here to write an elegy upon my wife give a character of her particular virtues and make my court to the sex by the flattery of a funeral sermon she was in a few words the stay of all my affairs the center of all my enterprises the engine that by her prudence reduced me to that happy compass i was in from the most extravagant and ruinous project that fluttered in my head as above and did more to guide my rambling genius than a mothers tears a fathers instructions a friends counsel or all my own reasoning powers could do i was happy in listening to her tears and in being moved by her entreaties and to the last degree desolate and dislocated in the world by the loss of her  when she was gone the world looked aukwardly round me i was as much a stranger in it in my thoughts as i was in the brasils when i went first on shore there and as much alone except as to the assistance of servants as i was in my island i knew neither what to do or what not to do i saw the world busy round me one part laboring for bread and the other part squandring in vile excesses or empty pleasures equally miserable because the end they proposed still fled from them for the man of pleasure every day surfeited of his vice and heaped up work for sorrow and repentance and the man of labor spent their strength in daily strugglings for breadto maintain the vital strength they labored with so living in a daily circulation of sorrow living but to work and working but to live as if daily bread where the only end of wearisome life and a wearisome life the only occasion of daily bread  this put me in mind of the life i lived in my kingdom the island where i suffered no more corn to grow because i did not want it and bred no more goats because i had no more use for them where the money lay in the drawer till it grew moldy and had scarce the favor to be looked upon in  0 years  all these things had i improved them as i ought to have done and as reason and religion had dictated to me would have taught me to search farther than human enjoyments for a full felicity and that there was something which certainly was the reason and end of life superior to all these things and which was either to be possessed or at least hoped for on this side the grave  but my sage counselor was gone i was like a ship without a pilot that could only run before the wind my thoughts run all away again into the old affair my head quite was turned with the whimsies of foreign adventures and all the pleasant innocent amusements of my farm and my garden my cattle and my family which before entirely possessed me were nothing to me had no relish and were like music to one that has no ear or food to one that has no taste in a word i resolved to leave off housekeeping let my farm and return to london and in a few months after i did so  when i came to london i was still as uneasy as i was before i had no relish to the place no employment in it nothing to do but to saunter about like an idle person of whom it may be said he is perfectly useless in gods creation and it is not one farthing matter to the rest of his kind whether he be dead or alive this also was the life which of all circumstances of life was the most my aversion who had been all my days used to an active life and i would often say to my self a state of idleness is the very dregs of life and indeed i thought i was much more suitably employed when i was    days a making me a deal board  it was now the beginning of the year      when my nephew who as i had observed before i had brought up to the sea and had made him commander of a ship was come home from a short voyage to bilboa being the first he had made and he came to me and told me that some merchants of his acquaintance had been proposing to him to go a voyage for them to the east indies and to china as private traders and now uncle says he if you will go to sea with me i will engage to land you upon your old habitation in the island for we are to touch at the brasils  nothing can be a greater demonstration of a future state and of the existence of an invisible world than the concurence of second causes with the ideas of things which we form in our minds perfectly reserved and not communicated to any in the world  my nephew knew nothing how far my distemper of wandering was returned upon me and i knew nothing of what he had in his thoughts to say when that very morning before he came to me i had in a great deal of confusion of thought and revolving every part of my circumstances in my mind come to this resolution viz that i would go to lisbon and consult with my old seacaptain and so if it was rational and practicable i would go and see the island again and see what was become of my people there i had pleased my self with the thoughts of peopling the place and carrying inhabitants from hence getting a patent for the possession and i know not what when in the middle of all this in comes my nephew as i have said with his project of carrying me thither in his way to the east indies  i paused a while at his words and looking steadily at him what devil said i sent you of this unlucky errand my nephew startled as if he had been frighted at first but perceiving i was not much displeased with the proposal he recovered himself i hope it may not be an unlucky proposal sir says he i dare say you would be pleased to see your new colony there where you once reigned with more felicity than most of your brother monarchs in the world  in a word the scheme hit so exactly with my temper that is to say the prepossession i was under and of which i have said so much that i told him in few words if he agreed with the merchants i would go with him but i told him i would not promise to go any farther than my own island why sir says he you dont want to be left there again i hope why said i can you not take me up again in your return he told me it could not be possible that the merchants would allow him to come that way with a laden ship of such value it being a months sail out of his way and might be three or four besides sir if i should miscarry said he and not return at all then you would be just reduced to the condition you were in before  this was very rational but we both found out a remedy for it which was to carry a framed sloop on board the ship which being taken in pieces and shipped on board the ship might by the help of some carpenters who we agreed to carry with us be set up again in the island and finished fit to go to sea in a few days  i was not long resolving for indeed the importunities of my nephew joined in so effectually with my inclination that nothing could oppose me on the other hand my wife being dead i had no body concerned themselves so much for me as to persuade me one way or other except my ancient good friend the widow who earnestly struggled with me to consider my years my easy circumstances and the needless hazards of a long voyage and above all my young children but it was all to no purpose i had an irresistible desire to the voyage and i told her i thought there was something so uncommon in the impressions i had upon my mind for the voyage that it would be a kind of resisting providence if i should attempt to stay at home after which she ceased her expostulations and joined with me not only in making provision for my voyage but also in settling my family affairs for my absence and providing for the education of my children  in order to this i made my will and settled the estate i had in such a manner for my children and placed in such hands that i was perfectly easy and satisfied they would have justice done them whatever might befall me and for their education i left it wholly to my widow with a sufficient maintenence to her self for her care all which she richly deserved for no mother could have taken more care in their education or understand it better and as she lived till i came home i also lived to thank her for it  my nephew was ready to sail about the beginning of january       and i with my man friday went on board in the downs the  th having besides that sloop which i mentioned above a very considerable cargo of all kinds of necessary things for my colony which if i did not find in good condition i resolved to leave so  first i carried with me some servants who i purposed to place there as inhabitants or at least to set on work there upon my own account while i stayed and either to leave them there or carry them forward as they should appear willing particularly i carried two carpenters a smith and a very handy ingenious fellow who was a cooper by trade but was also a general mechanic for he was dextrous at making wheels and handmills to grind corn was a good turner and a good potmaker he also made any thing that was proper to make of earth or of wood in a word we called him our jack of all trades  with these i carried a tailor who had offered himself to go passenger to the east indies with my nephew but afterward consented to stay on our new plantation and proved a most necessary handy fellow as could be desired in many other businesses besides that of this trade for as i observed formerly necessity arms us for all employments  my cargo as near as i can collect for i have not kept an account of the particulars consisted of a sufficient quantity of linen and some thin english stuffs for clothing the spaniards that i expected to find there and enough of them as by my calculation might comfortably supply them for seven years if i remember right the materials i carried for clothing them with gloves hats shoes stockings and all such things as they could want for wearing amounted to above  00 pounds including some beds bedding and household stuff particularly kitchenutensils with pots kettles peuter brass etc and near a hundred pound more in ironwork nails tools of every kind staples hooks hinges and every necessary thing i could think of  i carried also an hundred spare arms muskets and fuzees besides some pistols a considerable quantity of shot of all sizes and two pieces of brass cannon and because i knew not what time and what extremities i was providing for i carried an hundred barrels of powder besides swords cutlasses and the iron part of some pikes and halberts so that in short we had a large magazine of all sorts of stores and i made my nephew carry two small quarter deck guns more than he wanted for his ship to leave behind if their was occasion that when we came there we might build a fort and man it against all sorts of enemies and indeed i at first thought there was need enough for it all and much more if we hoped to maintain our possession of the island as shall be seen in the course of that story  i had not such bad luck in this voyage as i had been used to meet with and therefore shall have the less occasion to interrupt the reader who perhaps may be impatient to hear how matters went with my colony yet some odd accidents cross winds and bad weather happened on this first setting out which made the voyage longer than i expected it at first and i who had never made but one voyage viz my first voyage to guinea in which i might be said to come back again as the voyage was at first designed began to think the same ill fate still attended me and that i was born to be never contented with being on shore and yet to be always unfortunate at sea  contrary winds first put us to the northward and we were obliged to put in at galway in ireland where we lay windbound two and twenty days but we had this satisfaction with the disaster that provisions where here exceeding cheap and in the utmost plenty so that while we lay here never touched the ships stores but rather added to them here also i took in several live hogs and two cows and calves which i resolved if i had a good passage to put on shore in my island but we found occasion to dispose otherwise of them  we sat out the  th of february from ireland and had a very fair gale of wind for some days as i remember it might be about the  0th of february in the evening late when the mate having the watch came into the roundhouse and told us he saw a flash of fire and heard a gunfird and while he was telling us of it a boy came in and told us the boatswain heard another this made us all run out upon the quarter deck where for a while we heard nothing but in a few minutes we saw a very great light and found that there was some very terrible fire at a distance immediately we had recourse to our reckonings in which we all agreed that there could be no land that way in which the fire showed it self no not for  00 leagues for it appeared at wnw upon this we concluded it must be some ship on fire at sea and as by our hearing the noise of guns just before we concluded it could not be far off we stood directly toward it and were presently satisfied we should discover it because the farther we sailed the greater the light appeared though the weather being haizy we could not perceive any thing but the light for a while in about half an hours sailing the wind being fair for us though not much of it and the weather clearing up a little we could plainly discern that it was a great ship on fire in the middle of the sea  i was most sensible touched with this disaster though not at all acquainted with the persons engaged in it i presently recollected my former circumstances and in what condition i was in when taken up by the portugal captain and how much more deplorable the circumstances of the poor creatures belonging to this ship must be if they had no other ship in company with them upon this i immediately ordered that five guns should be fired one soon after another that if possible we might give notice to them that there was help for them at hand and that they might endeavor to save themselves in their boat for though we could see the flame of the ship yet they it being night could see nothing of us  we lay by some time upon this only driving as the burning ship drove waiting for daylight when on a sudden to our great terror though we had reason to expect it the ship blew up in the air and immediately that is to say in a few minutes all the fire was out that is to say the rest of the ship sunk this was a terrible and indeed an afflicting sight for the sake of the poor men who i concluded must be either all destroyed in the ship or be in the utmost distress in their boat in the middle of the ocean which at present by reason it was dark i could not see however to direct them as well as i could i caused lights to be hung out in all the parts of the ship where we could and which we had lanthorns for and kept firing guns all the night long letting them know by this that there was a ship not far off  about   clock in the morning we discovered the ships boats by the help of our perspective glasses found there were two of them both thronged with people and deep in the water we perceived they rowed the wind being against them that they saw our ship and did their utmost to make us see them  we immediately spread our ancient to let them know we saw them and hung a waft out as a signal for them to come on board and then made more sail standing directly to them in little more than half an hour we came up with them and in a word took them all in being no less than sixty four men women and children for there were a great many passengers  upon the whole we found it was a french merchant ship of  00 tun homeward bound from quebeck in the river of canada the master gave us a long account of the distress of his ship how the fire began in the steerage by the negligence of the steersman but on his crying out for help was as every body thought entirely put out when they found that some sparks of the first fire had gotten into some part of the ship so difficult to come at that they could not effectually quench it till getting in between the timbers and within the ceiling of the ship it proceeded into the hold and mastered all the skill and all the application they were able to exert  they had no more to do then but to get into their boats which to their great comfort were pretty large being their longboat and a great shalloup besides a small skiff which was of no great service to them other than to get some fresh water and provisions into her after they had secured their lives from the fire they had indeed small hope of their lives by getting into these boats at that distance from any land only as they said well that they were escaped from the fire and had a possibility that some ship might happen to be at sea and might take them in they had sails oars and a compass and were preparing to make the best of their way back to newfoundland the wind blowing pretty fair for it blew an easy gale at se by e they had as much provisions and water as with sparing it so as to be next door to starving might support them about    days in which if they had no bad weather and no contrary winds the captain said he hoped he might get the banks of newfoundland and might perhaps take some fish to sustain them till they might go on shore but there were so many chances against them in all these cases such as storms to overset and founder them rains and cold to benumb and perish their limbs contrary winds to keep them out and starve them that it must have been next to miraculous if they had escaped  in the midst of their consultations every one being hopeless and ready to despair the captain with tears in his eyes told me they were on a sudden surpised with the joy of hearing a gun fire and after that four more these were the five guns which i caused to be fired at first seeing the light this revived their hearts and gave them the notice which as above i desired it should viz that there was a ship at hand for their help  it was upon the hearing these guns that they took down their masts and sails the sound coming from the windward they resolved to lie by till morning some time after this hearing no more guns they fired three muskets one a considerable while after another but these the wind being contrary we never heard  some time after that again they were still more agreeably surpised with seeing our lights and hearing the guns which as i have said i caused to be fired all the rest of the night this set them to work with their oars to keep their boats ahead at least that we might the sooner come up with them and at last to their inexpressible joy they found we saw them  it is impossible for me to express the several gestures the strange ecstasies the variety of postures which these poor delivered people run into to express the joy of their souls at so unexpected a deliverance grief and fear are easily described sighs tears groans and a very few motions of the head and hands make up the sum of its variety but an excess of joy a surprise of joy has a thousand extravagancies in it there were some in tears some raging and tearing themselves as if they had been in the greatest agonies of sorrow some starkraving and downright lunatic some ran about the ship stamping with their feet others wringing their hands some were dancing some singing some laughing more crying many quite dumb not able to speak a word others sick and vomiting several swooning and ready to faint and a few were crossing themselves and giving god thanks  i would not wrong them neither there might be many that were thankful afterward but the passion was too strong for them at first and they were not able to master it they were thrown into ecstasies and a kind of frenzy and it was but a very few that were composed and serious in their joy  perhaps the case may have some addition to it from the particular circumstance of that nation they belonged to i mean the french whose temper is allowed to be more volatile more passionate and more sprightly and their spirits more fluid than in other nations i am not philosopher enough to determine the cause but nothing i had ever seen before came up to it the ecstasies poor friday my trusty savage was in when he found his father in the boat came the nearest to it and the surprise of the master and his two companions who i delivered from the villains that set them on shore in the island came a little way toward it but nothing was to compare to this either that i saw in friday or any where else in my life  it is further observable that these extravagancies did not show themselves in that different manner i have mentioned in different persons only but all the variety would appear in a short succession of moments in one and the same person a man that we saw this minute dumb and as it were stupid and confounded should the next minute be dancing and hallowing like an antic and the next moment be tearing his hair or pulling his clothes to pieces and stamping them under his feet like a mad man a few moments after that we should have him all in tears then sick then swooning and had not immediate help been had would in a few moments more have been dead and thus it was not with one or two or ten or twenty but with the greatest part of them and if i remember right our surgeon was obliged to let above thirty of them blood  there were two priests among them one an old man and the other a young man and that which was strangest was that the oldest man was the worst as soon as he set his foot on board our ship and saw himself safe he dropped down stone dead not the least sign of life could be perceived in him our surgeon immediately applied proper remedies to recover him and was the only man in the ship that believed he was not dead at length he opened a vein in his arm having first chaffd and rubbed the part so as to warm it as much as possible upon this the blood which only dropped at first flowed something freely in three minutes after the man opened his eyes and about a quarter of an hour after that he spoke grew better and quite well after the blood was stopped he walked about told us he was perfectly well took a dram of cordial which the surgeon gave him and was what we called come to himself about a quarter of an hour after they came running into the cabin to the surgeon who was bleeding a french woman that had fainted and told him the priest was gone starkmad it seems he had begun to revolve the change of his circumstance and again this put him into an ecstasy of joy his spirits whirled about faster than the vessels could convey them the blood grew hot and feverish and the man was as fit for bedlam as any creature that ever was in it the surgeon would not bleed him again in that condition but gave him something to dose and put him to sleep which after some time operated upon him and he waked the next morning perfectly composed and well  the younger priest behaved with great command of his passion and was really an example of a serious wellgoverned mind at his first coming on board the ship he threw himself flat on his face prostrating himself in thankfulness for his deliverance in which i unhappily and unseasonably disturbed him really thinking he had been in a swoon but he spoke calmly thanked me told me he was giving god thanks for his deliverance and begged me to leave him a few moments and that next to his maker he would give me thanks also  i was heartily sorry that i disturbed him and not only left him but kept others from interrupting him also he continued in that posture about three minutes or little more after i left him then came to me as he had said he would and with a great deal of seriousness and affection but with tears in his eyes thanked me that had under god given him and so many miserable creatures their lives i told him i had no room to move him to thank god for it rather than me but i added that it was nothing but what reason and humanity dictated to all men and that we had as much reason as he to give thanks to god who had blessed us so far as to make us the instruments of his mercy to so many of his creatures  after this the young priest applied himself to his countryfolks labored to compose them persuaded entreated argued reasoned with them and did his utmost to keep them within the exercise of their reason and with some he had success though others were for a time out of all government of themselves  i cannot help committing this to writing as perhaps it may be useful to those into whose hands it may fall for the guiding themselves in all the extravagances of their passions for if an excess of joy can carry men out to such a length beyond the reach of their reason what will not the extravagancies of anger rage and a provoked mind carry us to and indeed here i saw reason for keeping an exceeding watch over our passions of every kind as well those of joy and satisfaction as those of sorrow and anger  we were something disordered by these extravagancies among our new guests for the first day but when they had been retired lodgings provided for them as well as our ship would allow and they had slept heartily as most of them did they were quite another sort of people the next day  nothing of good manners or civil acknowledgments for the kindness shown them was wanting the french it is known are naturally apt enough to exceed that way the captain and one of the priests came to me the next day and desiring to speak with me and my nephew the commander began to consult with us what should be done with them and first they told us that as we had saved their lives so all they had was little enough for a return to us for that kindness received the captain said they had saved some money and some things of value in their boats caught hastily out of the flames and if we would accept it they were ordered to make an offer of it all to us they only desired to be set on shore somewhere in our way where if possible they might get passage to france  my nephew was for accepting their money at first word and to consider what to do with them afterward but i overruled him in that part for i knew what it was to be set on shore ina strange country and if the portugal captain that took me up at sea had served me so and took all i had for my deliverance i must have starved or have been as much a slave at the brasils as i had been in barbary the mere being sold to a mohammedan excepted and perhaps a portuguese is not much a better master than a turk if not in some cases a much worse  i therefore told the french captain that we had taken them up in their distress it was true but that it was our duty to do so as we were fellow creatures and as we would desire to be so delivered if we were in the like or any other extremity that we had done nothing for them but what we believed they would have done for us if we had been in their case and they in ours but that we took them up to save them not to plunder them and it would be a most barbarous thing to take that little from them which they saved out of the fire and then set them on shore and leave them that this would be first to save them from death and then kill them our selves save them from drowning and abandon them to starving and therefore i would not let the least thing be taken from them as to setting them on shore i told them indeed that was an exceeding difficulty to us for that the ship was bound to the east indies and though we were driven out of our course to the westward a very great way and perhaps was directed by heaven on purpose for their deliverance yet it was impossible for us wilfully to change our voyage on this particular account nor could my nephew the captain answer it to the freighters with whom he was under charterparty to pursue his voyage by the way of brasil and all i knew we could do for them was to put our selves in the way of meeting with other ships homeward bound from the west indies and get them passage if possible to england or france  the first part of the proposal was so generous and kind they could not but be very thankful for it but they were in a very great consternation especially the passengers at the notion of being carried away to the east indies and they then entreated me that seeing i was driven so far to the westward before i met with them i would at least keep on the same course to the banks of newfoundland where it was probable i might meet with some ship or sloop that they might hire to carry them back to canada from whence they came  i thought this was but a reasonable request on their part and therefore i inclined to agree to it for indeed i considered that to carry this whole company to the east indies would not only be an intolerable severity upon the poor people but would be ruining our whole voyage by devouring all our provisions so i thought it no breach of charterparty but what an unforeseen accident made absolutely necessary to us and in which no one could say we were to blame for the laws of god and nature would have forbid that we should refuse to take up two boats full of people in such a distressed condition and the nature of the thing as well respecting our selves as the poor people obliged us to set them on shore some where or other for their deliverance so i consented that we would carry them to newfoundland if wind and weather would permit and if not that i would carry them to martinico in the west indies  the wind continued fresh easterly but the weather pretty good and as the winds had continued in the points between ne and se a long time we missed several opportunities of sending them to france for we met several ships bound to europe whereof two were french from st christophers but they had been so long beating up against the wind that they durst take in no passengers for fear of wanting provisions for the voyage as well for themselves as for those they should take in so we were obliged to go on it was about a week after this that we made the banks of newfoundland where to shorten my story we put all our french people on board a bark which they hired at sea there to put them on shore and afterward to carry them to france if they could get provision to victual themselves with when i say all the french went on shore i should remember that the young priest i spoke of hearing we were bound to the east indies desired to go the voyage with us and to be set on shore on the coast of coromandel which i readily agreed to for i wonderfully liked the man and had very good reason as will appear afterward also four of the seamen entered themselves on our ship and proved very useful fellows  from hence we directed our course for the west indies steering away s and s by e for about twenty days together sometimes little or no wind at all when we met with another subject for our humanity to work upon almost as deplorable as that before  it was in the latitude of    degrees   minutes north and the   th day of march       when we spyd a sail our course se and by s we soon perceived it was a large vessel and that she bore up to us but could not at first know what to make of her till after coming a little nearer we found she had lost her maintopmast foremast and boltsprit and presently she fired a gun as a signal of distress the weather was pretty good wind at nnw a fresh gale and we soon came to speak with her  we found her a ship of bristol bound home from barbados but had been blown out of the road at barbados a few days before she was ready to sail by a terrible hurricane while the captain and chief mate were both gone on shore so that beside the terror of the storm they were but in an indifferent case for good artists to bring the ship home they had been already nine weeks at sea and had met with another terrible storm after the hurricane was over which had blown them quite out of their knowledge to the westward and in which they lost their masts as above they told us they expected to have seen the bahama islands but were then driven away again to the south east by a strong gale of wind at nnw the same that blew now and having no sails to work the ship with but a main course and a kind of square sail upon a jury foremast which they had set up they could not lie near the wind but were endeavoring to stand away for the canaries  but that which was worst of all was that they were almost starved for want of provisions besides the fatigues they had undergone their bread and flesh was quite gone they had not one ounce left in the ship and had had none for eleven days the only relief they had was their water was not all spent and they had about half a barrel of flower left they had sugar enough some succades or sweetmeats they had at first but they were devoured and they had seven casks of rum  there was a youth and his mother and a maidservant on board who were going passengers and thinking the ship was ready to sail unhappily came on board the evening before the hurricane began and having no provisions of their own left they were in a more deplorable condition than the rest for the seamen being reduced to such an extreme necessity themselves had no compassion we may be sure for the poor passengers and they were indeed in a condition that their misery is very hard to describe  i had perhaps not known this part if my curiosity had not led me the weather being fair and the wind abated to go on board the ship the second mate who upon this occasion commanded the ship had been on board our ship and he told me me indeed they had three passengers in the great cabin that they were in a deplorable condition nay says he i believe they are dead for i have heard nothing of them for above two days and i was afraid to enquire after them said he for i had nothing to relieve them with  we immediately applied our selves to give them what relief we could spare and indeed i had so far overruled things with my nephew that i would have victualld them though we had gone away to virginia or any part of the coast of america to have supplied our selves but there was no necessity for that  but now they were in a new danger for they were afraid of eating too much even of that little we gave them the mate or commander brought six men with him in his boat but these poor wretches looked like skeletons and were so weak they could hardly sit to their oars the mate himself was very ill and half starved for he declared he had reserved nothing from the men and went share and share alike with them in every bit they eat  i cautioned him to eat sparingly but set meat before him immediately and he had not eaten three mouthfuls before he began to be sick and out of order so he stopped a while and our surgeon mixed him up something with some broth which he said would be to him both food and physic and after he had taken it he grew better in the mean time i forgot not the men i ordered victuals to be given them and the poor creatures rather devoured than eat it they were so exceeding hungry that they were in a kind ravenous and had no command of themselves and two of them eat with so much greediness that they were in danger of their lives the next morning  the sight of these peoples distress was very moving to me and brought to mind what i had a terrible prospect of at my first coming on shore in the island where i had neither the least mouthful of food or any prospect of procuring any besides the hourly apprehension i had of being made the food of other creatures but all the while the mate was thus relating to me the miserable condition of the ships company i could not put out of my thought the story he had told me of the three poor creatures in the great cabin viz the mother her son and the maidservant who he had heard nothing of for two or three days and who he seemed to confess they had wholly neglected their own extremities being so great by which i understood that they had really given them no food at all and that therefore they must be perished and be all lying dead perhaps on the floor or deck of the cabin  as i therefore kept the mate who we then called captain on board with his men to refresh them so i also forgot not the starving crew that were left on board but ordered my own boat to go on board the ship and with my mate and twelve men to carry them a sack of bread and four or five pieces of beef to boil our surgeon charged the men to cause the meat to be boiled while they stayed and to keep guard in the cookroom to prevent the men taking it to eat raw or taking it out of the pot before it was well boiled and then to give every man but a very little at a time and by this caution he preserved the men who would otherwise have killed themselves with that very food that was given them on purpose to save their lives  at the same time i ordered the mate to go into the great cabin and see what condition the poor passengers were in and if they were alive to comfort them and give them what refreshment was proper and the surgeon gave him a large pitcher with some of the prepared broth which he had given the mate that was on board and which he did not question would restore them gradually  i was not satisfied with this but as i said above having a great mind to see the scene of misery which i knew the ship itself would present me with in a more lively manner than i could have it by report i took the captain of the ship as we now called him with me and went myself a little after in their boat  i found the poor men on board almost in a tumult to get the victuals out of the boyler before it was ready but my mate observed his order and kept a good guard at the cookroom door and the man he placed there after using all possible persuasion to have patience kept them off by force however he caused some biscuit cakes to be dipped in the pot and softened with the liquor of the meat which they call brews and gave them every one one to stay their stomachs and told them it was for their own safety that he was obliged to give them but a little at a time but it was all in vain and had i not come on board and their own commander and officers with me and with good words and some threats also of giving them no more i believe they would have broke into the cookroom by force and tore the meat out of the furnace for words are indeed of very small force to a hungry belly however we pacified them and fed them gradually and cautiously for the first time and the next time gave them more and at last filled their bellies and the men did well enough  but the misery of the poor passengers in the cabin was of another nature and far beyond the rest for as first the ships company had so little for themselves it was but too true that they had at first kept them very low and at last totally neglected them so that for six or seven days it might be said they had really had no food at all and for several days before very little the poor mother who as the men reported was a woman of good sense and good breeding had spared all she could get so affectionately for her son that at last she entirely sunk under it and when the mate of our ship went in she sat upon the floor or deck with her back up against the sides between two chairs which were lashed fast and her head sunk in between her shoulders like a corpse though not quite dead my mate said all he could to revive and encourage her and with a spoon put some broth into her mouth she opened her lips and lifted up one hand but could not speak yet she understood what he said and made signs to him intimating that it was too late for her but pointed to her child as if she would have said they should take care of him  however the mate who was exceedinglymovd with the sight endeavored to get some of the broth into her mouth and as he said got two or three spoonfuls down though i question whether he could be sure of it or not but it was too late and she died the same night  the youth who was preserved at the price of his most affectionate mothers life was not so far gone yet he lay in a cabin bed as one stre chd out with hardly any life left in him he had a piece of an old glove in his mouth having eaten up the rest of it however being young and having more strength than his mother the mate got something down his throat and he began sensibly to revive though by giving him some time after but two or three spoonfuls extraordinary he was very sick and brought it up again  but the next care was the poor maid she lay all along upon the deck hard by her mistress and just like one that had fallen down with an apoplexy and struggled for life her limbs where distorted one of her hands was clasped round the frame of a chair and she gripped it so hard that we could not easily make her let go her other arm lay over her head and her feet lay both together set fast against the frame of the cabin table in short she lay just like one in the last agonies of death and yet she was alive too  the poor creature was not only starved with hunger and terrified with the thoughts of death but as the men told us afterward was brokenhearted for her mistress who she saw dying for two or three days before and who she loved most tenderly  we knew not what to do with this poor girl for when our surgeon who was a man of very great knowledge and experience had with great application recovered her as to life he had her upon his hand as to her senses for she was little less than distracted for a considerable time after as shall appear presently  whoever shall read these memorandums must be desired to consider that visits at sea are not like a journey into the country where sometimes people stay a week or a fortnight at a place our business was to relieve this distressed ships crew but not to lie by for them and though they were willing to steer the same course with us for some days yet we could carry no sail to keep pace with a ship that had no masts however as their captain begged of us to help him to set up a maintopmast and a kind of a topmast to his jury foremast we did as it were lie by him for three or four days and then having given him five barrels of beef a barrel of pork two hogsheads of biscuit and a proportion of peace flour and what other things we could spare and taking three casks of sugar some rum and some pieces of eight of them for satisfaction we left them taking on board with us at their own earnest request the priest the youth and the maid and all their goods  the young lad was about seventeen years of age a pretty wellbred modest and sensible youth greatly dejected with the loss of his mother and as it seems had lost his father but a few months before at berbadoes he begged of the surgeon to speak to me to take him out of the ship for he said the cruel fellows had murdered his mother and indeed so they had that is to say passively for they might have spared a small sustenance to the poor helpless widow that might have preserved her life though it had been but just to keep her alive but hunger knows no friend no relation no justice no right and therefore is remorseless and capable of no compassion  the surgeon told him how far we were going and how it would carry him away from all his friends and put him perhaps in as bad circumstances almost as those we found him in that is to say starving in the world he said he mattered not whether he went if he was but delivered from the terrible crew he was among that the captain by which he meant me for he could know nothing of my nephew had saved his life and he was sure would not hurt him and as for the maid he was sure if she came to herself she would be very thankful for it let us carry them where we would the surgeon represented the case so affectionately to me that i yielded and we took them both on board with all their goods except eleven hogsheads of sugar which could not be removed or come at and as the youth had a bill of lading for them i made his commander sign a writing obliging himself to go as soon as he came to bristol to one mr rogers a merchant there to whom the youth said he was related and to deliver a letter which i wrote to him and all the goods he had belonging to the deceased widow which i suppose was not done for i could never learn that the ship came to bristol but was as is most probable lost at sea being in so disabled a condition and so far from any land that i am of opinion the first storm she met with afterward she might founder in the sea for she was leaky and had damage in her hold when we met with her  i was now in the latitude of    degrees    min and had hitherto had a tolerable voyage as to weather though at first the winds had been contrary i shall trouble no body with the little incidents of wind weather currents etc on the rest of our voyage but shortning my story for the sake of what is to follow shall observe that i came to my old habitation the island on the  0th of april      it was with no small difficulty that i found the place for as i came to it and went from it before on the south and east side of the island as coming from the brasils so now coming in between the main and the island and having no chart for the coast nor any landmark i did not know it when i saw it or know whether i saw it or no  we beat about a great while and went on shore on several islands on the mouth of the great river oronooque but none for my purpose only this i learned by my coasting the shore that i was under one great mistake before viz that the continent which i thought i saw from the island i lived in was really no continent but a long island or rather a ridge of islands reaching from one to the other side of the extended mouth of that great river and that the savages who came to my island were not properly those which we call caribbees but islanders and other barbarians of the same kind who inhabited something nearer to our side than the rest  in short i visited several of these islands to no purpose some i found were inhabited and some were not on one of them i found some spaniards and thought they had lived there but speaking with them found they had a sloop lay in a small creek hard by and they came thither to make salt and to catch some pearl mussles if they could but that they belonged to the isle de trinidad which lay farther north in the latitude of  and    degrees  but at last coasting from one island to another sometimes with the ship sometimes with the french mans shalloup which we had found a convenient boat and therefore kept her with their very good will at length i came fair on the south side of my island and i presently knew the very countenance of the place so i brought the ship safe to an anchor broadside with the little creek where was my old habitation  as soon as i saw the place i called for friday and asked him if he knew where he was he looked about a little and presently clapping his hands cried o yes o there o yes o there pointing to our old habitation and fell a dancing and capering like a mad fellow and i had much ado to keep him from jumping into the sea to swim ashore to the place  well friday says i do you think we shall find any body here or no and what do you think shall we see your father the fellow stood mute as a stock a good while but when i named his father the poor affectionate creature looked dejected and i could see the tears run down his face very plentifully what is the matter friday says i are you troubled because you may see your father no no says he shaking his head no see him more no ever more see again why so said i friday how do you know that o no o no says friday he long ago die long ago he much old man well well says i friday you dont know but shall we see any one else then the fellow it seems had better eyes than i and he points just to the hill above my old house and though we lay half a league off he cries out we see we see yes we see much men there and there and there i looked but i could see no body no not with a perspective glass which was i suppose because i could not hit the place for the fellow was right as i found upon enquiry the next day and there was five or six men altogether stood to look at the ship not knowing what to think of us  as soon as friday had told me he saw people i caused the english ancient to be spread and fired three guns to give them notice we were friends and in about half a quarter of an hour after we perceived a smoke rise from the side of the creek so i immediately ordered a boat out taking friday with me and hanging out a white flag or flag of truce i went directly on shore taking with me the young friar i mentioned to whom i had told the whole story of my living there and the manner of it and every particular both of my self and those i left there and who was on that account extremely desirous to go with me we had besides about sixteen men very well armed if we had found any new guests there which we did not know of but we had no need of weapons  as we went on shore upon the tide of flood near high water we rowed directly into the creek and the first man i fixed my eye upon was the spaniard whole life i had saved and who i knew by his face perfectly well as to his habit i shall describe it afterward i ordered no body to go on shore at first but my self but there was no keeping friday in the boat for the affectionate creature had spied his father at a distance a good way off of the spaniards where indeed i saw nothing of him and if they had not let him go on shore he would have jumped into the sea he was no sooner on shore but he flew away to his father like an arrow out of a bow it would have made any man have shed tears in spite of the firmest resolution to have seen the first transports of this poor fellows joy when he came to his father how he embraced him kissed him strokd his face took him up in his arms set him down upon a tree and lay down by him then stood and looked at him as any one would look at a strange picture for a quarter of an hour together then lie down on the ground and stroke his legs and kiss them and then get up again and stare at him one would have thought the fellow bewitched but it would have made a dog laugh to see how the next day his passion run out another way in the morning he walked along the shore to and again with his father several hours always leading him by the hand as if he had been a lady and every now and then he would come to fetch something or other for him to the boat either a lump of sugar or a dram a biscuit cake or something or other that was good in the afternoon his frolicks run another way for then he would set the old man down upon the ground and dance about him and make a thousand antic postures and gestures and all the while he did this he would be talking to him and telling him one story or another of his travels and of what had happened to him abroad to divert him in short if the same filial affection was to be found in christians to their parents in our part of the world one would be tempted to say there would hardly have been any need of the fifth commandment  but this is a digression i return to my landing it would be endless to take notice of all the ceremonies and civilities that the spaniards received me with the first spaniard who as i said i knew very well was he whose life i had saved he came toward the boat attended by one more carrying a flag of truce also and he did not only not know me at first but he had no thoughts no notion of its being me that was come till i spoke to him seignior said i in portuguese do you not know me at which he spoke not a word but giving his musket to the man that was with him threw his arms abroad and saying something in spanish that i did not perfectly hear comes forward and embraced me telling me he was inexcusable not to know that face again that he had once seen as of an angel from heaven sent to save his life he said abundance of very handsome things as a well bred spaniard always knows how and then beckoning to the person that attended him bad him go and call out his comerades he then asked me if i would walk to my old habitation where he would give me possession of my own house again and where i should see there had been but mean improvements so i walked along with him but alas i could no more find the place again than if i had never been there for they had planted so many trees and placed them in such a posture so thick and close to one another and in ten years time they were grown so big that in short the place was inaccessible except by such windings and blind ways as they themselves only who made them could find  i asked them what put them upon all these fortifications he told me i would say there was need enough of it when they had given me an account how they had passed their time since their arriving in the island especially after they had the misfortune to find that i was gone he told me he could not but have some satisfaction in my good fortune when he heard that i was gone away in a good ship and to my satisfaction and that he had oftentimes a strong persuasion that one time or other he should see me again but nothing that ever befell him in his life he said was so surprising and afflicting to him at first as the disappointment he was under when he came back to the island and found i was not there  as to the three barbarians so he called them that were left behind and of whom he said he had a long story to tell me the spaniards all thought themselves much better among the savages only that their number was so small and says he had they been strong enough we had been all long ago in purgatory and with that he crossed himself on the breast but sir says he i hope you will not be displeased when i shall tell you how forced by necessity we were obliged for our own preservation to disarm them and make them our subjects who would not be content with being moderately our masters but would be our murderers i answered i was heartily afraid of it when i left them there and nothing troubled me at my parting from the island but that they were not come back that i might have put them in possession of every thing first and left the other in a state of subjection as they deserved but if they had reduced them to it i was very glad and should be very far from finding any fault with it for i knew they were a parcel of refractory ungoverned villains and were fit for any manner of mischief  while i was saying this came the man whom he had sent back and with him eleven men more in the dress they were in it was impossible to guess what nation they were of but he made all clear both to them and to me first he turned to me and pointing to them said these sir are some of the gentlemen who owe their lives to you and then turning to them and pointing to me he let them know who i was upon which they all came up one by one not as if they had been sailors and ordinary fellows and i the like but really as if they had been ambassadors of noblemen and i a monarch or a great conqueror their behavior was to the last degree obliging and courteous and yet mixed with a manly majestic gravity which very well became them and in short they had so much more manners than i that i scarce knew how to receive their civilities much less how to return them in kind  the history of their coming to and conduct in the island after my going away is so very remarkable and has so many incidents which the former part of my relation will help to understand and which will in most of the particulars refer to that account i have already given that i cannot but commit them with great delight to the reading of those that come after me  i shall no longer trouble the story with a relation in the first person which will put me to the expense of ten thousand said is and said he is and he told mes and i told hims and the like but i shall collect the facts historically as near as i can gather them out of my memory from what they related to me and from what i met with in my conversing with them and with the place  in order to do this succinctly and as intelligibly as i can i must go back to the circumstance in which i left the island and in which the persons were of whom i am to speak and first it is necessary to repeat that i had sent away fridays father and the spaniard the two whose lives i had rescued from the savages i say i had sent them away in a large canoe to the main as i then thought it to fetch over the spaniards companions who he had left behind him in order to save them from the like calamity that he had been in and in order to succor them for the present and that if possible we might together find some way for our deliverance afterward  when i sent them away i had no visible appearance of or the least room to hope for my own deliverance any more than i had twenty year before much less had i any fore knowledge of what afterward happened i mean of an english ship coming on shore there to fetch me off and it could not but be a very great surprise to them when they came back not only to find that i was gone but to find three strangers left on the spot possessed of all that i had left behind me which would otherwise have been their own  the first thing however which i inquired into that i might begin where i left off was of their own part and i desired he would give me a particular account of his voyage back to his countrymen with the boat when i sent him to fetch them over he told me there was little variety in that part for nothing remarkable happened to them on the way they having very calm weather and a smooth sea for his countrymen it could not be doubted he said but that they were overjoyed to see him it seems he was the principal man among them the captain of the vessel they had been shipwrecked in having been dead some time they were he said the more surprised to see him because they knew that he was fallen into the hands of the savages who they were satisfied would devour him as they did all the rest of the prisoners that when he told them the story of his deliverance and in what manner he was furnished for carrying them away it was like a dream to them and their astonishment they said was something like that of josephs brethren when he told them who he was and told them the story of his exaltation in pharaohs court but when he showed them the arms the powder the ball and the provisions that he brought them for their journey or voyage they were restored to themselves took a just share of the joy of their deliverance and immediately prepared to come away with him  their first business was to get canoes and in this they were obliged not to stick so much upon the honest part of it but to trespass upon their friendly savages and to borrow two large canoes or periaguas on pretense of going out a fishing or for pleasure  in these they came away the next morning it seems they wanted no time to get themselves ready for they had no baggage neither clothes or provisions or any thing in the world but what they had on them and a few roots to eat of which they used to make their bread  they were in all three weeks absent and in that time unluckily for them i had the occasion offered for my escape as i mentioned in my other part and to get off from the island leaving three of the most impudent hardened ungoverned disagreeable villains behind me that any man could desire to meet with to the poor spaniards great grief and disappointment you may be sure  the only just thing the rogues did was that when the spaniards came on shore they gave my letter to them and gave them provisions and other relief as i had ordered them to do also they gave them the long paper of directions which i had left with them containing the particular methods which i took for managing every part of my life there the way how i baked my bread bred up tame goats and planted my corn how i cured my grapes made my pots and in a word every thing i did all this being written down they gave to the spaniards two of whom understand english well enough nor did they refuse to accommodate the spaniards with every thing else for they agreed very well for some time they gave them an equal admission into the house or cave and they began to live very sociably and the head spaniard who had seen pretty much of my methods and fridays father together managed all their affairs for as for the english men they did nothing but ramble about the island shoot parrots and catch tortoises and when they came home at night the spaniards provided their suppers for them  the spaniards would have been satisfied with this would the other but have let them alone which however they could not find in their hearts to do long but like the dog in the manger they would not eat themselves and would not let others eat neither the differences nevertheless were at first but trivial and such as are not worth relating but at last it broke out into open war and it begun with all the rudeness and insolence that can be imagined without reason without provocation contrary to nature and indeed to common sense and though it is true the first relation of it came from the spaniards themselves who i may call the accusers yet when i came to examine the fellows they could not deny a word of it  but before i come to the particulars of this part i must supply a defect in my former relation and this was that i forgot to set down among the rest that just as we were weighing the anchor to set sail there happened a little quarrel on board our ship which i was afraid once would have turned to a second mutiny nor was it appeased till the captain rouzing up his courage and taking us all to his assistance parted them by force and making two of the most refractory fellows prisoners he laid them in irons and as they had been active in the former disorders and let fall some ugly dangerous words the second time he threatened to carry them in irons to england and have them hanged there for mutiny and running away with the ship  this it seems though the captain did not intend to do it frighted some other men in the ship and some of them had put it into the heads of the rest that the captain only gave them good words for the present till they should come to some english port and that then they should be all put into jayl and tried for their lives  the mate got intelligence of this and acquainted us with it upon which it was desired that i who still passed for a great man among them should go down with the mate and satisfy the men and tell them that they might be assured if they behaved well the rest of the voyage all they had done for the time past should be pardoned so i went and after passing my honors word to them they appeared easy and the more so when i caused the two men who were in irons to be released and forgiven  but this mutiny had brought us to an anchor for that night the wind also falling calm next morning we found that our two men who had been laid in irons had stole each of them a musket and some other weapons what powder or shot they had we know not and had taken the ships pinnace which was not yet had up and ran away with her to their companions in roguery on shore  as soon as we found this i ordered the longboat on shore with twelve men and the mate and away they went to seek the rogues but they could neither find them or any of the rest for they all fled into the woods when they saw the boat coming on shore the mate was once resolved in justice to their roguery to have destroyed their plantations burnt all their household stuff and furniture and left them to shift without it but having no order he let it all alone left every thing as they found it and bringing the pinnace away came on board without them  these two men made their number five but the other three villains were so much wickeder than these that after they had been   or   days together they turned their two newcomers out of doors to shift for themselves and would have nothing to do with them nor could they for a good while be persuaded to give them any food as for the spaniards they were not yet come  when the spaniards came first on shore the business began to go forward the spaniards would have persuaded the three english brutes to have taken in their two countrymen again that as they said they might be all one family but they would not hear of it so the two poor fellows lived by themselves and finding nothing but industry and application would make them live comfortably they pitched their tents on the north shore of the island but a little more to the west to be out of the danger of the savages who always landed on the east parts of the island  here they built them two huts one to lodge in and the other to lay up their magazines and stores in and the spaniards having given them some corn for seed and especially some of the peace which i had left them they dug and planted and enclosed after the pattern i had set for them all and began to live pretty well their first crop of corn was on the ground and though it was but a little bit of land which they had dug up at first having had but a little time yet it was enough to relieve them and find them with bread and other eatables and one of the fellows being the cooks mate of the ship was very ready at making soup puddings and such other preparations as the rice and the milk and such little flesh as they got furnished him to do  they were going on in this little thriving posture when the three unnatural rogues their own country men too in mere humor and to insult them came and bullyd them and told them the island was theirs that the governor meaning me had given them possession of it and no body else had any right to it and damn em they should build no houses upon their ground unless they would pay them rent for them  the two men thought they had jested at first asked them to come in and sit down and see what fine houses they were that they had built and tell them what rent they demanded and one of them merrily told them if they were groundlandlords he hoped if they built tenements upon their land and made improvements they would according to the custom of landlords grant them a long lease and bid them go fetch a scrivener to draw the writings one of the three damning and raging told them they should see they were not in jest and going to a little place at a distance where the honest men had made a fire to dress their victuals he takes a firebrand and claps it to the outside of their hut and very fairly set it on fire and it would have been all burnt down in a few minutes if one of the two had not run to the fellow thrust him away and trod the fire out with his feet and that not without some difficulty too  the fellow was in such a rage at the honest mans thrusting him away that he returned upon him with a pole he had in his hand and had not the man avoided the blow very nimbly and run into the hut he had ended his days at once his comerade seeing the danger they were both in run in after him and immediately they came both out with their muskets and the man that was first struck at with the pole knocked the fellow down that begun the quarrel with the stock of his musket and that before the other two could come to help him and then seeing the rest come at them they stood together and presenting the other ends of their pieces to them bad them stand off  the other had firearms with them too but one of the two honest men bolder than his comerade and made desperate by his danger told them if they offered to move hand or foot they were dead men and boldly commanded them to lay down their arms they did not indeed lay down their arms but seeing him so resolute it brought them to a parley and they consented to take their wounded man with them and be gone and indeed it seems the fellow was wounded sufficiently with the blow however they were much in the wrong since they had the advantage that they did not disarm them effectually as they might have done and have gone immediately to the spaniards and given them an account how the rogues had treated them for the three villains studied nothing but revenge and every day gave them some intimation that they did so  but not to crowd this part with an account of the lesser part of their rogueries such as treading down their corn shooting three young kids and a shegoat which the poor men had got to breed up tame for their store and in a word plaguing them night and day in this manner it forced the two men to such a desperation that they resolved to fight them all three the first time they had a fair opportunity in order to this they resolved to go the castle as they called it that was my old dwelling where the three rogues and the spaniards all lived together at that time intending to have a fair battle and the spaniards should stand by to see fair play so they got up in the morning before day and came to the place and called the english men by their names telling a spaniard that answered that that they wanted to speak with them  it happened that the day before two of the spaniards having been in the woods had seen one of the two english men who for distinction i call the honest men and he had made a sad complaint to the spaniards of the barbarous usage they had met with from their three countrymen and how they had ruined their plantation and destroyed their corn that they had labored so hard to bring forward and killed the milchgoat and their three kids which was all they had provided for their sustenance and that if he and his friends meaning the spaniards did not assist them again they should be starved when the spaniards came home at night and they were all at supper he took the freedom to reprove the three english men though in very gentle and mannerly terms and asked them how they could be so cruel they being harmless inoffensive fellows and that they were only putting themselves in a way to subsist by their labor and that it had cost them a great deal of pains to bring things to such perfection as they had  one of the english men returned very briskly what had they to do there that they came on shore without leave and they should not plant or build upon the island it was none of their ground why says the spaniard very calmly seignior inglese they must not starve the english man replied like a true roughhewn tarpaulin they might starve and be damned they should not plant nor build but what must they do then seignior said the spaniard another of the brutes returned do dm em they should be servants and work for them but how can you expect that of them says the spaniard they are not bought with your money you have no right to make them servants the english man answered the island was theirs the governor had given it to them and no man had any thing to do there but themselves and with that swore by his maker that they would go and burn all their new huts they should build none upon their land  why seignior says the spaniard by the same rule we must be your servants too ay says the bold dog and so you shall too before we have done with you mixing two or three gd dammes in the proper intervales of his speech the spaniard only smiled at that and made him no answer however this little discourse had heated them and starting up one says to the other i think it was he they called will atkins come jack let us go and have the other brush with them well demolish their castle i will warrant you they shall plant no colony in our dominions  upon this they went all trooping away with every man a gun a pistol and a sword and muttered some insolent things among themselves of what they would do to the spaniards too when opportunity offered but the spaniards it seems did not so perfectly understand them as to know all the particulars only that in general they threatened them hard for taking the two english mens part  whether they went or how they bestowed their time that evening the spaniards said they did not know but it seems they wandered about the country part of the night and then lying down in the place which i used to call my bower they were weary and overslept themselves the case was this they had resolved to stay till midnight and so to take the two poor men when they were asleep and as they acknowledged afterward intended to set fire to their huts while they were in them and either burn them in them or murder them as they came out and as malice seldom sleeps very sound it was very strange they should not have been kept waking  however as the two men had also a design upon them as i have said though a much fairer one than that of burning and murdering it happened and very luckily for them all that they were up and gone abroad before the bloodyminded rogues came to their huts  when they came there and found the men gone atkins who it seems was the forwardest man called out to his comerades ha jack here is the nest but dn em the birds are flown they mused a while to think what should be the occasion of their being gone abroad so soon and suggested presently that the spaniards had given them notice of it and with that they shook hands and swore to one another that they would be revenged of the spaniards as soon as they had made this bloody bargain they fell to work with the poor mens habitation they did not set fire indeed to any thing but they pulled down both their little houses and pulled them so limb from limb that they left not the least stick standing or scarce any sign on the ground where they stood they tore all their little collected household stuff in pieces and threw every thing about in such a manner that the poor men afterward found some of their things a mile off their habitation  when they had done this they pulled up all the young trees the poor men had planted pulled up an enclosure they had made to secure their cattle and their corn and in a word sacked and plundered every thing as completely as a hoord of tartars would have done  the two men were at this juncture gone to find them out and had resolved to fight them wherever they had been though they were but two to three so that had they met there certainly would have been blood shed among them for they were all very stout resolute fellows to give them their due  but providence took more care to keep them assunder than they themselves could do to meet for as if they had dogged one another when the three were gone thither the two were here and afterward when the two went back to find them the three were come to the old habitation again we shall see their differing conduct presently when the three came back like furious creatures flushed with the rage which the work they had been about had put them into they came up to the spaniards and told them what they had done by way of scoff and bravado and one of them stepping up to one of the spaniards as if they had been a couple of boys at play takes hold of his hat as it was upon his head and giving it a twirl about fleering in his face says he to him and you seignior jack spaniard shall have the same sauce if you do not mend your manners the spaniard who though a quiet civil man was as brave as a man could be desired to be and withal a strong wellmade man looked steadily at him for a good while and then having no weapon in his hand slept gravely up to him and with one blow of his fist knocked him down as an ox is felled with a poleaxe at which one of the rogues insolent at the first fired his pistol at the spaniard immediately he missed his body indeed for the bullets went through his hair but one of them touched the tip of his ear and he bled pretty much the blood made the spaniard believe he was more hurt then he really was and that put him into some heat for before he acted all in a perfect calm but now resolving to go through with his work he stooped to take the fellows musket who he had knocked down and was just going to shoot the man and had fired at him when the rest of the spaniards being in the cave came out and calling to him not to shoot they stepped in secured the other two and took their arms from them  when they were thus disarmed and found they had made all the spaniards their enemies as well as their own countrymen they began to cool and giving the spaniards better words would have had their arms again but the spaniards considering the feud that was between them and the other two english men and that it would be the best method they could take to keep them from one another told them they would do them no harm and if they would live peaceably they would be very willing to assist and sociate with them as they did before but that they could not think of giving them their arms again while they appeared so resolved to do mischief with them to their own countrymen and had even threatened them all to make them their servants  the rogues were now no more capable to hear reason than to act reason and being refused their arms they went raving away and raging like mad men threatening what they would do though they had no firearms but the spaniards despising their threatening told them they should take care how they offered any injury to their plantation or cattle for if they did they would shoot them as they would do ravenous beasts wherever they found them and if they fell into their hands alive they should certainly be hanged however this was far from cooling them but away they went raging and swearing like furies of hell as soon as they were gone came back the two men in passion and rage enough also though of another kind for having been at their plantation and finding it all demolished and destroyed as above it will easily be supposed they had provocation enough they could scarce have room to tell their tale the spaniards were so eager to tell them theirs and it was strange enough to find three men thus bully nineteen and receive no punishment at all  the spaniards indeed despised them and especially having thus disarmed them made light of all their threatenings but the two english men resolved to have their remedy against them what pain soever it cost to find them out  but the spaniards interposed here too and told them that as they had disarmed them they could not consent that they the two should pursue them with firearms and perhaps kill them but said the grave spaniard who was their governor we will endeavor to make them do you justice if you will leave it to us for as there is no doubt but they will come to us again when their passion is over being not able to subsist without our assistance we promise you to make no peace with them without having a full satisfaction for you upon this condition we hope you will promise to use no violence with them other than in your own defense  the two english men yielded to this very awkardly and with great reluctance but the spaniards protested they did it only to keep them from bloodshed and to make all easy at last for said they we are not so many of us here is room enough for us all and it is great pity we should not be all good friends at length they did consent and waited for the issue of the thing living for some days with the spaniards for their own habitation was destroyed  in about five days time the three vagrants tired with wandering and almost starved with hunger having chiefly lived on turtles eggs all that while came back to the grove and finding my spaniard who as i have said was the governor and two more with him walking by the side of the creek they came up in a very submissive humble manner and begged to be received again into the family the spaniards used them civilly but told them they had acted so unnaturally by their countrymen and so very grossly by them the spaniards that they could not come to any conclusion without consulting the two english men and the rest but however they would go to them and discourse about it and they should know in half an hour it may de guessed that they were very hard put to it for it seems as they were to wait this half hour for an answer they begged they would send them out some bread in the mean time which he did and sent them at the same time a large piece of goats flesh and a broiled parrot which they eat very heartily for they were hungry enough  after half an hours consultation they were called in and a long debate had among them their two countrymen charging them with the ruin of all their labor and a design to murder them all which they owned before and therefore could not deny now upon the whole the spaniard acted the moderator between them and as they had obliged the two english men not to hurt the three while they were naked and unarmed so they now obliged the three to go and build their fellows two huts one of the same and the other of larger dimensions than they were before to fence their ground again where they had pulled up the fences plant trees in the room of those pulled up dig up the land again for planting corn where they had spoiled it and in a word to restore every thing in the same state as they found it as near as they could for entirely it could not be the season for the corn and the growth of the trees and hedges not being possible to be recovered  well they submitted to all this and as they had plenty of provisions given them all the while they grew very orderly and the whole society began to live pleasantly and agreeably together only that these three fellows could never be persuaded to work i mean for themselves except now and then a little just as they pleased however the spaniards told them plainly that if they would but live sociably and friendly together and study in the whole the good of the plantation they would be content to work for them and let them walk about and be as idle as they pleased and thus having lived pretty well together for a month or two the spaniards gave them arms again and give them liberty to go abroad with them as before  it was not above a week after they had these arms and went abroad but the ungrateful creatures began to be as insolent and troublesome as before but however an accident happening presently upon this which endangered the safety of them all they were obliged to lay by all private resentments and look to the preservation of their lives  it happened one night that the spaniard governor as i call him that is to say the spaniard whose life i had saved who was now the captain or leader or governor of the rest found himself very uneasy in the night and could by no means get any sleep he was perfectly well in body as he told me the story only found his thoughts tumultuous his mind run upon men fighting and killing of one another but was broad awake and could not by any means get any sleep in short he lay a great while but growing more and more uneasy he resolved to rise as they lay being so many of them upon goat skins laid thick upon such couches and pads as they made for themselves not in hammocks and shipbeds as i did who was but one so they had little to do when they were willing to rise but to get up upon their feet and perhaps put on a coat such as it was and their pumps and they were ready for going any way that their thoughts guided them  being thus gotten up he looked out but being dark he could see little or nothing and besides the trees which i had planted as in my former account is described and which were now grown tall intercepted his sight so that he could only look up and see that it was a clear starlight night and hearing no noise he returned and laid him down again but it was all one he could not sleep nor could he compose himself to any thing like rest but his thoughts were to the last degree uneasy and yet he knew not for what  having made some noise with rising and walking about going out and coming in another of them waked and calling asked who it was that was up the governor told him how it had been with him say you so says the other spaniard such things are not to be slighted i assure there is certainly some mischief working says he near us and presently he asked him where are the english men they are all in their huts says he safe enough it seems the spaniards had kept possession of the main apartment and had made a place where the three english men since their last mutiny always quartered by themselves and could not come at the rest well says the spaniard there is something in it i am persuaded from my own experience i am satisfied our spirits embodied have a converse with and receive intelligence from the spirits unembodied and inhabiting the invisible world and this friendly notice is given for our advantage if we know how to make use of it come says he let us go out and look abroad and if we find nothing at all in it to justify the trouble i will tell you a story to the purpose that shall convince you of the justice of my proposing it  in a word they went out to go to the top of the hill where i used to go but they being strong and in good company not alone as i was used none of my cautions to go up by the ladder and then pulling it up after them to go up a second stage to the top but were going round through the grove unconcerned and unweary when they were surpised with seeing a light as of fire a very little way off from them and hearing the voices of men not of one or two but of a great number  in all the discoveries i had made of the savages landing on the island it was my constant care to prevent them making the least discovery of there being any inhabitant upon the place and when by any occasion they came to know it they felt it so effectually that they that got away were scarce able to give any account of it for we disappeared as soon as possible nor did ever any that had seen me escape to tell any one else except it was the three savages in our last encounter who jumped into the boat of whom i mentioned that i was afraid they should go home and bring more help  whether it was the consequence of the escape of those men that so great a number came now together or whether they came ignorantly and by accident on their usual bloody errand they could not it seems understand but whatever it was it had been their business either to have concealed themselves as not to have seen them at all much less to have let the savages have seen that there were any inhabitants in the place or to have fallen upon them so effectually as that not a man of them should have escaped which could only have been by getting in between them and their boats but this presence of mind was wanting to them which was the ruin of their tranquillity for a great while  we need not doubt but that the governor and the man with him surpised with this sight run back immediately and raised their fellows giving them an account of the imminent danger they were all in and they again as readily took the alarm but it was impossible to persuade them to stay close within where they were but that they must run all out to see how things stood  while it was dark indeed they were well enough and they had opportunity enough for some hours to view them by the light of three fires they had made at a distance from one another what they were doing they knew not and what to do themselves they knew not for first the enemy were too many and secondly they did not keep together but were divided into several parties and were on shore in several places  the spaniards were in no small consternation at this sight and as they found that the fellows ran straggling all over the shore they made no doubt but first or last some of them would chop in upon their habitation or upon some other place where they would see the token of inhabitants and they were in great perplexity also for fear of their flock of goats which would have been little less than starving them if they would have been destroyed so the first thing they resolved upon was to dispatch three men away before it was light viz two spaniards and one englishman to drive all the goats away to the great valley where the cave was and if need were to drive them into the very cave itself  could they have seen the savages all together in one body and at any distance from their canoes they resolved if they had been an hundred of them to have attacked them but that could not be obtained for they were some of them two miles off from the other and as it appeared afterward were of two different nations  and after having mused a great while on the course they should take and beaten their brains in considering their present circumstances they resolved at last while it was dark to send the old savage fridays father out as a spy to learn if possible something concerning them what they came for and what they intended to do the old man readily undertook it and stripping himself quite naked as most of the savages were away he went after he had been gone an hour or two he brings word that he had been among them undiscovered that he found they were two parties and of two several nations who had war with one another and had had a great battle in their own country and that both sides having had several prisoners taken in the fight they were by mere chance landed all in the same island for the devouring their prisoners and making merry but their coming so by chance to the same place had spoiled all their mirth that they were in a great rage at one another and that they were so near that he believed they would fight again as soon as daylight began to appear but he did not perceive that they had any notion of any bodys being on the island but themselves he had hardly made an end of telling his story when they could perceive by the unusual noise they made that the two little armies were engaged in a bloody fight  fridays father used all the arguments he could to persuade our people to lie close and not be seen he told them their safety consisted in it and that they had nothing to do but lie still and the savages would kill one another to their hands and then the rest would go away and it was so to a tittle but it was impossible to prevail especially from the englishmen their curiosity was so importunate upon their prudentials that they must run out and see the battle however they used some caution too viz they did not go openly just by their own dwelling but went farther into the woods and placed themselves to advantage where they might securely see them manage the fight and as they thought not to be seen by them but it seems the savages did see them as we shall find hereafter  the battle was very fierce and if i might believe the englishmen one of them said he could perceive that some of them were men of great bravery of invincible spirits and of great policy in guiding the fight the battle they said held two hours before they could guess which party would be beaten but then that party which was nearest our peoples habitation began to appear weakest and after some time more some of them began to fly and this put our men again into a great consternation least any of those that fled should run into the grove before their dwelling for shelter and thereby involuntarily discover the place and that by consequence the pursuers should do the like in search for them upon this they resolved that they would stand armed within the wall and whoever came into the grove they should sally out over the wall and kill them so that if possible not one should return to give an account of it they ordered also that it should be done with their swords or by knocking them down with the stock of the musket but not by shooting them for fear of the noise  as they expected it fell out three of the routed army fled for life and crossing the creek ran directly into the place not in the least knowing whether they went but running as into a thick wood for shelter the scout they kept to look abroad gave notice of this within with this addition to our mens great satisfaction viz that the conquerors had not pursued them or seen which way they were gone upon this the spaniard governor a man of humanity would not suffer them to kill the three fugitives but sending three men out by the top of the hill ordered them to go round and come in behind them surprise and take them prisoners whichwas done the residue of the conquered people fled to their canoes and got off to sea the victors retired and made no pursuit or very little but drawing themselves into a body together gave two great skreaming shouts which they supposed was by way of triumph and so the fight ended and the same day about three a clock in the afternoon they also marched to their canoes and thus the spaniards had their island again free to themselves their fright was over and they saw no savages in several years after  after they were all gone the spaniards came out of their den and viewing the field of battle they found about two and thirty dead men upon the spot some were killed with great long arrows some of which were found sticking in their bodies but most of them were killed with their great wooden swords sixteen or seventeen of which they found in the field of battle and as many bows with a great many arrows these swords were strange great unweildy things and they must be very strong men that used them most of those men that were killed with them had their heads mashd to pieces as we may say or as we call it in english their brains knocked out and several their arms and legs broken so that it is evident they fight with inexpressible rage and fury we found not one wounded man that was not stone dead for either they stay by their enemy till they have quite killed him or they carry all the wounded men that are not quite dead away with them  this deliverance tamed our englishmen for a great while the sight had filled them with horror and the consequences appeared terrible to the last degree even to them if ever they should fall into the hands of those creatures who would not only kill them as enemies but kill them for food as we kill our cattle and they professed to me that the thoughts of being eaten up like beef or mutton though it was supposed it was not to be till they were dead had something in it so horrible that it nauseated their very stomachs made them sick when they thought of it and filled their minds with such unusual terror that they were not themselves for some weeks after  this as i said tamed even the three english brutes i have been speaking of and for a great while after they were very tractable and went about the common business of their whole society well enough planted sowed reaped and began to be all naturalized to the country but sometime after this they fell all into such measures which brought them into a great deal of trouble  they had taken three prisoners as i had observed and these three being lusty stout young fellows they made them servants and taught them to work for them and as slaves they did well enough but they did not take their measures with them as i did by my man friday viz to begin with them upon the principle of having saved their lives and then instruct them in the rational principles of life much less of religion civilizing and reducing them by kind usage and affectionate arguings but as they gave them their food every day so they gave them their work too and kept them fully employed in drudgery enough but they failed in this by it that they never had them to assist them and fight for them as i had my man friday who was as true to me as the very flesh upon my bones  but to come to the family part being all now good friends for common danger as i said above had effectually reconcil d them they began to consider their general circumstances and the first thing that came under their consideration was whether seeing the savages particularly haunted that side of the island and that there were more remote and retired parts of it equally adapted to their way of living and manifestly to their advantage they should not rather remove their habitation and plant in some more proper place for their safety and especially for the security of their cattle and corn  upon this after long debate it was concluded that they would not remove their habitation because that some time or other they thought they might hear from their governor again meaning me and if i should send any one to seek them i should be sure to direct them to that side where if they should find the place demolished they would conclude the savages had killed us all and we were gone and so our supply would go too  but as to their corn and cattle they agreed to remove them into the valley where my cave was where the land was as proper for both and where indeed there was land enough however upon second thought they altered one part of that resolution too and resolved only to remove part of their cattle thither and plant part of their corn there and so if one part was destroyed the other might be saved and one part of prudence they used which it was very well they did viz that they never trusted those three savages which they had prisoners with knowing anything of the plantation they had made in that valley or of any cattle they had there much less of the cave there which they kept in case of necessity as a safe retreat and whither they carried also the two barrels of powder which i had sent them at my coming away  but however they resolved not to change their habitation yet they agreed that as i had carefully covered it first with a wall or fortification and then with a grove of trees so seeing their safety consisted entirely in their being concealed of which they were now fully convinced they set to work to cover and conceal the place yet more effectually than before to this purpose as i had planted trees or rather thrust in stakes which in time all grew up to be trees for some good distance before the entrance into my apartment they went on in the same manner and filled up the rest of that whole space of ground from the trees i had set quite down to the side of the creek where as i said i landed my floats and even into the very ouze where the tide flowed not so much as leaving any place to land or any sign that there had been any landing thereabout these stakes also being of a wood very forward to grow as i have noted formerly they took care to have generally very much larger and taller than those which i had planted and as they grew apace so they planted them so very thick and close together that when they had been three or four years grown there was no piercing with the eye any considerable way into the plantation and as for that part which i had planted the trees were grown as thick as a mans thigh and among them they placed so many other short ones and so thick that in a word it stood like a pallisado a quarter of a mile thick and it was next to impossible to penetrate it but with a little army to cut it all down for a little dog could hardly get between the trees they stood so close  but this was not all for they did the same by all the ground to the right hand and to the left and round even to the top of the hill leaving no way not so much as for themselves to come out but by the ladder placed up to the side of the hill and then lifted up and placed again from the first stage up to the top which ladder when it was taken down nothing but what had wings or witchcraft to assist it could come at them  this was excellently well contrived nor was it less than what they afterward found occasion for which served to convince me that as human prudence has the authority of providence to justify it so it has doubtless the direction of providence to set it to work and would we listen carefully to the voice of it i am fully persuaded we might prevent many of the disasters which our lives are now by our own negligence subjected to but this by the way  i return to the story they lived two years after this in perfect retirement and had no more visits from the savages they had indeed an alarm given them one morning which put them into a great consternation for some of the spaniards being out early one morning on the west side or rather the end of the island which by the way was that end where i never went for fear of being discovered they were surpised with seeing above twenty canoes of indians just coming on shore  they made the best of their way home in hurry enough and giving the alarm to their comrades they kept close all that day and the next going out only at night to make observation but they had the good luck to be mistaken for wherever the savages went they did not land at that time on the island but pursued some other design  and now they had another broil with the three englishmen one of which a most turbulent fellow being in a rage at one of the three slaves which i mentioned they had taken because the fellow had not done something right which he bid him do and seemed a little untractable in his showing him drew a hatchet out of a frog belt in which he wore it by his side and fell upon the poor savage not to correct him but to kill him one of the spaniards who was by seeing him give the fellow a barbarous cut with the hatchet which he aimed at his head but struck into his shoulder so that he thought he had cut the poor creatures arm off ran to him and entreating him not to murder the poor man clapped in between him and the savage to prevent the mischief  the fellow being enraged the more at this struck at the spaniard with his hatchet and swore he would serve him as he intended to serve the savage which the spaniard perceiving avoided the blow and with a shovel which he had in his hand for they were all working in the field about their cornland knocked the brute down another of the englishmen running at the same time to help his comrade knocked the spaniard down and then two spaniards more came in to help their man and a third englishman fell in upon them they had none of them any firearms or any other weapons but hatchers and other tools except this third englishman he had one of my old rusty cutlashes with which he made at the two last spaniards and wounded them both this fray set the whole family in an uproar and more help coming in they took the three englishmen prisoners the next question was what should be done with them they had been so often mutinous and were so furious so desperate and so idle withal that they knew not what course to take with them for they were mischievous to the highest degree and valued not what hurt they did to any man so that in short it was not safe to live with them  the spaniard who was governor told them in so many words that if they had been of his own country he would have hanged them for all laws and all governors were to preserve society and those who were dangerous to the society ought to be expelled out of it but as they were englishmen and that it was to the generous kindness of an englishman that they all owed their preservation and deliverance he would use them with all possible lenity and would leave them to the judgment of the other two englishmen who were their countrymen  one of the two honest englishmen stood up and said they desired it might not be left to them for says he i am sure we ought to sentence them to the gallows and with that gives an account how will atkins one of the three had proposed to have all the five englishmen join together and murder all the spaniards when they were in their sleep  when the spanish governor heard this he calls to william atkins how seignior atkins says he would you murder us all what have you to say to that that hardened villain was so far from denying it that he said it was true and g  d d  m him they would do it still before they had done with them well but seignior atkins says the spaniard what have we done to you that you will kill us and what would you get by killing us and what must we do to prevent your killing us must we kill you or you will kill us why will you put us to the necessity of this seignior atkins says the spaniard very calmly and smiling  seignior atkins was in such a rage at the spaniards making a jest of it that had he not been held by three men and withal had no weapons with him it was thought he would have attempted to have killed the spaniard in the middle of all the company  this hairbrained carriage obliged them to consider seriously what was to be done the two englishmen and the spaniard who saved the poor savage was of the opinion they should hang one of the three for an example to the rest and that particularly it should be he that had twice attempted to commit murder with his hatchet and indeed there was some reason to believe he had done it for the poor savage was in such a miserable condition with the wound he had received that it was thought he could not live  but the governor spaniard still said no it was an englishman that had saved all their lives and he would never consent to put an englishman to death though he had murdered half of them nay he said if he had been killed himself by an englishman and had time left to speak it should be that they should pardon him  this was so positively insisted on by the governor spaniard that there was no gain saying it and as merciful councils are most apt to prevail where they are so earnestly pressed so they all came into it but then it was to be considered what should be done to keep them from doing the mischief they designed for all agreed governor and all that means were to be used for preserving the society from danger after a long debate it was agreed first that they should be disarmed and not permitted to have either gun or powder or shot or sword or any weapon and should be turned out of the society and left to live where they would and how they would by themselves but that none of the rest either spaniards or english should converse with them speak with them or have any thing to do with them that they should be forbid to come within a certain distance of the place where the rest dwelt and that if they offered to commit any disorder so as to spoil burn kill or destroy any of the corn plantings buildings fences or cattle belonging to the society they should dye without mercy and they would shoot them wherever they could find them  the governor a man of great humanity musing upon the sentence considered a little upon it and turning to the two honest englishmen said hold you must reflect that it will be long ever they can raise corn and cattle of their own and they must not starve we must therefore allow them provisions so he caused to be added that they should have a proportion of corn given them to last them eight months and for seed to sow by which time they might be supposed to raise some of their own that they should have six milchgoats four hegoats and six kids given them as well for present subsistence as for a store and that they should have tools given them for their work in the fields such as six hatchets an ax a saw and the like but they should have none of these tools or provisions unless they would swear solemnly that they would not hurt or injure any of the spaniards with them or of their fellow englishmen  thus they dismissed them the society and turned them out to shift for themselves they went away sullen and refractory as neither contented to go away or to stay but as there was no remedy they went pretending to go and choose a place where they would settle themselves to plant and live by themselves and some provision were given them but no weapons  about four or five days after they came again for some victuals and gave the governor an account where they had pitched their tents and marked themselves out an habitation and plantation and it was a very convenient place indeed on the remotest part of the island ne much about the place where i landed in my first voyage when i was driven out to sea the lord knows whether in my attempt to surround the island  here they built themselves two handsome huts and contrived them in a manner like my first habitation being close under the side of a hill having some trees growing already on three sides of it so that by planting others it would be very easily covered from the sight unless narrowly searched for they desired some dried goatsskins for beds and covering which were given them and upon giving their words that they would not disturb the rest or injure any of their plantations they gave them hatchets and what other tools they could spare some peace barley and rice for sowing and in a word any thing they wanted but arms and ammunition  they lived in this separate condition about six months and had gotten in their first harvest though the quantity was but small the parcel of land they had planted being but little for indeed having all their plantation to form they had a great deal of work upon their hands and when they came to make boards and pots and such things they were quite out of their element and could make nothing of it and when the rainy season came on for want of a cave in the earth they could not keep their grain dry and it was in great danger of spoiling and this humbled them much so they came and begged the spaniards to help them which they very readily did and in four days worked a great hole in the side of the hill for them big enough to secure their corn and other things from the rain but it was but a poor place at best compared to mine and especially as mine was then for the spaniards had greatly enlarged it and made several new apartments in it  about three quarters of a year after this separation a new frolic took these rogues which together with the former villainy they had committed brought mischief enough upon them and had very near been the ruin of the whole colony the three new sociates began it seems to be weary of the laborious life they led and that without hope of bettering their circumstances and a whim took them that they would make a voyage to the continent from whence the savages came and would try if they could not seize upon some prisoners among the natives there and bring them home so to make them do the laborious part of their work for them  the project was not so preposterous if they had gone no farther but they did nothing and proposed nothing but had either mischief in the design or mischief in the event and if i may give my opinion they seemed to be under a blast from heaven for if we will not allow a visible curse to pursue visible crimes how shall we reconcile the events of things with the divine justice it was certainly an apparent vengeance on their crime of mutiny and piracy that brought them to the state they were in and as they showed not the least remorse for the crime but added new villainies to it such as particularly the piece of monstrous cruelty of wounding a poor slave because he did not or perhaps could not understand to do what he was directed and to wound him in such a manner as no question made him a cripple all his life and in a place where no surgeon or medicine could be had for his cure and what was still worse the murderous intent or to do justice to the crime the intentional murder for such to be sure it was as was afterward the formed design they all laid to murder the spaniards in cold blood and in their sleep  but i leave observing and return to the story the three fellows comes down to the spaniards one morning and in very humble terms desired to be admitted to speak with them the spaniards very readily heard what they had to say which was this that they were tired of living in the manner they did that they were not handy enough to make the necessaries they wanted and that having no help they found they should be starved but if the spaniards would give them leave to take one of the canoes which they came over in and give them arms and ammunition proportioned for their defense they would go over to the main and seek their fortune and so deliver them from the trouble of supplying them with any other provisions  the spaniards were glad enough to be rid of them but yet very honestly represented to them the certain destruction they were running into told them they had suffered such hardships upon that very spot that they could without any spirit of prophesy tell them that they would be starved or be murdered and bad them consider of it  the men replied audaciously they should be starved if they stayed here for they could not work and would not work and they could but be starved abroad and if they were murdered there was an end of them they had no wives or children to cry after them and in short insisted importunately upon their demand declaring that they would go whether they would give them any arms or no  the spaniards told them with great kindness that if they were resolved to go they should not go like naked men and be in no condition to defend themselves and that though they could ill spare their firearms having not enough for themselves yet they would let them have two muskets a pistol and a cutlash and each man a hatchet which they thought was sufficient for them  in a word they accepted the offer and having baked them bread enough to serve them a month and given them as much goatsflesh as they could eat while it was sweet and a great basket full of dried grapes a pot full of fresh water and a young kid alive to kill they boldly set out in a canoe for a voyage over the sea where it was at least  0 miles broad  the boat was indeed a large one and would have very well carried fifteen or twenty men and therefore was rather too big for them to manage but as they had a fair breeze and the floodtide with them they did well enough they had made a mast of a long pole and a sail of four large goat skins dried which they had sowed or laced together and away they went merrily enough the spaniards called after them bon veyajo and no man ever thought of seeing them any more  the spaniards would often say to one another and the two honest english men who remained behind how quietly and comfortably they lived now those three turbulent fellows were gone as for their ever coming again that was the remotest thing from their thoughts that could be imagined when behold after two and twenty days absence one of the english men being abroad upon his plantingwork sees three strange men coming toward him at a distance with guns upon their shoulders  away runs the english man as if he was bewitched comes frighted and amazed to the governor spaniard and tells him they were all undone for there were strangers landed upon the island he could not tell who the spaniard pausing a while says to him how do you mean you cannot tell who they are the savages to be sure no no says the english man they are men in clothes with arms nay then says the spaniard why are you concerned if they are not savages they must be friends for there is no christian nation upon earth but will do us good rather than harm  while they were debating thus comes the three english men and standing without the wood which was new planted hallod to them they presently knew their voices and so all the wonder of that kind ceased but now the admiration was turned upon another question viz what could be the matter and what made them come back again  it was not long before they brought the men in and enquiring where they had been and what they had been doing they gave them a full account of their voyage in a few words viz that they reached the land in two days or something less but finding the people alarmed at their coming and preparing with bows and arrows to fight them they durst not go on shore but sailed on to the northward six or seven hours till they came to a great opening by which they perceived that the land they saw from our island was not the main but an island that entering that opening of the sea they saw another island on the right hand north and several more west and being resolved to land somewhere they put over to one of the islands which lay west and went boldly on shore that they found the people very courteous and friendly to them and that they gave them several roots and some dried fish and appeared very sociable and the women as well as the men were very forward to supply them with any thing they could get for them to eat and brought it to them a great way upon their heads  they continued here four days and inquired as well as they could of them by signs what nations were this way and that way and were told of several fierce and terrible people that lived almost every way who as they made signs to them used to eat men but as for themselves they said that they never eat men or women except only such as they took in the wars and then they owned that they made a great feast and eat their prisoners  the english men inquired when they had a feast of that kind and they told him about two moons ago pointing to the moon and then to two fingers and that their great king had two hundred prisoners now which he had taken in his war and they were feeling them to make them fat for the next feast the english men seemed mighty disirous to see those prisoners but the other mistaking them thought they were desirous to have some of them to carry away for their own eating so they beckoned to them pointing to the setting of the sun and then to the rising which was to signify that the next morning at sunrising they would bring some for them and accordingly the next morning they brought down five women and eleven men and gave them to the english men to carry with them on their voyage just as we would bring so many cows and oxen down to a seaport town to victual a ship  as brutish and barbarous as these fellows were at home their stomachs turned at this sight and they did not know what to do to refuse the prisoners would have been the highest affront to the savage gentry that offered them and what to do with them they knew not however upon some debates they resolved to accept of them and in return they gave the savages that brought them one of their hatchets an old key a knife and six or seven of their bullets which though they did not understand they seemed extremely pleased with and then tying the poor creatures hands behind them they the people dragged the poor prisoners into the boat for our men  the english men were obliged to come away as soon as they had them or else they that gave them this noble present would certainly have expected that they should have gone to work with them have killed two or three of them the next morning and perhaps have invited the donors to dinner  but having taken their leave with all the respects and thanks that could well pass between people where on either side they understood not one word they could say they put off with their boat and came back toward the first island where when they arrived they set eight of their prisoners at liberty there being too many of them for their occasion  in their voyage they endeavored to have some communication with their prisoners but it was impossible to make them understand any thing nothing they could say to them or give them or do for them but was looked upon as going about to murder them they first of all unbound them but the poor creatures skreamd at that especially the women as if they had just felt the knife at their throats for they immediately concluded they were unbound on purpose to be killed  if they gave them any thing to eat it was the same thing then they concluded it was for fear they should sink in flesh and so not be fat enough to kill if they looked at one of them more particularly the party presently concluded it was to see whether he or she was fattest and fittest to kill nay after they had brought them quite over and began to use them kindly and treat them well still they expected every day to make a dinner or a supper for their new masters  when the three wanderers had given this unaccountable history or journal of their voyage the spaniard asked them where their new family was and being told that they had brought them on shore and put them into one of their huts and were come up to beg some victuals for them they the spaniards and the other two english men that is to say the whole colony resolved to go all down to the place and see them and did so and fridays father with them  when they came into the hut there they sat all bound for when they had brought them on shore they bound their hands that they might not take the boat and make their escape there i say they sat all of them stark naked first there were three men lusty comely fellows well shaped strait and fair limbs about thirty to thirty five years of age and five women whereof two might be from thirty to forty two more not above four or five and twenty and the fifth a tall comely maiden about sixteen or seventeen the women were well favored agreeable persons both in shape and features only tawny and two of them had they been perfect white would have passed for very handsome women even in london itself having pleasant agreeable countenances and of a very modest behavior especially when they came afterward to be clothed and dressed as they called it though the dress was very indifferent it must be confessed of which hereafter  the sight you may be sure was something uncouth to our spaniards who were to give them a just character men of the best behavior of the most calm sedate tempers and perfect good humor that ever i met with and in particular of the most modesty as will presently appear i say the sight was very uncouth to see two naked men and five naked women all together bound and in the most miserable circumstances that human nature could be supposed to be viz to be expecting every moment to be dragged out and have their brains knocked out and then to be eaten up like a calf that is killed for a dainty  the first thing they did was to cause the old indian fridays father to go in and see first if he knew any of them and then if he understood any of their speech as soon as the old man came in he looked seriously at them but knew none of them neither could any of them understand a word he said or a sign he could make except one of the women  however this was enough to answer the end which was to satisfy them that the men into whose hands they were fallen were christians that they abhorred eating of men or women and that they might be sure they would not be killed as soon as they were assured of this they discovered such a joy and by such awkward and several ways as is hard to describe for it seems they were of several nations  the woman who was their interpreter was bid in the next place to ask them if they were willing to be servants and to work for the men who had brought them away to save their lives at which they all fell a dancing and presently one fell to taking up this and another that any thing that lay next to carry on their shoulders to intimate that they were willing to work  the governor who found that the having women among them would presently be attended with some inconvenience and might occasion some strife and perhaps blood asked the three men what they intended to do with these women and how they intended to use them whether as servants or as women one of the englishmen answered very boldly and readily that they would use them as both to which the governor said i am not going to restrain you from it you are your own masters as to that but this i think is but just for avoiding disorders and quarrels among you and i desire it of you for that reason only viz that you will all engage that if any of you take any of these women as a woman or wife that he shall take but one and that having taken one none else should touch her for though we cannot marry any of you yet it is but reasonable that while you stay here the woman any of you takes should be maintained by the man that takes her and should be his wife i mean says he while he continues here and that none else shall have any thing to do with her all this appeared so just that every one agreed to it without any difficulty  then the englishmen asked the spaniards if they designed to take any of them but every one of them answered no some of them said they had wives in spain and the others did not like women that were not christians and all together declared that they would not touch one of them which was an instance of such virtue as i have not met with in all my travels on the other hand to be short the five englishmen took them every one a wife that is to say a temporary wife and so they set up a new form of living for the spaniards and fridays father lived in my old habitation which they had enlarged exceedingly within the three servants which were taken in the late battle of the savages lived with them and these carried on the main part of the colony supplying all the rest with food and assisting them in any thing as they could or as they found necessity required  but the wonder of this story was how five such refractory ill matched fellows should agree about these women and that two of them should not pitch upon the same woman especially seeing two or three of them were without comparison more agreeable than the other but they took a good way enough to prevent quarrelling among themselves for they set the five women by themselves in one of their huts and they went all into the other hut and drew lots among them who should choose first  he that drew to choose first went away by himself to the hut where the poor naked creatures were and fetched out her he chose and it was worth observing that he that chose first took her that was reckoned the homeliest and the oldest of the five which made mirth enough among the rest and even the spaniards laughed at it but the fellow considered better than any of them that it was application and business that they were to expect assistance in as much as any thing else and she proved the best wife of all the parcel  when the poor women saw themselves set in a row thus and fetched out one by one the terrors of their condition returned upon them again and they firmly believed that they were now a going to be devoured accordingly when the english sailor came in and fetched out one of them the rest set up a most lamentable cry and hung about her and took their leave of her with such agonies and such affection as would have grieved the hardest heart in the world nor was it possible for the englishmen to satisfy them that were not to be immediately murdered till they fetched the old man fridays father who immediately let them know that the five men who had fetched them out one by one had chosen them for their wives  when they had done and the fright the women were in was a little over the men went to work and the spaniards came and helped them and in a few hours they had built them every one a new hut or tent for their lodging apart for those they had already were crowded with their tools household stuff and provision the three wicked ones had pitched farthest off and the two honest ones nearer but both on the north shore of the island so that they continued separate as before and thus my island was peopled in three places and as i might say three towns were begun to be planted  and here it is very well worth observing that as it often happens in the world what the wise ends of gods providence are in such a disposition of things i cannot say the two honest fellows had the two worst wives and the three reprobates that were scarce worth hanging that were fit for nothing and neither seemed born to do themselves good or any one else had three clever diligent careful and ingenious wives not that the two first were ill wives as to their temper or humor for all the five were most willing quiet passive and subjected creatures rather like slaves than wives but my meaning is they were not alike capable ingenious or industrious or alike cleanly and neat  another observation i must make to the honor of a diligent application on one hand and to the disgrace of a slothful negligent idle temper on the other that when i came to the place and viewed the several improvements plantings and management of the several little colonies the two men had so far outgone the three that there was no comparison they had indeed both of them as much ground laid out for corn as they wanted and the reason was because according to my rule nature dictated that it was to no purpose to sow more corn than they wanted but the difference of the cultivation of the planting of the fences and indeed of every thing else was easy to be seen at first view  the two men had innumerable young trees planted about their huts that when you came to the place nothing was to be seen but a wood and though they had twice had their plantation demolished once by their own countrymen and once by the enemy as shall be shown in its place yet they had restored all again and every thing was thriving and flourishing about them they had grapes planted in order and managed like a vineyard though they had themselves never seen any thing of that kind and by their good ordering their vines their grapes were as good again as any of the others they had also found themselves out a retreat in the thickest part of the woods where though there was not a natural cave as i had found yet they made one with incessant labor of their hands and where when the mischief which followed happened they secured their wives and children so as they could never be found they having by sticking innumerable stakes and poles of the wood which as i said grew so easily made the wood unpassable except in some places where they climbed up to get over the outside part and then went on by ways of their own leaving  as to the three reprobates as i justly call them though they were much civilized by their new settlement compared to what they were before and were not so quarrelsom having not the same opportunity yet one of the certain companions of a profligate mind never left them and that was their idleness it is true they planted corn and made fences but solomons words were never better verified than in them i went by the vineyard of the slothful and it was all overgrown with thorns for when the spaniards came to view their crop they could not see it in some places for weeds the hedge had several gaps in it where the wild goats had gotten in and eaten up the corn perhaps here and there a dead bush was crammed in to stop them out for the present but it was only shutting the stabledoor after the steed was stolen whereas when they looked on the colony of the other two there was the very face of industry and success upon all they did there was not a weed to be seen in all their corn or a gap in any of their hedges and they on the other hand verified solomons words in another place that the diligent hand makes rich for every thing grew and thrived and they had plenty within and without they had more tame cattle than the other more utensils and necessaries within doors and yet more pleasure and diversion too  it is true the wives of the three were very handy and cleanly within doors and having learned the english ways of dressing and cooking from one of the other english men who as i said was cooksmate on board the ship they dressed their husbands victuals very nicely and well whereas the other could not be brought to understand it but then the husband who as i say had been cooksmate did it himself but as for the husbands of the three wives they loyterd about fetched turtles eggs and caught fish and birds in a word any thing but labor and they fared accordingly the diligent lived well and comfortably and the slothful lived hard and beggarly and so i believe generally speaking it is all over the world  but now i come to a scene different from all that had happened before either to them or to me and the original of the story was this  early one morning there came on shore five or six canoes of indians or savages call them which you please and there is no room to doubt that they came upon the old errand of feeding upon their slaves but that part was now so familiar to the spaniards and to our men too that they did not concern themselves about it as i did but having been made sensible by their experience that their only business was to lie concealed and that if they were not seen by any of the savages they would go off again quietly when their business was done having as yet not the least notion of there being any inhabitants in the island i say having been made sensible of this they had nothing to do but to give notice to all the three plantations to keep within doors and not show themselves only placing a scout in a proper place to give notice when the boats went to sea again  this was without doubt very right but a disaster spoiled all these measures and made it known among the savages that there were inhabitants there which was in the end the desolation of almost the whole colony after the canoes with the savages were gone off the spaniards peeped abroad again and some of them had the curiosity to go to the place where they had been to see what they had been doing here to their great surprise they found three savages left behind and lying fast asleep upon the ground it was supposed they had either been so gorged with their inhuman feast that like beasts they were asleep and would not stir when the others went or they were wandered into the woods and did not come back in time to be taken in  the spaniards were greatly surpised at this sight and perfectly at a loss what to do the spaniard governor as it happened was with them and his advice was asked but he professed he knew not what to do as for slaves they had enough already and as to killing them they were none of them inclined to that the spaniard governor told me they could not think of shedding innocent blood for as to them the poor creatures had done them no wrong invaded none of their property and they thought they had no just quarrel against them to take away their lives  and here i must in justice to these spaniards observe that let the accounts of spanish cruelty in mexico and peru be what they will i never met with seventeen men of any nation whatsoever in any foreign country who were so universally modest temperate virtuous so very goodhumored and so courteous as these spaniards and as to cruelty they had nothing of it in their very nature no inhumanity no barbarity no outrageous passions and yet all of them men of great courage and spirit  their temper and calmness had appeared in their bearing the unsufferable usage of the three english men and their justice and humanity appeared now in the case of the savages as above after some consultation they resolved upon this that they would lie still a while longer till if possible these three men might be gone but then the governor spaniard recollected that the three savages had no boat and that if they were left to rove about the island they would certainly discover that there were inhabitants in it and so they should be undone that way  upon this they went back again and there lay the fellows fast asleep still so they resolved to waken them and take them prisoners and they did so the poor fellows were strangely frighted when they were seized upon and bound and afraid like the women that they should be murdered and eaten for it seems those people think all the world does as they do eating mens flesh but they were soon made easy as to that and away they carried them  it was very happy to them that they did not carry them home to their castle i mean to my palace under the hill but they carried them first to the bower where was the chief of their countrywork such as the keeping the goats the planting the corn etc and afterward they carried them to the habitation of the two english men  here they were set to work though it was not much they had for them to do and whether it was by negligence in guarding them or that they thought the fellows could not mend themselves i know not but one of them run away and taking into the woods they could never hear of him more  they had good reason to believe he got home again soon after in some other boats or canoes of savages who came on shore three or four weeks afterward and who carrying on their revels as usual went off again in two days time this thought terrified them exceedingly for they concluded and that not without good cause indeed that if this fellow came safe home among his comrades he would certainly give them an account that there were people in the island as also how few and weak they were for this savage as i observed before had never been told and it was very happy he had not how many they were or where they lived nor had he ever seen or heard the fire of any of their guns much less had they shown him any of their other retired places such as the cave in the valley or the new retreat which the two english men had made and the like  the first testimony they had that this fellow had given intelligence of them was that about two months after this six canoes of savages with about seven or e ght or ten men in a canoe came rowing along the north side of the island where they never used to come before and landed about an hour after sunrise at a convenient place about a mile from the habitation of the two englishmen where this escaped man had been kept as the spaniard governor said had they been all there the damage would not have been so much for not a man of them would have escap d but the case differed now very much for two men to fifty was too much odds the two men had the happiness to discover them about a league off so that it was above an hour before they landed and as they landed a mile from their huts it was some time before they could come at them now having great reason to believe that they were betrayed the first thing they did was to bind the two slaves which were left and cause two of the three men who they brought with the women who it seems proved very faithful to them to lead them with their two wives and what ever they could carry away with them to their retired place in the woods which i have spoken of above and there to bind the two fellows hand and foot till they heard farther  in the next place seeing the savages were all come on shore and that they bent their course directly that way they opened the fences where their milchgoats were kept and drove them all out leaving their goats to straggle into the wood whither they pleased that the savages might think they were all bred wild but the rogue who came with them was too cunning for that and gave them an account of it all for they went directly to the place  when the two poor frighted men had secured their wives and goods they sent the other slave they had of the three who came with the women and who was at their place by accident away to the spaniards with all speed to give them the alarm and desire speedy help and in the mean time they took their arms and what ammunition they had and retreated toward the place in the wood where their wives were sent keeping at a distance yet so that they might see if possible which way the savages took  they had not gone far but that from a rising ground they could see the little army of their enemies come on directly to their habitation and in a moment more could see all their huts and household stuff flaming up together to their great grief and mortification for they had a very great loss to them irretrievable at least for some time they kept their station for a while till they found the savages like wild beasts spread themselves all over the place rumaging every way and every place they could think of in search for prey and in particular for the people of whom it now plainly appeared they had intelligence  the two englishmen seeing this thinking themselves not secure where they stood because as it was likely some of the wild people might come that way so they might come too many together thought it proper to make another retreat about half a mile farther believing as it afterward happened that the farther they strolld the fewer would be together  the next halt was at the entrance into a very thick grown part of the woods and where an old trunk of a tree stood which was hollow and vastly large and in this tree they both took their standing resolving to see there what might offer  they had not stood there long but two of the savages appeared running directly that way as if they had already had notice where they stood and were coming up to attack them and a little way farther they spied three more coming after them and five more beyond them all coming the same way besides which they saw seven or eight more at a distance running another way for in a word they ran every way like sportsmen beating for their game  the poor men were now in great perplexity whether they should stand and keep their posture or fly but after a very short debate with themselves they considered that if the savages ranged the country thus before help came they might perhaps find out their retreat in the woods then all would be lost so they resolved to stand them there and if they were too many to deal with then they would get up to the top of the tree from whence they doubted not to defend themselves fire excepted as long as their ammunition lasted though all the savages that were landed which was near fifty were to attack them  having resolved upon this they next considered whether they should fire at the first two or wait for the three and so take the middle party by which the two and the five that followed would be separated and they resolved to let the two first pass by unless they should spy them in the tree and come to attack them the two first savages also confirmed them in this regulation by turning a little from them toward another part of the wood but the three and the five after them came forwards directly to the tree as if they had known the englishmen were there  seeing them come so strait toward them they resolved to take them in a line as they came and as they resolv d to fire but one at a time perhaps the first shot might hit them all three to which purpose the man who was to fire put three or four bullets into his piece and having a fair loophole as it were from a broken hole in the tree he took a sure aim without being seen waiting till they were within about thirty yards of the tree so that he could not miss  while they were thus waiting and the savages came on they plainly saw that one of the three was the run away savage that had escaped from them and they both knew him distinctly and resolved that if possible he should not escape though they should both fire so the other stood ready with his piece that if he did not drop at the first shot he should be sure to have a second  but the first was too good a marksman to miss his aim for as the savages kept near one another a little behind in a line in a word he fired and hit two of them directly the foremost was killed outright being shot in the head the second which was the runaway indian was shot through the body and fell but was not quite dead and the third had a little scratch in the shoulder perhaps by the same ball that went through the body of the second and being dreadfully frighted though not much hurt sat down upon the ground skreaming and yelling in a hideous manner  the five that were behind more frighted with the noise than sensible of the danger stood still at first for the woods made the sound a thousand times bigger than it really was the echos rattling from one side to another and the fowls rising from all parts skreaming and making every sort a several kind of noise according to their kind just as it was when i fired the first gun that perhaps was ever shot off in that place since it was an island  however all being silent again and they not knowing what the matter was came on unconcerned till they came to the place where their companions lay in a condition miserable enough and here the poor ignorant creatures not sensible that they were within reach of the same mischief stood all of a huddle over the wounded man talking and as may be supposed enquiring of him how he came to be hurt and who it is very rational to believe told them that a flash of fire first and immediately after that thunder from their gods had killed those two and wounded him this i say is rational for nothing is more certain than that as they saw on man near them so they had never heard a gun in all their lives or so much as heard of a gun neither knew they any thing of killing or wounding at a distance with fire and bullets if they had one might reasonably believe they would not have stood so unconcerned in viewing the fate of their fellows without some apprehension of their own  our two men though as they confessed to me it grieved them to be obliged to kill so many poor creatures who at the same time had no notion of their danger yet having them all thus in their power and the first having loaded his piece again resolved to let fly both together among them and singling out by agreement which to aim at they shot together and killed or very much wounded four of them the fifth frighted even to death though not hurt fell with the rest so that our men seeing them all fall together thought they had killed them all  the belief that the savages were all killed made our two men come boldly out from the tree before they had charged their guns again which was a wrong step and they were under some surprise when they came to the place and found no less than four of the men alive and of them two very little hurt and one not at all this obliged them to fall upon them with the stocks of their muskets and first they made sure of the run away savage that had been the cause of all the mischief and of another that was hurt in his knee and put them out of their pain then the man that was not hurt at all came and kneeled down to them with his two hands held up and made piteous moans to them by gestures and signs for his life but could not say one word to them that they could understand  however they signed to him to sit down at the foot of a tree thereby and one of the english men with a piece of ropetwine which he had by great chance in his pocket tied his two feet fast together and his two hands behind him and there they left him and with what speed they could made after the other two which were gone before fearing they or any more of them should find the way to their covered place in the woods where their wives and the few goods they had left lay they came once in sight of the two men but it was at a great distance however they had the satisfaction to see them cross over a valley toward the sea the quite contrary way from that which led to their retreat which they were afraid of and being satisfied with that they went back to the tree where they left their prisoner who as they supposed was delivered by his comrades for he was gone and the two pieces of ropeyarn with which they had bound him lay just at the foot of the tree  they were now in as great a concern as before not knowing what course to take or how near the enemy might be or in what numbers so they resolved to go away to the place where their wives were to see if all was well there and to make them easy who were in fright enough to be sure for though the savages were their own country folk yet they were most terribly afraid of them and perhaps the more for the knowledge they had of them  when they came there they found the savages had been in the wood and very near that place but had not found it for it was indeed inaccessible by the trees standing so thick as before had not the persons seeking it been directed by those that knew it which these did not they found therefore every thing very safe only the women in a terrible fright while they were here they had the comfort to have seven of the spaniards come to their assistance the other ten with their servants and old friday i mean fridays father were gone in a body to defend their bower and the corn and cattle that was kept there in case the savages should have roved over to that side of the country but they did not spread so far with the seven spaniards came one of the three savages who as i said were their prisoners formerly and with them also came the savage who the english men had left bound hand and foot at the tree for it seems they came that way saw the slaughter of the seven men and unbound the eighth and brought him along with them where however they were obliged to bind him again as they had the two others who were left when the third run away  the prisoners began now to be a burden to them and they were so afraid of their escaping that they were once resolving to kill them all believing they were under an absolute necessity to do so for their own preservation however the spaniard governor would not consent to it but ordered for the present that they should be sent out of the way to my old cave in the valley and be kept there with two spaniards to guard them and give them food for their subsistence which was done and they were bound there hand and foot for that night  when the spaniards came the two english men were so encouraged that they could not satisfy themselves to stay any longer there but taking five of the spaniards and themselves with four muskets and a pistol among them and two stout quarterstaves away they went in quest of the savages and first they came to the tree where the men lay that had been killed but it was easy to see that some more of the savages had been there for they had attempted to carry their dead men away and had dragged two of them a good way but had given it over from thence they advanced to the first rising ground where they stood and saw their camp destroyed and where they had the mortification still to see some of the smoke but neither could they here see any of the savages they then resolved though with all possible caution to go forward toward their ruined plantation but a little before they came thither coming in sight of the sea shore they saw plainly the savages all embarking again in their canoes in order to be gone  they seemed sorry at first and there was no way to come at them to give them a parting blow but upon the whole were very well satisfied to be rid of them  the poor english men being now twice ruined and all their improvement destroyed the rest all agreed to come and help them rebuild and to assist them with needful supplies their three countrymen who were not yet noted for having the least inclination to do any good yet as soon as they heard of it for they living remote eastward knew nothing of the matter till all was over came and offered their help and assistance and did very friendly work for several days to restore their habitation and make necessaries for them and thus in a little time they were set upon their legs again  about two days after this they had the farther satisfaction of seeing three of the savages canoes come driving on shore and at some distance from them two drowned men by which they had reason to believe that they had met with a storm at sea and had overset some of them for it had blown very hard the very night after they went off  however as some might miscarry so on the other hand enough of them escaped to inform the rest as well of what they had done as of what had happened to them and to whet them on to another enterprise of the same nature which they it seems resolved to attempt with sufficient force to carry all before them for except what the first man had told them of inhabitants they could say little to it of their own knowledge for they never saw one man and the fellow being killed that had affirmed it they had no other witness to confirm it to them  it was five or six months after this before they heard any more of the savages in which time our men were in hopes they had either forgot their former bad luck or given over the hopes of better when on a sudden they were invaded with a most formidable fleet of no less than eight and twenty canoes full of savages armed with bows and arrows great clubs wooden swords and such like engines of war and they brought such numbers with them that in short it put all our people into the utmost consternation  as they came on shore in the evening and at the eastermost side of the island our men had that night to consult and consider what to do and in the first place knowing that their being entirely concealed was their only safety before and would much more be so now while the number of their enemies was so great they therefore resolved first of all to take down the huts which were built for the two english men and drive away their goats to the old cave because they supposed the savages would go directly thither as soon as it was day to play the old game over again though they did not now land within two leagues of it  in the next place they drove away all the flock of goats they had at the old bower as i called it which belonged to the spaniards and in short left as little appearance of inhabitants any where as was possible and the next morning early they posted themselves with all their force at the plantation of the two men waiting for their coming as they guessed so it happened these new invaders leaving their canoes at the east end of the island came ranging along the shore directly toward the place to the number of two hundred and fifty as near as our men could judge our army was but small indeed but that which was worse they had not arms for all their number neither the whole account it seems stood thus first as to men    spaniards   english men   old friday or fridays father   the three slaves taken with the women who proved very faithful   other slaves who lived with the spaniards to arm these they had    muskets   pistols   fowlingpieces   muskets or fowlingpieces which were taken by me from the mutinous seamen who i reduced   swords   old halberds   to their slaves they did not give either musket or fuzee but they had every one a halberd or a long staff like a quarterstaff with a great spike of iron fastened into each end of it and by his side a hatchet also every one of our men had hatchets two of the women could not be prevailed upon but they would come into the fight and they had bows and arrows which the spaniards had taken from the savages when the first action happened which i have spoken of where the indians fought with one another and the women hatchets too  the spaniard governor who i have described so often commanded the whole and william atkins who though a dreadful fellow for wickedness was a most daring bold fellow commanded under him the savages came forward like lions and our men which was the worst of their fate had no advantage in their situation only that will atkins who now proved a most useful fellow with six men was planted just behind a small thicket of bushes as an advanced guard with orders to let the first of them pass by and then fire into the middle of them and as soon as he had fired to make his retreat as nimble as he could round a part of the wood and so come in behind the spaniards where they stood having a thicket of trees all before them  when the savages came on they run straggling about every way in heaps out of all manner of order and w atkins let about fifty of them pass by him then seeing the rest come in a very thick throng he orders three of his men to fire having loaded their muskets with six or seven bullets apiece about as big as large pistol bullets how many they killed or wounded they knew not but the consternation and surprise was inexpressible among the savages they were frighted to the last degree to hear such a dreadful noise and see their men killed and others hurt but see no body that did it when in the middle of their fright w atkins and his other three let fly again among the thickest of them and in less than a minute the first three being loaded again gave them a third volley  had w atkins and his men retired immediately as soon as they had fired as they were ordered to do or had the rest of the body been at hand to have poured in their shot continually the savages had been effectually routed for the terror that was among them came principally from this viz that they were killed by the gods with thunder and lightning and could see no body that hurt them but w atkins staying to load again discovered the cheat some of the savages who were at a distance spying them came upon them behind and though atkins and his men fired at them also two or three times and killed above twenty retiring as fast as they could yet they wounded atkins himself and killed one of his fellow englishmen with their arrows as they did afterward one spaniard and one of the indian slaves who came with the women this slave was a most gallant fellow and fought most desperately killing five of them with his own hand having no weapon but one of the armed staves and a hatchet  our men being thus hard laid at atkins wounded and two other men killed retreated to a rising ground in the wood and the spaniards after firing three vollies upon them retreated also for their number was so great and they were so desperate that though above fifty of them were killed and more than so many wounded yet they came on in the teeth of our men fearless of danger and shot their arrows like a cloud and it was observed that their wounded men who were not quite disabled were made outrageous by their wounds and fought like madmen  when our men retreated they left the spaniard and the englishman that was killed behind them and the savages when they came up to them killed them over again in a wretched manner breaking the arms legs and heads with their clubs and wooden swords like true savages but finding our men were gone they did not seem to pursue them but drew themselves up in a kind of a ring which is it seems their custom and shouted twice in token of their victory after which they had the mortification to see several of their wounded men fall dying with the mere loss of blood  the spaniard governor having drawn his little body up together upon a rising ground atkins though he was wounded would have had him marched and charged them again altogether at once but the spaniards replied seignior atkins you see how their wounded men fight let them alone till morning all these wounded men will be stiff and sore with their wounds and faint with the loss of blood and so we shall have the fewer to engage  the advice was good but will atkins replied merrily that is true seignior and so shall i too and that is the reason i would go on while i am warm well seignior atkins says the spaniards you have behaved gallantly and done your part we will fight for you if you cannot come on but i think it best to stay till morning so they waited  but as it was a clear moonlight night and they found the savages in great disorder about their dead and wounded men and a great hurry and noise among them where they lay they afterward resolved to fall upon them in the night especially if they could come to give them but one volley before they were discovered which they had a fair opportunity to do for one of the two englishmen in whose quarter it was where the fight began led them round between the woods and seaside westward and then turning short south they came so near where the thickest of them lay that before they were seen or heard eight of them fired in among them and did dreadful execution upon them in half a minute more eight others fired after them pouring in their small shot in such a quantity that abundance were killed and wounded and all this while they were not able to see who hurt them or which way to fly  the spaniards charged again with the utmost expedition and then divided themselves into three bodies and resolved to fall in among them altogether they had in each body eight persons that is to say    whereof were    men and the   women who by the way fought desperately  they divided the firearms equally in each party and so of the halberds and staves they would have had the women keep back but they said they were resolved to die with their husbands having thus formed their little army they marched out from among the trees and they came up to the teeth of the enemy shouting and hollowing as loud as they could the savages stood all together but were in the utmost confusion hearing the noise of our men shouting from three quarters together they would have fought if they had seen us and as soon as we came near enough to be seen some arrows were shot and poor old friday was wounded though not dangerously but our men gave them no time but running up to them fired among them three ways and then fell in with the butends of their muskets their swords armed staves and hatchets and laid about them so well that in a word they set up a dismal skreaming and howling flying to save their lives which way soever they could  our men were tired with the execution and killed or mortally wounded in the two fights about   0 of them the rest being frighted out of their wits scoured through the woods and over the hills with all the speed and fear that nimble feet could help them to do and as we did not trouble ourselves much to pursue them they got altogether to the sea side where they landed and where their canoes lay but their disaster was not at an end yet for it blew a terrible storm of wind that evening from the seaward so that it was impossible for them to go off nay the storm continuing all night when the tide came up their canoes were most of them driven by the surge of the sea so high upon the shore that it required infinite toil to get them off and some of them were even dash d to pieces against the beach or against one another  our men though glad of their victory yet got little rest that night but having refreshed themselves as well as they could they resolved to march to that part of the island where the savages were fled and see what posture they were in this necessarily led them over the place where the fight had been and where they found several of the poor creatures not quite dead and yet past recovering life a sight disagreeable enough to generous minds for a truly great man though obliged by the law of battle to destroy his enemy takes no delight in his misery  however there was no need to give any orders in this case for their own savages who were their servants dispatched those poor creatures with their hatchets  at length they came in view of the place where the more miserable remains of the savages army lay where there appeared about an hundred still their posture was generally sitting upon the ground with their knees up toward their mouth and the head put between the two hands leaning down upon the knees  when our men came within two musket shot of them the spaniard governor ordered two muskets to be fired without ball to alarm them this he did that by their countenance he might know what to expect viz whether they were still in heart to fight or were so heartily beaten as to be dispirited and discouraged and so he might manage accordingly  this stratagem took for as soon as the savages heard the first gun and saw the flash of the second they started up upon their feet in the greatest consternation imaginable and as our men advanced swiftly toward them they all ran skreaming and yawling away with a kind of a howling noise which our men did not understand and had never heard before and thus they ran up the hills into the country  at first our men had much rather the weather had been calm and they had all gone away to sea but they did not then consider that this might probably have been the occasion of their coming again in such multitudes as not to be resisted or at least to come so many and so often as would quite desolate the island and starve them will atkins therefore who notwithstanding his wound kept always with them proved the best counselor in this case his advice was to take the advantage that offered and clap in between them and their boats and so deprive them of the capacity of ever returning any more to plague the island  they consulted long about this and some were against it for fear of making the wretches fly to the woods and live there desperate and so they should have them to hunt like wild beasts be afraid to stir out about their business and have their plantations continually rifled all their tame goats destroyed and in short be reduced to a life of continual distress  will atkins told them they had better have to do with a hundred men than with a hundred nations that as they must destroy their boats so they must destroy the men or be all of them destroyed themselves in a word he showed them the necessity of it so plainly that they all came into it so they went to work immediately with the boats and getting some dry wood together from a dead tree they tried to set some of them on fire but they were so wet that they would not burn however the fire so burned the upper part that it soon made them unfit for swimming in the sea as boats when the indians saw what they were about some of them came running out of the woods and coming as near as they could to our men kneeled down and cried oa oa waramokoa and some other words of their language which none of the others understood anything of but as they made pitiful gestures and strange noises it was easy to understand they begged to have their boats spared and that they would be gone and never come there again  but our men were now satisfied that they had no way to preserve themselves or to save their colony but effectually to prevent any of these people from ever going home again depending upon this that if ever so much as one of them got back into their country to tell the story the colony was undone so that letting them know that they should not have any mercy they fell to work with their canoes and destroyed them every one that the storm had not destroyed before at the sight of which the savages raised a hideous cry in the woods which our people heard plain enough after which they ran about the island like distracted men so that in a word our men did not really know at first what to do with them  nor did the spaniards with all their prudence consider that while they made those people thus desperate they ought to have kept good guard at the same time upon their platnations for though it is true they had driven away their cattle and the indians did not find out their main retreat i mean my old castle at the hill nor the cave in the valley yet they found out my plantation at the bower and pulled it all to pieces and all the fences and planting about it trod all the corn under foot tore up the vines and grapes being just then almost ripe and did to our men an inestimable damage though to themselves not one farthingworth of service  though our men were able to fight them upon all occasions yet they were in no condition to pursue them or hunt them up and down for as they were too nimble of foot for our men when they found them single so our men durst not go about single for fear of being surrounded with their numbers the best was they had no weapons for though they had bows they had no arrows left nor any materials to make any nor had they any edged tool or weapon among them  the extremity and distress they were reduced to was great and indeed deplorable but at the same time our men were also brought to very bad circumstances by them for though their retreats were preserved yet their provision was destroyed and their harvest spoiled and what to do or which way to turn themselves they knew not the only refuge they had now was the stock of cattle they had in the valley by the cave and some little corn which grew there and the plantation of the three englishmen william atkins and his comrades who were now reduced to two one of them being killed by an arrow which struck him on the side of his head just under the temple so that he never spoke more and it was very remarkable that this was the same barbarous fellow who cut the poor savage slave with his hatchet and who afterward intended to have murdered all the spaniards  i looked upon their case to have been worse at this time than mine was at any time after i first discovered the grains of barley and rice and got into the manner of planting and raising my corn and my tame cattle for now they had as i may say a hundred wolves upon the island which would devour every thing they could come at yet could very hardly be come at themselves  the first thing they concluded when they saw what their circumstances were was that they would if possible drive them up to the farther part of the island southwest that if any more savages came on shore they might not find one another then that they would daily hunt and harass them and kill as many of them as they could come at till they had reduced their number and if they could at last tame them and bring them to any thing they would give them corn and teach them how to plant and live upon their daily labor  in order to this they so followed them and so terrified them with their guns that in a few days if any of them fired a gun at an indian if he did not hit him yet he would fall down for fear and so dreadfully frighted they were that they kept out of sight farther and farther till at last our men following them and every day almost killing and wounding some of them they kept up in the woods and hollow places so much that it reduced them to the utmost misery for want of food and many were afterward found dead in the woods without any hurt but merely starved to death  when our men found this it made their hearts relent and pity moved them especially the spaniard governor who was the most gentlemanly generousminded man as ever i met with in my life and he proposed if possible to take one of them alive and bring him to understand what they meant so far as to be able to act as interpreter and to go among them and see if they might be brought to some conditions that might be depended upon to save their lives and to do us no spoil  it was some while before any of them could be taken but being weak and half starved one of them was at last surpised and made a prisoner he was sullen at first and would neither eat or drink but finding himself kindly used and victuals given him and no violence offered him he at last grew tractable and came to himself  they brought old friday to him who talked often with him and told him how kind the other would be to them all that they would not only save their lives but would give them a part of the island to live in provided they would give satisfaction that they would keep in their own bounds and not come beyond it to injure or prejudice others and that they should have corn given them to plant and make it grow for their bread and some bread given them for their present subsistence and old friday bad the fellow go and talk with the rest of his countrymen and see what they said to it assuring them that if they did not agree immediately they should be all destroyed  the poor wretches thoroughly humbled and reduced in number to about thirty seven closed with the proposal at the first offer and begged to have some food given them upon which twelve spaniards and two englishmen well armed with three indian slaves and old friday marched to the place where they were the three indian slaves carried them a large quantity of bread some rice boiled up to cakes and dried in the sun and three live goats and they were ordered to go to the side of a hill where they sat down eat the provisions very thankfully and were the most faithful fellows to their words that could be thought of for except when they came to beg victuals and directions they never came out of their bounds and there they lived when i came to the island and i went to see them  they had taught them both to plant corn make bread breed tame goats and milk them they wanted nothing but wives and they soon would have been a nation they were confined to a neck of land surrounded with high rocks behind them and lying plain toward the sea before them on the southeast corner of the island they had land enough and it was very good and fruitful they had a piece of land about a mile and half broad three or four mile in length  our men taught them to make wooden spades such as i made for myself and gave them among them twelve hatchets and three or four knives and there they lived the most subjected innocent creatures that ever were heard of  after this the colony enjoyed a perfect tranquillity with respect to the savages till i came to revisit them which was above two years not but that now and then some canoes of savages came on shore for their triumphal unnatural feasts but as they were of several nations and perhaps had never heard of those that came before or the reason of it they did not make any search or enquiry after their countrymen and if they had it would have been very hard to have found them out  thus i think i have given a full account of all that happened to them to my return at least that was worth notice the indians or savages were wonderfully civilized by them and they frequently went among them but forbid on pain of death any one of the indians coming to them because they would not have their settlement betrayed again  one thing was very remarkable viz that they taught the savages to make wickerwork or baskets but they soon outdid their masters for they made abundance of most ingenious things in wickerwork particularly all sorts of baskets sieves birdcages cupboards etc as also chairs to sit on stools beds couches and abundance of other things being very ingenious at such work when they were once put in the way of it  my coming was a particular relief to these people because we furnished them with knives scissars spades shovels pick axes and all things of that kind which they could want  with the help of these tools they were so very handy that they came at last to build up their huts or our houses very handsomely raddling or working it up like basketwork all the way round which was a very extraordinary piece of ingenuity and looked very odd but was an exceeding good fence as well against heat as against all sorts of vermin and our men were so taken with it that they got the wild savages to come and do the like for them so that when i came to see the two englishmens colonies they looked at a distance as if they lived all like bees in a hive and as for will atkins who was now become a very industrious necessary and sober fellow he had made himself such a tent of basketwork as i believe was never seen it was   0 paces round in the outside as i measured by my steps the walls were as close worked as a basket in pannels or squares of    in number and very strong standing about seven foot high in the middle was another not above    paces round but built stronger being eightsquare in its form and in the eight corners stood eight very strong posts round the top of which he laid strong pieces pinned together with wooden pins from which he raised a piramid for the roof of eight rafters very handsome i assure you and joined together very well though he had no nails and only a few iron spikes which he made himself too out of the old iron that i had left there and indeed this fellow showed abundance of ingenuity in several things which he had no knowledge of he made him a forge with a pair of wooden bellows to blow the fire he made himself charcoal for his work and he formed out of one of the iron crows a middling good anvil to hammer upon in this manner he made many things but especially hooks staples and spikes bolts and hinges but to return to the house after he had pitched the roof of his innermost tent he worked it up between the rafters with basketwork so firm and thatched that over again so ingeniously with ricestraw and over that a large leaf of a tree which covered the top that his house was as dry as if it had been tild or slated indeed he owned that the savages made the basketwork for him  the outer circuit was covered as a leantoo all round this inner apartment and long rafters lay from the two and thirty angles to the top posts of the inner house being about twenty foot distant so that there was a space like a walk within the outer wickerwall and without the inner near twenty foot wide  the inner place he partitiond off with the same wickerwork but much fairer and divided it into six apartments so that he had six rooms on a floor and out of every one of these there was a door first into the entry or coming into the main tent and another door into the space or walk that was round it so that walk was also divided into six equal parts which served not only for retreat but to store up any necessaries which the family had occasion for these six spaces not taking up the whole circumference what other apartments the outer circle had were thus ordered as soon as you were in at the door of the outer circle you had a short passage strait before you to the door of the inner house but on either side was a wicker partition and a door in it by which you went first into a large room or storehouse twenty foot wide and about thirty foot long and through that into another not quite so long so that in the outer circle was ten handsome rooms six of which were only to be come at through the apartments of the inner tent and served as closets or retiring rooms to the respective chambers of the inner circle and four large warehouses or barns or what you please to call them which went in through one another two on either hand of the passage that led through the outer door to the inner tent  such a piece of basketwork i believe was never seen in the world nor a house or tent so neatly contrived much less so built in this great beehive lived the three families that is to say will atkins and his companion the third was killed but his wife remained with three children for she was it seems big with child when he died and the other two were not at all backward to give the widow her full share of every thing i mean as to their corn milk grapes etc and when they killed a kid or found a turtle on the shore so that they all lived well enough though it was true they were not so industrious as the other two as has been observed already  one thing however cannot be omitted viz that as for religion i dont know that there was any thing of that kind among them they pretty often indeed put one another in mind that there was a god by the very common method of seamen viz swearing by his name nor were their poor ignorant savage wives much the better for having been married to christians as we must call them for as they knew very little of god themselves so they were utterly incapable of entering into any discourse with their wives about a god or to talk anything to them concerning religion  the utmost of all the improvement which i can say the wives had made from them was that they had taught them to speak english pretty well and all the children they had which was near  0 in all were taught to speak english too from their first learning to speak though they at first spoke it in a very broken manner like their mothers there were none of these children above six years old when i came thither for it was not much above seven years that they had fetched these five savage ladies over but they had all been pretty fruitful for they had all children more or less i think the cooks mates wife was big of her sixth child and the mothers were all a good sort of wellgoverned quiet laborious women modest and decent helpful to one another mighty observant and subject to their masters i cannot call them husbands and wanted nothing but to be well instructed in the christian religion and to be legally married both which were happily brought about afterward by my means or at least in consequence of my coming among them  having thus given an account of the colony in general and pretty much of my five runagate englishmen i must say something of the spaniards who were the main body of the family and in whose story there are some incidents also remarkable enough  i had a great many discourses with them about their circumstances when they were among the savages they told me readily that they had no instances to give of their application or ingenuity in that country that they were a poor miserable dejected handful of people that if means had been put into their hands they had yet so abandoned themselves to despair and so sunk under the weight of their misfortunes that they thought of nothing but starving one of them a grave and very sensible man told me he was convinced they were in the wrong that it was not the part of wise men to give up themselves to their misery but always to take hold of the helps which reason offered as well for present support as for future deliverance he told me that grief was the most senseless insignificant passion in the world for that it regarded only things past which were generally impossible to be recalled or to be remedied but had no view to things to come and had no share in any thing that looked like deliverance but rather added to the affliction than proposed a remedy and upon this he repeated a spanish proverb which though i cannot repeat in just the same words that he spoke in yet i remember i made it into an english proverb of my own thus in trouble to be troubled is to have your trouble doubled   he ran on then in remarks upon all the little improvements i had made in my solitude my unwearied application as he called it and how i had made a condition which in its circumstances was at first much worse than theirs a thousand times more happy than theirs was even now when they were all together he told me it was remarkable that englishmen had a greater presence of mind in their distress than any people that ever he met with that their unhappy nation and the portuguese were the worst men in the world to struggle with misfortunes for that their first step in dangers after the common efforts are over was always to despair lie down under it and die without rousing their thoughts up to proper remedies for escape  i told him their case and mine differed exceedingly that they were cast upon the shore without necessaries without supply of food or of present sustenance till they could provide that it is true i had this disadvantage and discomfort that i was alone but then the supplies i had providentially thrown into my hands by the unexpected driving of the ship on shore was such a help as would have encouraged any creature in the world to have applied himself as i had done seignior says the spaniard had we poor spaniards been in your case we should never have gotten half those things out of the ship as you did nay says he we should never have found means to have gotten a raft to carry them or to have gotten the raft on shore without boat or sail and how much less should we have done said he if any of us had been alone well i desired him to abate his compliment and go on with the history of their coming on shore where they landed he told me they unhappily landed at a place where there were people without provisions whereas had they had the common sense to have put off to sea again and gone to another island a little farther they had found provisions though without people there being an island that way as they have been told where there was provisions though no people that is to say that the spaniards of trinidad had frequently been there and had filled the island with goats and hogs at several times where they have bred in such multitudes and where turtle and seafowls were in such plenty that they could have been in no want of flesh though they had found no bread whereas here they were only sustained with a few roots and herbs which they understood not and which had no substance in them and which the inhabitants gave them sparingly enough and who could treat them no better unless they would turn canibals and eat mens flesh which was the great dainty of their country  they gave me an account how many ways they strove to civilize the savages they were with and to teach them rational customs in the ordinary way of living but in vain and how they retorted it upon them as unjust that they who came there for assistance and support should attempt to set up for instructors of those that gave them bread intimating it seems that none should set up for the instructors of others but those who could live without them  they gave me dismal accounts of the extremities they were driven to how sometimes they were many days without any food at all the island they were upon being inhabited by a sort of savages that lived more indolent and for that reason were less supplied with the necessaries of life than they had reason to believe others were in the same part of the world and yet they found that these savages were less ravenous and voracious than those who had better supplies of food  also they added that they could not but see with what demonstrations of wisdom and goodness the governing providence of god directs the events of things in the world which they said appeared in their circumstances for if pressed by the hardships they were under and the barrenness of the country where they were they had searched after a better place to live in they had then been out of the way of the relief that happened to them by my means  then they gave me an account how the savages who they lived among expected them to go out with them into their wars and it was true that as they had firearms with them had they not had the disaster to lose their ammunition they should not have been serviceable only to their friends but have made themselves terrible both to friends and enemies but being without powder and shot and yet in a condition that they could not in reason deny to go out with their landlords to their wars when they came into the field of battle they were in a worse condition than the savages themselves for they neither had bows or arrows nor could they use those the savages gave them so that they could do nothing but stand still and be wounded with arrows till they came up to the teeth of their enemy and then indeed the three halbards they had were of use to them and they would often drive a whole little army before them with those halbards and sharpened sticks put into the muzzles of their muskets but that for all this they were sometimes surrounded with multitudes and in great danger from their arrows till at last they found the way to make themselves large targets of wood which they covered with skins of wild beasts whose names they knew not and these covered them from the arrows of the savages that notwithstanding these they were sometimes in great danger and were once five of them knocked down together with the clubs of the savages which was the time when one of them was taken prisoner that is to say the spaniard whom i had relieved that at first they thought had been killed but when afterward they heard he was taken prisoner they were under the greatest grief imaginable and would willingly have all ventured their lives to have rescued him  they told me that when they were so knocked down the rest of their company rescued them and stood over them fighting till they were come to themselves all but him who they thought had been dead and then they made their way with their halbards and pieces standing close together in a line through a body of above a thousand savages beating down all that came in their way got the victory over their enemies but to their great sorrow because it was with the loss of their friend who the other party finding him alive carried off with some others as i gave an account in my former  they described most affectionately how they were surpised with joy at the return of their friend and companion in misery who they thought had been devoured by wild beasts of the worst kind viz by wild men and yet how more and more they were surpised with the account he gave them of his errand and that there was a christian in any place near much more one that was able and had humanity enough to contribute to their deliverance  they described how they were astonished at the sight of the relief i sent them and at the appearance of loaves of bread things they had not seen since their coming to that miserable place how often they crossed it and blessed it as bread sent from heaven and what a reviving cordial it was to their spirits to taste it as also of the other things i had sent for their supply and after all they would have told me something of the joy they were in at the sight of a boat and pilots to carry them away to the person and place from whence all these new comforts came but they told me it was impossible to express it by words for their excessive joy naturally driving them to unbecoming extravagancies they had no way to describe them but by telling me that they bordered upon lunacy having no way to give vent to their passion suitable to the sense that was upon them that in some it worked one way and in some another and that some of them through a surprise of joy would burst out into tears others be stark mad and others immediately faint this discourse extremely affected me and called to my mind fridays ecstasy when he met his father and the poor peoples ecstasy when i took them up at sea after their ship was on fire the mate of the ships joy when he found himself delivered in the place where he expected to perish and my own joy when after    years captivity i found a good ship ready to carry me to my own country all these things made me more sensible of the relation of those poor men and more affected with it  having thus given a view of the state of things as i found them i must relate the heads of what i did for these people and the condition in which i left them it was their opinion and mine too that they would be troubled no more with the savages or that if they were they would be able to cut them off if they were twice as many as before so they had no concern about that then i entered into a serious discourse with the spaniard whom i call governor about their stay in the island for as i was not come to carry any of them off so it would not be just to carry off some and leave others who perhaps would be unwilling to stay if their strength was diminished  on the other hand i told them i came to establish them there not to remove them and then i let them know that i had brought with me relief of sundry kinds for them that i had been at a great charge to supply them with all things necessary as well for their convenience as their defense and that i had such and such particular persons with me as well to increase and recruit their number as by the particular necessary employments which they were bred to being artificers to assist them in those things in which at present they were to seek  they were all together when i talked thus to them and before i delivered to them the stores i had brought i asked them one by one if they had entirely forgot and buried the first animosities that had been among them and would shake hands with one another and engage in a strict friendship and union of interest that so there might be no more misunderstandings or jealousies  will atkins with abundance of frankness and good humor said they had met with afflictions enough to make them all sober and enemies enough to make them all friends that for his part he would live and die with them and was so far from designing any thing against the spaniards that he owned they had done nothing to him but what his own mad humor made necessary and what he would have done and perhaps much worse in their case and that he would ask them pardon if i desired it for the foolish and brutish things he had done to them and was very willing and desirous of living in terms of entire friendship and union with them and would do any thing that lay in his power to convince them of it and as for going to england he eared not if he did not go thither these twenty years  the spaniards said they had indeed at first disarmed and excluded will atkins and his two countrymen for their ill conduct as they had let me know and they appealed to me for the necessity they were under to do so but that will atkins had behaved himself so bravely in the great fight they had with the savages and on several occasions since and had showed himself so faithful to and concerned for the general interest of them all that they had forgotten all that was past and thought he merited as much to be trusted with arms and supplied with necessaries as any of them and that they had testified their satisfaction in him by committing the command to him next to the governor himself and as they had an entire confidence in him and all his countrymen so they acknowledged they had merited that confidence by all the methods that honest men could merit to be valued and trusted and they most heartily embraced the occasion of giving me this assurance that they would never have any interest separate from one another  upon these frank and open declarations of friendship we appointed the next day to dine all together and indeed we made a splendid feast i caused the ships cook and his mate to come on shore and dress our dinner and the old cooks mate we had on shore assisted we brought on shore six pieces of good beef and four pieces of pork out of the ships provision with our punchbowl and materials to sill it and in particular i gave them ten bottles of french claret and ten bottles of english beer things that neither the spaniards or the english men had tasted for many years and which it may be supposed they were exceeding glad of  the spaniards added to our feast five whole kids which the cooks roasted and three of them were sent covered up close on board the ship to the seamen that they might feast on fresh meat from on shore as we did with their salt meat from on board  after this feast at which we were very innocently merry i brought out my cargo of goods wherein that there might be no dispute about dividing i showed them that there was sufficient for them all and desired that they might all take an equal quantity of the goods that were for wearing that is to say equal when made up as first i distributed linen sufficient to make every one of them four shirts and at the spaniards request afterward made them up six these were exceeding comfortable to them having been what as i may say they had long since forgot the use of or what it was to wear them  i allotted the thin english stuffs which i mentioned before to make every one a light coat like a frock which i judged fittest for the heat of the season cool and loose and ordered that whenever they decayed they should make more as they thought fit the like for pumps shoes stockings and hats etc  i cannot express what pleasure what satisfaction sat upon the countenances of all these poor men when they saw the care i had taken of them and how well i had furnished them they told me i was a father to them and that having such a correspondent as i was in so remote a part of the world it would make them forget that they were left in a desolate place and they all voluntarily engaged to me not to leave the place without my consent  then i presented to them the people i had brought with me particularly the tailor the smith and the two carpenters all of them most necessary people but above all my general artificer than whom they could not name any thing that was more useful to them and the tailor to show his concern for them went to work immediately and with my leave made them every one a shirt the first thing he did and which was still more he taught the women not only how to sow and stitch and use the needle but made them assist to make the shirts for their husbands and for all the rest  as to the carpenters i scarce need mention how useful they were for they took in pieces all my clumsy unhandy things and made them clever convenient tables stools bedsteads cupboards lockers shelves and every thing they wanted of that kind  but to let them see how nature made artificers at first i carried the carpenters to see will atkinss baskethouse as i called it and they both owned they never saw an instance of such natural ingenuity before nor any thing so regular and so handily built at least of its kind and one of them when he saw it after musing a good while turning about to me i am sure says he that man has no need of us you need do nothing but give him tools  then i brought them out all my store of tools and gave every man a diggingspade a shovel and a rake for we had no harrows or plows and to every separate place a pickax a crow a broad ax and a saw always appointing that as often as any were broken or worn out they should be supplied without grudging out of the general stores that i left behind  nails staples hinges hammers chissels knives scissars and all sorts of tools and ironwork they had without tale as they required for no man would care to take more than they wanted and he must be a fool that would wast or spoil them on any account whatever and for the use of the smith i left two ton of unwrought iron for a supply  my magazine of powder and arms which i brought them was such even to profusion that they could not but rejoice at them for now they could march as i used to do with a musket upon each shoulder if there was occasion and were able to fight a thousand savages if they had but some little advantages of situation which also they could not miss of if they had occasion  i carried on shore with me the young man whose mother was starved to death and the maid also she was a sober well educated religious young woman and behaved so inoffensively that every one gave her a good word she had indeed an unhappy life with us there being no woman in the ship but herself but she bore it with patience after a while seeing things so well ordered and in so fine a way of thriving upon my island and considering that they had neither business or acquaintance in the east indies or reason for taking so long a voyage i say considering all this both of them came to me and desired i would give them leave to remain on the island and be entered among my family as they called it  i agreed to it readily and they had a little plat of ground allotted to them where they had three tents or houses set up surrounded with a basketwork pallisadod like atkinss adjoining to his plantation their tents were contrived so that they had each of them a room apart to lodge in and a middle tent like a great storehouse to lay all their goods in and to eat and drink in and now the other two english men removed their habitation to the same place and so the island was divided into three colonies and no more viz the spaniards with old friday and the first servants at my old habitation under the hill which was in a word the capital city and where they had so enlarged and extended their works as well under as on the outside of the hill that they lived though perfectly concealed yet full at large never was there such a little city in a wood and so hid i believe in any part of the world for i verily believe a thousand men might have ranged the island a month and if they had not known there was such a thing and looked on purpose for it they would not have found it for the trees stood so thick and so close and grew so fast matted into one another that nothing but cutting them down first could discover the place except the only two narrow entrances where they went in and out could be found which was not very easy one of them was just down at the wateredge of the creek and it was afterward above two hundred yards to the place and the other was up the ladder at twice as i have already formerly described it and they had a large wood thick planted also on the top of the hill which contained above an acre which grew apace and covered the place from all discovery there with only one narrow place between two trees not easy to be discovered to enter on that side  the other colony was that of w atkinss where there were four families of english men i mean those i had left there with their wives and children three savages that were slaves the widow and children of the english man that was killed the young man and the maid and by the way we made a wife of her also before we went away there were also the two carpenters and the tailor who i brought with me for them also the smith who was a very necessary man to them especially as a gunsmith to take care of their arms and my other man who i called jack of all trades who was in himself as good almost as  0 men for he was not only a very ingenious fellow but a very merry fellow and before i went away we married him to the honest maid that came with the youth in the ship i mentioned before  and now i speak of marrying it brings me naturally to say something of the french ecclesiastic that i had brought with me out of the ships crew who i took up at sea it is true this man was a roman and perhaps it may give offense to some hereafter if i leave any thing extraordinary upon record of a man who before i begin i must to set him out in just colors represent in terms very much to his disadvantage in the account of protestants as first that he was a papist secondly a popish priest and thirdly a french popish priest  but justice demands of me to give him a due character and i must say he was a grave sober pious and most religious person exact in his life extensive in his charity and exemplar in almost every thing he did what then can any one say against my being very sensible of the value of such a man notwithstanding his profession though it may be my opinion perhaps as well as the opinion of others who shall read this that he was mistaken  the first hour that i began to converse with him after he had agreed to go with me to the east indies i found reason to delight exceedingly in his conversation and he first began with me about religion in the most obliging manner imaginable  sir says he you have not only under god and at that he crossed his breast saved my life but you have admitted me to go this voyage in your ship and by your obliging civility have taken me into your family giving me an opportunity of free conversation now sir says he you see by my habit what my profession is and i guess by your nation what yours is i may think it is my duty and doubtless it is so to use my utmost endeavors on all occasions to bring all the souls i can to the knowledge of the truth and to embrace the catholic doctrine but as i am here under your permission and in your family i am bound in justice to your kindness as well as in decency and good manners to be under your government and therefore i shall not without your leave enter into any debates on the point of religion in which we may not agree farther than you shall give me leave  i told him his carriage was so modest that i could not but acknowledge it that it was true we were such people as they called heretics but that he was not the first catholic that i had conversed with without falling into any inconveniences or carrying the questions to any height in debate that he should not find himself the worse used for being of a different opinion from us and if we did not converse without any dislike on either side upon that score it should be his fault not ours  he replied that he thought all our conversation might be easily separated from disputes that it was not his business to cap principles with every man he discoursed with and that he rather desired me to converse with him as a gentleman than as a religieuse that if i would give him leave at any time to discourse upon religious subjects he would readily comply with it and that then he did not doubt but i would allow him also to defend his own opinions as well as he could but that without my leave he would not break in upon me with any such thing  he told me farther that he would not cease to do all that became him in his office as a priest as well as a private christian to procure the good of the ship and the safety of all that was in her and though perhaps we would not join with him and he could not pray with us he hoped he might pray for us which he would do upon all occasions in this manner we conversed and as he was of a most obliging gentlemanlike behavior so he was if i may be allowed to say so a man of good sense and as i believe of great learning  he gave me a most diverting account of his life and of the many extraordinary events of it of many adventures which had befallen him in the few years that he had been abroad in the world and particularly this was very remarkable viz that in the voyage he was now engaged he had had the misfortune to be five times shipped and unshipd and never to go to the place whither any of the ships he was in were at first designed that his first intent was to have gone to martinico and that he went on board a ship bound thither at st malo but being forced into lisbon by bad weather the ship received some damage by running aground in the mouth of the river tagus and was obliged to unload her cargo there that finding a portuguese ship there bound to the maderas and ready to sail and supposing he should easily meet with a vessel there bound to martinico he went on board in order to sail to the maderas but the master of the portuguese ship being but an indifferent mariner had been out in his reckoning and they drove to fial where however he happened to find a very good market for his cargo which was corn and therefore resolved not to go to the maderas but to load salt at the isle of may and to go away to newfoundland he had no remedy in this exigence but to go with the ship and had a pretty good voyage as far as the banks so they call the place where they catch the fish where meeting with a french ship bound from france to quebeck in the river of canada and from thence to martinico to carry provisions he thought he should have an opportunity to complete his first design but when he came to quebeck the master of the ship died and the ship proceeded no farther so the next voyage he shipped himself for france in the ship that was burnt when we took them up at sea and then shipped with us for the east indies as i have already said thus he had been disappointed in five voyages all as i may call it in one voyage besides what i shall have occasion to mention farther of the same person  but i shall not make digressions into other mens stories which have no relation to my own i return to what concerns our affair in the island he came to me one morning for he lodged among us all the while we were upon the island and it happened to be just when i was going to visit the english mens colony at the farthest part of the island i say he came to me and told me with a very grave countenance that he had for two or three days desired an opportunity of some discourse with me which he hoped should not be displeasing to me because he thought it might in some measure correspond with my general design which was the prosperity of my new colony and perhaps might put it at least more than he yet thought it was in the way of gods blessing  i looked a little surpised at the last part of his discourse and turning a little short how sir said i can it be said that we are not in the way of gods blessing after such visible assistances and wonderful deliverances as we have seen here and of which i have given you a large account  if you had pleased sir said he with a world of modesty and yet with great readiness to have heard me you would have found no room to have been displeased much less to think so hard of me that i should suggest that you have not had wonderful assistances and deliverances and i hope on your behalf that you are in the way of gods blessing and your design is exceeding good and will prosper but sir though it were more so than is even possible to you yet there may be some among you that are not equally right in their actions and you know that in the story of the children of israel one achan in the camp removed gods blessing from them and turned his hand so against them that six and thirty of them though not concerned in the crime were the object of divine vengeance and bore the weight of that punishment  i was sensibly touched with his discourse and told him his inference was so just and the whole design seemed so sincere and was really so religious in its own nature that i was very sorry i had interrupted him and begged him to go on and in the mean time because it seemed that what we had both to say might take up some time i told him i was going to the english mens plantations and asked him to go with me and we might discourse of it by the way he told me he would more willingly wait on me thither because there partly the thing was acted which he desired to speak to me about so we walked on and i pressed him to be free and plain with me in what he had to say  why then sir says he be pleased to give me leave to lay down a few propositions as the foundation of what i have to say that we may not differ in the general principles though we may be of some differing opinions in the practice of particulars first sir though we differ in some of the doctrinal articles of religion and it is very unhappy that it is so especially in the case before us as i shall show afterward yet there are some general principles in which we both agree viz first that there is a god and that this god having given us some stated general rules for our service and obedience we ought not willingly and knowingly to offend him either by neglecting to do what he has commanded or by doing what he has expressly forbidden and let our different religions be what they will this general principle is readily owned by us all that the blessing of god does not ordinarily follow a presumptuous sinning against his command and every good christian will be affectionately concerned to prevent any that are under his care living in a total neglect of god and his commands it is not your men being protestants whatever my opinion may be of such that discharges me from being concerned for their souls and from endeavoring if it lies before me that they should live in as little distance from and enmity with their maker as possible especially if you give me leave to meddle so far in your circuit  i could not yet imagine what he aimed at and told him i granted all he had said and thanked him that he would so far concern himself for us and begged he would explain the particulars of what he had observed that like joshua to take his own parable i might put away the accursed thing from us  why then sir says he i will take the liberty you give me and there are three things which if i am right must stand in the way of gods blessing upon your endeavors here and which i should rejoice for your sake and their own to see removed and sir says he i promise myself that you will fully agree with me in them all as soon as i name them especially because i shall convince you that every one of them may with great ease and very much to your satisfaction be remedied  he gave me no leave to put in any more civilities but went on first sir says he you have here four english men who have fetched women from among the savages and have taken them as their wives and have had many children by them all and yet are not married to them after any stated legal manner as the laws of god and man require and therefore are yet in the sense of both no less than adulterers and living in adultery to this sir says he i know you will object that there was no clergyman or priest of any kind or of any profession to perform the ceremony nor any pen and ink or paper to write down a contract of marriage and have it signed between them and i know also sir what the spaniard governor has told you i mean of the agreement that he obliged them to make when they took these women viz that they should choose them out by consent and keep separately to them which by the way is nothing of a marriage no agreement with the women as wives but only an agreement among themselves to keep them from quarrelling  but sir the essence of the sacrament of matrimony so he called it being a roman consists not only in the mutual consent of the parties to take one another as man and wife but in the formal and legal obligation that there is in the contract to compel the man and woman at all times to own and acknowledge each other obliging the men to abstain from all other women to engage in no other contract while these subsist and on all occasions as ability allows to provide honestly for them and their children and to oblige the woman to the same or like conditions mutatis mutandis on their side  now sir says he these men may when they please or when occasion presents abandon these women disown their children leave them to perish and take other women and marry them whilst these are living and here he added with some warmth how sir is god honored in this unlawful liberty and how shall a blessing succeed your endeavors in this place however good in themselves and however sincere in your design while these men who at present are your subjects under your absolute government and dominion are allowed by you to live in open adultery  i confess i was struck at the thing itself but much more with the convincing arguments he supported it with for it was certainly true that though they had no clergyman upon the spot yet a formal contract on both sides made before witnesses and confirmed by any token which they had all agreed to be bound by though it had been but breaking a stick between them engaging the men to own these women for their wives upon all occasions and never to abandon them or their children and the women to the same with their husbands had been an effectual lawful marriage in the sight of god and it was a great neglect that it was not done  but i thought to have gotten off with my young priest by telling him that all that part was done when i was not here and they had lived so many years with them now that if it was an adultery it was past remedy they could do nothing in it now  sir says he asking your pardon for such freedom you are right in this that it being done in your absence you could not be charged with that part of the crime but i beseech you flatter not yourself that you are not therefore under an obligation to do your utmost now to put an end to it how can you think but that let the time past lie on who it will all the guilt for the future will lie entirely upon you because it is certainly in your power now to put an end to it and in no bodys power but yours  i was so dull still that i did not take him right but i imagined that by putting an end to it he meant that i should part them and not suffer them to live together any longer and i said to him i could not do that by any means for that it would put the whole island into confusion he seemed surpised that i should so far mistake him no sir says he i do not mean that you should now separate them but legally and effectually marry them now and as sir my way of marrying them may not be so easy to reconcile them to though it will be as effectual even by your own laws so your way may be as well before god and as valid among men i mean by a written contract signed by both man and woman and by all the witnesses present which all the laws of europe would decree to be valid  i was amazed to see so much true piety and so much sincerity of zeal besides the unusual impartiality in his discourse as to his own party or church and such true warmth for the preserving people that he had no knowledge of or relation to i say for preserving them from transgressing the laws of god the like of which i had indeed not met with any where but recollecting what he had said of marrying them by a written contract which i knew would stand too i returned it back upon him and told him i granted all that he had said to be just and on his part very kind that i would discourse with the men upon the point now when i came to them and i knew no reason why they should scruple to let him marry them all which i knew well enough would be granted to be as authentic and valid in england as if they were married by one of our own clergymen what was afterward done in this matter i shall speak of by itself  i then pressed him to tell me what was the second complaint which he had to make acknowledging that i was very much his debtor for the first and thanked him heartily for it he told me he would use the same freedom and plainness in the second and hoped i would take it as well and this was that notwithstanding these english subjects of mine as he called them had lived with those women for almost seven years had taught them to speak english and even to read it and that they were as he perceived women of tolerable understanding and capable of instruction yet they had not to this hour taught them any thing of the christian religion no not so much as to know that there was a god or a worship or in what manner god was to be served or that their own idolatry and worshipping they knew not who was false and absurd  this he said was an unaccountable neglect and what god would certainly call them to account for and perhaps at last take the work out of their hands he spoke this very affectionately and warmly i am persuaded says he had those men lived in the savage country whence their wives came the savages would have taken more pains to have brought them to be idolaters and to worship the devil than any of these men so far as he could see had taken with them to teach them the knowledge of the true god now sir said he though i do not acknowledge your religion or you mine yet we should be glad to see the devils servants and the subjects of his kingdom taught to know the general principles of the christian religion that they might at least hear of god and of a redeemer and of the resurrection and of a future state things which we all believe they had at least been so much nearer coming into the bosom of the true church than they are now in the public profession of idolatry and devilworship  i could hold no longer i took him in my arms and embraced him with an excess of passion how far said i to him have i been from understanding the most essential part of a christian viz to love the interest of the christian church and the good of other mens souls i scarce have known what belongs to being a christian o sir do not say so replied he this thing is not your fault no says i but why did i never lay it to heart as well as you it is not too late yet said he be not too forward to condemn yourself but what can be done now said i you see i am going away will you give me leave said he to talk with those poor men about it yes with all my heart said i and will oblige them to give heed to what you say too as to that said he we must leave them to the mercy of christ but it is our business to assist them encourage them and instruct them and if you will give me leave and god his blessing i do not doubt but the poor ignorant souls shall be brought home into the great circle of christianity if not into the particular faith that we all embrace and that even while you stay here upon this i said i shall not only give you leave but give you a thousand thanks for it what followed on this account i shall mention also again in its place  i now pressed him for the third article in which we were to blame why really says he it is of the same nature and i will proceed asking your leave with the same plainness as before it is about your poor savages who are as i may say your conquered subjects it is a maxim sir that is or ought to be received among all christians of what church or pretended church soever viz the christian knowledge ought to be propagated by all possible means and on all possible occasions it is on this principle that our church sends missionaries into persia india and china and that our clergy even of the superior sort willingly engage in the most hazardous voyages and the most dangerous residence among murderers and barbarians to teach them the knowledge of the true god and to bring them over to embrace the christian faith now sir you have such an opportunity here to have six or seven and thirty poor savages brought over from idolatry to the knowledge of god their maker and redeemer that i wonder how you can pass such an occasion of doing good which is really worth the expense of a mans whole life  i was now struck dumb indeed and had not one word to say i had here a spirit of true christian zeal for god and religion before me let his particular principles be of what kind soever as for me i had not so much as entertained a thought of this in my heart before and i believe should not have thought of it for i looked upon these savages as slaves and people who had we had any work for them to do we would have used as such or would have been glad to have transported them to any other part of the world for our business was to get rid of them and we would all have been satisfied if they had been sent to any country so they had never seen their own but to the case i say i was confounded at his discourse and knew not what answer to make him he looked earnestly at me seeing me in some disorder sir says he i shall be very sorry if what i have said gives you any offense no no says i i am offended with no body but myself but i am perfectly confounded not only to think that i should never take any notice of this before but with reflecting what notice i am able to take of it now you know sir said i what circumstances i am in i am bound to the east indies in a ship freighted by merchants and to whom it would be an unsufferable piece of injustice to detain their ship here the men lying all this while at victuals and wages upon the owners account it is true i agreed to be allowed twelve days here and if i stay more i must pay   l sterling per diem demorage nor can i stay upon demorage above eight days more and i have been here thirteen days already so that i am perfectly unable to engage in this work unless i would suffer myself to be left behind here again in which case if this single ship should miscarry in any part of her voyage i should be just in the same condition that i was left in here at first and from which i have been so wonderfully delivered  he owned the case was very hard upon me as to my voyage but laid it home upon my conscience whether the blessing of saving seven and thirty souls was not worth my venturing all i had in the world for i was not so sensible of that as he was i returned upon him thus why sir it is a valuable thing indeed to be an instrument in gods hand to convert seven and thirty heathens to the knowledge of christ but as you are an ecclesiastic and are given over to the work so that it seems so naturally to fall into the way of your profession how is it that you do not rather offer yourself to undertake it than press me to it  upon this he faced about just before me as we walked along and putting me to a full stop made me a very low bow i most heartily thank god and you sir says he for giving me so evident a call to so blessed a work and if you think your self discharged from it and desire me to undertake it i will most readily do it and think it a happy reward for all the hazards and difficulties of such a broken disappointed voyage as i have met with that i may be dropped at last into so glorious a work  i discovered a kind of rapture in his face while he spoke this to me his eyes sparkld like fire his face glowed and his color came and went as if he had been falling into fits in a word he was fired with the joy of being embarked in such a work i paused a considerable while before i could tell what to say to him for i was really surpised to find a man of such sincerity and zeal and carried out in his zeal beyond the ordinary rate of men not of his profession only but even of any profession whatsoever but after i had considered it awhile i asked him seriously if he was in earnest and that he would venture on the single consideration of an attempt on those poor people to be locked up in an unplanted island for perhaps his life and at last might not know whether he should be able to do them any good or not  he turned short upon me and asked me what i called a venture pray sir said he what do you think i consented to go in your ship to the east indies for nay said i that i know not unless it was to preach to the indians doubtless it was said he and do you think if i can convert these seven and thirty men to the faith of christ it is not worth my time though i should never be fetched off the island again nay is it not infinitely of more worth to save so many souls than my life is or the life of twenty more of the same profession yes sir says he i would give christ and the blessed virgin thanks all my days if i could be made the least happy instrument of saving the souls of these poor men though i was never to set my foot off of this island or see my native country any more but since you will honor me says he with putting me into this work for which i will pray for you all the days of my life i have one humble petition to you said he besides what is that said i why says he it is that you will leave your man friday with me to be my interpreter to them and to assist me for without some help i cannot speak to them or they to me  i was sensibly troubled at his requesting friday because i could not think of parting with him and that for many reasons he had been the companion of my travels he was not only faithful to me but sincerely affectionate to the last degree and i had resolved to do something considerable for him if he outlived me as it was probable he would then i knew that as i had bred friday up to be a protestant it would quite confound him to bring him to embrace another profession and he would never while his eyes were open believe that his old master was a heretic and would be damned and this might in the end ruin the poor fellows principles and so turn him to his first idolatry  however a sudden thought relieved me in this strait and it was this i told him i could not say that i was willing to part with friday on any account whatever though a work that to him was of more value than his life ought to be to me of much less value than the keeping or parting with a servant but on the other hand i was persuaded that friday would by no means consent to part with me and i could not force him to it without his consent without manifest injustice because i had promised i would never put him away and he had promised and engaged to me that he would never leave me unless i put him away  he seemed very much concerned at it for he had no rational access to these poor people seeing he did not understand one word of their language nor they one word of his to remove this difficulty i told him fridays father had learned spanish which i found he also understood and he should serve him for an interpreter so he was much better satisfied and nothing could persuade him but he would stay to endeavor to convert them but providence gave another and very happy turn to all this  i come back now to the first part of his objections when we came to the english men i sent for them all together and after some account given them of what i had done for them viz what necessary things i had provided for them and how they were distributed which they were very sensible of and very thankful for i began to talk to them of the scandalous life they led and gave them a full account of the notice the clergyman had already taken of it and arguing how unchristian and irreligious a life it was i first asked them if they were married men or batchelors they soon explained their condition to me and showed me that two of them were widowers and the other three were single men or batchelors i asked them with what consciences they could take these women and lie with them as they had done call them their wives and have so many children by them and not be married lawfully to them  they all gave me the answer that i expected viz that there was no body to marry them that they agreed before the governor to keep them as their wives and to keep them and own them as their wives and they thought as things stood with them they were as legally married as if they had been married by a parson and with all the formalities in the world  i told them that no doubt they were married in the sight of god and were bound in conscience to keep them as their wives but that the laws of men being otherwise they might pretend they were not married and so desert the poor women and children hereafter and that their wives being poor desolate women friendless and moneyless would have no way to help themselves i therefore told them that unless i was assured of their honest intent i could do nothing for them but would take care that what i did should be for the women and their children without them and that unless they would give some assurances that they would marry the women i could not think it was convenient they should continue together as man and wife for that it was both scandalous to men and offensive to god who they could not think would bless them if they went on thus  all this went on as i expected and they told me especially will atkins who seemed now to speak for the rest that they loved their wives as well as if they had been born in their own native country and would not leave them upon any account whatever and they did very believe their wives were as virtuous and as modest and did to the utmost of their skill as much for them and for their children as any women could possibly do and they would not part with them on any account and will atkins for his own particular added if any man would take him away and offer to carry him home to england and make him captain of the best man of war in the navy he would not go with him if he might not carry his wife and children with him and if there was a clergyman in the ship he would be married to her now with all his heart  this was just as i would have it the priest was not with me at that moment but was not far off so to try him farther i told him i had a clergyman with me and if he was sincere i would have him married the next morning and bid him consider of it and talk with the rest he said as for himself he need not consider of it at all for he was very ready to do it and was glad i had a minister with me and he believed they would be all willing also i then told him that my friend the minister was a french man and could not speak english but that i would act the clerk between them he never so much as asked me whether he was papist or protestant which was indeed what i was afraid of but i say they never inquired about it so we parted i went back to my clergyman and will atkins went in to talk with his companions i desired the french gentleman not to say any thing to them till the business was thorough ripe and i told him what answer the men had given me  before i went from their quarter they all came to me and told me they had been considering what i had said that they were very glad to hear i had a clergyman in my company and they were very willing to give me the satisfaction i desired and to be formally married as soon as i pleased for they were far from desiring to part with their wives and that they meant nothing but what was very honest when they chose them so i appointed them to meet me the next morning and that in the mean time they should let their wives know the meaning of the marriagelaw and that it was not only to prevent any scandal but also to oblige them that they should not forsake them whatever might happen  the women were easily made sensible of the meaning of the thing and were very well satisfied with it as indeed they had reason to be so they failed not to attend all together at my apartment the next morning where i brought out my clergyman and though he had not on a ministers gown after the manner of england or the habit of a priest after the manner of france yet having a black vest something like a cassock with a sash round it he did not look very unlike a minister and as for his language i was his interpreter  but the seriousness of his behavior to them and the scruples he made of marrying the women because they were not baptized and professed christians gave them an exceeding reverence for his person and there was no need after that to enquire whether he was a clergyman or no  indeed i was afraid his scruple would have been carried so far as that he would not have married them at all nay notwithstanding all i was able to say to him he resisted me though modestly yet very steadily and at last refused absolutely to marry them unless he had first talked with the men and the women too and though at first i was a little backward to it yet at last i agreed to it with a good will perceiving the sincerity of his design  when he came to them he let them know that i had acquainted him with their circumstances and with the present design that he was very willing to perform that part of his function and marry them as i had desired but that before he could do it he must take the liberty to talk with them he told them that in the sight of all indifferent men and in the sense of the laws of society they had lived all this while in an open adultery and that it was true that nothing but the consenting to marry or effectually separating them from one another now could put an end to it but there was a difficulty in it too with respect to the laws of christian matrimony which he was not fully satisfied about viz that of marrying one that is a professed christian to a savage an idolater and a heathen one that is not baptized and yet that he did not see that there was time left for it to endeavor to persuade the women to be baptized or to profess the name of christ whom they had he doubted heard nothing of and without which they could not be baptized  he told them he doubted they were but indifferent christians themselves that they had but little knowledge of god or of his ways and therefore he could not expect that they had said much to their wives on that head yet but that unless they would promise him to use their endeavor with their wives to persuade them to become christians and would as well as they could instruct them in the knowledge and belief of god that made them and to worship jesus christ that redeemed them he could not marry them for he would have no hand in joining christians with savages nor was it consistent with the principles of the christian religion and was indeed expressly forbidden in gods law  they heard all this very attentively and i delivered it very faithfully to them from his mouth as near his own words as i could only sometimes adding something of my own to convince them how just it was and how i was of his mind and i always very faithfully distinguished between what i said from myself and what were the clergymans words they told me it was very true what the gentleman had said that they were but very indifferent christians themselves and that they had never talked to their wives about religion lord sir says will atkins how should we teach them religion why we know nothing ourselves and besides sir said he should we go to talk to them of god and jesus christ and heaven and hell twould be to make them laugh at us and ask us what we believe ourselves and if we should tell them we believe all the things that we speak of to them such as of good people going to heaven and wicked people to the devil they would ask us where we intend to go ourselves that believe all this and are such wicked fellows as we indeed are why sir it is enough to give them a surfeit of religion at first hearing folks must have some religion themselves before they pretend to teach other people will atkins said i to him though i am afraid what you say has too much truth in it yet can you not tell your wife that she is in the wrong that there is a god and a religion better than her own that her gods are idols that they can neither hear nor speak that there is a great being that made all things and that can destroy all that he had made that he rewards the good and punishes the bad and that we are to be judged by him at last for all we do here you are not so ignorant but even nature itself will teach you that all this is true and i am satisfied you know it all to be true and believe it yourself  that is true sir said atkins but with what face can i say any thing to my wife of all this when she will tell me immediately it cannot be true  not true said i what do you mean by that why sir said he she will tell me it cannot be true that this god i shall tell her of can be just or can punish or reward since i am not punished and sent to the devil that have been such a wicked creature as she knows i have been even to her and to every body else and that i should be suffered to live that have been always acting so contrary to what i must tell her is good and to what i ought to have done  why truly atkins said i i am afraid thou speak too much truth and with that i let the clergyman know what atkins had said for he was impatient to know o said the priest tell him there is one thing will make him the best minister in the world to his wife and that is repentance for none teach repentance like true penitents he wants nothing but to repent and then he will be so much the better qualified to instruct his wife he will be then able to tell her that there is not only a god and that he is the just rewarder of good and evil but that he is a merciful being and with infinite goodness and longsuffering forbears to punish those that offend waiting to be gracious and willing not the death of a sinner but rather that he should return and live that oftentimes suffers wicked men to go on a long time and even reserves damnation to the general day of retribution that it is a clear evidence of god and of a future state that righteous men receive not their reward or wicked men their punishment till they come into another world and this will lead him to teach his wife the doctrine of the resurrection and of the last judgment let him but repent for himself he will be an excellent preacher of repentance to his wife  i repeated all this to atkins who looked very serious all the while and who we could easily perceive was more than ordinarily affected with it when being eager and hardly suffering me to make an end i know all this master says he and a great deal more but i have not the impudence to talk thus to my wife when god and my own conscience knows and my  will be an undeniable evidence against me that i have lived as if i had never heard of a god or future state or any thing about it and to talk of my repenting alas and with that he fetched a deep sigh and i could see that tears stood in his eyes it is past all that with me past it atkins said i what do thou mean by that i know well enough what i mean says he i mean it is too late and that is too true  i told my clergyman word for word what he said the poor zealous priest i must call him so for be his opinion what it will he had certainly a most singular affection for the good of other mens souls and it would be hard to think he had not the like for his own i say this zealous affectionate man could not refrain tears also but recovering himself he said to me ask him but one question is he easy that it is too late or is he troubled and wishes it were not so i put the question fairly to atkins and he answered with a great deal of passion how could any man be easy in a condition that certainly must end in eternal destruction that he was far from being easy but that on the contrary he believed it would one time or other ruin him  what do you mean by that said i why he said he believed he should one time or other cut his throat to put an end to the terror of it  the clergyman shook his head with a great concern in his face when i told him all this but turning quick to me upon it says he if that be his case you may assure him it is not too late christ will give him repentance but pray says he explain this to him that as no man is saved but by christ and the merit of his passion procuring divine mercy for him how can it be too late for any man to receive mercy does he think he is able to sin beyond the power or reach of divine mercy pray tell him there may be a time when provoked mercy will no longer strive and when god may refuse to hear but that it is never too late for men to ask mercy and we that are christs servants are commanded to preach mercy at all times in the name of jesus christ to all those that sincerely repent so that it is never too late to repent  i told atkins all this and he heard me with great earnestness but it seemed as if he turned off the discourse to the rest for he said to me he would go and have some talk with his wife so he went out awhile and we talked to the rest i perceived they were all stupidly ignorant as to matters of religion much as i was when i went rambling away from my father and yet that there were none of them backward to hear what had been said and all of them seriously promised that they would talk with their wives about it and do their endeavor to persuade them to turn christians  the clergyman smiled upon me when i reported what answer they gave but said nothing a good while but at last shaking his head we that are christs servants says he can go no further than to exhort and instruct and when men comply submit to the reproof and promise what we ask it is all we can do we are bound to accept their good words but believe me sir said he whatever you may have known of the life of that man you call will atkins i believe he is the only sincere convert among them i take that man to be a true penitent i wont despair of the rest but that man is apparently struck with the sense of his past life and i doubt not but when he comes to talk religion to his wife he will talk himself effectually into it for attempting to teach others is sometimes the best way of teaching our selves i knew a man who having nothing but a summary notion of religion himself and being wicked and profligate to the last degree in his life made a thorough reformation in himself by laboring to convert a jew if that poor atkins begins but once to talk seriously of jesus christ to his wife my life for it he talks himself into a thorough convert makes himself a penitent and who knows what may follow  upon this discourse however and their promising as above to endeavor to persuade their wives to embrace christianity he married the other three couple but will atkins and his wife were not yet come in after this my clergyman waiting a while was curious to know where atkins was gone and turning to me says he i entreat you sir let us walk out of your labyrinth here and look i dare say we shall find this poor man somewhere or other talking seriously to his wife and teaching her already something of religion i began to be of the same mind so we went out together and i carried him a way which none knew but my self and where the trees were so thick set as that it was not easy to see through the thicket of leaves and far harder to see in than to see out when coming to the edge of the wood i saw atkins and his tawny savage wife sitting under the shade of a bush very eager in discourse i stopped short till my clergyman came up to me and then having showed him where they were we stood and looked very steadily at them a good while  we observed him very earnest with her pointing up to the sun and to every quarter of the heavens then down to the earth then out to the sea then to himself then to her to the woods to the trees now says my clergyman you see my words are made good the man preaches to her mark him now he is telling her that our god has made him and her and the heavens the earth the sea the woods the trees etc i believe he is said i immediately we perceived will atkins start up upon his feet fall down on his knees and lift up both his hands we suppose he said something but we could not hear him it was too far for that he did not continue kneeling half a minute but comes and sits down again by his wife and talks to her again we perceived then the woman very attentive but whether she said any thing or no we could not tell while the poor fellow was upon his knees i could see the tears run plentifully down my clergymans cheeks and i could hardly forbear my self but it was a great affliction to us both that we were not near enough to hear any thing that passed between them  well however we could come no nearer for fear of disturbing them so we resolved to see an end of this piece of still conversation and it spoke loud enough to us without the help of voice he sat down again as i have said close by her and talked again earnestly to her and two or three times we could see him embrace her most passionately another time we saw him take out his handkerchief and wipe her eyes and then kiss her again with a kind of transport very unusual and after several of these things we see him on a sudden jump up again and lend her his hand to help her up when immediately leading her by the hand a step or two they both kneeled down together and continued so about two minutes  my friend could bear it no longer but cries out aloud st paul st paul behold he prays i was afraid atkins would hear him therefore i entreated him to withhold himself awhile that we might see an end of the scene which to me i must confess was the most affecting and yet the most agreeable that ever i saw in my life well he strove with himself and contained himself for a while but was in such raptures of joy to think that the poor heathen woman was become a christian that he was not able to contain himself he wept several times then throwing up his hands and crossing his breast said over several things ejaculatory and by way of giving god thanks for so miraculous a testimony of the success of our endeavors some he spoke softly and i could not well hear others audibly some in latin some in french then two or three times the tears of joy would interrupt him that he could not speak at all but i begged that he would compose himself and let us more narrowly and fully observe what was before us which he did for a time and the scene was not ended there yet for after the poor man and his wife were risen again from their knees we observed he stood talking still eagerly to her and we observed by her motion that she was greatly affected with what he said by her frequent lifting up her hands laying her hand to her breast and such other postures as usually express the greatest seriousness and attention this continued about half a quarter of an hour and then they walked away too so that we could see no more of them in that situation  i took this interval to talk with my clergyman and first i told him i was glad to see the particulars we had both been witnesses to that though i was hard enough of belief in such cases yet that i began to think it was all very sincere here both in the man and his wife however ignorant they might both be and i hoped such a beginning would have a yet more happy end and who knows said i but these two may in time by instruction and example work upon some of the others some of them said he turning quick upon me ay upon all of them depend upon it if those two savages for he has been but little better as you relate it should embrace jesus christ they will never leave till they work upon all the rest for true religion is naturally communicative and he that is once made a christian will never leave a pagan behind him if he can help it i owned it was a most christian principle to think so and a testimony of a true zeal as well as a generous heart in him but my friend said i will you give me leave to start one difficulty here i cannot tell how to object the least thing against that affectionate concern which you show for the turning the poor people from their paganism to the christian religion but how does this comfort you while these people are in your account out of the pale of the catholic church without which you believe there is no salvation so that you esteem these but heretics and for other reasons as effectually lost as the pagans themselves  to this he answered with abundance of candor and christian charity thus sir i am a catholic of the roman church and a priest of the order of st benedict and i embrace all the principles of the roman faith but yet if you will believe me and that i do not speak in compliment to you or in respect to my circumstances and your civilities i say nevertheless i do not look upon you who call your selves reformed without some charity i dare not say though i know it is our opinion in general i say i dare not say that you cannot be saved i will by no means limit the mercy of christ so far as to think that he cannot receive you into the bosom of his church in a manner to us unperceivable and which it is impossible for us to know and i hope you have the same charity for us i pray daily for your being all restored to christs church by whatsoever methods he who is allwise is pleased to direct in the mean time sure you will allow it to consist with me as a roman to distinguish far between a protestant and a pagan between one that calls on jesus christ though in a way which i do not think is according to the true faith and a savage a barbarian that knows no god no christ no redeemer and if you are not within the pale of the catholic church we hope you are nearer being restored to it than those that know nothing of god or his church and i rejoice therefore when i see this poor man who you say has been a profligate and almost a murderer kneel down and pray to jesus christ as we suppose he did though not fully enlightened believing that god from whom every such work proceeds will sensibly touch his heart and bring him to the further knowledge of that truth in his own time and if god shall influence this poor man to convert and instruct the ignorant savage his wife i can never believe that he shall be cast away himself and have i not reason then to rejoice the nearer any are brought to the knowledge of christ though they may not be brought quite home into the bosom of the catholic church just at the time when i may desire it leaving it to the goodness of christ to perfect his work in his own time and his own way certainly i would rejoice if all the savages in america were brought like this poor woman to pray to god though they were to be all protestants at first rather than they should continue pagans and heathens firmly believing that he that had bestowed the first light to them would further illuminate them with a beam of his heavenly grace and bring them into the pale of his church when he should see good  i was astonished at the sincerity and temper of this truly pious papist as much as i was oppressed by the power of his reasoning and it presently occurred to my thoughts that if such a temper was universal we might be all catholic christians whatever church or particular profession we joined to or joined in that a spirit of charity would soon work us all up into right principles and in a word as he thought that the like charity would make us all catholics so i told him i believed had all the members of his church the like moderation they would soon be all protestants and there we left that part for we never disputed at all  however i talked to him another way and taking him by the hand my friend says i i wish all the clergy of the roman church were blessed with such moderation and had an equal share of your charity i am entirely of your opinion but i must tell you that if you should preach such doctrine in spain or italy they would put you into the inquisition  it may be so said he i know not what they might do in spain or italy but i will not say they would be the better christians for that severity for i am sure there is no heresy in too much charity  well as will atkins and his wife were gone our business there was over so we went back our own way and when we came back we found them waiting to be called in observing this i asked my clergyman if we should discover to him that we had seen him under the bush or no and it was his opinion we should not but that we should talk to him first and hear what he would say to us so we called him in alone no body being in the place but our selves and i began with him thus  will atkins said i prithee what education had you what was your father  wa a better man than ever i shall be sir my father was a clergyman   rc what education did he give you   wa he would have taught me well sir but i despised all education instruction or correction like a beast as i was   rc it is true solomon says he that despises reproof is brutish   wa ay sir i was brutish indeed i murdered my father for gods sake sir talk no more about that sir i murdered my poor father   pr ha a murderer    here the priest started for i interpreted every word as he spoke it and looked pale it seems be believed that will had really killed his own father  rc no no sir i do not understand him so will atkins explain yourself you did not kill your father did you with your own hands   wa no sir i did not cut his throat but i cut the thread of all his comforts and shortened his days i broke his heart by the most ungrateful unnatural return for the most tender affectionate treatment that ever father gave or child could receive   rc well i did not ask you about your father to extort this confession i pray god give you repentance for it and forgive you that and all your other sms but i asked you because i see that though you have not much learning yet you are not so ignorant as some are in things that are good that you have known more of religion a great deal than you have practiced   wa though you sir did not extort the confession that i make about my father conscience does and when ever we come to look back upon our lives the sins against our indulgent parents are certainly the first that touch us the wounds they make lie deepest and the weight they leave will lie heaviest upon the mind of all the sins we can commit   rc you talk too feelingly and sensibly for me atkins i cannot bear it   wa you bear it master i dare say you know nothing of it   rc yes atkins every shore every hill nay i may say every tree in this island is witness to the anguish of my soul for my ingratitude and base usage of a good tender father a father much like yours by your description and i murdered my father as well as you will atkins but i think for all that my repentance is short of yours too  by a great deal    i would have said more if i could have restrained my passions but i thought this poor mans repentance was so much sincerer than mine that i was going to leave off the discourse and retire for i was surpised with what he said and thought that instead of my going about to teach and instruct him the man was made a teacher and instructor to me in a most surprising and unexpected manner  i laid all this before the young clergyman who was greatly affected with it and said to me did i not say sir that when this man was converted he would preach to us all i tell you sir if this one man be made a true penitent here will be no need of me he will make christians of all in the island but having a little composed my self i renewed my discourse with will atkins  but will said i how comes the sense of this matter to touch you just now  wa sir you have set me about a work that has struck a dart through my very soul i have been talking about god and religion to my wife in order as you directed me to make a christian of her and she has preached such a sermon to me as i shall never forget while i live   rc no no it is not your wife has preached to you but when you were moving religious arguments to her conscience has flung them back upon you   wa ay sir with such a force as is not to be resisted   rc pray will let us know what passed between you and your wife for i know something of it already   wa sir it is impossible to give you a full account of it i am too full to hold it and yet have no tongue to express but let her have said what she will and though i cannot give you an account of it this i can tell you of it that i resolve to amend and reform my life   rc but tell us some of it how did you begin will for this has been an extraordinary case that is certain she has preached a sermon indeed if she has wrought this upon you   wa why i first told her the nature of our laws about marriage and what the reasons were that men and women were obliged to enter into such compacts as it was neither in the power of one or other to break that otherwise order and justice could not be maintained and men would run from their wives and abandon their children mix confusedly with one another and neither families be kept entire or inheritances be settled by legal descent   rc you talk like a civilian will could you make her understand what you meant by inheritance and families they know no such thing among the savages but marry any how without regard to relation consanguinity or family brother and sister nay as i have been told even the father and daughter and son and the mother   wa i believe sir you are misinformed and my wife assures me of the contrary and that they abhor it perhaps for any farther relations they may not be so exact as we are but she tells me they never touch one another in the near relations you speak of   rc well what did she say to what you told her   wa she said she liked it very well and it was much better than in her country   rc but did you tell her what marriage was   wa ay ay there began all our dialogue i asked her if she would be married to me our way she asked me what way that was i told her marriage was appointed by god and here we had a strange talk together indeed as ever man and wife had i believe   nb this dialogue between w atkins and his wife as i took it down in writing just after he told it me was as follows  wife appointed by your god why have you a god in your country   wa yes my dear god is in every country   wife no you god in my country my country have the great old benamuckee god   wa child i am very unfit to show you who god is god is in heaven and made the heaven and the earth the sea and all that in them is   wife no makee de earth no you god make all earth no make my country   wa laughed a little at her expression of god not making her country  wife no laugh why laugh me this no thing to laugh    he was justly reproved by his wife for she was more serious than he at first  wa that is true indeed i will not laugh any more my dear   wife why you say you god make all   wa yes child our god made the whole world and you and i and all things for he is the only true god there is no god but him he lives for ever in heaven   wife why you no tell me long ago   wa that is true indeed but i have been a wicked wretch and have not only forgotten to acquaint thee with any thing before but have lived without god in the world my self   wife what have you de great god in you country you no kno him no say o to him no do good thing for him that no possible   wa it is too true though for all that we live as if there was no god in heaven or that he had no power on earth   wife but why god let you do so why he no makee you good live   wa it is all our own fault   wife but you say me he is great much great have much great power can makee kill when he will why he no makee kill when you no serve him no say o to him no be good mans   wa that is true he might strike me dead and i ought to expect it for i have been a wicked wretch that is true but god is merciful and does not deal with us as we deserve   wife but then do not you tell god tankee for that too   wa no indeed i have not thanked god for his mercy any more than i have feared god for his power   wife than you god no god me no think believe he be such one great much power strong no makee kill you though you makee him much angry   wa what will my wicked life hinder you from believing in god what a dreadful creature am i and what a sad truth is it that the horrid lives of christians hinders the conversions of heathens   wife how me tink you have great much god  up there and yet no do well no do good thing can he tell sure he no tell what you do    she points up to heaven  wa yes yes he knows and sees all things he hears us speak sees what we do knows what we think though we do not speak   wife what he no hear you swear curse speak the great damn   wa yes yes he hears it all   wife where be then the muchee great power strong   wa he is merciful that is all we can say for it and this proves him to be the true god he is god and not man and therefore we are not consumed    here will atkins told us he was struck with horror to think how he could tell his wife so clearly that god sees and hears and knows the secret thoughts of the heart and all that we do and yet that he had dared to do all the vile things he had done  wife merciful what you call that   wa he is our father and maker and he pities and spares us   wife so then he never makee kill never angry when you do wicked then he no good himself or no great able   wa yes yes my dear he is infinitely good and infinitely great and able to punish too and sometimes to show his justice and vengeance he lets fly his anger to destory sinners and make examples many are cut off in their sins   wife but no make kill you yet than he tell you may be that he no make you kill so you make de bargain with him you do bad thing he no be angry at you when he be angry at other mans   wa no indeed my sins are all presumptions upon his goodness and he would be infinitely just if he destroyed me as he has done other men   wife well and yet no kill no makee you dead what you say to him for that you no tell him tankee for all that too   wa i am an unthankful ungrateful dog that is true   wife why he no makee you much good better you say he makee you   wa he made me as he made all the world it is i have deformed my self and abused his goodness and made my self an abominable wretch   wife i wish you makee god know me i no makee him angry i no do bad wicked thing   here will atkins said his heart sunk within him to hear a poor untaught creature desire to be taught to know god and he such a wicked wretch that he could not say one word to her about god but what the reproach of his own carriage would make most irrational to her to believe nay that already she had told him that she could not believe in god because he that was so wicked was not destroyed  wa my dear you mean you wish i could teach you to know god not god to know you for he knows you already and every thought in your heart   wife why then he know what i say to you now he know me wish to know him how shall me know who makee me   wa poor creature he must teach thee i cannot teach thee i will pray to him to teach thee to know him and to forgive me that i am unworthy to teach thee   the poor fellow was in such an agony at her desiring him to make her know god and her wishing to know him that he said he fell down on his knees before her and prayed to god to enlighten her mind with the saving knowledge of jesus christ and to pardon his sins and accept of his being the unworthy instrument of instructing her in the principles of religion after which he sat down by her again and their dialogue went on nb this was the time when we saw him kneel down and lift up his hands  wife what you put down the knee for what you hold up the hand for what you say who you speak to what is all that   wa my dear i bow my knees in token of my submission to him that made me i said o to him as you call it and as you say your old men do to their idol benamukee that is i prayed to him   wife what you say o to him for   wa i prayed to him to open your eyes and your understanding that you may know him and be accepted by him   wife can he do that too   wa yes he can he can do all things   wife but now he hear what you say   wa yes he has bid us pray to him and promised to hear us   wife bid you pray when he bid you how he bid you what you hear him speak   wa no we do not hear him speak but he has revealed himself many ways to us   here he was at a great loss to make her understand that god has revealed himself to us by his word and what his word was but at last he told it her thus  wa god has spoken to some good men in former days even from heaven by plain words and god has inspired good men by his spirit and they have written all his laws down in a book   wife me no understand that where is book   wa alas my poor creature i have not this book but i hope i shall one time or other get it for you and help you to read it   here he embraced her with great affection but with inexpressible grief that he had not a bible  wife but how you makee me know that god teachee them to write that book   wa by the same rule that we know him to be god   wife what rule what way you know him   wa because he teaches and commands nothing but what is good righteous and holy and ends to make us perfectly good as well as perfectly happy and because he forbids and commands us to avoid all that is wicked that is evil in it self or evil in its consequences   wife that me would understand that me fain see if he teachee all good thing forbid all wicked thing he reward all good thing punish all wicked thing he make all thing he give all thing he hear me when i say o to him as you go do just now he makee me good if i wish be good he spare me no makee kill me when i no be good all this you say he do yet he be great god me take think believe him be great god me say o to him too with you my dear   here the poor man could forbear no longer but raising her up made her kneel by him and he prayed to god aloud to instruct her in the knowledge of himself by his spirit and that by some good providence if possible she might sometime or other come to have a bible that she might read the word of god and be taught by it to know him  this was the time that we saw him lift her up by the hand and saw him kneel down by her as above  they had several other discourses it seems after this too long to set down here and particularly she made him promise that since he confessed his own life had been a wicked abominable course of provocation against god that he would reform it and not make god angry any more least he should make him dead as she called it and then she should be left alone and never be taught to know this god better and least he should be miserable as he had told her wicked men should be after death  this was a strange account and very affecting to us both but particularly to the young clergyman he was indeed wonderfully surpised with it but under the greatest affliction imaginable that he could not talk to her that he could not speak english to make her understand him and as she spoke but very broken english he could not understand her however he turned himself to me and told me that he believed there must be more to do with this woman than to marry her i did not understand him at first but at length he explained himself viz that she ought to be baptized  i agreed with him in that part readily and was for going about it presently no no hold sir said he though i would have her be baptized by all means yet i must observe that will atkins her husband has indeed brought her in a wonderful manner to be willing to embrace a religious life and has given her just ideas of the being of a god of his power justice mercy yet i desire to know of him if he had said any thing to her of jesus christ and of the salvation of sinners of the nature of faith in him and redemption by him of the holy spirit the resurrection the last judgment and a future state  i called will atkins again and asked him but the poor fellow fell immediately into tears and told us he had said something to her of all those things but that he was himself so wicked a creature and his own conscience so reproached him with his horrid ungodly life that he trembled at the apprehensions that her knowledge of him should lessen the attention she should give to those things and make her rather contemn religion than receive it but he was assured he said that her mind was so disposed to receive due impressions of all those things that if i would but discourse with her she would make it appear to my satisfaction that my labor would not be lost upon her  according i called her in and placing my self as interpreter between my religious priest and the woman i entreated him to begin with her but sure such a sermon was never preached by a popish priest in these latter ages of the world and as i told him i thought he had all the zeal all the knowledge all the sincerity of a christian without the error of a roman catholic and that i took him to be such a clergyman as the roman bishops were before the church of rome assumed spiritual sovereignty over the consciences of men  in a word he brought the poor woman to embrace the knowledge of christ and of redemption by him not with wonder and astonishment only as she did the first notions of a god but with joy and faith with an affection and a surprising degree of understanding scarce to be imagined much less to be expressed and at her own request she was baptized  when he was preparing to baptize her i entreated him that he would perform that office with some caution that the man might not perceive he was of the roman church if possible because of other ill consequences which might attend a difference among us in that very religion which we were instructing the other in he told me that as he had no consecrated chapel no proper things for the office i should see he would do it in a manner that i should not know by it that he was a roman catholic my self if i had not known it before and so he did for saying only some words over to himself in latin which i could not understand he poured a whole dishful of water upon the womans head pronouncing in french very loud mary which was the name her husband desired me to give her for i was her godfather i baptize thee in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost so that none could know any thing by it what religion he was of he gave the benediction afterward in latin but either will atkins did not know but it was in french or else did not take notice of it at that time  as soon as this was over we married them and after the marriage was over he turned himself to will atkins and in a very affectionate manner exhorted him not only to presevere in that good dispotion he was in but to support the convictions that were upon him by a resolution to reform his life told him it was in vain to say he repented if he did not forsake his crimes represented to him how god had honored him with being the instrument of bringing his wife to the knowledge of the christian religion and that he should be careful he did not dishonor the grace of god and that if he did he would see the heathen a better christian than himself the savage converted and the instrument cast away  he said a great many good things to them both and then recommending them in a few words to gods goodness gave them the benediction again i repeating every thing to them in english and thus ended the ceremony i think it was the most pleasant agreeable day to me that ever i passed in my whole life  but my clergyman had not done yet his thoughts hung continually upon the conversion of the seven and thirty savages and fain he would have stayed upon the island to have undertaken it but i convinced him first that his undertaking was impracticable in it self and secondly that perhaps i would put it into a way of being done in his absence to his satisfaction of which by and by  having thus brought the affair of the island to a narrow compass i was preparing to go on board the ship when the young man who i had taken out of the famished ships company came to me and told me he understood i had a clergyman with me and that i had caused the english men to be married to the savages whom they called wives that he had a match too which he desired might be finished before i went between two christians which he hoped would not be disagreeable to me  i knew this must be the young woman who was his mothers servant for there was no other christian woman on the island so i began to persuade him not to do any thing of that kind rashly or because he found himself in this solitary circumstance i represented to him that he had some considerable substance in the world and good friends as i understood by himself and by his maid also that the maid was not only poor and a servant but was unequal to him she being six or seven and twenty years old and he not above seventeen or eighteen that he might very probably with my assistance make a remove from this wilderness and come into his own country again and that then it would be a thousand to one but he would repent his choice and the dislike of that circumstance might be disadvantagious to both i was going to say more but he interrupted me smiling and told me with a great deal of modesty that i mistook in my guesses that he had nothing of that kind in his thoughts his present circumstance being melancholy and disconsolate enough and he was very glad to hear that i had thoughts of putting them in a way to see their country again and nothing should have put him upon staying there but that the voyage i was going was so exceeding long and hazardous and would carry him quite out of the reach of all his friends that he had nothing to desire of me but that i would settle him in some little property in the island where he was give him a servant or two and some few necessaries and he would settle himself here like a planter waiting the good time when if ever i returned to england i would redeem him and hoped i would not be unmindful of him when i came into england that he would give me some letters to his friends in london to let them know how good i had been to him and in what part of the world and what circumstance i had left him in that he promised me that whenever i redeemed him the plantation and all the improvements he had made upon it let the value be what it would should be wholly mine  his discourse was very prettily delivered considering his youth and was the more agreeable to me because he told me positively the match was not for himself i gave him all possible assurances that if i lived to come safe to england i would deliver his letters and do his business effectually and that he might depend i would never forget the circumstance i had left him in but still i was impatient to know who was the person to be married upon which he told me it was my jack of all trades and his maid susan  i was most agreeably surprised when he named the match for indeed i thought it very suitable the character of that man i have given already and as for the maid she was a very honest modest sober and religious young woman had a very good share of sense was agreeable enough in her person spoke very handsomely and to the purpose always with decency and good manners and not backward to speak when any thing required it or impertinently forward to speak when it was not her business very handy and housewifely in any thing that was before her an excellent manager and fit indeed to have been governess to the whole island she knew very well how to behave to all kind of folks she had about her and to better if she had found any there  the match being proposed in this manner we married them the same day and as i was father at the altar as i may say and gave her away so i gave her a portion for i appointed her and her husband a handsome large space of ground for their plantation and indeed this match and the proposal the young gentleman made to give him a small property in the island put me upon parcelling it out amongst them that they might not quarrel afterward about their situation  this sharing out the land to them i left to will atkins who indeed was now grown a most sober grave managing fellow perfectly reformed exceeding pious and religious and as far as i may be allowed to speak positively in such a case i verily believe was a true sincere penitent  he divided things so justly and so much to every ones satisfaction that they only desired one general writing under my hand for the whole which i caused to be drawn up and signed and sealed to them setting out the bounds and situation of every mans plantation and testifying that i gave them thereby severally a right to the whole possession and inheritance of the respective plantations or farms with their improvements to them and their heirs reserving all the rest of the island as my own property and a certain rent for every particular plantation after eleven years if i or any one from me or in my name came to demand it producing an attested copy of the same writing  as to the government and laws among them i told them i was not capable of giving them better rules than they were able to give themselves only made them promise me to live in love and good neighborhood with one another and so i prepared to leave them  one thing i must not omit and this is that being now settled in a kind of commonwealth among themselves and having much business in hand it was but odd to have seven and thirty indians live in a nook of the island independent and indeed unemployd for excepting the providing themselves food which they had difficulty enough in too sometimes they had no manner of business or property to manage i proposed therefore to the governor spaniard that he should go to them with fridays father and propose to them to remove and either plant for themselves or take them into their several families as servants to be maintained for their labor but without being absolute slaves for i would not admit them to make them slaves by force by any means because they had their liberty given them by capitulation and as it were articles of surrender which they ought not to break  they most willingly embraced the proposal and came all very cheerfully along with him so we allotted them land and plantations which three or four accepted of but all the rest chose to be employed as servants in the several families we had settled and thus my colony was in a manner settled as follows the spaniards possessed my original habitation which was the capital city and extended their plantations all along the side of the brook which made the creek that i have so often described as far as my bower and as they increased their culture it went always eastward the english lived in the northeast part where w atkins and his comrades began and came on southward and southwest toward the back part of the spaniards and every plantation had a great addition of land to take in if they found occasion so that they need not jostle one another for want of room  all the east end of the island was left uninhabited that if any of the savages should come on shore there only for their usual customary barbarities they might come and go if they disturbed no body no body would disturb them and no doubt but they were often ashore and went away again for i never heard that the planters were ever attacked or disturbed any more  it now came into my thoughts that i had hinted to my friend the clergyman that the work of converting the savages might perhaps be set on foot in his absence to his satisfaction and i told him that now i thought it was put in a fair way for the savages being thus divided among the christians if they would but every one of them do their part with those which came under their hands i hoped it might have a very good effect  he agreed presently in that if said he they will do their part but how says he shall we obtain that of them i told him we would call them altogether and leave it in charge with them or go to them one by one which he thought best so we divided it he to speak to the spaniards who were all papists and i to the english who were all protestants and we recommended it earnestly to them and made them promise that they never would make any distinction of papist or protestant in their exhorting the savages to turn christians but teach them the general knowledge of the true god and of their savior jesus christ and they likewise promised us that they would never have any differences or disputes one with another about religion  when i came to w atkinss house i may call it so for such a house or such a piece of basketwork i believe was not standing in the world again i say when i came there i found the young woman i have mentioned above and w atkinss wife were become intimates and this prudent religious young woman had perfected the work will atkins had begun and though it was not above four days after what i have related yet the new baptized savage woman was made such a christian as i have seldom heard of any like her in all my observation or conversation in the world  it came next into my mind in the morning before i went to them that amongst all the needful things i had to leave with them i had not left them a bible in which i showed my self less considering for them than my good friend the widow was for me when she sent me the cargo of an hundred pounds from lisbon where she packed up   bibles and a prayerbook however the good womans charity had a greater extent than ever she imagined for they were reserved for the comfort and instruction of those that made much better use of them than i had done  i took one of the bibles in my pocket and when i came to will atkinss tent or house and found the young woman and atkinss baptized wife had been discoursing of religion together for w atkins told it me with a great deal of joy i asked if they were together now and he said yes so i went into the house and he with me and we found them together very earnest in discourse o sir says will atkins when god has sinners to reconcile to himself and aliens to bring home he never wants a messenger my wife has got a new instructor i knew i was unworthy as i was incapable of that work that young woman has been sent hither from heaven she is enough to convert a whole island of savages the young woman blushed and rose up to go away but i desired her to sit still i told her she had a good work upon her hands and i hoped god would bless her in it  we talked a little and i did not perceive they had any book among them though i did not ask but i put my hand in my pocket and pulled out my bible here says i to atkins i have brought you an assistant that perhaps you had not before the man was so confounded that he was not able to speak for some time but recovering himself he takes it with both his hands and turning to his wife here my dear says he did not i tell you our god though he lives above could hear what we said here is the book i prayed for when you and i kneeled down under the bush now god has heard us and sent it when he had said so the man fell into such transports of a passionate joy that between the joy of having it and giving god thanks for it the tears run down his face like a child that was crying  the woman was surprised and was like to have run into a mistake that none of us were aware of for she firmly believed god had sent the book upon her husbands petition it is true that providentially it was so and might be taken so in a consequent sense but i believed it would have been no difficult matter at that time to have persuaded the poor woman to have believed that an express messenger came from heaven on purpose to bring that individual book but it was too serious a matter to suffer any delusion to take place so i turned to the young woman and told her we did not desire to impose upon the new convert in her first and more ignorant understanding of things and begged her to explain to her that god may be very properly said to answer our petitions when in the course of his providence such things are in a particular manner brought to pass as we petitioned for but we do not expect returns from heaven in a miraculous and particular manner and that it is our mercy that it is not so  this the young woman did afterward effectually so that there was i assure you no priestcraft used here and i should have thought it one of the most unjustifiable frauds in the world to have had it so but the surprise of joy upon will atkins is really not to be expressed and there we may be sure there was no delusion sure no man was ever more thankful in the world for any thing of its kind than he was for this bible nor i believe never any man was glad of a bible from a better principle and though he had been a most profligate creature desperate headstrong outrageous furious and wicked to a great degree yet this man is a standing rule to us all for the well instructing children viz that parents should never give over to teach and instruct or ever despair of the success of their endeavors let the children be ever so obstinate refractory or to appearance insensible of instruction for if ever god in his providence touches the consciences of such the force of their education returns upon them and the early instruction of parents is not lost though it may have been many years laid asleep but some time or other they may find the benefit of it  thus it was with this poor man however ignorant he was or divested of religion and christian knowledge he found he had some to do with now more ignorant than himself and that the least part of the instruction of his good father that could now come to his mind was of use to him  among the rest it occurred to him he said how his father used to insist much upon the inexpressible value of the bible the privilege and blessing of it to nations families and persons but he never entertained the least notion of the worth of it till now when being to talk to heathens savages and barbarians he wanted the help of the written oracle for his assistance  the young woman was very glad of it also for the present occasion though she had one and so had the youth on board our ship among their goods which were not yet brought on shore and now having said so many things of this young woman i cannot omit telling one story more of her and my self which has something in it very informing and remarkable  i have related to what extremity the poor young woman was reduced how her mistress was starved to death and did die on board that unhappy ship we met at sea and how the whole ships company being reduced to the last extremity the gentlewoman and her son and this maid were first hardly used as to provisions and at last totally neglected and starved that is to say brought to the last extremity of hunger  one day being discoursing with her upon the extremities they suffered i asked her if she could describe by what she had felt what it was to starve and how it appeared she told me she believed she could and she told her tale very distinctly thus first sir said she we had for some days fared exceeding hard and suffered very great hunger but now at last we were wholly without food of any kind except sugar and a little wine and a little water the first day after i had received no food at all i found my self toward evening first empty and sickish at my stomach and nearer night mightily inclined to yawning and sleepy i laid down on a couch in the great cabin to sleep and slept about three hours and awaked a little refreshed having taken a glass of wine when i lay down after being about three hours awake it being about five aclock in the morning i found my self empty and my stomach sickish and laid down again but could not sleep at all being very faint and ill and thus i continued all the second day with a strange variety first hungry then sick again with reachings to vomit the second night being obliged to go to bed again without any food more than a draught of fair water and being asleep i dreamed i was at barbados and that the market was mightily stocked with provisions that i bought some for my mistress and went and dined very heartily  i thought my stomach was as full after this as any would have been after or at a good dinner but when i waked i was exceedingly sunk in my spirits to find my self in the extremity of famine the last glass of wine we had i drank and put sugar in it because of its having some spirit to supply nourishment but there being no substance in the stomach for the digesting office to work upon i found the only effect of the wine was to raise disagreeable fumes from the stomach into the head and i lay as they told me stupid and senseless as one drunk for some time  the third day in the morning after a night of strange and confused inconsistent dreams and rather dozing than sleeping i waked ravenous and furious with hunger and i question had not my understanding returned and conquered it i say i question whether if i had been a mother and had had a little child with me its life would have been safe or not  this lasted about three hours during which time i was twice raging mad as any creature in bedlam as my young master told me and as he can now inform you  in one of these fits of lunacy or distraction whether by the motion of the ship or some slip of my foot i know not i fell down and struck my face against the corner of a palate bed in which my mistress lay and with the blow the blood gushed out of my nose and the cabin boy bringing me a little basin i sat down and bled into it a great deal and as the blood run from me i came to my self and the violence of the flame or the fever i was in abated and so did the ravenous part of the hunger  then i grew sick and reached to vomit but could not for i had nothing in my stomach to bring up after i had bled some time i swoond and they all believed i was dead but i came to my self soon after and then had a most dreadful pain in my stomach not to be described not like the cholick but a gnawing eager pain for food and toward night it went off with a kind of earnest wishing or longing for food something like as i suppose the longing of a woman with child i took another draught of water with sugar in it but my stomach loathed the sugar and brought it all up again then i took a draught of water without sugar and that stayed with me and i laid me down upon the bed praying most heartily that it would please god to take me away and composing my mind in hopes of it i slumberd awhile and then waking thought my self dying being light with vapors from an empty stomach i recommended my soul then to god and earnestly wished that some body would throw me into the sea  all this while my mistress lay by me just as i thought expiring but bore it with much more patience than i and gave the last bit of bread she had left to her child my young master who would not have taken it but she obliged him to eat it and i believe it saved his life  toward the morning i slept again and first when i awaked i fell into a violent passion of crying and after that had a second fit of violent hunger i got up ravenous and in a most dreadful condition had my mistress been dead as much as i loved her i am certain i should have eaten a piece of her flesh with as much relish and as unconcerned as ever i did the the flesh of any creature appointed for food and once or twice i was going to bite my own arm at last i saw the basin in which was the blood i had bled at my nose the day before i ran to it and swallowed it with such haste and such a greedy appetite as if i had wondered no body had taken it before and afraid it should be taken from me now  though after it was down the thoughts of it filled me with horror yet it checked the fit of hunger and i drank a draught of fair water and was composed and refreshed for some hours after it this was the  th day and thus i held it till toward night when within the compass of three hours i had all these several circumstances over again one after another viz sick sleepy eagerly hungry pain in the stomach then ravenous again then sick again then lunatic then crying then ravenous again and so every quarter of an hour and my strength wasted exceedingly at night i laid me down having no comfort but in the hope that i should die before morning  all this night i had no sleep but the hunger was now turned into a disease and i had a terrible cholick and griping by wind instead of food having found its way into the bowels and in this condition i lay till morning when i was surpised a little with the cries and lamentations of my young master who called out to me that his mother was dead i lifted my self up a little for i had not strength to rise but found she was not dead though she was able to give very little signs of life  i had then such convulsions in my stomach for want of some sustenance that i cannot describe with such frequent throws and pangs of appetite that nothing but the tortures of death can imitate and in this condition i was when i heard the seamen above cry out a sail a sail and hallow and jump about as if they were distracted  i was not able to get off from the bed and my mistress much less and my young master was so sick that i thought he had been expiring so we could not open the the cabindoor or get any account what it was as occasioned such a combustion nor had we had any conversation with the ships company for two days they having told us that they had not a mouthful of any thing to eat in the ship and they told us afterward they thought we had been dead  it was this dreadful condition we were in when you were sent to save our lives and how you found us sir you know as well as i and better too    this was her own relation and is such a distinct account of starving to death as i confess i never met with and was exceeding entertaining to me i am the rather apt to believe it to be a true account because the youth gave me an account of a good part of it though i must own not so distinct and so feelingly as his maid and the rather because it seems his mother fed him at the price of her own life but the poor maid though her constitution being stronger than that of her mistress who was in years and a weakly woman too she might struggle harder with it i say the poor maid might be supposed to feel the extremity something sooner than her mistress who might be allowed to keep the last bit something longer than she parted with any to relieve the maid no question as the case is here related if our ship or some other had not so providentially met them a few days more would have ended all their lives unless they had prevented it by eating one another and even that as their case stood would have served them but a little while they being  00 leagues from any land or any possibility of relief other than in the miraculous manner it happened but this is by the way i return to my disposition of things among the people  and first it is to be observed here that for many reasons i did not think fit to let them know any thing of the sloop i had framed and which i thought of setting up among them for i found at least at my first coming such seeds of divisions among them that i saw it plainly had i set up the sloop and left it among them they would upon every light disgust have separated and gone away from one another or perhaps have turned pirates and so made the island a den of thieves instead of a plantation of sober and religious people so as i intended it nor did i leave the two pieces of brass cannon that i had on board or the two quarter deck guns that my nephew took extraordinarily for the same reason i thought it was enough to qualify them for a defensive war against any that should invade them but not to set them up for an offensive war or to encourage them to go abroad to attack others which in the end would only bring ruin and destruction upon themselves and all their undertaking i reserved the sloop therefore and the guns for their service another way as i shall observe in its place  i have now done with the island i left them all in good circumstances and in a flourishing condition and went on board my ship again the of having been five and twenty days among them and as they were all resolved to stay upon the island till i came to remove them i promised to send some further relief from the brasils if i could possibly find an opportunity and particularly i promised to send them some cattle such as sheep hogs and cows for as to the two cows and calves which i brought from england we had been obliged by the length of our voyage to kill them at sea for want of hay to feed them  the next day giving them a salute of five guns at parting we set sail and arrived at the bay of all saints in the brasils in about    days meeting nothing remarkable in our passage but this that about three days after we sailed being becalmed and the current setting strong to the ene running as it were into a bay or gulf on the land side we were driven something out of our course and once or twice our men cried land to the eastward but whether it was the continent or islands we could not tell by any means  but the third day toward evening the sea smooth and the weather calm we saw the sea as it were covered toward the land with something very black not being able to discover what it was till after some time our chief mate going up the main shrowds a little way and looking at them with a perspective cried out it was an army i could not imagine what he meant by an army and spoke a little hastily calling the fellow a fool or some such word nay sir says he dont be angry for it is an army and a fleet too for i believe there are a thousand canoes and you may see them paddle along and they are coming toward us too apace  i was a little surpised then indeed and so was my nephew the captain for he had heard such terrible stories of them in the island and having never been in those seas before that he could not tell what to think of it but said two or three times we should all be devoured i must confess considering we were becalmed and the current set strong toward the shore i liked it the worse however i bad him not be afraid but bring the ship to an anchor as soon as we came so near to know that we must engage them  the weather continued calm and they came on apace toward us so i gave order to come to an anchor and furle all our sails as for the savages i told them they had nothing to fear but fire and therefore they should get their boats out and fasten them one close by the head and the other by the stern and man them both well and wait the issue in that posture this i did that the men in the boats might be ready with skeets and buckets to put out any fire these savages might endeavor to fix to the outside of the ship  in this posture we lay by for them and in a little while they came up with us but never was such a horrid sight seen by christians my mate was much mistaken in his calculation of their number i mean of a thousand canoes the most we could make of them when they came up being about a hundred and six and twenty and a great many of them too for some of them had sixteen or seventeen men in them and some more and the least six or seven  when they came nearer to us they seemed to be struck with wonder and astonishment as at a sight which they had doubtless never seen before nor could they at first as we afterward understood know what to make of us they came boldly up however very near to us and seemed to go about to row round us but we called to our men in the boats not to let them come too near them  this very order brought us to an engagement with them without our designing it for five or six of their large canoes came so near our longboat that our men beckoned with their hands to them to keep back which they understood very well and went back but at their retreat about  0 arrows came on board us from those boats and one of our men in the longboat was very much wounded  however i called to them not to fire by any means but we handed down some dealboards into the boat and the carpenter presently set up a kind of a fence like waste boards to cover them from the arrows of the savages if they should shoot again  about half an hour afterward they came all up in a body astern of us and pretty near us so near that we could easily discern what they were though we could not tell their design and i easily found they were some of my old friends the same sort of savages that i had been used to engage with and in a little time more they rowed a little farther out to sea till they came directly broadside with us and then rowed down strait upon us till they came so near that they could hear us speak upon this i ordered all my men to keep close least they should shoot any more arrows and made all our guns ready but being so near as to be within hearing i made friday go out upon the deck and call out aloud to them in his language to know what they meant which accordingly he did whether they understood him or not that i knew not but as soon as he had called to them six of them who were in the foremost or nighest boat to us turns their canoes from us and stooping down showed us their naked backsides just as if in english saving your presence they had bid us kiss  whether this was a defiance or challenge we know not or whether it was done in mere contempt or as a signal to the rest but immediately friday cried out they were going to shoot and unhappily for him poor fellow they let fly about  00 of their arrows and to my inexpressible grief killed poor friday no other man being in their sight the poor fellow was shot with no less than three arrows and about three more fell very near him such unlucky marksmen they were  i was so enraged with the loss of my old servant the companion of all my sorrows and solitudes that i immediately ordered five guns to be loaded with small shot and four with great and gave them such a broadside as they had never heard in their lives before to be sure  they were not above half a cable length off when we fired and our gunners took their aim so well that three or four of their canoes were overset as we had reason to believe by one shot only  the ill manners of turning up their bare backsides to us gave us no great offense neither did i know for certain whether that which would pass for the greatest contempt among us might be understood so by them or not therefore in return i had only resolved to have fired four or five guns at them with powder only which i knew would fright them sufficiently but when they shot at us directly with all the fury they were capable of and especially as they had killed my poor friday who i so entirely loved and valued and who indeed so well deserved it i not only had been justified before god and man but would have been very glad if i could to have overset every canoe there and drowned every one of them  i can neither tell how many we killed or how many we wounded at this broadside but sure such a fright and hurry never was seen among such a multitude there were    or    of their canoes split and overset in all and the men all set a swimming the rest frighted out of their wits scoured away as fast as they could taking but little care to save those whose boats were split or spoiled with our shot so i suppose that they were many of them lost and our men took up one poor fellow swimming for his life above an hour after they were all gone  our small shot from our cannon must needs kill and wound a great many but in short we never knew any thing how it went with them for they fled so fast that in three hours or thereabouts we could not see above three or four straggling canoes nor did we ever see the rest any more for a breeze of wind springing up the same evening we weighed and set sail for the brasils  we had a prisoner indeed but the creature was so sullen that he would neither eat or speak and we all fansied he would starve himself to death but i took a way to cure him for i made them take him and turn him into the longboat and make him believe they would toss him into the sea again and so leave him where they found him if he would not speak nor would that do but they really did throw him into the sea and came away from him and then he followed them for he swam like a cork and called to them in his tongue though they knew not one word of what he said however at last they took him in again and then he began to be more tractable nor did i ever design they should drown him  we were now under sail again but i was the most disconsolate creature alive for want of my man friday and would have been very glad to have gone back to the island to have taken one of the rest from thence for my occasion but it could not be so we went on we had one prisoner as i have said and twas a long while before we could make him understand any thing but in time our men taught him some english and he began to be a little tractable afterward we inquired what country he came from but could mke nothing of what he said for his speech was so odd all gutturals and spoke in the throat in such an hollow odd manner that we could never form a word from him and we were all of opinion that they might speak that language as well if they were gagged as otherwise nor could we perceive that they had any occasion either for teeth tongue lips or palate but formed their words just as a hunting horn forms a tune with an open throat he told us however some time after when we had taught him to speak a little english that they were going with their kings to fight a great battle when he said kings we asked him how many kings he said they were five nation we could not make him understand the plural s and that they all joined to go against two nation we asked him what made them come up to us he said to makee te great wonder look where it is to be observed that all those natives as also those of africa when they learn english they always add two es at the end of the words where we use one and make the accent upon them as makee takee and the like and we could not break them of it nay i could hardly make friday leave it off though at last he did  and now i name the poor fellow once more i must take my last leave of him poor honest friday we buried him with all the decency and solemnity possible by putting him into a coffin and throwing him into the sea and i causdem to fire eleven guns for him and so ended the life of the most grateful faithful honest and most affectionate servant that ever man had  we went now away with a fair wind for brasil and in about twelve days time we made land in the latitude of five degrees south of the line being the northeastermost land of all that part of america we kept on s by e in sight of the shore four days when we made cape st augustine and in three days came to an anchor off of the bay of all saints the old place of my deliverance from whence came both my good and evil fate  never ship came to this part that had less business than i had and yet it was with great difficulty that we were admitted to hold the least correspondence on shore not my partner himself who was alive and made a great figure among them not my two merchants trustees not the fame of my wonderful preservation in that island could obtain me that favor but my partner remembering that i had given  00 moidores to the prior of the monastery of the augustines and     to the poor went to the monastery and obliged the prior that then was to go to the governor and get leave for me personally with the captain and one more besides eight seamen to come on shore and no more and this upon condition absolutely capitulated for that we should not offer to land any goods out of the ship or to carry any person away without license  they were so strict with us as to landing any goods that it was with extreme difficulty that i got on shore three bales of english goods such as fine broad clothes stuffs and some linen which i had brought for a present to my partner  he was a very generous broad hearted man though like me he came from little at first and though he knew not that i had the least design of giving him any thing he sent me on board a present of fresh provisions wine and sweetmeats worth above  0 moidores including some tobacco and three or four fine medals in gold but i was even with him in my present which as i have said consisted of fine broad cloth english stuffs lace and fine hollands also i delivered him about the value of  00 lib sterling in the same goods for other uses and i obliged him to set up the sloop which i had brought with me from england as i have said for the use of my colony in order to send the refreshments i intended to my plantation  accordingly he got hands and finished the sloop in a very few days for she was already framed and i gave the master of her such instructions as he could not miss the place nor did he miss them as i had an account from my partner afterward i got him soon loaded with the small cargo i sent them and one of our seamen that had been on shore with me there offered to go with the sloop and settle there upon my letter to the governor spaniard to allot him a sufficient quantity of land for a plantation and giving him some clothes and tools for his plantingwork which he said he understood having been an old planter at maryland and a buckaneer into the bargain  i encouraged the fellow by granting all he desired and as an addition i gave him the savage which we had taken prisoner of war to be his slave and ordered the governor spaniard to give him his share of every thing he wanted with the rest  when we came to fit this man out my old partner told me there was a certain very honest fellow a brasil planter of his acquaintance who had fallen into the displeasure of the church i know not what the matter is with him says he but on my conscience i think he is a heretic in his heart and he has been obliged to conceal himself for fear of the inquisition that he would be very glad of such an opportunity to make his escape with his wife and two daughters and if i would let them go to my island and allot them a plantation he would give them a small stock to begin with for the officers of the inquisition had seized all his effects and estate and he had nothing left but a little household stuff and two slaves and adds he though i hate his principles yet i would not have him fall into their hands for he would assuredly be burnt alive if he does  i granted this presently and joined my english man with them and we concealed the man and his wife and daughters on board our ship till the sloop put out to go to sea and then having put all their goods on board the sloop some time before we put them on board the sloop after he was got out of the bay  our seamen was mightily pleased with this new partner and their stock indeed was much alike rich in tools in preparations and a farm but nothing to begin with but as above however they carried over with them which was worth all the rest some materials for planting sugar canes with some plants of canes which he i mean the portugal man understood very well  among the rest of the supplies sent my tenants in the island i sent them by their sloop three milch cows and five calves about    hogs among em three sows big with pig two mares and a stonehorse  for my spaniards according to my promise i engaged three portugal women to go and recommended it to them to marry them and use them kindly i could have procured more women but i remembered that the poor persecuted man had two daughters and there was but five of the spaniards that wanted the rest had wives of their own though in another country  all this cargoe arrived safe and as you may easily suppose very welcome to my old inhabitants who were now with this addition between sixty and seventy people besides little children of which there was a great many i found letters at london from them all by the way of lisbon when i came back to england of which i shall also take some notice immediately  i have now done with my island and all manner of discourse about it and whoever reads the rest of my memorandums would do well to turn his thoughts entirely from it and expect to read of the follies of an old man not warned by his own harms much less by those of other men to beware of the like not cooled by almost forty years misery and disappointments not satisfied with prosperity beyond expectation not made cautious by affliction and distress beyond imitation  i had no more business to go to the east indies than a man at full liberty and having committed no crime has to go to the turnkey at newgate and desire him to lock him up among the prisoners there and starve him had i taken a small vessel from england and went directly to the island had i loaded her as i did the other vessel with all the necessaries for the plantation and for my people took a patent from the government here to have secured my property in subjection only to that of england had i carried over cannon and ammunition servants and people to plant and taking possession of the place fortified and strengthened it in the name of england and increased it with people as i might easily have done had i then settled my self there and sent the ship back laden with good rice as i might also have done in six months time and ordered my friends to have fitted her out again for our supply had i done this and staid there my self i had at least acted like a man of common sense but i was possessed with a wandering spirit scorned all advantages i pleased my self with being the patron of those people i placed there and doing for them in a kind of haughty majestic way like an old patriarchal monarch providing for them as if i had been father of the whole family as well as of the plantation but i never so much as pretended to plant in the name of any government or nation or to acknowledge any prince or to call my people subjects to any one nation more than another nay i never so much as gave the place a name but left it as i found it belonging to no man and the people under no discipline or government but my own who though i had influence over them as father and benefactor had no authority or power to act or command one way or other farther than voluntary consent moved them to comply yet even this had i staid there would have done well enough but as i rambld from them and came there no more the last letters i had from any of them was by my partners means who afterward sent another sloop to the place and who sent me word though i had not the letter till five years after it was written that they went on but poorly were male content with their long stay there that will atkins was dead that five of the spaniards were come away and that though they had not been much molested by the savages yet they had had some skirmishes with them that they begged of him to write to me to think of the promise i had made to fetch em away that they might see their own country again before they died  but i was gone a wild goose chase indeed and they who will have any more of me must be content to follow me through a new variety of follies hardships and wild adventures wherein the justice of providence may be duly observed and we may see how easily heaven can gorge us with our own desires make the strongest of our wishes be our affliction and punish us most severely with those very things which we think it would be our utmost happiness to be allowed in  let no wise man flatter himself with the strength of his own judgment as if he was able to choose any particular station of life for himself man is a short sighted creature sees but a very little way before him and as his passions are none of his best friends so his particular affections are generally his worst counselors  i say this with respect to the impetuous desire i had from a youth to wander into the world and how evident it now was that this principle was preserved in me for my punishment how it came on the manner the circumstance and the conclusion of it it is easy to give you historically and with its utmost variety of particulars but the secret ends of divine power in thus permitting us to be hurried down the stream of our own desires is only to be understood of those who can listen to the voice of providence and draw religious consequences from gods justice and their own mistakes  be it i had business or no business away i went it is no time now to enlarge any farther upon the reason or absurdity of my own conduct but to come to the history i was embarked for the voyage and the voyage i went  i should only add here that my honest and truly pious clergyman left me here a ship being ready to go to lisbon he asked me leave to go thither being still as he observed bound never to finish any voyage he began how happy had it been for me if i had gone with him  but it was too late now all things heaven appoints are best had i gone with him i had never had had so many things to be thankful for and you had never heard of the second part of the travels and adventures of robin crusoe so i must leave here the fruitless exclaiming at my self and go on with my voyage  from the brasils we made directly away over the atlantic sea to the cape de bon esperance or as we call it the cape of good hope and had a tolerable good voyage our course generally southeast now and then a storm and some contrary winds but my disasters at sea were at an end my future rubs and cross events were to befall me on shore that it might appear the land was as well prepared to be our scourge as the sea when heaven who directs the circumstances of things pleases to appoint it to be so  our ship was on a trading voyage and had a supra cargo on board who was to direct all her motions after she arrived at the cape only being limited to certain numbers of days for stay by charter party at the several ports she was to go to this was none of my business neither did i meddle with it at all my nephew the captain and the supracargo adjusting all those things between them as they thought fit  we made no stay at the cape longer than was needful to take in fresh water but made the best of our way for the coast of coremandel we were indeed informed that a french man of war of fifty guns and two large merchant ships were gone for the indies and as i knew we were at war with france i had some apprehensions of them but they went their own way and we heard no more of them  i shall not pester my account or the reader with descriptions of places journals of our voyages variations of compass latitudes meridiandistances tradewinds situation of ports and the like such as almost all the histories of long navigation are full of and makes the reading tiresome enough and are perfectly unprofitable to all that read it except only to those who are to go to those places themselves  it is enough to name the ports and places which we touched at and what occurred to us upon our passing from one to another we touch d first at the island of madagascar where though the people are fierce and treacherous and in particular very well armed with lances and bows which they use with inconceivable dexterity yet we fared very well with them a while they treated us very civilly and for some trifles which we gave them such as knives scissars etc they brought us eleven good fat bullocks middling in size but very good in flesh which we took in partly for fresh provisions for our present spending and the rest to salt for the ships use  we were obliged to stay here some time after we had furnished our selves with provisions and i that was always too curious to look into every nook of the world where ever i came was for going on shore as often as i could it was on the east side of the island that we went on shore one evening and the people who by the way are very numerous came thronging about us and stood gazing at us at a distance but as we had traded freely with them and had been kindly used we thought our selves in no danger but when we saw the people we cut three boughs out of a tree and stuck them up at a distance from us which it seems is a mark in the country not only of truce and friendship but when it is accepted the other side set up three poles or boughs which is a signal that they accept the truce too but then this is a known condition of the truce that you are not to pass beyond their three poles toward them nor they to come past your three poles or boughs toward you so that you are perfectly secure within the three poles and all the space between your poles and theirs is allowed like a market for free converse traffic and commerce when you go there you must not carry your weapons with you and if they come into that space they stick up their javelines and lances all at the first poles and come on unarmed but if any violence is offered them and the truce thereby broken away they run to the poles and lay hold of their weapons and then the truce is at an end  it happened one evening when we went on shore that a greater number of their people came down than usual but all was very friendly and civil and they brought in several kinds of provisions for which we satisfied them with such toys as we had their women also brought us milk and roots and several things very acceptable to us and all was quiet and we made us a little tent or hut of some boughs of trees and lay on shore all night  i know not what was the occasion but i was not so well satisfied to lie on shore as the rest and the boat lying at an anchor about a stone cast from the land with two men in her to take care of her i made one of them come on shore and getting some boughs of trees to cover us also in the boat i spread the sail on the bottom of the boat and lay under the cover of the branches of trees all night in the boat  about two a clock in the morning we heard one of our men make a terrible noise on the shore calling out for gods sake to bring the boat in and come and help them for they were all like to be murdered at the same time i heard the firing of   muskets which was the number of the guns they had and that three times over for it seems the natives here were not so easily frighted with guns as the savages were in america where i had to do with them  all this while i knew not what was the matter but rouzing immediately from sleep with the noise i caused the boat to be thrust in and resolv d with three fusils we had on board to land and assist our men  we got the boat soon to the shore but our men were in too much haste for being come to the shore they plunged into the water to get to the boat withall the expedition they could being pursued by between three and four hundred men our men were but nine in all and only five of them had fusils with them the rest had indeed pistols and swords but they were of small use to them  we took up seven of our men and with difficulty enough too three of them being very ill wounded and that which was still worse was that while we stood in the boat to take our men in we were in as much danger as they were in on shore for they poured their arrows in upon us so thick that we were fain to barricade the side of the boat up with the benches and two or three loose boards which to our great satisfaction we had by mere accident or providence in the boat  and yet had it been daylight they are it seems sach exact marksmen that if they could have seen but the least part of any of us they would have been sure of us we had by the light of the moon a little sight of them as they stood pelting us from the shore with darts and arrows and having got ready our firearms we gave them a volley that we could hear by the cries of some of them that we had wounded several however they stood thus in battle array on the shore till break of day which we suppose was that they might see the better to take their aim at us  in this condition we lay and could not tell how to weigh our anchor or set up our sail because we must needs stand up in the boat and they were as sure to hit us as we were to hit a bird in a tree with small shot we made signals of distress to the ship which though we rode a league off yet my nephew the captain hearing our firing and by glasses perceiving the posture we lay in and that we fired toward the shore pretty well understood us and weighing anchor with all speed he stood as near the shore as he durst with the ship and then sent another boat with ten hands in her to assist us but we called to them not to come too near telling them what condition we were in however they stood in nearer to us and one of the men taking the end of a towline in his hand and keeping our boat between him and the enemy so that they could not perfectly see him swam on board us and made fast the line to the boat upon which we slipped our little cable and leaving our anchor behind they towed us out of reach of the arrows we all the while lying close behind the barricado we had made  as soon as we were got from between the ship and the shore that she could lay her side to the shore she run along just by them and we poured in a broadside among them laden with pieces of iron and lead small bullets and such stuff besides the great shot which made a terrible havoc amongst them  when we were got on board and out of danger we had time to examine into the occasion of this fray and indeed our supracargo who had been often in those parts put me upon it for he said he was sure the inhabitants would not have touched us after we had made a truce if we had not done something to provoke them to it at length it came out viz that an old woman who had come to sell us some milk had brought it within our poles with a young woman with her who also brought some roots or herbs and while the old woman whether she was mother to the young woman or no they could not tell was selling us the milk one of our men offered some rudeness to the wench that was with her at which the old woman made a great noise however the seaman would not quit his prize but carried her out of the old womans sight among the trees it being almost dark the old woman went away without her and as we suppose made an outcry among the people she came from who upon notice raised this great army upon us in three or four hours and it was great odds but we had been all destroyed  one of our men was killed with a lance thrown at him just at the beginning of the attack as he sallied out of the tent they had made the rest came off free all but the fellow who was the occasion of all the mischief who paid dear enough for his black mistress for we could not hear what became of him a great while we lay upon the shore two days after though the wind presented and made signals for him made our boat sail up shore and down shore several leagues but in vain so we were obliged to give him over and if he alone had suffered for it the loss had been the less  i could not satisfy my self however without venturing on shore once more to try if i could learn any thing of him or them it was the third night after the action that i had a great mind to learn if i could by any means what mischief we had done and how the game stood on the indians side i was careful to do it in the dark lest we should be attacked again but i ought indeed to have been sure that the men i went with had been under my command before i engaged in a thing so hazardous and mischievous as i was brought into by it without my knowledge or design  we took twenty stout fellows with us as any in the ship besides the supra cargo and my self and we landed two hours before midnight at the same place where the indians stood drawn up the evening before i landed here because my design as i have said was chiefly to see if they had quitted the field and if they had left any marks behind them of the mischief we had done them and i thought if we could surprise one or two of them perhaps we might get our man again by way of exchange  we landed without any noise and divided our men into two bodies whereof the boatswain commanded one and i the other we neither saw or heard any body stir when we landed and we marched up one body at a distance from the other to the place but at first could see nothing it being very dark till by and by our boatswain that lead the first party stumbled and fell over a dead boy this made them halt a while for knowing by the circumstances that they were at the place where the indians had stood they waited for my coming up here we concluded to halt till the moon began to rise which we knew would be in less than an hour when we could easily discern the havoc we had made among them we told two and thirty bodies upon the ground whereof two were not quite dead some had an arm and some a leg shot off and one his head those that were wounded we supposed they had carried away  when we had made as i thought a full discovery of all we could come at the knowledge of i was resolved for going on board but the boatswain and his party sent me word that they were resolved to make a visit to the indian town where these dogs as they called them dwelt and asked me to go along with them and if they could find them as still they fansied they should they did not doubt getting a good booty and it might be they might find tho jeffry there that was the mans name we had lost  had they sent to ask my leave to go i knew well enough what answer to have given them for i would have commanded them instantly on board knowing it was not a hazard fit for us to run who had a ship and shiploading in our charge and a voyage to make which depended very much upon the lives of the men but as they sent me word they were resolved to go and only asked me and my company to go along with them i positively refused it and rose up for i was sitting on the ground in order to go to the boat one or two of the men began to importune me to go and when i refused positively began to grumble and say they were not under my command and they would go come jack says one of the men will go with me i will go for one jack said he would and another followed and then another and in a word they all left me but one who i persuaded to stay and a boy left in the boat so the supracargo and i with the third man went back to the boat where we told them we would stay for them and take care to take in as many of them as should be left for i told em it was a mad thing they were going about and supposed most of em would run the fate of thom jeffry  they told me like seamen they would warrant it they would come off again and they would take care etc so away they went i entreated em to consider the ship and voyage that their lives were not their own and that they were entrusted with the voyage in some measure that if they miscarried the ship might be lost for want of their help and that they could not answer it to god or man i said a great deal more to em on that head but i might as well have talked to the main mast of the ship they were mad upon their journey only they gave me good words and begged i would not be angry that they would be very cautious and they did not doubt but they would be back again in an about an hour at farthest for the indian town they said was not above half a mile off though they found it above two miles before they got to it  well they all went away as above and though the attempt was desperate and such as none but mad men would have gone about yet to give em their due they went about it warily as boldly they were gallantly armed that is true for they had every man a fuzee or musket a bayonet every man a pistol some of them had broad cutlasses some of them hangers and the boatswain and two more had poleaxes besides all which they had among them thirteen handgrenadoes bolder fellows and better provided never went about any wicked work in the world  when they went out their chief design was plunder and they were in mighty hopes of finding gold there but a circumstance which none of them were aware of set them on fire with revenge and made devils of them all when they came to the few indian houses which they thought had been the town which was not above half a mile off they were under a great disappointment for there were not above    or    houses and where the town was or how big they knew not they consulted therefore what to do and were some time before they could resolve for if they fell upon these they must cut all their throats and it was ten to one but some of them might escape it being in the night though the moon was up and if one escaped he would run away and raise all the town so they should have a whole army upon them again on the other hand if they went away and left those untouched for the people were all asleep they could not tell which way to look for the town  however the last was the best advice so they resolved to leave them and look for the town as well as they could they went on a little way and found a cow tied to a tree this they presently concluded would be a good guide to them for they said the cow certainly belonged to the town before them or the town behind them and if they untied her they should see which way she went if she went back they had nothing to say to her but if she went forward they had nothing to do but to follow her so they cut the cord which was made of twisted flags and the cow went on before them in a word the cow led them directly to the town which as they report consisted of above  00 houses or huts and in some of these they found several families living together  here they found all in silence as profoundly secure as sleep and a country that had never seen an enemy of that kind could make them and first they called another council to consider what they had to do and in a word they resolved to divide themselves into three bodies and to set three houses on fire in three parts of the town and as the men came out to seize them and bind them if any resisted they need not be asked what to do then and so to search the rest of the houses for plunder but they resolved to march silently first through the town and see what dimensions it was of and if they might venture upon it or no  they did so and desperately resolved that they would venture upon them but while they were animating one another to the work three of them that were a little before the rest called out aloud to them and told them they had found thom jeffry they all run up to the place and so it was indeed for there they sound the poor fellow hanged up naked by one arm and his trhoat cut there was an indian house just by the tree where they found sixteen or seventeen of the principal indians who had been concerned in the fray with us before and two or three of them wounded with our shot and our men found they were awake and talking one to another in that house but knew not their number  the sight of their poor mangled comrade so enraged em as before that they swore to one another they would be revenged and that not an indian who came into their hands should have quarter and to work they went immediately and yet not so madly as by the rage and fury they were in might be expected their first care was to get something that would soon take fire but after a little search they found that would be to no purpose but most of the houses were low and thatched with flags or rushes of which the country is full so they presently made some wild fire as we call it by wetting a little powder in the palms of their hands and in a quarter of an hour they set the town on fire in four or five places and particularly that house where the indians were not gone to bed as soon as the fire began to blaze the poor frighted creatures began to rush out to save their lives but met with their fate in the attempt and especially at the door where they drove em back the boatswain himself killing one or two with his poleax the house being large and many in it he did not care to go in but called for a handgrenado and threw it among em which at first frighted em but when it burst made such havoc among em that they cried out in a hideous manner  in short most of the indians who were in the open part of the house were killed or hurt with the grenado except two or three more who pressed to the door which the boatswain and two more kept with their bayonets in the muzzles of their pieces and dispatched all who came that way but there was another apartment in the house where the prince or king or whatever he was ano several others were and these they kept in till the house which was by this time all of a light flame fell in upon them and they were imotherd or burnt together  all this while they fired not a gun because they would not waken the people faster than they could master them but the fire began to waken them fast enough and our fellows were glad to keep a little together in bodies for the fire grew so raging all the houses being made of light combustible stuff that they could hardly bear the street between them and their business was to follow the fire for the surer execution as fast as the fire either forced the people out of those houses which were burning or frighted them out of others our people were ready at their doors to knock them on the head still calling and hallowing to one another to remember thom jeffrys  while this was doing i must confess i was very uneasy and especially when i saw the flames of the town which it being night seemed to be just by me  my nephew the captain who was roused by his men too seeing such a fire was very uneasy not knowing what the matter was or what danger i was in especially hearing the guns too for by this time they began to use their firearms a thousand thoughts oppressed his mind concerning me and the supracargo what should become of us and at last though he could ill spare any more men yet not knowing what exigence we might be in he takes another boat and with    men and himself comes on shore to me  he was surpriz d to see me and the supracargo in the boat with no more than two men and though he was glad that we were well yet he was in the same impatience with us to know what was doing for the noise continued and the flame increased in short it was next to an impossibility for any men in the world to restrain their curiosity to know what had happened or the concern for the safety of the men in a word the captain told me he would go and help his men let what would come i argued with him as i did before with the men the safety of the ship the danger of the voyage the interest of the owners and merchants etc and told him i would go and the two men and only see if we could at a distance learn what was like to be the event and come back and tell him  it was all one to talk to my nephew as it was to talk to the rest before he would go he said and he only wished he had left but ten men in the ship for he could not think of having his men lost for want of help he had rather lose the ship the voyage and his life and all and away went he  in a word i was no more able to stay behind now than i was to persuade them not to go so in short the captain ordered two men to row back the pinnace and fetch twelve men more leaving the longboat at an anchor and that when they came back six men should keep the two boats and six more come after us so that he left only    men in the ship for the whole ships company consisted of    men whereof two were lost in the last quarrel which brought this mischief on  being now on the march you may be sure we felt little of the ground we trod on and being guided by the fire we kept no path but went directly to the place of the flame if the noise of the guns was surprising to us before the cries of the poor people were now of quite another nature and filled us with horror i must confess i never was at the sacking a city or at the taking a town by storm i had heard of oliver cromwell taking drogheda in ireland and killing man woman and child and i had read of count tilly sacking of the city of magdeburgh and cutting the throats of   000 of all sexes but i nener had an idea of the thing itself before not is it possible to describe it or the horror which was upon our minds at hearing it  however we went on and at length came to the town though there was no entering the streets of it for the fire the first object we met with was the ruins of a hut or house or rather the ashes of it for the house was consumed and just before it plain now to be seen by the light of the fire lay four men and three women killed and as we thought one or two more lay in the heap among the fire in short there were such instances of a rage altogether barbarous and of a fury semething beyond what was human that we thought it impossible our men could be guilty of it or if they were the authors of it we thought they ought to be every one of em put to the worst of deaths but this was not all we saw the fire increased forward and the cry went on just as the fire went on so that we were in the utmost confusion we advanced a little way farther and behold to our astonishment three women naked and crying in a most dreadful manner come flying as if they had indeed had wings and after them sixteen or seventeen men natives in the same terror and consternation with three of our english butchers for i can call them no better in their rear who when they could not overtake them fired in among them and one that was killed by their shot fell down in our sight when the rest saw us believing us to be their enemies and that we would murder them as well as those that persued them they set up a most dreadful shreik especially the women and two of them fell down as if already dead with the fright  my very soul shrunk within me and my blood run chil in my veins when i saw this and i believe had the three english sailors that pursued them come on i had made our men kill them all however we took some ways to let the poor flying creatures know that we would not hurt them and immediately they came up to us and kneeling down with their hands lifted up made piteous lamentation to us to save them which we let them know we would whereupon they crept altogether in a huddle crose behind us as for protection i left my men drawn up together and charged them to hurt no body but if possible to get at some of our people and see what devil it was possessed them and what they intended to do and in a word to command them off assuring them that if they stayed till daylight they would have an hundred thousand men about their ears i say i left them and went among those flying people taking only two of our men with me and there was indeed a piteous spectacle among them some of them had their feet terribly burnt with trampling and running through the fire others their hands burnt one of the women had fallen down in the fire and was very much burnt before she could get out again and two or three of the men had cuts in their backs and thighs from our men pursuing and another was shot through the body and died while i was there  i would fain have learned what the occasion of all this was but i could not understand one word they said though by signs i perceived that some of them knew not what was the occasion themselves i was so terrified in my thoughts at this outrageous attempt that i could not stay there but went back to my own men and resolved to go into the middle of the town through the fire or whatever might be in the way and put an end to it cost what it would accordingly as soon as i came back to my men i told them my resolution and commanded them to follow me when in the very moment came four of our men with the boatswain at their head roving over the heaps of bodies they had killed all covered with blood and dust as if they wanted more people to massacre when our men hallowed to them as loud as they could hallow and with much ado one of them made them hear so that they knew who we were and came up to us  as soon as the boatswain saw us he set up a hallow like a shout of triumph for having as he thought more help come and without bearing to hear me captain says he noble captain i am glad you are come we have not half done yet villainous hell hound dogs i will kill as many of them as poor tom has hairs upon his head we have sworn to spare none of them well root out the very nation of em from the earth and thus he run on out of breath too with action and would not give us leave to speak a word  at last raising my voice that i might silence him a little barbarous dog said i what are you doing i will not have one creature touched more upon pain of death i charge you upon your life to stop your hands and stand still here or you are a dead man this minute  why sir says he do you know what you do or what they have done if you want a reason for what we have done come hither and with that he showed me the poor fellow hanging with his throat cut  i confess i was urged then myself and at another time should have been forward enough but i thought they had carried their rage too far and thought of jacobs words to his sons simeon and levi cursed be their anger for it was fierce and their wrath for it was cruel but i had now a a new task upon my hands for when the men i carried with me saw the sight as i had done i had as much to do to restrain them as i should have had with the other nay my nephew himse f fell in with them and told me in their hearing that he was only concerned for fear of the men being overpowered for as to the people he thought not one of em ought to live for they had all glutted themselves with the murder of the poor man and that they ought to be used like murderers upon these words away run eight of my men with the boatswain and his crew to complete their bloody work and i seeing it quite out of my power to restrain them came away pensive and sad for i could not bear the sight much less the horrible noise and cries of the poor wretches that fell into their hands  i got no body to come back with me but the supracargo and two men and with these i walked back to the boats it was a very great piece of folly in me i confess to venture back as it were alone for as it began now to be almost day and the alarm had run over the country there stood about  0 men armed with lances and bows at the little place where the    or    houses stood mentioned before but by accident i missed the place and came directly to the seaside and by the time i got to the seaside it was broad day immediately i took the pinnace and went aboard and sent her back to assist the men in what might happen  i observed about the time that i came to the boatside that the fire was pretty well out and the noise abated but in about half an hour after i got on board i heard a volley of our mens firearms and saw a great smoke this as i understood afterward was our men falling upon the men who as i said stood at the few houses on the way of whom they killed sixteen or seventeen and set all those houses on fire but did not meddle with the women or children  by that time the men got to the shore again with the pinnace our men began to appear they came dropping in some and some not in two bodies and in form as they went but all in heaps straggling here and there in such a manner that a small force of resolute men might have cut them all off  but the dread of them was upon the whole country and the men were amazed and surpised and so frighted that i believe a hundred of em would have fled at the sight of but five of our men nor in all this terrible action was there a man who made any considerable defense they were so surpised between the terror of the fire and the sudden attack of our men in the dark that they knew not which way to turn themselves for if they fled one way they were met by one party if back again by another so that they were every where knocked down nor did any of our men receive the least hurt except one who strained his foot and another had one of his hands very much burnt  i was very angry with my nephew the captain and indeed with all the men in my mind but with him in particular as well for his acting so out of his duty as commander of the ship and having the charge of the voyage upon him as in his prompting rather than cooling the rage of his men in so bloody and cruel an enterprise my nephew answered me very respectfully but told me that when he saw the body of the poor seaman whom they had murdered in such a cruel and barbarous manner he was not master of himself neither could he govern his passion he owned he should not have done so as he was commander of the ship but as he was a man and nature moved him he could not bear it as for the rest of the men they were not subject to me at all and they knew it well enough so they took no notice of my dislike  the next day we set sail so we never heard any more of it our men differed in the account of the number they killed some said one thing some another but according to the best of their accounts put altogether they killed or destroyed about   0 people men women and children and left not a house standing in the town  as for the poor fellow tho jeffrys as he was quite dead for his throat was so cut that his head was half off it would do him no service to bring him away so they left him where they found him only took him down from the tree where he was hanged by one hand  however just our men thought this action i was against them in it and i always after that time told them god would blast the voyage for i looked upon all the blood they shed that night to be murder in them for though it is true that they had killed tho jeffrys yet it was as true that jeffrys was the aggressor had broken the truce and had violated or debauched a young woman of theirs who came down to them innocently and on the faith of their public capitulation  the boatswain defended this quarrel when we were afterward on board he said it is true that we seemed to break the truce but really had not and that the war was begun the night before by the natives themselves who had shot us and killed one of our men without any just provocation so that as we were in a capacity to fight them now we might also be in a capacity to do our selves justice upon them in an extraordinary manner that though the poor man had taken a little liberty with a wench he ought not to have been murdered and that in such a villainous manner and that they did nothing but what was just and what the laws of god allowed to be done to murderers  one would think this should have been enough to have warned us against going on shore among heathens and barbarians but it is impossible to make mankind wise but at their own expense and their experience seems to be always of most use to them when it is dearest bought  we are now bound to the gulf of persia and from thence to the coast of coremandel only to touch at surrat but the chief of the supracargos design lay at the bay of bengale where if he missed of his business outward bound he was to go up to china and return to the coast as he came home  the first disaster that befell us was in the gulf of persia where five of our men venturing on shore on the arabian side of the gulf were surrounded by the arabians and either all killed or carried away into slavery the rest of the boats crew were not able to rescue them and had but just time to get off their boat i began to upbraid them with the just retribution of heaven in this case but the boatswain very warmly told me he thought i went farther in my censures than i could show any warrant for in scripture and referred to the    st luke verse  th where our savior intimates that those men on whom the tower of siloam fell were not sinners above all the galileans but that which indeed put me to silence in the case was that not one of these five men who were now lost were of the number of those who went on shore to the massacre of madagascar so i always called it though our men could not bear the word massacre with any patience and indeed this last circumstance as i have said put me to silence for the present  but my frequent preaching to them on this subject had worse consequences than i expected and the boatswain who had been the head of the attempt came up boldly to me one time and told me he found that i continually brought that affair upon the stage that i made unjust reflections upon it and had used the men very ill on that account and himself in particular that as i was but a passenger and had no command in the ship or concern in the voyage they were not obliged to bear it that they did not know but i might have some ill design in my head and perhaps to call them to account for it when they came to england and that therefore unless i would resolve to have done with it and also not to concern my self any farther with him or any of his affairs he would leave the ship for he did not think it was safe to sail with me among them  i heard him patiently enough till he had done and then told him that i did confess i had all along opposed the massacre of madagascar for such i would always call it and that i had on all occasions spoken my mind freely about it though not more upon him than any of the rest that as to my having no command in the ship that was true nor did i exercise any authority only took my liberty of speaking my mind in things which publicly concerned us all and what concern i had in the voyage was none of his business that i was a considerable owner of the ship and in that claim i conceived i had a right to speak even farther than i had yet done and would not be accountable to him or any one else and begun to be a little warm with him he made but little reply to me at that time and i thought that affair had been over we were at this time in the road at bengale and being willing to see the place i went on shore with the supracargo in the ships boat to divert myself and toward evening was preparing to go on board when one of the men came to me and told me he would not have me trouble my self to come down to the boat for they had orders not to carry me on board any more any one may guess what a surprised was in at so insolent a message and i asked the man who bad him deliver that errand to me he told me the cockswain i said no more to the fellow but bad him let them know he had delivered his message and that i had given him no answer to it  i immediately went and found out the supracargo and told him the story adding what i presently foresaw viz that there would certainly be a mutiny in the ship and entreated him to go immediately on board the ship in an indian boat and acquaint the captain of it but i might haspard this intelligence for before i had spoken to him on shore the matter was effected on board the boatswain the gunner the carpenter and in a word all the inferior officers as soon as i was gone off in the boat came up to the quarter deck and desired to speak with the captain and there the boatswain making a long harangue for the fellow talked very well and repeating all he had said to me told the captain in few words that as i was now gone peaceaby on shore they were loath to use any violence with me which if i had not gone on shore they would otherwise have done to oblige me to have gone they therefore thought fit to tell him that as they shipped themselves to serve in the ship under his command they would perform it well and faithfully but if i would not quit the ship or the captain oblige me to quit it they would all leave the ship and sail no farther with him and at that word all he turned his face about toward the mainmast which was it seems the signal agreed on between them at which all the seamen being got together they cried out one and all one and all  my nephew the captain was a man of spirit and of great presence of mind and though he was surpised you may be sure at the thing yet he told them calmly that he would consider of the thing but that he could do nothing in it till he had spoken to me about it he used some arguments with them to show them the unreasonableness and injustice of the thing but it was all in vain they swore and shook hands round before his face that they would go all on shore unless he would engage to them not to suffer me to come any more on board the ship  this was a hard article upon him who knew his obligation to me and did not know how i might take it so he began to talk cavalierly to them told them that i was a very considerable owner of the ship and that in justice he could not put me out of my own house that this was next door to serving me as the famous pirate kid had done who made the mutiny in a ship set the captain on shore in an uninhabited island and run away with the ship that let them go into what ship they would if ever they came to england again it would cost them dear that the ship was mine and that he could not put me out of it and that he would rather lose the ship and the voyage too than disoblige me so much so they might do as they pleased however he would go on shore and talk with me on shore and invited the boatswain to go with me and perhaps they might accommodate the matter with me  but they all rejected the proposal and said they would have nothing to do with me any more neither on board or on shore and if i came on board they would all go on shore well said the captain if you are all of this mind let me go on shore and talk with him so away he came to me with this account a little after the message had been brought to me from the cockswain  i was very glad to see my nephew i must confess for i was not without apprehensions that they would confine him by violence set sail and run away with the ship and then i had been stripped naked in a remote country and nothing to help myself in short i had been in a worse case than when i was all alone in the island  but they had not come that length it seems to my great satisfaction and when my nephew told me what they had said to him and how they had sworn and shook hands that they would one and all leave the ship if i was suffered to come on board i told him he should not be concerned at it at all for i would stay on shore i only desired he would take care and send me all my necessary things on shore and leave me a sufficient sum of money and i would find my way to england as well as i could  this was a heavy piece of news to my nephew but there was no way to help it but to comply with it so in short he went on board the ship again and satisfied the men that his uncle had yielded to their importunity and had sent for his goods from on board the ship so that matter was over in a very few hours the men returned to their duty and i began to consider what course i should steer  i was now alone in the remotest part of the world as i think i may call it for i was near three thousand leagues by sea farther off from england than i was at my island only it is true i might travel here by land over the great moguls country to surratte might go from thence to bafora by sea up the gulf of persia and from thence might take the way of the caravans over the desert of arabia to aleppo and scanderoon from thence by sea again to italy and so over land into france and this put together might be at least a full diameter of the globe but if it were to be measured i suppose it would appear to be a great deal more  i had another way before me which was to wait for some english ships which were coming to bengale from achin on the island of sumatra and get passage on board them for england but as i came hither without any concern with the english east india company so it would be difficult to go from hence without their license unless with great favor of the captains of the ships or of the companies factors and to both i was an utter stranger  here i had the particular pleasure speaking by contraries to see the ship set sail without me a treatment i think a man in my circumstances scarce ever met with except from pirates running away with a ship and setting those that would not agree with their villainy on shore indeed this was next door to it both ways however my nephew left me two servants or rather one companion and one servant the first was clerk to the purser who he engaged to go with me and the other was his own servant i took me also a good lodging in the house of an english woman where several merchants lodged some french two italians or rather jews and one english man here i was handsomely enough entertained and that i might not be said to run rashly upon any thing i stayed hereabove nine months considering what course to take and how to manage my self i had some english goods with me of value and a considerable sum of money my nephew furnishing me with a thousand pieces of eight and a letter of credit for more if i had occasion that i might not be straightened whatever might happen  i quickly disposed of my goods and to advantage too and as i originally intended i bought here some very good diamonds which of all other things was the most proper for me in my present circumstances because i might always carry my whole estate about me  after a long stay here and many proposals made for my return to england but none falling out to my mind the english merchant who lodged with me and with whom i had contracted an intimate acquaintance came to me one morning countryman says he i have a project to communicate to you which as it suits with my thoughts may for ought i know suit with yours also when you shall have thoroughly considered it  here we are posted says he you by accident and i by my own choice in a part of the world very remote from our own country but it is in a country where by us who understand trade and business a great deal of money is to be got if you will put a thousand pound to my thousand pound we will hire a ship here the first we can get to our minds you shall be captain i will be merchant and we will go a trading voyage to china for what should we stand still for the whole world is in motion rouling round and round all the creatures of god heavenly bodies and earthly are busy and diligent why should we be idle there are no drones in the world but men why should we be of that number  i liked his proposal very well and the more because it seemed to be expressed with so much good will and in so friendly a manner i will not say but that i might by my loose and unhinged circumstances be the fitter to embrace a proposal for trade or indeed for any thing else whereas otherwise trade was none of my element however i might perhaps say with some truth that if trade was not my element rambling was and no proposal for seeing any part of the world which i had never seen before could possibly come amiss to me  it was however some time before we could get a ship to our minds and when we had got a vessel it was not easy to get english sailors that is to say so many as were necessary to govern the voyage and manage the sailors which we should pick up there after some time we got a mate a boatswain and a gunner english a dutch carpenter and three portugueze foremast men with these we found we could do well enough having indian seamen such as they are to make up  there are so many travelers who have wrote the history of their voyages and travels this way that it would be very little diversion to any body to give a long account of the places we went to and the people who inhabit there those things i leave to others and refer the reader to those journals and travels of english men of which many i find are published and more promised every day it is enough to me to tell you that i made this voyage to achin in the island of sumatra and from thence to siam where we exchanged some of our wares for opium and some arrack the first a commodity which bears a great price among the chinese and which at that time was very much wanted there in a word we went up to suskan made a very great voyage was eight months out and returned to bengale and i was very well satisfied with my adventure i observe that our people in england often admire how the officers which the company send into india and the merchants which generally stay there get such very great estates as they do and sometimes come home worth  0 to  0  00 thousand pound at a time  but it is no wonder or at least we shall see so much farther into it when we consider the innumerable ports and places where they have a free commerce that it will then be no wonder and much less will it be so when we consider that at all those places and ports where the english ships come there is so much and such constant demand for the growth of all other countries that there is a certain vent for the returns as well as a market abroad for the goods carried out  in short we made a very good voyage and i got so much money by the first adventure and such an insight into the method of getting more that had i been twenty year younger i should have been tempted to have staid here and sought no farther for making my fortune but what was all this to a man on the wrong side of threescore that was rich enough and came abroad more in obedience to a restless desire of seeing the world than a covetuous desire of getting in it and indeed i think it is with great justice that i now call it a restless desire for it was so when i was at home i was restless to go abroad and now i was abroad i was restless to be at home i say what was this gain to me i was rich enough nor had i any uneasy desires about getting more money and therefore the profit of the voyage to me were things of no great force for the prompting me forward to farther undertakings and i thought that by this voyage i had made no progress at all because i was come back as i might call it to the place from whence i came as to a home whereas my eye which like that which solomon speaks of was never satisfied with seeing was still more desirous of wandering and seeing i was come into a part of the world which i was never in before and that part in particular which i had heard much of and was resolved to see as much of as i could and then i thought i might say i had seen all the world that was worth seeing  but my fellow traveller and i had different notions i do not name this to insist upon my own for i acknowledge his were the most just and the most suited to the end of a merchants life who when he is abroad upon adventures it is his wisdom to stick to that as the best thing for him which he is like to get the most money by my new friend kept himself to the nature of the thing and would have been content to have gone like a carriers horse always to the same inn backward and forward provivided he could as he called it find his account in it on the other hand mine was the notion of a mad rambling boy that never cares to see a thing twice over  but this was not all i had a kind of impatience upon me to be nearer home and yet the most unsettled resolution imaginable which way to go in the interval of these consultations my friend who was always upon the search for business proposed another voyage to me among the spice islands and to bring home a loading of cloves from the manillas or there abouts places where indeed the dutch do trade but islands belonging partly to the spaniards though we went not so far but to some other where they have not the whole power as they have at batavia ceylon etc we were not long in preparing for this voyage the chief difficulty was in bringing me to come into it however at last nothing else offering and finding that really stirring about and trading the profit being so great and as i may say certain had more pleasure in it and more satisfaction to the mind than sitting still which to me especially was the unhappiest part of life i resolved on his voyage too which we made very successfully touching at borneo and several islands whose names i do not remember and came home in about five months we sold our spice which was chiefly cloves and some nutmegs to the persian merchants who carried them away for the gulf and making near five of one we really got a great deal of money  my friend when we made up this account smiled at me well now said he with a sort of agreeable insulting my indolent temper is not this better than walking about here like a man of nothing to do and spending our time in staring at the nonsense and ignorance of the pagans why truly says i my friend i think it is and i begin to be a convert to the principles of merchandising but i must tell you said i by the way you do not know what i am a doing for if once i conquer my backwardness and embark heartily as old as i am i shall harrass you up and down the world till i tire you for i shall pursue it so eagerly i shall never let you lie still  but to be short with my speculations a little while after this there came in a dutch ship from batavia she was a coaster not an european trader and of about two hundred ton burden the men as they pretended having been so sickly that the captain had not men enough to go to sea with he lay by at bengal and having it seems got money enough or being willing for other reasons to go for europe he gave public notice that he would sell his ship this came to my ears before my new partner heard of it and i had a great mind to buy it so i goes home to him and told him of it he considered a while for he was no rash man neither but musing some time he replied she is a little too big but however we will have her accordingly we bought the ship and agreeing with the master we paid for her and took possession when we had done so we resolved to entertain the men if we could to join them with those we had for the pursuing our business but on a sudden they having received not their wages but their share of the money not one of them was to be found we inquired much about them and at length were told that they were all gone together by land to agra the great city of the moguls residence and from thence were to travel to suratte and so by sea to the gulf of persia  nothing had so heartily troubled me a good while as that i missed the opportunity of going with them for such a ramble i thought and in such company as would both have guarded me and diverted me would have suited mightily with my great design and i should both have seen the world and gone homewards too but i was much better satisfied a few days after when i came to know what sort of fellows they were for in short their history was that this man they called captain was the gunner only not the commander that they had been a trading voyage in which they were attacked on shore by some of the mallayans who had killed the captain and three of his men and that after the captain was killed these men eleven in number had resolved to run away with the ship which they did and brought her in at the bay of bengale leaving the mate and five men more on shore of whom we shall hear farther  well let them come by the ship how they would we came honestly by her as we thought though we did not i confess examine into things so exactly as we ought for we never inquired any thing of the seamen who if we had examined would certainly have falterd in their account contradicted one another and perhaps contradicted themselves or one how or other we should have seen reason to have suspected them but the man showed us a bill of sale for the ship to one emanuel clostershoven or some such name for i suppose it was all a forgery and called himself by that name and we could not contradict him and being withal a little too unwary or at least having no suspicion of the thing we went through with our bargain  we picked up some more english seamen here after this and some dutch and now we resolved for a second voyage to the south east for cloves etc that is to say among the philippine and mollucco isles and in short not to fill this part of my story with trifles when what is yet to come is so remarkable i spent from first to last six years in this country trading from port to port backward and forward and with very good success and was now the last year with my new partner going in the ship abovementioned on a voyage to china but designing first to siam to buy rice  in this voyage being by contrary winds obliged to beat up and down a great while in the straits of mallacca and among the islands we were no sooner got clear of those difficult seas but we found our ship had sprung a leak and we were not able by all our industry to find it out where it was this forced us to make for some port and my partner who knew the country better than i did directed the captain to put into the river of cambodia far i had made the english mate one mr thomson captain not being willing to take the charge of two ship upon my self this river lies on the north side of the great bay or gulf which goes up to siam  while we were here and going often on shore for refreshment there comes to me one day an english man and he was it seems a gunners mate on board an english east india ship which rode in the same river up at or near the city of cambodia what brought him hither we know not but he comes up to me and speaking english sir says he you are a stranger to me and i to you but i have something to tell you that very nearly concerns you  i looked steadily at him a good while and thought at first i had known him but i did not if it very nearly concerns me said i and not your self what moves you to tell it me i am moved says he by the eminent danger you are in and for ought i see you have no knowledge of it i know no danger i am in said i but that my ship is leaky and i cannot find it out but i purpose to lay her aground to morrow to see if i can find it but sir says he leaky or not leaky find it or not find it you will be wiser than to lay your ship on shore to morrow when you hear what i have to say to you do you know sir said he the town of cambodia lies about fifteen leagues up this river and there are two large english ships about five leagues on this side and three dutch well said i and what is that to me why sir said he is it for a man that is upon such adventures as you are upon to come into a port and not examine first what ships there are there and whether he is able to deal with them i suppose you dont think you are a match for them i was amused very much at his discourse but not amazed at it for i could not conceive what he meant and i turned short upon him and said sir i wish you would explain your self i cannot imagine what reason i have to be afraid of any company of ships or dutch ships i am no interloper what can they have to say to me  he looked like a man half angry half pleased and pausing a while but smiling well sir says he if you think your self secure you must take your chance i am sorry your hate should blind you against good advice but assure your self if you do not put to sea immediately you will the very next tide be attacked by five longboats full of men and perhaps if you are taken you will be hanged for a pirate and the particulars be examined afterward i thought sir added he i should have met with a better reception than this for doing you a piece of service of such importance i can never be ungrateful said i for any service or to any man that offers me any kindness but it is past my comprehension said i what they should have such a design upon me for however since you say there is no time to be lost and that there is some villainous design in hand against me i will go on board this minute and put to sea immediately if my men can stop the leak or if we can swim without stopping it but sir said i shall i go away ignorant of the reason of all this can you give me no farther light into it  i can tell you but part of the story sir says he but i have a dutch seaman here with me and i believe i could persuade him to tell you the rest but there is scarce time for it but the short of the story is this the first part of which i suppose you know well enough viz that you was with this ship at sumatra that there your captain was murdered by the mallayans with three of his men and that you or some of those who were on board with you ran away with the ship and are since turned pirates this is the sum of the story and you will be all seized as pirates i can assure you and executed with very little ceremony for you know merchants ships show but little law to pirates if they get them into their power  now you speak plain english said i and i thank you and though i know nothing that we have done like what you talk of but am sure we came honestly and fairly by the ship yet seeing such work is a doing as you say and that you seem to mean honestly i will be upon my guard nay sir says he do not talk of being upon your guard the best defense is to be out of the danger if you have any regard to your life and the life of all your men put out to sea without fail at high water and as you have a whole tide before you you will be gone too far out before they can come down for they came away at high water and as they have twenty miles to come you get near two hours of them by the difference of the tide not reckoning the length of the way besides as they are only boats and not ships they will not venture to follow you far out to sea especially if it blows  well says i you have been very kind in this what shall i do for you to make you amends sir says he you may not be so willing to make me any amends because you may not be convinced of the truth of it i will make an offer to you i have nineteen months pay due to me on board the ship   which i came out of england in and the dutch man that is with me has seven months pay due to him if you will make good our pay to us we will go along with you if you find nothing more in it we will desire no more but if we do convince you that we have saved your lives and the ship and the lives of all the men in her we will leave the rest to you  i consented to this readily and went immediately on board and the two men with me as soon as i came to the ship side my partner who was on board came out on the quarter deck and called to me with a great deal of joy o ho o oh we have stopped the leak we have stopped the leak say you so said i thank god but weigh the anchor then immediately weigh says he what do you mean by that what is the matter says he ask no questions says i but all hands to work and weigh without losing a minute he was surpised but however he called the captain and he immediately ordered the anchor to be got up and though the tide was not quite done yet a little land breeze blowing we stood out to sea then i called him into the cabin and told him the story at large and we called in the men and they told us the rest of it but as it took us up a great deal of time so before we had done a seaman comes to the cabin door and calls out to us that the captain bad him tell us we were chased chased says i by who and by what by five sloops or boats says the fellow full of men very well said i then it is apparent there is something in it in the next place i ordered all our men to be called up and told them that there was a design to seize the ship and to take us for pirates and asked them if they would stand by us and by one another the men answered cheerfully that one and all they would live and die with us then i asked the captain what way he thought best for us to manage a fight with them for resist them i was resolved we would and that to the last drop he said readily that the way was to keep them off with our great shot as long as we could and then to fire at them with our small arms as long as we could but when neither of these would do any longer we should retire to our close quarters perhaps they had not materials to break open our bulkheads or get in upon us  the gunner had in the mean time order to bring two guns to bear fore and aft out of the steerage to clear the deck and loaded them with musquetbullets and small pieces of old iron and what next came to hand and thus we made ready for fight but all this while we kept out to sea with wind enough and could see the boats at a distance being five large longboats following us with all the sail they could make  two of those boats which by our glasses we could see were english out sailed the rest were near two leagues a head of them and gained upon us considerably so that we found they would come up with us upon which we fired gun without ball to intimate that they should bring too and we put out a flag of truce as a signal for parley but they kept crowding after us till they came within shot when we took in our white flag they having made no answer to it hung out a red flag and fired at them with a shot notwithstanding this they came on till they were near enough to call to them with a speaking trumpet which we had on board so we called to them and bid them keep off at their peril  it was all one they crowded after us and endeavored to come under our stern so to board us on our quarter upon which seeing they were resolute for mischief and depended upon the strength that followed them i ordered to bring the ship too so that they lay upon our broadside when immediately we fired five guns at them one of which had been levelled so true as to carry away the stern of the hindermost boat and bring them to the necessity of taking down their sail and running all to the head of the boat to keepl er from sinking so she lay by and had enough of it but seeing the foremost boat crowd on after us we made ready to fire at her in particular  while this was doing one of the three boats that was behind being forwarder than the other two made up to the boat which we had disabled to relieve her and we could afterward see her take out the men we called again to the foremost boat and offered a truce to parley again and to know what was her business with us but had no answer only she crowded close under our stern upon this our gunner who was a very dexterous fellow run out his two chaseguns and fired again at her but the shot missing the men in the boat shouted waved their caps and came on but the gunner getting quickly ready again fired among them the second time one shot of which though it missed the boat it self yet fell in among the men and we could easily see had done a great deal of mischief among them but we taking no notice of that ward the ship again and brought our quarter to bear upon them and firing three guns more we found the boat was split almost to pieces in particular her rudder and a piece of her stern was shot quite away so they handed their sail immediately and were in great disorder but to complete their misfortune our gunner let fly two guns at them again where he hit them we could not tell but we found the boat was sinking and some of the men already in the water upon this i immediately manned out our pinnace which we had kept close by our side with orders to pick up some of the men if they could and save them from drowning and immediately to come on board with them because we saw the rest of the boats began to come up our men in the pinnace followed their orders and took up three men one of which was just drowning and it was a good while before we could recover him as soon as they were on board we crowded all the sail we could make and stood farther out to sea and we found that when the other three boats came up to the first two they gave over their chase  being thus delivered from a danger which though i knew not the reason of it yet seemed to be much greater than i apprehended i took care that we would change our course and not let any one imagine whither we were going so we stood out to sea eastward quite out of the course of all europian ships whether they were bound to china or any where else within the commerce of the europian nations  when we were now at sea we began to consult with the two seamen and enquire first what the meaning of all this should be and the dutch man let us into the secret of it at once telling us that the fellow that sold us the ship as we said was no more than a thief that had run away with her then he told us how the captain whose name too he told us though i do not remember was treacherously murdered by the natives on the coast of mallaca with three of his men and that he this dutch man and four more got into the woods where they wandered about a great while till at length he in particular in a miraculous manner made his escape and swam off to a dutch ship which sailing near the shore in its way from china had sent their boat on shore for fresh water that he durst not come to that part of the shore where the boat was but shift in the night to take the water farther off and the ships boat took him up  he then told us that he went to battavia where two of the seamen belonging to the ship arrived having deserted the rest in their travels and gave an account that the fellow who had run away with the ship sold her at bengale to a set of pirates which were gone a cruising in her and that they had already taken an english ship and two dutch ships very richly laden  this later part we found to concern us directly and though we knew it to be false yet as my partner said very well if we had fallen into their hands and they had had such a prepossession against us beforehand it had been in vain for us to have defended our selves or to hope for any good quarter at their hands and especially considering that our accusers had been our judges and that we could have expected nothing from them but what rage would have dictated and an ungoverned passion have executed and therefore it was his opinion we should go directly back to bengale from whence we came without putting in at any port whatever because there we could give a good account of our selves could prove where we were when the ship put in who we bought her of and the like and which was more than all the rest if we were put to the necessity of bringing it before the proper judges we should be sure to have some justice and not be hanged first and judged afterward  i was sometime of my partners opinion but after a little more serious thinking i told him i thought it was a very great hazard for us to attempt returning to bengale for that we were on the wrong side of the straits of malacca and that if the alarm was given we should be sure to be waylaid on every side as well by the dutch of battavia as the english elsewhere that if we should be taken as it were running away we should even condemn our selves and there would want no more evidence to destroy us i also asked the english sailors opinion who said he was of my mind and that we should certainly be taken  this danger a little startled my partner and all the ships company and we immediately resolved to go away to the coast of tonquin and so on to the coast of china and pursuing the first design as to trade find some way or other to dispose of the ship and come back in some of the vessels of the country such as we could get this was approved of as the best method for our security and accordingly we steered away nne keeping above fifty leagues off from the usual course to the eastward  this however put us to some inconveniences for first the winds when we came to the distance from the shore seemed to be more steadily against us blowing almost trade as we call it from the east and ene so that we were a long while upon our voyage and we were but ill provided with victuals for so long a voyage and which was still worse there was some danger that those english and dutch ships whose boats pursued us whereof some were bound that way might be got in before us and if not some other ship bound to china might have information of us from them and pursue us with the same vigor  i must confess i was now very uneasy and thought myself including the late escape from the longboats to have been in the most dangerous condition that ever i was in through all my past life for whatever ill circumstances i had been in i was never pursued for a thief before nor had i ever done any thing that merited the name of dishonest or fraudulent much less thievish i had chiefly been my own enemy or as i may rightly say i had been no bodys enemy but my own but now i was embarrassd in the worst condition imaginable for though i was perfectly innocent i was in no condition to make that innocence appear and if i had been taken it had been under a supposed guilt of the worst kind at least a crime esteemed so among the people i had to do with  this made me very anxious to make an escape though which way to do it i knew not or what port or place we should go to my partner seeing me thus dejected though he was the most concerned at first began to encourage me and discribing to me the several ports of that coast told me he would put in on the coast of chochinchina or the bay of tonquin intending to go afterward to macao a town once in the possession of the portuguese and where still a great many european families resided and particularly the missionary priests usually went thither in order to their going forward to china  hither then we resolved to go and accordingly though after a tedious and irregular course and very much straightened for provisions we came within sight of the coast very early in the morning and upon reflection upon the past circumstances we were in and the danger if we had not escaped we resolved to put into a small river which however had a depth enough of water for us and to see if we could either over land or by the ships pinnace come to know what ships were in any port thereabouts this happy step was indeed our deliverance for though we did not immediately see any europian ships in the bay of tonquin yet the next morning there came into the bay two dutch ships and a third without any colors spread out but which we believed to be a dutch man passed by at about two leagues distance steering for the coast of china and in the afternoon went by two english ships steering the same course and thus we thought we saw our selves beset with enemies both one way or other the place we were in was wild and barbarous the people thieves even by occupation or profession and though it is true we had not much to seek of them and except getting a few provisions cared not how little we had to do with them yet it was with much difficulty that we kept our selves from being insulted by them several ways  we were in a small river of this country within a few leagues of its utmost limits northward and by our boat we coasted notheast to the point of land which opens the great bay of tonquin and it was in this beating up along the shore that we discovered as above that in a word we were surrounded with enemies the people we were among were the most barbarous of all the inhabitants of the coast having no correspondence with any other nation and dealing only in fish and oil and such gross commodities and it may be particularly seen that they are as i said the most barbarous of any of the inhabitants viz that among other customs they have this as one viz that if any vessel have the misfortune to be shipwrecked upon their coast they presently make their men all prisoners or slaves and it was not long before we found a spice of their kindness this way on the occasion following  i have observed above that our ship sprung a leak at sea and that we could not find it out and however it happened that as i have said it was stopped unexpectedly in the happy minute of our being to be seized by the dutch and english ships in the bay of siam yet as we did not find the ship so perfectly fit and sound as we desired we resolved while we were in this place to lay her on shore take out what heavy things we had on board which were not many and to wash and clean her bottom and if possible to find out where the leaks were  accordingly having lightened the ship and brought all our guns and other moveable things to one side we tried to bring her down that we might come at her bottom but on second thoughts we did not care to lay her dry on ground neither could we find out a proper place for it  the inhabitants who had never been acquainted with such a sight came wondering down to the shore to look at us and seeing the ship lie down on one side in such a manner and heeling in toward the shore and not seeing our men who were at work on her bottom with stages and with their boats on the offside they presently concluded that the ship was cast away and lay so fast on the ground  on this supposition they came all about us in two or three hours time with ten or twelve large boats having some of them eight some ten men in a boat intending no doubt to have come on board and plundered the ship and if they had found us there to have carried us away for slaves to their king or whatever they call him for we knew nothing who was their governor  when they came up to the ship and began to row round her they discovered us all hard at work on the outside of the ships bottom and side washing and graving and stopping as every seafaring man knows how  they stood for a while gazing at us and we who were a little surpised could not imagine what their design was but being willing to be sure we took this opportunity to get some of us into the ship and others to hand down arms and ammunition to those that were at work to defend themselves with if there should be occasion and it was no more than need for in less than a quarter of an hours consultation they agreed it seems that the ship was really a wreck that we were all at work endeavoring to save her or to save our lives by the help of our boats and when we handed our arms into the boats they concluded by that motion that we were endeavoring to save some of our goods upon this they took it for granted we all belonged to them and away they came down upon our men as if it had been in a line of battle  our men seeing so many of them began to be frighted for we lay but in an ill posture to fight and cried out to us to know what they should do i immediately called to the men who worked upon the stages to slip them down and get up the side into the ship and bad those in the boat to row round and come on board and those few of us who were on board worked with all the strength and hands we had to bring the ship to rights but however neither the men upon the stages or those in the boats could do as they were ordered before the cochinchinesses were upon them and two of their boats boarded our longboat and began to lay hold of the men as their prisoners  the first man they laid hold of was an englishseaman a stout strong fellow who having a musket in his hand never offered to fire it but laid it down in the boat like a fool as i thought but he understood his business better than i could teach him for he grappled the pagan and dragged him by main force out of their own boat into ours where taking him by the two ears he beat his head so against the boats gunnel that the fellow died instantly in his hands and in the mean time a dutch man who stood next took up the musket and with the butend of it so laid about him that he knocked down five of them who attempted to enter the boat but this was doing little toward resisting thirty or forty men who fearless because ignorant of their danger began to throw themselves into the longboat where we had but five men in all to defend it but one accident gave our men a complete victory which deserved our laughter rather than any thing else and that was this  our carpenter being preparing to grave the outside of the ship as well as to pay the seams where he had caulkd her to stop the leakes had got two kettles just let down into the boat one filled with boiling pitch and the other with rosin tallow and oil and such stuff as the shipwrights use for that work and the man that tended the carpenter had a great iron ladle in his hand with which he supplied the men that were at work with that hot stuff two of the enemies men entered the boat just where this fellow stood being in the foresheets he immediately saluted them with a ladle full of the stuff boiling hot which so burnt and scalded them being half naked that they roared out like two bulls and enraged with the fire leaped both into the sea the carpenter saw it and cried out well done jack give them some more of it and stepping forward himself takes one of their mops and dipping it in the pitchpot he and his man threw it among them so plentifully that in short of all the men in three boats there was not one that was not scalded and burnt with it in a most frightful pitiful manner and made such a howling and crying that i never heard a worse noise and indeed nothing like it for it is worth observing that though pain naturally makes all people cry out yet every nation has a particular way of exclamation and make noises as different from one another as their speech i cannot give the noise these creatures made a better name than howling nor a name more proper to the tone of it for i never heard any thing more like the noise of the wolves which as i have said i heard howl in the forest on the frontiers of languedoc  i was never pleased with a victory better in my life not only as it was a perfect surprise to me and that our danger was imminent before but as we got this victory without any blood shed except of that man the fellow killed with his naked hands and which i was very much concerned at for i was sick of killing such poor savage wretches even though it was in my own defense knowing they came on errands which they thought just and knew no better and that though it may be a just thing because necessary for there is no necessary wickedness in nature yet i thought it was a sad life which we must be always obliged to be killing our fellow creatures to preserve our own and indeed i think so still and i would even now suffer a great deal rather than i would take away the life even of that person injuring me and i believe all considering people who know the value of life would be of my opinion at least they would if they entered seriously into the consideration of it  but to return to my story all the while this was doing my partner and i who managed the rest of the men on board had with great dexterity brought the ship almost to rights and having gotten the guns into their places again the gunner called to me to bid our boat get out of the way for he would let fly among them i called back again to him and bid him not offer to fire for the carpenter would do the work without him but bad him heat another pitchkettle which our cook who was on board took care of but the enemy were so terrified with what they had met with in their first attack that they would not come on again and some of them that were farthest off seeing the ship swim as it were upright begun as we supposed to see their mistake and give over the enterprise finding it was not as they expected thus we got clear of this merry fight and having gotten some rice and some roots and bread with about sixteen good big hogs on board two days before we resolved to stay here no longer but go forward whatever came of it for we made no doubt but we should be surrounded the next day with rogues enough perhaps more than our pitchkettle would dispose of for us  we therefore got all our things on board the same evening and the next morning was ready to sail in the mean time lying at an anchor at some distance we were not so much concerned being now in a sighting posture as well as in a sailing posture if any enemy had presented the next day having finished our work within board and finding our ship was perfectly healed of all her leaks we set sail we would have gone into the bay of tonquin for we wanted to inform our selves of what was to be known concerning the dutch ships that had been there but we durst not stand in there because we had seen several ships go in as we supposed but a little before so we kept on ne toward the isle of formosa as much afraid of being seen by a dutch or english merchant ship as a dutch or english merchant ship in the mediteranean is of an algerine man of war  when we were thus got to sea we kept out ne as if we would go to the munillas or the phillippine islands and this we did that we might not fall into the way of any of our european ships and then we steered north till we came to the latitude of    degrees  0 min by which means we made the island formosa directly where we came to an anchor in order to get water and fresh provisions which the people there who are very courteous and civil in their manners supplied us with willingly and dealt very fairly and punctually with us in all their agreements and bargains which is what we did not find among other people and may be owing to the remains of christianity which was once planted here by a dutch missionary of protestants and is a testimony of what i have often observed viz that the christian religion always civilizes the people and reforms their manners where it is received whether it works saving effects upon them or no  from hence we sailed still north keeping the coast of china at an equal distance till we knew we were beyond all the ports of china where our european ships usually come being resolved if possible not to fall into any of their hands especially in this country where as our circumstances were we could not fail of being entirely ruined nay so great was my fear in particular as to my being taken by them that i believe firmly i would much rather have chosen to fall into the hands of the spanish inquisition  being now come to the latitude of  0 degrees we resolved to put into the first trading port we should come at and standing in for the shore a boat came off two leagues to us with an old portuguese pilot on board who knowing us to be an european ship came to offer his service which indeed we were very glad of and took him on board upon which without asking us whether we would go he dismissed the boat he came in and sent them back  i thought it was now so much in our choice to make the old man carry us whither we would that i began to talk with him about carrying us to the gulf of nanquin which is the most northern part of the coast of china the old man said he knew the gulf of nanquin very well but smiling asked us what we would do there  i told him we would sell our cargo and purchase chinawares callicoes rawsilks tea wroughtsilks etc and so would return by the same course we came he told us our best port had been to have put in at macao where we could not have failed of a market for our opium to our satisfaction and might for our money have purchased all sorts of chinagoods as cheap as we could at nanquin  not being able to put the old man out of his talk of which he was very opiniated or conceited i told him we were gentlemen as well as merchants and that we had a mind to go and see the great city of pecking and the famous court of the monarch of china why then says the old man you should go to ningpo where by the river which runs into the sea there you may go up within five leagues of the great canal this canal is a navigable river which goes through the heart of that vast empire of china crosses all the rivers passes some considerable hills by the help of sluices and gates and goes up to the city of pecking being in length near   0 leagues  well said i seignior portuguese but that is not our business now the great question is if you can carry us up to the city of nanquin from whence we can travel to pecking afterward yes he said he could do so very well and that there was a great dutch ship gone up that way just before this gave me a little shock and a dutch ship was now our terror and we had much rather have met the devil at least if he had not come in too frightful a figure and we depended upon it that a dutch ship would be our destruction for we were in no condition to fight them all the ships they trade with into those parts being of great burden and of much greater force than we were  the old man found me a little confused and under some concern when he named a dutch ship and said to me sir you need be under no apprehensions of the dutch i suppose they are not now at war with your nation no says i that is true but i know not what liberties men may take when they are out of the reach of the law why says he you are no pirates what need you fear they will not meddle with peaceable merchants sure  if i had any blood in my body that did not fly up into my face at that word it was hindered by some stop in the vessels appointed by nature to prevent it for it put me into the greatest disorder and confusion imaginable nor was it possible for me to conceal it so but that the old man easily perceived it  sir says he i find you are in some disorder in your thoughts at my talk pray be pleased to go which way you think fit and depend upon it i will do you all the service i can why seignior said i it is true i am a little unsettled in my resolution at this time whither to go in particular and i am something more so for what you said about pirates i hope there are no pirates in these seas we are but in an ill condition to meet with them for you see we have but a small force and but very weakly manned  o sir says he do not be concerned i do not know that there has been any pirates in these seas these fifteen years except one which was seen as i hear in the bay of siam about a month since but you may be assured she is gone to the southward nor was she a ship of any great force or fit for the work she was not built for a privateer but was run away with by a reprobate crew that were on board after the captain and some of his men had been murdered by the malayans at or near the island of sumatra  what said i seeming to know nothing of the matter did they murder the captain no said he i do not understand that they murdered him but as they afterward run away with the ship it is generally believed they betrayed him into the hands of the malayans who did murder him and perhaps they procured them to do it why then said i they deserve death as much as if they had done it themselves nay says the old man they do deserve it and they will certainly have it if they light upon any english or dutch ship for they have all agreed together that if they meet that rogue they will give him no quarter  but said i to him you say the pirate is gone out of those seas how can they meet with him why that is true says he they do say so but he was as i tell you in the bay of siam in the river cambodia and was discovered there by some dutch men who belonged to the ship and who were left on shore when they run away with her and some english and dutch traders being in the river they were within a little of taking him nay said he if the foremost boats had been well seconded by the rest they had certainly taken him but he finding only two boats within reach of him tacked about and fired at these two and disabled them before the other came up and then standing off to sea the other were not able to follow him and so he got away but they have all so exact a description of the ship that they will be sure to know him and wherever they find him they have vowed to give no quarter to either the captain or the seamen but to hang them all up at the yardarm  what says i will they execute them right or wrong hang them first and judge them afterward o sir says the old pilot there is no need to make a formal business of it with such rogues as those let them tie them back to back and set them a diving it is no more than they richly deserve  i knew i had my old man fast aboard and that he could do me no harm so that i turned short upon him well now seignior said i and this is the very reason why i would have you carry us up to nanquin and not to put back to macao or to any other part of the country where the english or dutch ships come for be it known to you seignior those captains of the english and dutch ships are a parcel of rash proud insolent fellows that neither knows what belongs to justice nor how to behave themselves as the laws of god and nature direct but being proud of their offices and not understanding their power they would act the murderers to punish robbers would take upon them to insult men falsely accused and determine them guilty without due enquiry and perhaps i may live to call some of them to an account for it where they may be taught how justice is to be executed and that no man ought to be treated as a criminal till some evidence may be had of the crime and that he is the man  with this i told him that this was the very ship they attacked and gave him a full account of the skirmish we had with their boats and how foolishly and cowardlike they behaved i told him all the story of our buying the ship and how the dutch men served us i told him the reasons i had to believe that this story of killing the master by the malayans was true as also the running away with the ship but that it was all a fiction of their own to suggest that the men were turned pirates and they ought to have been sure it was so before they had ventured to attack us by surprise and oblige us to resist them adding that they would have the blood of those men who we killed there in our just defense to answer for  the old man was amazed at this relation and told us we were very much in the right to go away to the north and that if he might advise us it should be to sell the ship in china which we might very well do and buy or build another in the country and said he though you will not get so good a ship yet you may get one able enough to carry you and all your goods back again to bengale or any where else  i told him i would take his advice when i came to any port where i could find a ship for my turn or get any customer to buy this he replied i should meet with customers enough for the ship at nanquin and that a chinese jonk would serve me very well to go back again and that he would procure me people both to buy one and sell the other  well but seignior says i as you say they know the ship so well i may perhaps if i follow your measures be instrumental to bring some honest innocent men into a terrible broil and perhaps to be murdered in cold blood for wherever they find the ship they will prove the guilt upon the men by proving this was the ship and so innocent men may probably be overpowered and murdered why says the old man i will find out a way to prevent that also for as i know all those commanders you speak of very well and shall see them all as they pass by i will be sure to set them to rights in the thing and let them know that they had been so much in the wrong that though the people who were on board at first might run away with the ship yet it was not true that they had turned pirates and that in particular these were not the men that first went off with the ship but innocently bought her for their trade and i am persuaded they will so far believe me as at least to act more cautiously for the time to come well says i and will you deliver one message to them from me yes i will says he if you will give it under your hand in writing that i may be able to prove that it came from you and not out of my own head i answered that i would readily give it him under my hand so i took a pen and ink and paper and wrote at large the story of assaulting me with the longboats etc the pretended reason of it and the unjust cruel design of it and concluded to the commanders that they had done what they not only should have been ashamed of but also that if ever they came to england and i lived to see them there they should all pay dearly for it if the laws of my country were not grown out of use before i arrived there  my old pilot read this over and over again and asked me several times if i would stand to it i answered i would stand to it as long as i had any thing left in the world being sensible that i should one time or other find an opportunity to put it home to them but we had no occasion ever to let the pilot carry this letter for he never went back again while those things were passing between us by way of discourse we went forward directly for nanquin and in about thirteen days sail came to an anchor at the south west point of the great gulf of nanquin where by the way i came by accident to understand that two dutch ships were gone the length before me and that i should certainly fall into their hands i consulted my partner again in this exigency and he was as much at a loss as i was and would very gladly have been safe on shore almost any where however i was not in such perplexity neither but i asked the old pilot if there was no creek or harbor which i might put into and pursue my business with the chinese privately and be in no danger of the enemy he told me if i would sail to the southward about two and forty leagues there was a little port called quinchang where the fathers of the mission usually landed from macao on their progress to teach the christian religion to the chinese and where no european ships ever put in and if i thought to put in there i might consider what farther course to take when i was on shore he confessed he said it was not a place for merchants except that at some certain times they had a kind of a fair there when the merchants from japan came over thither to buy the chinese merchandises  we all agreed to go back to this place the name of the port as he called it i may perhaps spell wrong for i do not particularly remember it having lost this together with the names of many other places set down in a little pocketbook which was spoiled by the water on an accident which i shall relate in its order but this i remember that the chinese or japonese merchants we corresponded with called it by a differing name from that which our portuguese pilot gave it and pronounced it as above quinchang  as we were unanimous in our resolutions to go to this place we weighed the next day having only gone twice on shore where we were to get fresh water on both which occasions the people of the country were very civil to us and brought us abundance of things to sell to us i mean of provisions plants roots tea rice and some fowls but nothing without money  we came to the other port the wind being contrary not till five days but it was very much to our satisfaction and i was joyful and i may say thankful when i set my foot safe on shore resolving and my partner too that if it was possible to dispose of our selves and effects any other way though not every way to our satisfaction we would never set one foot on board that unhappy vessel more and indeed i must acknowledge that of all the circumstances of life that ever i had any experience of nothing makes mankind so completely miserable as that of being in constant fear well does the scripture say the fear of man brings a snare it is a life of death and the mind is so entirely suppressed by it that it is capable of no relief the animal spirits sink and all the vigor of nature which usually supports men under other afflictions and is present to them in the greatest exigencies fails them here  nor did it fail of its usual operations upon the fancy by heightening every danger representing the english and dutch captains to be men incapable of hearing reason or of distinguishing between honest men and rogues or between a story calculated for our own turn made out of nothing on purpose to deceive and a true genuine account of our whole voyage progress and design for we might many ways have convinced any reasonable creature that we were not pirates the goods we had on board the course we steered or frankly showing our selves and entering into such and such ports and even our very manner the force we had the number of men the few arms little ammunition short provisions all these would have served to convince any men that we were no pirates the opium and other goods we had on board would make it appear the ship had been at bengale the dutch men who it was said had the names of all the men that was in the ship might easily see that we were a mixture of english portuguese and indians and but two dutch men on board these and many other particular circumstances might have made it evident to the understanding of any commander whose hands we might fall into that we were no pirates  but fear that blind useless passion worked another way and threw us into the vapors it bewildred our understandings and set the imagination at work to form a thousand terrible things that perhaps might never happen we first supposed as indeed every body had related to us that the seamen on board the english and dutch ships but especially the dutch were so enraged at the name of a pirate and especially at our beating of their boats and escaping that they would not give themselves leave to enquire whether we were pirates or no but would execute us off hand as we call it without giving us any room for a defense we reflected that there was really so much apparent evidence before them that they would scarce enquire after any more as first that the ship was certainly the same and that some of the seamen among them knew her and had been on board her and secondly that when we had intelligence at the river of cambodia that they were coming down to examine us we fought their boat and fled so that we made no doubt but they were fully satisfied of our being pirates as we were satisfied of the contrary and as i often said i know not but i should have been apt to have taken those circumstances for evidence if the tables were turned and my case was theirs and have made no scruple of cutting all the crew to pieces without believing or perhaps considering what they might have to offer in their defense  but let that be how it will those were our apprehensions and both my partner and i too scarce slept a night without dreaming of halters and yardarms that is to say gibbets of fighting and being taken of killing and being killed and one night i was in such a fury in my dream fancying the dutch men had boarded us and i was knocking one of their seamen down that i struck my double fist against the side of the cabin i lay in with such a force as wounded my hand most grievously broke my knuckles and cut and bruised the flesh so that it not only waked me out of my sleep but i was once afraid i should have lost two of my fingers  another apprehension i had was of the cruel usage we might meet with from them if we fell into their hands then the story of amboyna came into my head and how the dutch might perhaps torture us as they did our countrymen there and make some of our men by extremity of torture confess those crimes they never were guilty of own themselves and all of us to be pirates and so they would put us to death with a formal appearance of justice and that they might be tempted to do this for the gain of our ship and cargo which was worth four or five thousand pound put altogether  these things tormented me and my partner too night and day nor did we consider that the captains of ships have no authority to act thus and if we had surrendered prisoners to them they could not answer the destroying us or torturing us but would be accountable for it when they came into their own country this i say gave me no satisfaction for if they will act thus with us what advantage would it be to us that they would be called to an account for it or if we were first to be murdered what satisfaction would it be to us to have them punished when they came home  i cannot refrain taking notice here what reflections i now had upon the past variety of my particular circumstances how hard i thought it was that i who had spent forty years in a life of continued difficulties and was at last come as it were to the port or haven which all men drive at viz to have rest and plenty should be a voluntier in new sorrows by my own unhappy choice and that i who had escaped so many dangers in my youth should now come to be hanged in my old age and in so remote a place for a crime i was not in the least inclined to much less really guilty of and in a place and circumstance were innocence was not like to be any protection at all to me  after these thoughts something of religion would come in and i should be considering that this seemed to me to be a disposition of immediate providence and i ought to look upon it and submit to it as such that although i was innocent as to men i was far from being innocent as to my maker and i ought to look in and examine what other crimes in my life were most obvious to me and for which providence might justly inflict this punishment as a retribution and that i ought to submit to this just as i would to a shipwreck if it had pleased god to have brought such a disaster upon me  in its turn natural courage would sometimes take its place and then i would be talking my self up to vigorous resolutions that i would not be taken to be barbarously used by a parcel of mercyless wretches in cold blood that it were much better to have fallen into the hands of the savages who were maneaters and who i was sure would feast upon me when they had taken me than by those who would perhaps glut their rage upon me by inhuman tortures and barbarities that in the case of the savages i always resolved to die fighting to the last gasp and why should i not do so seeing it was much more dreadful to me at least to think of falling into these mens hands than ever it was to think of being eaten by men for the savages give them their due would not eat a man till he was dead and killed them first as we do a bullock but that these men had many arts beyond the cruelty of death when ever these thoughts prevailed i was sure to put my self in a kind of fever with the agitations of a supposed fight my blood would boil and my eyes sparkle as if i was engaged and i always resolved that i would take no quarter at their hands but even at last if i could resist no longer i would blow up the ship and all that was in her and leave them but little booty to boast of  by how much the greater weight the anxieties and perplexities of these things were to our thoughts while we were at sea by so much the greater was our satisfaction when we saw our selves on shore and my partner told me he dreamed that he had a very heavy load upon his back which he was to carry up a hill and found that he was not able to stand long under it but that the portuguese pilot came and took it off his back and the hill disappeared the ground before him showing all smooth and plain and truly it was so we were all like men who had a load taken off their backs  for my part i had a weight taken off from my heart that i was not able any longer to bear and as i said above we resolved to go no more to sea in that ship when we came on shore the old pilot who was now our friend got us a lodging and a warehouse for our goods which by the way was much the same it was a little house or hut with a large house joining to it all built with canes and pallisadoed round with large canes to keep out pilsering thieves of which it seems there were not a few in that country however the magistrates allowed us also a little guard and we had a sentinel with a kind of halberd or half pike who stood sentinel at our door to whom we allowed a pint of rice and a little piece of money about the value of three pence per day so that our goods were kept very safe  the fair or mart usually kept in this place had been over some time however we found that there were three or four jonks in the river and two jappanners i mean ships from jappan with goods which they had bought in china and were not gone away having japponese merchants on shore  the first thing our old portuguese pilot did for us was to bring us acquainted with three missionary romish priests who were in the town and who had been there some time converting the people to christianity but we thought they made but poor work of it and made them but sorry christians when they had done however that was none of our business one of these was a french man who they called father simon he was a jolly well conditioned man very free in his conversation not seeming so serious and grave as the other two did one of whom was a portuguese and the other a genoese but father simon was courteous easy in his manner and very agreeable company the other two were more reserved seemed rigid and austere and applied seriously to the work they came about viz to talk with and infinuate themselves among the inhabitants wherever they had opportunity we often eat and drank with those men and though i must confess the conversion as they call it of the chinese to christianity is so far from the true conversion required to bring heathen people to the faith of christ that it seems to amount to little more than letting them know the name of christ and say some prayers to the virgin mary and her son in a tongue which they understand not and to cross themselves and the like yet it must be confessed that these religious who we call missionaries have a firm belief that these people shall be saved and that they are the instruments of it and on this account they undergo not only the fatigue of the voyage and hazards of living in such places but oftentimes death it self with the most violent tortures for the sake of of this work and it would be a great want of charity in us whatever opinion we have of the work it self and the manner of their doing it if we should not have a good opinion of their zeal who undertook it with so many hazards and who have no prospect of the least temporal advantage to themselves  but to return to my story this french priest father simon was appointed it seems by order of the chief of the mission to go up to peking the royal seat of the chinese emperor and waited only for another priest who was ordered to come to him from macao to go along with him and we scarce ever met together but he was inviting me to go that journey telling me how he would show me all the glorious things of that mighty empire and among the rest the greatest city in the world a city said he that your london and our paris put together cannot be equal to this was the city of peking which i confess is very great and infinitely full of people but as i looked on those things with different eyes from other men so i shall give my opinion of them in few words when i come in the course of my travels to speak more particularly of them  but first i come to my friar or missionary dining with him one day and being very merry together i showed some little inclination to go with him and he pressed me and my partner very hard and with a great many persuasions to consent why father simon says my partner why should you desire our company so much you know we are heretics and you do not love us nor cannot keep us company with any pleasure o says he you may perhaps be good catholics in time my business here is to convert heathens and who knows but i may convert you too very well father said i so you will preach to us all the way i will not be troublesome to you says he our religion does not divest us of good manners besides says he we are here like countrymen and so we are compared to the place we are in and if you are hugonots and i a catholic we may be all christians at last at least said he we are all gentlemen and we may converse so without being uneasy to one another i liked that part of his discourse very well and it began to put me in mind of my priest that i had left in the brasils but this father simon did not come up to his character by a great deal for though father simon had no appearance of a criminal levity in him neither yet he had not that fund of christian zeal strict piety and sincere affection to religion that my other good ecclesiastic had of whom i have said so much  but to leave him a little though he never left us nor soliciting us to go with him but we had something else before us at first for we had all this while our ship and our merchandise to dispose of and we began to be very doubtful what we should do for we were now in a place of very little business and once i was about to venture to sail for the river of kilam and the city of nanquin but providence seemed now more visibly as i thought than ever to concern it self in our affair and i was encouraged from this very time to think i should one way or other get out of this tangled circumstance and be brought home to my own country again though i had not the least view of the manner and when i began sometimes to think of it could not imagine by what method it was to be done providence i say began here to clear up our way a little and the first thing that offered was that our old portuguese pilot brought a japan merchant to us who began to enquire what goods we had and in the first place he bought all our opium and gave us a very good price for it paying us in gold by weight some in small pieces of their own coin and some in small wedges of about ten or eleven ounces each while we were dealing with him for our opium it came into my head that he might perhaps deal with us for the ship too and i ordered the interpreter to propose it to him he shrunk up his shoulders at it when it was first proposed to him but in a few days after he came to me with one of the missionary priests for his interpreter and told me he had a proposal to make to me and that was this he had bought a great quantity of goods of us when he had no thoughts or proposals made to him of buying the ship and that therefore he had not money enough to pay for the ship but if i would let the same men who were in the ship navigate her he would hire the ship to go to japan and would send them from thence to the philippine islands with another loading which he would pay the freight of before they went from japan and that at their return he would buy the ship i began to listen to his proposal and so eager did my head still run upon rambling that i could not but begin to entertain a notion of going my self with him and so to sail from the philippine islands away to the south seas and accordingly i asked the japanese merchant if he would not hire us to the philippine islands and discharge us there he said no he could not do that for then he could not have the return of his cargo but he would discharge us in japan he said at the ships ret urn well still i was for taking him at that proposal and going my self but my partner wiser than my self persuaded me from it representing the dangers as well of the seas as of the japaneses who are a false cruel and treacherous people and then of the spaniards at the philippines more false more cruel and more treacherous than they  but to bring this long turn of our affairs to a conclusion the first thing we had to do was to consult with the captain of the ship and with his men and know if they were willing to go to japan and while i was doing this the young man who as i said my nephew had left with me as my companion for my travels came to me and told me that he thought that voyage promised very fair and that there was a great prospect of advantage and he would be very glad if i undertook it but that if i would not and would give him leave he would go as a merchant or how i pleased to order him that if ever he came to england and i was there and alive he would render me a faithful account of his success and it should be as much mine as i pleased  i was really loath to part with him but considering the prospect of advantage which was really considerable and that he was a young fellow as likely to do well in it as any i knew i inclined to let him go but first i told him i would consult my partner and give him an answer the next day my partner and i discoursed about it and my partner made a most generous offer he told me you know it has been an unlucky ship and we both resolve not to go to sea in it again if your steward so he called my man will venture the voyage i will leave my share of the vessel to him and let him make his best of it and if we live to meet in england and he meets with success abroad he shall account for one half of the profits of the ships freight to us the other shall be his own  if my partner who was no way concerned with my young man made him such an offer i could do no less than offer him the same and all the ships company being willing to go with him we made over half the ship to him in property and took a writing from him obliging him to account for the other and away he went to japan the japan merchant proved a very punctual honest man to him protected him at japan and got him a license to come on shore which the europeans in general have not lately obtained paid him his freight very punctually sent him to the philippines loaded with japan and china wares and a supracargo of their own who trafficking with the spaniards brought back european goods again and a great quantity of cloves and other spice and there he was not only paid his freight very well and at a very good price but being not willing to sell the ship then the merchant furnished him with goods on his own account that for some money and some spices of his own which he brought with him he went back to the manillas to the spaniards where he sold his cargo very well here having gotten a good acquaintance at manilla he got his ship made a free ship and the governor of manilla hired him to go to accapulco in america on the coast of mexico and gave him a license to land there and travel to mexico and to pass in any spanish ship to europe with all his men  he made the voyage to accapulco very happily and there he sold his ship and having there also obtained allowance to travel by land to porto bello he found means some how or other to get to jamaica with all his treasure and about eight years after came to england exceeding rich of the which i shall take notice in its place in the mean time i return to our particular affairs  being now to part with the ship and ships company it came before us of course to consider what recompense we should give to the two men that gave us such timely notice of the design against us in the river of cambodia the truth was they had done us a considerable service and deserved well at our hands though by the way they were a couple of rogues too for as they believed the story of our being pirates and that we had really run away with the ship they came down to us not only to betray the design that was formed against us but to go to sea with us as pirates and one of them confessed afterward that nothing else but the hopes of going a roguing brought him to do it however the service they did us was not the less and therefore as i had promised to be grateful to them i first ordered the money to be paid to them which they said was due to them on board their respective ships that is to say the english man nineteen months pay and to the dutch man seven and over and above that i gave them each of them a small sum of money in god and which contented them very well then i made the english man gunner in the ship the gunner being now made second mate and purser the dutch man i made boatswain so they were both very well pleased and proved very serviceable being both able seamen and very stout fellows  we were now on shore in china if i thought my self banished and remote from my own country at bengale where i had many ways to get home for my money what could i think of my self now when i was gotten about a thousand leagues farther off from home and perfectly destitute of all manner of prospect of return  all we had for it was this that in about four months time there was to be another fair at the place where we were and then we might be able to purchase all sorts of the manufactures of the country and withal might possibly find some chinese jonks or vessels from tonquin that would be to be sold and would carry us and our goods whither we pleased this i liked very well and resolved to wait besides as our particular persons were not obnoxious so if any english or dutch ships came thither perhaps we might have an opportunity to load our goods and get passage to some other place in india nearer home  upon these hopes we resolved to continue here but to divert our selves we took two or three journeys into the country first we went ten days journey to see the city of nanquin and a city well worth seeing indeed they say it has a million of people in it which however i do not believe it is regularly built the streets all exactly strait and cross one another in direct lines which gives the figure of it great advantage  but when i come to compare the miserable people of these countries with ours their fabrics their manner of living their government their religion their wealth and their glory as some call it i must confess i do not so much as think it is worth naming or worth my while to write of or any that shall come after me to read  it is veryobservable that we wonder at the grandeur the riches the pomp the ceremonies the government the manufactures the commerce and the conduct of these people not that it is to be wondered at or indeed in the least to be regarded but because having first a true notion of the barbarity of those countries the rudeness and the ignorance that prevails there we do not expect to find any such things so far off  otherwise what are their buildings to the palaces and royal buildings of europe what their trade to the universal commerce of england holland france and spain what are their cities to ours for wealth strength gaiety of apparel rich furniture and an infinite variety what are their ports supplied with a few jonks and barks to our navigation our merchant fleets our large and powerful navys our city of london has more trade than all their mighty empire one english or dutch or french man of war of  0 guns would fight and destroy all the shipping of china but the greatness of their wealth their trade the power of their government and strength of their armies is surprising to us because as i have said considering them as a barbarous nation of pagans little better than savages we did not expect such things among them and this indeed is the advantage with which all their greatness and power is represented to us otherwise it is in it self nothing at all for as i have said of their ships so may be said of their armies and troops all the forces of their empire though they were to bring two millions of men into the field together would be able to do nothing but ruin the country and starve themselves if they were to besiege a strong town in flanders or to fight a disciplined army one line of german curiassiers or of french cavalry would overthrow all the horse of china a million of their foot could not stand before one embattled body of our infantry posted so as not to be surrounded though they were to be not one to twenty in number nay i do not boast if i say that  0000 german or english foot and  0000 french horse would fairly beat all the forces of china and so of our fortified towns and of the art of our engineers in assaulting and defending towns there is not a fortified town in china could hold out one month against the batteries and attacks of an european army and at the same time all the armies of china could never take such a town as dunkirk provided it was not starved no not in a ten years siege they have firearms it is true but they are awkward clumsy and uncertain in going off they have powder but it is of no strength they have neither discipline in the field exercise to their arms skill to attack or temper to retreat and therefore i must confess it seemed strange to me when i came home and heard our people say such fine things of the power riches glory magnificence and trade of the chinese because i saw and knew that they were a contemptible herd or crowd of ignorant sordid slaves subjected to a government qualified only to rule such a people and in a word for i am now launched quite beside my design i say in a word were not its distance inconceivably great from muscovy and was not the muscovite empire almost as rude impotent and ill governed a crowd of slaves as they the czar of muscovy might with much ease drive them all out of their country and conquer them in one campaign and had the czar who i since hear is a growing prince and begins to appear formidable in the world fallen this way instead of attacking the warlike swedes in which attempt none of the powers of europe would have envied or interrupted him he might by this time have been emperor of china instead of being beaten by the king of sweden at narva when the latter was not one to six in number as their strength and their grandeur so their navigation commerce and husbandry is imperfect and impotent compared to the same things in europe also in their knowledge their learning their skill in the sciences they have globes and spheres and a smatch of the knowledge of the mathematics but when you come to enquire into their knowledge how shortsighted are the wisest of their students they know nothing of the motion of the heavenly bodies and so grossly absurdly ignorant that when the sun is eclipsed they think it is a great dragon has assaulted and run away with it and they fall a clattering with all the drums and kettles in the country to fright the monster away just as we do to hive a swarm of bees  as this is the only excursion of this kind which i have made in all the account i have given of my travels so i shall make no more descriptions of countries and people it is none of my business or any part of my design but giving an account of my own adventures through a life of inimitable wanderings and a long variety of changes which perhaps few that come after me will have heard the like of i shall therefore say very little of all the mighty places desert countries and numerous people i have yet to pass through more than relates to my own story and which my concern among them will make necessary i was now as near as i can compute in the heart of china about the latitude of thirty degrees north of the line for we were returned from nanquin i had indeed a mind to see the city of peking which i had heard so much of and father simon importuned me daily to do it at length his time of going away being set and the other missionary who was to go with him being arrived from macao it was necessary that we should resolve either to go or not to go so i referred him to my partner and left it wholly to his choice who at length resolved it in the affirmative and we prepared for our journey we set out with very good advantage as to finding the way for we got leave to travel in the retinue of one of their mandarins a kind of viceroy or principal magistrate in the province where they reside and who take great state upon them traveling with great attendance and with great homage from the people who are sometimes greatly impoverished by them because all the countries they pass through are obliged to furnish provisions for them and all their attendance that which i particularly observed as to our traveling with his baggage was this that though we received sufficient provisions both for our selves and our horses from the country as belonging to the mandarin yet were obliged to pay for every thing we had after the market price of the country and the mandarins steward or commissary of the provisions collected it duly from us so that our traveling in the retinue of the mandarin though it was a very great kindness to us was not such a mighty favor in him but was indeed a great advantage to him considering there were above thirty other people traveled in the same manner besides us under the protection of his retinue or as we may call it under his convoy this i say was a great advantage to him for the country furnished all the provisions for nothing and he took all our money for them  we were five and twenty days traveling to peking through a country infinitely populous but miserably cultivated the husbandry the economy and the way of living miserable though they boast so much of the industry of the people i say miserable and so it is if we who understand how to live were to endure it or to compare it with our own but not so to these poor wretches who know no other the pride of these people is infinitely great and exceeded by nothing but their poverty which adds to that which i call their misery and i must needs think the naked savages of america live much more happy because as they have nothing so they desire nothing whereas these are proud and insolent and in the main are mere beggars and drudges their ostentation is inexpressible and is chiefly showed in their clothes and building and in the keeping multitudes of servants or slaves and which is to the last degree ridiculous their contempt of all the world but themselves  i must confess i traveled more pleasantly afterward in the deserts and vast wildernesses of grand tartary than here and yet the roads here are well paved and well kept and very convenient for travelers but nothing was more awkward to me than to see such a haughty imperious insolent people in the midst of the grossest simplicity and ignorance for all their famed ingenuity is no more and my friend father simon and i used to be very merry upon these occasions to see the beggarly pride of those people for example coming by the house of a country gentleman as father simon called him about ten leagues off of the city of nanquin we had first of all the honor to ride with the master of the house about two miles the state he rode in was a perfect don quixotism being a mixture of pomp and poverty  the habit of this greasy don was very proper for a scaramouch or merryandrew being a dirty callicoe with all the tawdry and trapping of a foolscoat such as hangingsleeves tossels and cuts and slashes almost on every side it covered a taffaty vest as greasy as a butcher and which testified that his honor must needs be a most exquisite sloven  his horse was a poor lean starved hobbling creature such as in england might sell for about  0 or  0 shillings and he had two slaves followed him on foot to drive the poor creature along he had a whip in his hand and he belabourd the beast as fast about the head as his slaves did about the tail and thus he rode by us with about ten or twelve servants and we were told he was going from the city to his country seat about half a league before us we traveled on gently but this figure of a gentleman rode away before us and as we stopped at a village about an hour to refresh us when we came by the country seat of this great man we saw him in a little place before his door eating his repast it was a kind of a garden but he was easy to be seen and we were given to understand that the more we looked on him the better he would be pleased  he sat under a tree something like the palmetto tree which effectually shaded him over the head and on the south side but under the tree also was placed a large umbrello which made that part look well enough he sat lolling back in a great elbowchair being a heavy corpulent man and his meat being brought him by two women slaves he had two more whose office i think few gentlemen in europe would accept of their service in viz one fed the squire with a spoon and the other held the dish with one hand and scraped off what he let fall upon his worships beard and taffaty vest while the great fat brute thought it below him to employ his own hands in any of those familiar offices which kings and monarchs would rather do than be troubled with the clumsy fingers of their servants  i took this time to think what pain mens pride puts them to and how troublesome a haughty temper thus illmanagd must be to a man of common sense and leaving the poor wretch to please himself with our looking at him as if we admired his pomp whereas we really pitied and contemned him we persud our journey only father simon had the curiosity to stay to inform himself what dainties the country justice had to feed on in all his state which he said he had the honor to taste of and which was i think a dose that an english hound would scarce have eaten if it had been offered him viz a mess of boiled rice with a great piece of garlic in it and a little bag filled with green pepper and another plant which they have there something like our ginger but smelling like musk and tasting like mustard all this was put together and a small lump or piece of lean mutton boiled in it and this was his worships repast four or five servants more attending at a distance if he fed them meaner than he was fed himself the spice excepted they must fare very coarsely indeed  as for our mandarin with whom we traveled he was respected like a king surrounded always with his gentlemen and attended in all his appearances with such pomp that i saw little of him but at a distance but this i observed that there was not a horse in his retinue but that our carriers packhorses in england seem to me to look much better but they were so covered with equipage mantles trappings and such like trumpery that you cannot see whether they are fat or lean in a word we could see scarce any thing but their feet and their heads  i was now lighthearted and all my trouble and perplexity that i have given an account of being over i had no anxious thoughts about me which made this journey the pleasanter to me nor had i any ill accident attended me only in the passing or fording a small river my horse fell and made me free of the country as they call it that is to say threw me in the place was not deep but it wetted me all over i mention it because it spoiled my pocketbook wherein i had set down the names of several people and places which i had occasion to remember and which not taking due care of the leaves rotted and the words were never after to be read to my great loss as to the names of some places i touched at in this voyage  at length we arrived at peking i had no body with me but the youth who my nephew the captain had given me to attend me as a servant and who proved very trusty and diligent and my partner had no body with him but one servant who was a kinsman as for the portuguese pilot he being desirous to see the court we gave him his passage that is to say bore his charges for his company and to use him as an interpreter for he understood the language of the country and spoke good french and a little english and indeed this old man was a most useful impliment to us every where for we had not been above a week at peking when he came laughing ah seignior inglise says he i have something to tell you will make your heart glad my heart glad says i what can that be i dont know any thing in this country can either give me joy or grief to any great degree yes yes said the old man in broken english make you glad me sorrow sorry he would have said this made me more inquisitive why said i will it make you sorry because said he you have brought me here    days journey and will leave me to go back alone and which way shall i get to my port afterward without a ship without a horse without peccune so he called money being his broken latin of which he had abundance to make us merry with  in short he told us there was a great caravan of muscovite and polish merchants in the city and they were preparing to set out on their journey by land to muscovy within four or five weeks and he was sure we would take the opportunity to go with them and leave him behind to go back all alone i confess i was surprised with his news a secret joy spread it self over my whole soul which i cannot describe and never felt before or since and i had no power for a good while to speak a word to the old man but at last i turned to him how do you know this said i are you sure it is true yes says he i met this morning in the street an old acquaintance of mine an armenian or one you call a grecian who is among them he came last from astracan and was designing to go to tonquin where i formerly knew him but has altered his mind and is now resolved to go with the caravan to muscow and so down the river wolga to astracan well segnior says i do not be uneasy about being left to go back alone if this be a method for my return to england it shall be your fault if you go back to macao at all we then went to consulting together what was to be done and i asked my partner what he thought of the pilots news and whether it would suit with his affairs he told me he would do just as i would for he had settled all his affairs so well at bengale and left his effects in such good hands that as we had made a good voyage here if he could vest it in china silks wrought and raw such as might be worth the carriage he would be content to go england and then make his voyage back to bengale by the companys ships  having resolved upon this we agreed that if our portugal pilot would go with us we would bear his charges to muscow or to england if he pleased nor indeed were we to be esteemed over generous in that part neither if we had not rewarded him farther for the service he had done us was really worth all that and more for he had not only been a pilot to us at sea but he had been like a broker for us on shore and his procuring for us the japan merchant was some hundreds of pounds in our pocket so we consulted together about it and being willing to gratify him which was indeed but doing him justice and very willing also to have him with us besides for he was a most necessary man on all occasions we agreed to give him a quantity of coined gold which as i compute it came to about     pounds sterling between us and to bear all his charges both for himself and horse except only a horse to carry his goods  having settled this among our selves we called him to let him know what we had resolved i told him he had complained of our being to let him go back alone and i was now to tell him we was resolved he should not go back at all that as we had resolved to go to europe with the caravan we resolved also he should go with us and that we called him to know his mind he shook his head and said it was a long journey and he had no pecune to carry him thither or to subsist himself when he came there we told him we believed it was so and therefore we had resolved to do something for him that should let him see how sensible we were of the service he had done us and also how agreeable he was to us and then i told him what we had resolved to give him here which he might lay out as we would do our own and that as for his charges if he would go with us we would set him safe ashore life and casualties excepted either in muscovy or england which he would at our own charge except only the carriage of his goods  he received the proposal like a man transported and told us he would go with us over the whole world and so in short we all prepared our selves for the journey however as it was with us so it was with the other merchants they had many things to do and instead of being ready in five weeks it was four months and some odd days before all things were got together  it was the beginning of february our style when we set out from peking my partner and the old pilot had gone express back to the port where we had first put in to dispose of some goods which we had left there and i with a chinese merchant who i had some knowledge of at nanquin and who came to peking on his own affairs went to nanquin where i bought ninety pieces of fine damasks with about two hundred pieces of other very fine silks of several sorts some mixed with gold and had all these brought to peking against my partners return besides this we bought a very large quantity of raw silk and some other goods our cargo amounting in these goods only to about three thousand five hundred pounds sterling which together with tea and some fine callicoes and three camels loads of nutmegs and cloves loaded in all eighteen camels for our share besides those we rodeupon which with two or three spare horses and two horses loaded with provisions made us in short    camels and horses in our retinue  the company was very great and as near as i can remember made between three and four hundred horse and upwards of a hundred and twenty men very well armed and provided for all events for as the eastern caravans are subject to be attacked by the arabs so are these by the tartars but they are not altogether so dangerous as the arabs nor so barbarous when they prevail  the company consisted of people of several nations such as muscovites chiefly for there were above sixty of them who were merchants or inhabitants of moscow though of them some were livonians and to our particular satisfaction five of them were scots who appeared also to be men of great experience in business and men of very good substance  when we had traveled one days journey the guides who were five in number called all the gentlemen and merchants that is to say all the passengers except the servants to a great council as they called it at this great council every one deposited a certain quantity of money to a common stock for the necessary expense of buying forage on the way where it was not otherwise to be had and for satisfying the guides getting horses and the like and here they constituted the journey as they call it viz they named captains and officers to draw us all up and give the command in case of an attack and gave every one their turn of command nor was this forming us into order any more than what we found needful upon the way as shall be observed in its place  the road all on this side of the country is very populous and is full of potters and earthmakers that is to say people that tampered the earth for the china ware and as i was coming along our portugal pilot who had always something or other to say to make us merry came sneering to me and told me he would show me the greatest rarity in all the country and that i should have this to say of china after all the illhumourd things i had said of it that i had seen one thing which was not to be seen in all the world beside i was very importunate to know what it was at last he told me it was a gentlemans house built all with china ware well says i are not the materials of their building the product of their own country and so it is all china ware is not it no no says he i mean it is a house all made of china ware such as you call it in england or as it is called in our country porcellain well says i such a thing may be how big is it can we carry it in a box upon a camel if we can we will buy it upon a camel says the old pilot holding up both his hands why there is a family of thirty people lives in it  i was then curious indeed to see it and when i came to it it was nothing but this it was a timberhouse or a house built as we call it in england with lath and plaster but all the plaistering was really china ware that is to say it was plastered with the earth that makes china ware  the outside which the sun shone hot upon was glazed and looked very well perfect white and painted with blue figures as the large china ware in england is painted and hard as if it had been burnt as to the inside all the walls instead of wainscot were lined up with hardened and painted tiles like the little square tiles we call galleytiles in england all made of the finest china and the figures exceeding fine indeed with extraordinary variety of colors mixed with gold many tiles making but one figure but joined so artificially the mortar being made of the same earth that it was very hard to see where the tiles met the floors of the rooms were of the same composition and as hard as the earthen floors we have in use in several parts of england especially lincolnshire nottinghamshire leicestershire etc as hard as stone and smooth but not burnt and painted except some smaller rooms like closets which were all as it were paved with the same tile the cielings and in a word all the plaistering work in the whole house were of the same earth and after all the roof was covered with tiles of the same but of a deep shining black  this was a chinawarehouse indeed truly and literally to be called so and had i not been upon the journey i could have staid some days to see and examine the particulars of it they told me there were fountains and fish ponds in the garden all paved at the bottom and sides with the same and fine statues set up in rows on the walks entirely formed of the porcellain earth and burnt whole  as this is one of the singularities of china so they may be allowed to excel in it but i am very sure they excel in their accounts of it for they told me such incredible things of their performance in crockery ware for such it is that i care not to relate as knowing it could not be true they told me in particular of one workman that made a ship with all its tackle and masts and sails in earthen ware big enough to carry fifty men if he had told me he launched it and made a voyage to japan in it i might have said something to it indeed but as it was i knew the whole of the story which was in short asking pardon for the word that the fellow lied so i smiled and said nothing to it  this odd sight kept me two hours behind the caravan for which the leader of it for the day fined me about the value of three shillings and told me if it had been three days journey without the wall as it was three days within he must have fined me four times as much and made me ask pardon the next council day so i promised to be more orderly for indeed i found afterward the orders made for keeping all together were absolutely necessary for our common safety  in two days more we passed the great china wall made for a fortification against the tartars and a very great work it is going over hills and mountains in a needless track where the rocks are impassible and the precipices such as no enemy could possibly enter or indeed climb up or where if they did no wall could hinder them they tell us its length is near a thousand english miles but that the country is five hundred in a strait measured line which the wall bounds without measuring the windings and turnings it takes it is about four fathom high and as many thick in some places  i stood still an hour or thereabout without trespassing our orders for so long the caravan was in passing the gate i say i stood still an hour to look at it on every side near and far off i mean that was within my view and the guide of our caravan who had been extolling it for the wonder of the world was mighty eager to hear my opinion of it i told him it was a most excellent thing to keep off the tartars which he happened not to understand as i meant it and so took it for a compliment but the old pilot laughed o seignior inglese says he you speak in colors in colors said i what do you mean by that why you speak what looks white this way and black that way gay one way and dull another way you tell him it is a good wall to keep out tartars you tell me by that it is good for nothing but to keep out tartars or it will keep out none but tartars i understand you seignior inglese i understand you says he but seignior chinese understood you his own way  well says i seignior do you think it would stand out an army of our country people with a good train of artillery or our engineers with two companies of miners would not they batter it down in ten days that an army might enter in battalia or blow it up in the air foundation and all that there should be no sign of it left ay ay says he i know that the chinese wanted mightily to know what i said and i gave him leave to tell him a few days after for we was then almost out of their country and he was to leave us in a little time afterward but when he knew what i had said he was dumb all the rest of the way and we heard no more of his fine story of the chinese power and greatness while he stayed  after we had passed this mighty nothing called a wall something like the picts wall and so famous in northumberland and built by the romans we began to find the country thinly inhabited and the people rather confined to live in fortified towns and cities as being subject to the inroads and depredations of the tartars who rob in great armies and therefore are not to be resisted by the naked inhabitants of an open country  and here i began to find the necessity of keeping together in a caravan as we traveled for we saw several troops of tartars roving about but when i came to see them distinctly i wondered more that the chinese empire could be conquered by such contemptible fellows for they are a mere hoord or crowd of wild fellows keeping no order and understanding no discipline or manner of fight  their horses are poor lean starved creatures taught nothing and fit for nothing and this we said the first day we saw them which was after we entered the wilder part of the country our leader for the day gave leave for about sixteen of us to go a hunting as they call it and what was this but hunting of sheep however it may be called hunting too for the creatures are the wildest and swiftest of foot that ever i saw of their kind only they will not run a great way and you are sure of sport when you begin the chase for they appear generally thirty or forty in a flock and like true sheep always keep together when they fly  in pursuit of this odd sort of game it was our hap to meet with about forty tartars whether they were hunting mutton as we were or whether they looked for another kind of prey i know not but as soon as they saw us one of them blew a kind of a horn very loud but with a barbarous sound that i had never heard before and by the way never care to hear again we all supposed this was to call their friends about them and so it was for in less than half a quarter of an hour a troop of forty or fifty more appeared at about a mile distance but our work was over first as it happened  one of the scots merchants of muscow happened to be amongst us and as soon as he heard the horn he told us in short that we had nothing to do but to charge them immediately without loss of time and drawing us up in a line he asked if we were resolved we told him we were ready to follow him so he rode directly up to them they stood gazing at us like a mere crowd drawn up in no order nor showing the face of any order at all but as soon as they saw us advance they let fly their arrows which however missed us very happily it seems they mistook not their aim but their distance for their arrows all fell a little short of us but with so true an aim that had we been about twenty yards nearer we must have had several men wounded if not killed  immediately we halted and though it was at a great distance we fired and sent them leaden bullets for wooden arrows following our shot full gallop to fall in among them sword in hand for so our bold scot that led us directed he was indeed but a merchant but he behaved with that vigor and bravery on this occasion and yet with such a cool courage too that i never saw any man in action fitter for command as soon as we came up to them we fired our pistols in their faces and then drew but they fled in the greatest confusion imaginable the only stand any of them made was on our right where three of them stood and by signs called the rest to come back to them having a kind of scymiter in their hands and their bows hanging at their backs our brave commander without asking any body to follow him gallops up close to them and with his fuzee knocks one of them off his horse killed the second with his pistol and the third ran away and thus ended our fight but we had this misfortune attending it viz that all our mutton that we had in chase got away we had not a man killed or hurt but as for the tartars there was about five of them killed who were wounded we knew not but this we knew that the other party was so frighted with the noise of our guns that they made off and never made any attempt upon us  we were all this while in the chinese dominion and therefore the tartars were not so bold as afterward but in about five days we entered a vast great wild desert which held us three days and nights march and we were obliged to carry our water with us in great leather bottles and to encamp all night just as i have heard they do in the desert of arabia  i asked whose dominion this was in and they told me this was a kind of border that might be called no mans land being a part of the great karakathie or grand tartary but that however it was all reckoned to china but that there was no care taken here to preserve it from the inroads of thieves and therefore it was reckoned the worst desert in the whole world though we were to go over some much larger  in passing this wilderness which i confess was at the first very frightful to me we saw two or three times little parties of the tartars but they seemed to be upon their own affairs and to have no design upon us and so like the man who met the devil if they had nothing to say to us we had nothing to say to them we let them go  once however a party of them came so near as to stand and gaze at us whether it was to consider what they should do whether attack us or not attack us that we knew not but when we were passed at some distance by them we made a rearguard of forty men and stood ready for them letting the caravan pass half a mile or thereabouts before us but after a while they marched off only we found they saluted us with five arrows at their parting one of which wounded a horse so that it disabled him and we left him the next day poor creature in great need of a good farrier we suppose they might shoot more arrows which might fall short of us but we saw no more arrows or tartars that time  we traveled near a month after this the ways being not so good as at first though still in the dominions of the emperor of china but lay for the most part in villages some of which were fortified because of the incursions of the tartars when we came to one of these towns it was about two days and a half journey before we were to come to the city naum i wanted to buy a camel of which there are plenty to be sold all the way upon that road and of horses also such as they are because so many caravans coming that way they are often wanted the person that i spoke to to get me a camel would have gone and fetched it for me but i like a fool must be officious and go my self along with him the place was about two miles out of the village where it seems they kept the camels and horses feeding under a guard  i walked it on foot with my old pilot being very desirous forsooth of a little variety when we came to the place it was a low marshy ground walled round with a stone wall piled up dry without mortar or earth among it like a park with a little guard of chinese soldiers at the door having bought a camel and agreed for the price i came away and the chinese man that went with me led the camel when on a sudden came up five tartars on horseback two of them seized the fellow and took the camel from him while other three stepped up to me and my old pilot seeing us as it were unarmed for i had no weapon about me but my sword which could but ill defend me against three horsemen the first that came up stopped short upon my drawing my sword for they are errant cowards but a second coming upon my left gave me a blow on the head which i never felt till afterward and wondered when i came to my self what was the matter with me and where i was for he laid me flat on the ground but my never failing old pilot the portuguese so providence unlooked for directs deliverances from dangers which to us are unforeseen had a pistol in his pocket which i knew nothing of nor the tartars neither if they had i suppose they would not have attacked us but cowards are always boldest when there is no danger  the old man seeing me down with a bold heart stepped up to the fellow that had struck me and laying hold of his arm with one hand and pulling him down by main force a little toward him with the other shot him into the head and laid him dead upon the spot he then immediately stepped up to him who had stopped us as i said and before he could come forward again for it was all done as it were in a moment made a blow at him with a scymeter which he always wore but missing the man cut his horse into the side of his head cut one of his ears off by the root and a great slice down the side of his face the poor beast enraged with the wound was no more to be governed by his rider though the fellow sat well enough too but away he flew and carried him quite out of the pilots reach and at some distance rising up upon his hind legs threw down the tartar and fell upon him  in this interval the poor chinese came in who had lost the camel but he had no weapon however seeing the tartar down and his horse fallen upon him away he runs to him and seizing upon an ugly illfavored weapon he had by his side something like a poleax but not a poleax neither he wrenchd it from him and made shift to knock his tartarian brains out with it but my old man had the third tartar to deal with still and seeing he did not fly as he expected nor come on to fight him as he apprehended but stand stock still the old man stood still too and falls to work with his tackle to charge his pistol again but as soon as the tartar saw the pistol whether he supposed it to be the same or another i know not but away he scowered and left my pilot my champion i called him afterward a complete victory  by this time i was a little awake for i thought when first i began to wake that i had been in a sweet sleep but as i said above i wondered where i was how i came upon the ground and what was the matter in a word a few moments after as sense returned i felt pain though i did not know where i clapped my hand to my head and took it away bloody then i felt my head ach and then in another moment memory returned and every thing was present to me again  i jumped up upon my feet instantly and got hold of my sword but no enemies in view i found a tartar lie dead and his horse standing very quietly by him and looking farther i saw my champion and deliverer who had been to see what the chinese had done coming back with his hanger in his hand the old man seeing me on my feet came running to me and embraced me with a great deal of joy being afraid before that i had been killed and seeing me bloody would see how i was hurt but it was not much only what we call a broken head neither did i afterward find any great inconvenience from the blow other than the place which was hurt and which was well again in two or three days  we made no great gain however by this victory for we lost a camel and gained a horse but that which was remarkable when we came back to the village the man demanded to be paid for the camel i disputed it and it was brought to a hearing before the chinese judge of the place that is to say in english we went before a justice of the peace give him his due he acted with a great deal of prudence and impartiality and having heard both sides he gravely asked the chinese man that went with me to buy the camel whose servant he was i am no servant says he but went with the stranger at whose request says the justice at the strangers request says he why then says the justice you were the strangers servant for the time and the camel being delivered to his servant it was delivered to him and he must pay for it  i confess the thing was so clear that i had not a word to say but admiring to see such just reasoning upon the consequence and so accurate stating the cause i paid willingly for the camel and sent for another but you may observe i sent for it i did not go to fetch it my self any more i had enough of that  the city of naum is a frontier of the chinese empire they call it fortified and so it is as fortifications go there for this i will venture to affirm that all the tartars in karakathaie which i believe are some millions could not batter down the walls with their bows and arrows but to call it strong if it were attacked with cannon would be to make those who understand it laugh at you  we wanted as i have said above two days journey of this city when messengers were sent express to every part of the road to tell all travelers and caravans to halt till they had a guard sent for them for that an unusual body of tartars making ten thousand in all had appeared in the way about thirty miles beyond the city  this was very bad news to travelers however it was carefully done of the governor and we were very glad to hear we should have a guard accordingly two days after we had two hundred soldiers sent us from a garrison of the chinese on our left and three hundred more from the city of naum and with those we advanced boldly the three hundred soldiers from naum marched in our front the two hundred in our rear and our men on each side of our camels with our baggage and the whole caravan in the center in this order and well prepared for battle we thought our selves a match for the whole ten thousand mongul tartars if they had appeared but the next day when they did appear it was quite another thing  it was early in the morning when marching from a little well situated town called changu we had a river to pass where we were obliged to ferry and had the tartars had any intelligence then had been the time to have attacked us when the caravan being over the rearguard was behind but they did not appear  about three hours after when we were entered upon a desert of about fifteen or sixteen miles over behold by a cloud of dust they raised we saw an enemy was at hand and they were at hand indeed for they came on upon the spur  the chinese our guard on the front who had talked so big the day before began to stagger and the soldiers frequently looked behind them which is a certain sign in a soldier that he is just ready to run away my old pilot was of my mind and being near me he called out seignior inglese says he those fellows must be encouraged or they will ruin us all for if the tartars come on they will never stand it i am of your mind said i but what course must be done done says he let fifty of our men advance and flank them on each wing and encourage them and they will fight like brave fellows in brave company but without they will every man turn his back immediately i rode up to our leader and told him who was exactly of our mind and accordingly fifty of us marched to the right wing and fifty to the left and the rest made a line of rescue and so we marched leaving the last two hundred men to make another body by themselves and to guard the camels only that if need were they should send a hundred men to assist the last fifty  in a word the tartars came on and an innumerable company they were how many we could not tell but ten thousand we thought was the least a party of them came on first and viewed our posture traversing the ground in the front of our line and as we found them within gunshot our leader ordered the two wings to advance swiftly and give them a salvo on each wing with their shot which was done but they went off and i suppose back to give an account of the reception they were like to meet with and indeed that salute clogged their stomach for they immediately halted stood a while to consider of it and wheeling off to the left they gave over the design and said no more to us for that time which was very agreeable to our circumstances which were but very indifferent for a battle with such a number  two days after this we came to the city naun or naum we thanked the governor for his care for us and collected to the value of a hundred crowns or thereabouts which we gave to the soldiers sent to guard us and here we rested one day this is a garrison indeed and there were nine hundred soldiers kept here but the reason of it was that formerly the muscovite frontiers lay nearer to them than they do now the muscovites having abandoned that part of the country which lies from this city west for about two hundred miles as desolate and unfit for use and more especially being so very remote and so difficult to send troops thither for its defense for we had yet above two thousand miles to muscovy properly so called  after this we passed several great rivers and two dreadful deserts one of which we were sixteen days passing over and which as i said was to be called no mans land and on the   th of april we came to the frontiers of the muscovite dominions i think the first city or town or fortress whatever it might be called that belonged to the czar of muscovy was called argun being on the west side of the river argun  i could not but discover an infinite satisfaction that i was so soon arrived in as i called it a christian country or at least in a country governed by christians for though the muscovites do in my opinion but just deserve the name of christians yet such they pretend to be and are very devout in their way it would certainly occur to any man who travels the world as i have done and who had any power of reflection i say it would occur to him to reflect what a blessing it is to be brought into the world where the name of god and of a redeemer is known worshipped and adored and not where the people given up by heaven to strong delusions worship the devil and prostrate themselves to stocks and stones worship monsters elements horrible shaped animals and statues or images of monsters not a town or city we passed through but had their pagods their idols and their temples and ignorant people worshipping even the works of their own hands  now we came where at least a face of the christian worship appeared where the knee was bowed to jesus and whether ignorantly or not yet the christian religion was owned and the name of the true god was called upon and adored and it made the very recesses of my soul rejoice to see it i saluted the brave scots merchant i mentioned above with my first acknowledgment of this and taking him by the hand i said to him blessed be god we are once again come among christians he smiled and answered do not rejoice too soon countryman these muscovites are but an odd sort of christians and but for the name of it you may see very little of the substance for some months farther of our journey  well says i but still it is better than paganism and worshipping of devils why i will tell you says he except the russian soldiers in garrisons and a few of the inhabitants of the cities upon the road all the rest of this country for above a thousand miles farther is inhabited by the worst and most ignorant of pagans and so indeed we found it  we were now launched into the greatest piece of solid earth if i understand any thing of the surface of the globe that is to be found in any part of the earth we had at least twelve hundred miles to the sea eastward we had at least two thousand to the bottom of the baltic sea westward and above three thousand miles if we left that sea and went on west to the british and french channels we had full five thousand miles to the indian or persian sea south and about eight hundred miles to the frozen sea north nay if some people may be believed there might be no sea northeast till we came round the pole and consequently into the northwest and so had a continent of land into america the lord knows where though i could give some reasons why i believe that to be a mistake  as we entered into the muscovite dominions a good while before we came to any considerable towns we had nothing to observe there but this first that all the rivers that run to the east as i understood by the charts which some in our caravan had with them it was plain all those rivers ran into the great river yamour or gammour this river by the natural course of it must run into the east sea or chinese ocean the story they tell us that the month of this river is choked up with bullrushes of a monstrous growth viz three foot about and twenty or thirty foot high i must be allowed to say i believe nothing of but as its navigation is of no use because there is no trade that way the tartars to whom alone it belongs dealing in nothing but cattle so no body that ever i heard of has been curious enough either to go down to the mouth of it in boats or come up from the mouth of it in ships but this is certain that this river running due east in the latitude of carries a vast concourse of rivers along with it and finds an ocean to empty it self in that latitude so we are sure of sea there  some leagues to the north of this river there are several considerable rivers whose streams run as due north as the yamour runs east and these are all found to join there waters with the great river tartarus named so from the northernmost nations of the mongul tartars who the chinese say were the first tartars in the world and who as our geographers allege are the gog and magog mentioned in sacred story  these rivers running all northward as well as all the other rivers i am yet to speak of make it evident that the northern ocean bounds the land also on that side so that it does not seem rational in the least to think that the land can extend it self to join with america on that side or that there is not a communication between the northern and the earstern ocean but of this i shall say no more it was my observation at that time and therefore i take notice of it in this place we now advanced from the river arguna by easy and moderate journeys and were very visibly obliged to the care the czar of muscovy has taken to have cities and town built in as many places as are possible to place them where his soldiers keep garrison something like the stationary soldiers placed by the romans in the remotest countries of their empire some of which i had read particularly were placed in britain for the security of commerce and for the lodging travelers and thus it was here for wherever we came though at these towns and stations the garrisons and governor were russians and professed christians yet the inhabitants of the country were mere pagans sacrificing to idols and worshipping the sun moon and stars or all the host of heaven and not only so but were of all the heathens and pagans that ever i met with the most barbarous except only that they did not eat mans flesh as our savages of america did  some instances of this we met with in the country between arguna where we enter the muscovite dominions and a city of tartars and russians together called nortziuskoy in which is a continued desert or forest which cost us twenty days to travel over it in a village near the last of those places i had the curiosity to go and see their way of living which is most brutish and unsufferable they had i suppose a great sacrifice that day for there stood out upon an old stump of a tree an idol made of wood frightful as the devil at least as any thing we can think of to represent the devil can be made it had a head certainly not so much as resembling any creature that the world ever saw ears as big as goats horns and as high eyes as big as a crownpiece a nose like a crooked rams horn and a mouth extended four cornered like that of a lion with horrible teeth hooked like a parrots under bill it was dressed up in the filthiest manner that you could suppose its upper garment was of sheepskins with the wool outward a great tartar bonnet on the head with two horns growing through it it was about eight foot high yet had no feet or legs or any other proportion of parts  this scarecrow was set up at the outer side of the village and when i came near to it there was sixteen or seventeen creatures whether men or women i could not tell for they make no distinction by their habits either of body or head these lay all flat on the ground round this formidable block of shapeless wood i saw no motion among them any more than if they had been all logs of wood like the idol and at first really thought they had been so but when i came a little nearer they started up upon their feet and raised a howling cry as if it had been so many deepmouthd hounds and walked away as if they were displeased at our disturbing them a little way off from the island and at the door of that tent or hutt made all of sheepskins and cowskins dried stood three butchers i thought they were such when i came nearer to them i found they had long knives in their hands and in the middle of the tent appeared three sheep killed and one young bullock or steer these it seems were sacrifices to that senseless log of an idol and these three men priests belonging to it and the seventeen prostrated wretches were the people who brought the offering and were making their prayers to that stock  i confess i was more moved at their stupidity and brutish worship of a hobgoblin than ever i was at any thing in my life to see gods most glorious and best creature to whom he had granted so many advantages even by creation above the rest of the works of his hands vested with a reasonable soul and that soul adorned with faculties and capacities adapted both to honor his maker and be honored by him sunk and degenerated to a degree so more than stupid as to prostrate it self to a frightful nothing a mere imaginary object dressed up by themselves and made terrible to themselves by their own contrivance adorned only with clouts and rags and that this should be the effect of mere ignorance wrought up into hellish devotion by the devil himself who envying to his maker the homage and adoration of his creatures had deluded them into such gross surfeiting sordid and brutish things as one would think should shock nature it self  but what signified all the astonishment and reflection of thoughts thus it was and i saw it before my eyes and there was no room to wonder at it or think it impossible all my admiration turned to rage and i rid up to the image or monster call it what you will and with my sword cut the bonnet that was on its head in two in the middle so that it hung down by one of the horns and one of our men that was with me took hold of the sheepskin that covered it and pulled at it when behold a most hideous outcry and howling run through the village and two or three hundred people came about my ears so that i was glad to scour for it for we saw some had bows and arrows but i resolved from that moment to visit them again  our caravan rested three nights at the town which was about four miles off in order to provide some horses which they wanted several of the horses having been lamed and jaded with the badness of the way and long march over the last desert so we had some leisure here to put my design in execution i communicated my project to the scots merchant of muscow of whose courage i had had sufficient testimony as above i told him what i had seen and with what indignation i had since thought that human nature could be so degenerate i told him i was resolved if i could get but four or five men well armed to go with me i was resolved to go and destroy that vile abominable idol and let them see that it had no power to help it self and consequently could not be an object of worship or to be prayed to much less help them that offered sacrifices to it  he laughed at me says he your zeal may be good but what do you propose to yourself by it propose said i to vindicate the honor of god which is insulted by this devil worship but how will it vindicate the honor of god said he while the people will not be able to know what you mean by it unless you could speak to them and tell them so and then they will fight you and beat you too i will assure you for they are desperate fellows and that especially in defense of their idolatry can we not said i do it in the night and then leave them the reasons and causes in writing in their own language writing said he why there is not a man in five nations of them that know any thing of a letter or how to read a word in any language or in their own wretched ignorance said i to him however i have a great mind to do it perhaps nature may draw inferences from it to them to let them see how brutish they are to worship such horrid things look you sir said he if your zeal prompts you to it so warmly you must do it but in the next place i would have you consider these wild nations of people are subjected by force to the czar of muscovys dominions and if you do this it is ten to one but they will come by thousands to the governor of nertsinskay and complain and demand satisfaction and if he cannot give them satisfaction it is ten to one but they revolt and it will occasion a new war with all the tartars in the country  this i confess put new thoughts into my head for a while but i harpd upon the same string still and all that day i was uneasy to put my project in execution toward the evening the scots merchant met me by accident in our walk about the town and desired to speak with me i believe said he i have put you off of your good design i have been a little concerned about it since for i abhor the idol and the idolatry as much as you can do truly says i you have put it off a little as to the execution of it but you have not put it all out of my thoughts and i believe i shall do it still before i quit this place though i were to be delivered up to them fot satisfaction no no says he god forbid they should deliver you up to such a crew of monsters they shall not do that neither that would be murdering you indeed why says i how would they use me use you says he i will tell you how they served a poor russian who affronted them in their worship just as you did and who they took prisoner after they had lamed him with an arrow that he could not run away they took him and stripped him stark naked and set him up on the top of the idol monster and stood all round him and shot as many arrows into him as would stick over his whole body and then they burnt him and all the arrows sticking in him as a sacrifice to the idol and was this the same idol yes says he the very same well says i i will tell you a story so i related the story of our men at madagascar and how they burnt and sacked the village there and killed man woman and child for their murdering one of our men just as it is related before and when i had done i added that i thought we ought to do so to this village  he listened very attentively to the story but when i talked of doing so to that village says he you mistake very much it was not this village it was almost a hundred mile from this place but it was the same idol for they carry him about in procession all over the country well then says i then that idol ought to be punished for it and it shall says i if i live this night out  in a word finding me resolute he liked the design and told me i should not go alone but he would go with me and bring a stout fellow one of his countrymen to go also with us and one says he as famous for his zeal as you can desire any one to be against such devilish things as these in a word he brought me his comrade a scots man who he called captain richardson and i gave him a full account of what i had seen and in a word of what i intended and he told me readily he would go with me if it cost him his life so we agreed to go only us three i had indeed proposed it to my partner but he declined it he said he was ready to assist me to the utmost and upon all occasions for my defense but that this was an adventure quite out of his way so i say we resolved upon our work only us three and my manservant and to put it in execution that night about midnight with all the secrecy imaginable  however upon second thoughts we were willing to delay it till the next night because the caravan being to set forward in the morning we supposed the governor could not pretend to give them any satisfaction upon us when we were out of his power the scots merchant as steady in his resolution for the enterprise as bold in executing brought me a tartars robe or gown of the sheepskins and a bonnet with a bow and arrows and had provided the same for himself and his countryman that the people if they saw us should not be able to determine who we were  all the first night we spent in mixing up some combustible matter with aquavitae gunpowder and such other materials as we could get and having a good quantity of tar in a little pot about an hour after night we set out upon our expedition  we came to the place about eleven a clock at night and found that the people had not the least jealousy of danger attending their idol the night was cloudy yet the moon gave us light enough to see that the idol stood just in the same posture and place that it did before the people seemed to be all at their rest only that in the great hutt or tent as we called it where we saw the three priests who we mistook for butchers we saw a light and going up close to the door we heard people talking as if there were five or six of them we concluded therefore that if we set the wildfire to the idol these men would come out immediately and run up to the place to rescue it from the destruction that we intended for it and what to do with them we knew not once we thought of carrying it away and setting fire to it at a distance but when we came to handle it we found it it too bulky for our carriage so we were at a loss again the second scots man was for setting fire to the tent or hutt and knocking the creatures that were there on the head when they came out but i could not join with that i was against killing them if it was possible to be avoided well then said the scots merchant i will tell you what we will do we will try to take them prisoners tie their hands behind them and make them stand still and see their idol destroyed  as it happened we had twine or packthread enough about us which was used to tie our fireworks together with so we resolved to attack these people first and with as little noise as we could the first thing we did we knocked at the door which issued just as we desired it for one of their idol priests came to the door we immediately seized upon him stopped his mouth and tied his hands behind him and led him to the idol where we gagged him that he might not make a noise tied his feet also together and left him on the ground  two of us then waited at the door expecting that another would come out to see what the matter was but we waited so long till the third man came back to us and then no body coming out we knocked again gently and immediately out came two more and we served them just in the same manner but was obliged to go all with them and lay them down by the idol some distance from one another when going back we found two more were come out to the door and a third stood behind them within the door we seized the two and immediately tied them when the third stepping back and crying out my scots merchant went in after him and taking out a composition we had made that would only smoke and stink he set fire to it and threw it in among them by that time the other scots man and my man taking charge of the two men who were already bound and tied together also by the arm led them away to the idol and left them there to see if their idol would relieve them making have back to us  when the fuze we had thrown in had filled the hutt with so much smoke that they were almost suffocated we then threw in a small leather bag of another kind which flamed like a candle and following it in we found there was but four people left who it seems were two men and two women and as we supposed had been about some of their diabolick sacrifices they appeared in short frighted to death at least so as to sit trembling and stupid and not able to speak neither for the smoke  in a word we took them bound them as we had the other and all without any noise i should have said we brought them out of the house or hutt first for indeed we were not able to bear the smoke any more than they were when we had done this we carried them all together to the idol when we came there we fell to work with him and first we daubed him all over and his robes also with tar and such other stuff as we had which was tallow mixed with brimstone then we stopped his eyes and ears and mouth full of gunpowder and then we wrapped up a great piece of wildfire in his bonnet and then sticking all the combustibles we had brought with us upon him we looked about to see if we could find any thing else to help to burn him when my man remembered that by the tent or hutt where the men were there lay a heap of dry forage whether straw or rushes i do not remember away he and one of the scots men run and fetched their arms full of that when we had done this we took all our prisoners and brought them having untied their feet and ungaggd their mouths and made them stand up and set them just before their monstrous idol and then set fire to the whole  we stayed by it a quarter of an hour or thereabouts till the powder in the eyes and mouth and ears of the idol blew up and we could perceive had split and deformed the shape and in a word till we saw it burn into a mere block or log of wood and then setting the dry forage to it we found it would be quite consumed when we began to think of going away but the scots man said no we must not go for these poor deluded wretches will all throw themselves into the fire and burn themselves with the idol so we resolved to stay till the forage was burnt down too and then we came away and left them  in the morning we appeared among our fellow travelers exceeding busy in getting ready for our journey nor could any man suggest that we had been any where but in our beds as travelers might be supposed to be to fit themselves for the fatigues of that days journey  but it did not end so the next day came a great multitude of the country people not only of this village but of a hundred more for ought i know to the towngates and in a most outrageous manner demanded satisfaction of the russian governor for the insulting their priests and burning their great chamchithaungu such a hard name they gave the monstrous creature they worshipped the people of nertsinskay were at first in a great consternation for they said the tartars were no less than thirty thousand and that in a few days more would be one hundred thousand strong  the russian governor sent out messengers to appease them and gave them all the good words imaginable he assured them he knew nothing of it and that there had not a soul of his garrison been abroad that it could not be from any body there and if they would let him know who it was they should be examplarily punished they returned haughtily that all the country reverenced the great chamchithaungu who dwelt in the sun and no mortal would have decreed to offer violence to his image but some christian miscreant so they called them it seems and they therefore denounced war against him and all the russians who they said were miscreants and christians  the governor still patient and unwilling to make a breach or to have any cause of war alleged to be given by him the czar having straightly charged them to treat the conquered country with gentleness and civility gave them still all the good words he could at last he told them there was a caravan gone toward russia that morning and perhaps it was some of them who had done them this injury and that if they would be satisfied with that he would send after them to enquire into it this seemed to appease them a little and accordingly the governor sent after us and gave us a particular account how the thing was intimating withal that if any in our caravan had done it they should make their escape but that whether they had done it or no we should make all the have forward that was possible and that in the mean time he would keep them in play as long as he could  this was very friendly in the governor however when it came to the caravan there was no body knew any thing of the matter and as for us that were guilty we were the least of all suspected none so much as asked us the question however the captain of the caravan for the time took the hint that the governor gave us and we marched or traveled two days and two nights without any considerable stop and then we lay at a village called plothus nor did make any long stop here but hastened on toward jarawena another of the czar of muscovys colonies and where we expected we should be safe but it is to be observed that here we began for two or three days march to enter upon the vast nameless desert of which i shall say more in its place and which if we had now been upon it it is more than probable we had been all destroyed it was the second days march from plothus that by the clouds of dust behind us at a great distance some of our people began to be sensible we were pursued we had entered the desert and had passed by a great lake called schaksoser when we perceived a very great body of horse appear on the other side of the lake to the north we traveling west we observed they went away west as we did but had supposed we would have taken that side of the lake whereas we very happily took the south side and in two days more we saw them not for they believing we were still before them pushed on till they came to the river udda this is a very great river when it passes farther north but where we came to it we found it narrow and fordable  the third day they either found their mistake or had intelligence of us and came pouring in upon us toward the dusk of the evening we had to our great satisfaction just pitched upon a place for our camp which was very convenient for the night for as we were upon a desert though but at the beginning of it that was above five hundred miles over we had no towns to lodge at and indeed expected none but the city jarawena which we had yet two days march to the desert however had some few woods in it on this side and little rivers which ran all into the great river udda it was in a narrow strait between two little but very thick woods that we pitched our little camp for that night expecting to be attacked in the night  no body knew but ourselves what we were pursued for but as it was usual for the mongul tartars to go about in troops in that desert so the caravans always fortify themselves every night against them as against armies of robbers and it was therefore no new thing to be pursued  but we had this night of all the nights of our travels a most advantageous camp for we lay between two woods with a little rivulet running just before our front so that we could not be surrounded or attacked any way but in our front or rear we took care also to make our front as strong as we could by placing our packs with our camels and horses all in a line on the inside of the river and felling some trees in our rear  in this posture we encamped for the night but the enemy was upon us before we had finished our situation they did not come on us like thieves as we expected but sent three messengers to us to demand the men to be delivered to them that had abused their priests and burned their god chamchithaungu with fire that they might burn them with fire and upon this they said they would go away and do us no farther harm otherwise they would burn us all with fire our men looked very blank at this message and began to stare at one another to see who looked with most guilt in their faces but no body was the word no body did it the leader of the caravan sent word he was well assured it was not done by any of our camp that we were peaceable merchants traveling on our business that we had done no harm to them or to any one else and that therefore they must look farther for their enemies who had injured them for we were not the people so desired them not to disturb us for if they did we should defend our selves  they were far from being satisfied with this for an answer but a great crowd of them came down in the morning by break of day to our camp but seeing us in such an unaccountable situation they durst come no farther than the brook in our front where they stood and showed us such a number that indeed terrified us very much for those that spoke least of them spoke of ten thousand here they stood and looked at us a while and then setting up a great howl they let fly a cloud of arrows among us but we were well enough fortified for that for we sheltered under our baggage and i do not remember that one man of us was hurt  some time after this we see them move a little to our right and expected them on the rear when a cunning fellow a cossack as they call them of jarawena in the pay of the muscovites calling to the leader of the caravan said to him i will go send all these people away to siheilka this was a city four or five days journey at least to the south and rather behind us so he takes his bow and arrows and getting on horseback he rides away from our rear directly as it were back to nertssinskay after this he takes a great circuit about and comes to the army of the tartars as if he had been sent express to tell them a long story that the people who had burnt the chamchithaungu were gone to siheilka with a caravan of miscreants as he called them that is to say christians and that they had resolved to burn the god schalisar belonging to the tongueses  as this fellow was himself a mere tartar and perfectly spoke their language he counterfeited so well that they all took it from him and away they drove in a most violent hurry to siheilka which it seems was five days journey to the north and in less than three hours they were entirely out of our sight and we never heard any more of them and we never knew whether they went to that other place called siheilka or no  so we passed safely on to the city of jarawena where there was a garrison of muscovites and there we rested five days the caravan being exceedingly fatigued with the last days hard march and with want of rest in the night  from this city we had a frightful desert which held us three and twenty days march we furnished our selves with some tents here for the better accommodating our selves in the night and the leader of the caravan procured sixteen carriages or wagons of the country for carrying our water and provisions and these carriages were our defense every night round our little camp so that had the tartars appeared unless they had been very numerous indeed they would not have been able to hurt us  we may well be supposed to want rest again after this long journey for in this desert we saw neither house or tree or scarce a bush we saw abundance of the sablehunters as they called them these are all tartars of the mongul tartary of which this county is a part and they frequently attack small caravans but we saw no numbers of them together i was curious to see the sable skins they catched but could never speak with any of them for they durst not come near us neither durst we straggle from our company to go near them  after we had passed this desert we came into a country pretty well inhabited that is to say we found towns and castles settled by the czar of muscovy with garrisons of stationary soldiers to protect the caravans and defend the country against the tartars who would otherwise make it very dangerous traveling and his czarish majesty has given such strict orders for the well guarding the caravans and merchants that if there are any tartars heard of in the country detachments of the garrisons are always sent to see the travelers safe from station to station  and thus the governor of adinskoy who i had opportunity to make a visit to by means of the scots merchant who was acquainted with him offered us a guard of fifty men if we thought there was any danger to the next station  i thought long before this that as we came nearer to europe we should find the country better peopled and the people more civilized but i found my self mistaken in both for we had yet the nation of the tongueses to pass through where we saw the same tokens of paganism and barbarity or worse than before only as they were conquered by the muscovites and entirely reduced they were not so dangerous but for rudeness of manners idolatry and multitheism no people in the world ever went beyond them they are clothed all in skins of beasts and their houses are built of the same you know not a man from a woman neither by the ruggedness of their countenances or their clothes and in the winter when the ground is covered with snow they live under ground in houses like vaults which have cavities going from one to another  if the tartars had their chamchitongu for a whole village or country these had idols in every hutt and in every cave besides they worship the stars the sun the water the snow and in a word every thing that they do not understand and they understand but very little so that almost every element every uncommon thing sets them a sacrificing  but i am no more to describe people than countries any farther than my own story comes to be concerned in them i met with nothing peculiar to my self in all this country which i reckon was from the desert which i spoke of last at least  00 miles half of it being another desert which took us up twelve days severe traveling without house or tree or bush but were obliged again to carry our own provisions as well water as bread after we were out of this desert and had traveled two days we came to janezay a muscovite city or station on the great river janezay this river they told us parted europe from asia though our mapmakers as i am told do not a gree to it however it is certainly the eastern boundary of the ancient siberia which now makes up a province only of the vast muscovite empire but is it self equal in bigness to the whole empire of germany  and yet here i observed ignorance and paganism still prevailed except in the muscovite garrisons all the country between the river oby and the river janezay is as entirely pagan and the people as barbarous as the remotest of the tartars nay as any nation for ought i know in asia or america i also found which i observed to the muscovite governors who i had opportunity to converse with that the poor pagans are not much the wiser or the nearer christianity for being under the muscovite government which they acknowledged was true enough but as they said was none of their business that if the czar expected to convert his siberian or tonguese or tartar subjects it should be done by sending clergymen among them not soldiers and they added with more sincerity than i expected that they found it was not so much the concern of their monarch to make the people christians as it was to make them subjects  from this river to the great river oby we crossed a wild uncultivated country i cannot say it is a barren soil it is only barren of people and good management otherwise it is in itself a most pleasant fruitful and agreeable country what inhabitants we found in it are all pagans except such as are sent among them from russia for this is the country i mean on both sides the river oby whither the muscovite criminals that are not put to death are banished and from whence it is next to impossible they should ever come away  i have nothing material to say of my particular affairs till i came to tobolski the capital city of siberia where i continued some time on the following occasion  we had been now almost seven months on our journey and winter began to come on apace whereupon my partner and i called a council about our particular affairs in which we found it proper considering that we were bound for england and not for muscow to consider how to dispose of our selves they told us of sledges and rane deer to carry us over the snow in the winter time and indeed they have such things that it would be incredible to relate the particulars of by which means the russians travel more in the winter than they can in summer because in these sleds they are able to run night and day the snow being frozen is one universal covering to nature by which the hills the vales the rivers the lakes all are smooth and hard as a stone and they run upon the surface without any regard to what is underneath  but i had no occasion to push at a winter journey of this kind i was bound to england not to muscow and my rout lay two ways either i must go on as the caravan went till i came to jeroslaw and then go off west for narva and the gulf of finland and so either by sea or land to dantzick where i might possibly sell my china cargo to good advantage or i must leave the caravan at a little town on the dwina from whence i had but six days by water to archangel and from thence might be sure of shipping either to england holland or hamburgh  now to go any of these journeys in the winter would habeen preposterous for as to dantzick the baltic would be frozen up and i could not get passage and to go by land in those countries was far less safe than among the mongul tartars likewise to go to archangel in october all the ships would be gone from thence and even the merchants who dwell there in summer retire south to muscow in the winter when the ships are gone so that i should have nothing but extremity of cold to encounter with a scarcity of provisions and must lie there in an empty town all the winter so that upon the whole i thought it much my better way to let the caravan go and to make provision to winter where i was viz at tobolski in siberia in the latitude of degrees where i was sure of three things to wear out a cold winter with viz plenty of provision such as the country afforded a warm house with fuel enough and excellent company of all which i shall give a full account in its place  i was now in a quite different climate from my beloved island where i never felt cold except when i had my ague on the contrary i had much to do to bear any clothes on my back and never made any fire but without doors and for my necessity in dressing my food etc now i made me three good vests with large robes or gowns over them to hang down to the feet and button close to the wrists and all these lined with furs to make them sufficiently warm  as to a warm house i must confess i greatly disliked our way in england of making fires in every room in the house in open chimneys which when the fire was out always kept the air in the room cold as the climate but taking an appartment in a good house in the town i ordered a chimney to be built like a furnace in the center of six several rooms like a stove the funnel to carry the smoke went up one way the door to come at the fire went in another and all the rooms were kept equally warm but no fire seen just as they heat the bagnios in england  by this means we had always the same climate in all the rooms and an equal heat was preserved and how cold soever it was without it was always ways warm within and yet we saw no fire nor was ever incommoded with any smoke  the most wonderful thing of all was that it should be possible to meet with good company here in a country so barbarous as that of the most northerly parts of europe near the frozen ocean and within but a very few degrees of nova zembla  but this being the country where the state criminals of muscovy as i observed before are all banished this city was full of noblemen princes gentlemen colonels and in short all degrees of the nobility gentry soldiery and courtiers of muscovy here was the famous prince galliozen the old general robostiski and several other persons of note and some ladies  by means of my scots merchant who nevertheless i parted with here i made an acquaintance here with several of these gentlemen and some of them of the first rank and from these in the long winter nights in which i stayed here i received several very agreeable visits it was talking one night with prince one of the banished ministers of state belonging to the czar of muscovy that my talk of my particular case began he had been telling me abundance of fine things of the greatness the magnificence the dominions and the absolute power of the emperor of the russians i interrupted him and told him i was a greater and more powerful prince than ever the czar of muscovy was though my dominions were not so large or my people so many the russian grandee looked a little surpised and fixing his eyes steddily upon me began to wonder what i meant  i told him his wonder would cease when i had explained myself first i told him i had the absolute disposal of the lives and fortunes of all my subjects that notwithstanding my absolute power i had not one person disaffected to my government or to my person in all my dominions he shook his head at that and said there indeed i outdid the czar of muscovy i told him that all the lands in my kingdom were my own and all my subjects were not only my tenants but tenants at will that they would all fight for me to the last drop and that never tyrant for such i acknowledged myself to be was ever so universally beloved and yet so horribly feared by his subjects  after amusing them with these riddles in government for a while i opened the case and told them the story at large of my living in the island and how i managed both myself and the people there that were under me just as i have since minuted it down they were exceedingly taken with the story and especially the prince who told me with a sigh that the true greatness of life was to be master of ourselves that he would not have exchanged such a state of life as mine to have been czar of muscovy and that he found more felicity in the retirement he seemed to be banished to there than ever he found in the highest authority he enjoyed in the court of his master the czar that the height of human wisdom was to bring our tempers down to our circumstances and to make a calm within under the weight of the greatest scorns without when he came first hither he said he used to tear the hair from his head and the clothes from his back as others had done before him but a little time and consideration had made him look into himself as well as round him to things without that he found the mind of man if it was but once brought to reflect upon the state of universal life and how little this world was concerned in its true felicity was perfectly capable of making a felicity for itself fully satisfying to itself and suitable to its own best ends and desires with but very little assistance from the world that air to breath in food to sustain life clothes for warmth and liberty for exercise in order to health completed in his opinion all that the world could do for us and though the greatness the authority the riches and the pleasures which some enjoyed in the world and which he had enjoyed his share of had much in them that was agreeable to us yet he observed that all those things chiefly gratified the coarsest of our affections such as our ambition our particular pride our avarice our vanity and our sensuality all which were indeed the mere product of the worst part of man were in themselves crimes and had in them the seeds of all manner of crimes but neither were related to or concerned with any of those virtues that constituted us wise men or of those graces which distinguished us as christians that being now deprived of all the fancied felicity which he enjoyed in the full exercise of all those vices he said he was at leisure to look upon the dark side of them where he found all manner of deformity and was now convinced that virtue only makes a man truly wise rich and great and preserves him in the way to a superior happiness in a future state and in this he said they were more happy in their banishment than all their enemies were who had the full possession of all the wealth and power that they the banished had left behind them  nor sir says he do i bring my mind to this politically by the necessity of my circumstances which some call miserable but if i know any thing of my self i would not now go back though the czar my master should call me and reinstate me in all my former grandeur i say i would no more go back to it than i believe my soul when it shall be delivered from this prison of the body and has had a taste of the glorious state beyond life would come back to the jayl of flesh and blood it is now enclosed in and leave heaven to deal in the dirt and crime of human affairs  he spoke this with so much warmth in his temper so much earnestness and motion of his spirits which were apparent in his countenance that it was evident it was the true sense of his soul there was no room to doubt his sincerity  i told him i once thought my self a kind of a monarch in my old station of which i had given him an account but that i thought he was not a monarch only but a great conqueror for that he that has got a victory over his own exorbitant desires and has the absolute dominion over himself whose reason entirely governs his will is certainly greater than he that conquers a city but my lord said i shall i take the liberty to ask you a question with all my heart says he if he door of your liberty was opened said i would you not take hold of it to deliver your self from this exile  hold said he your question is subtle and requires some serious just distinctions to give it a sincere answer and i will give it you from the bottom of my heart nothing that i know of in this world would move me to deliver my self from this state of banishment except these two first the enjoyment of my relations and secondly a little warmer climate but i protest to you that to go back to the pomp of the court the glory the power the hurry of a minister of state the wealth the gaiety and the pleasures that is to say follies of a courtier if my master should send me word this moment that he restores me to all he banished me from i protest if i know my self at all i would not leave this wilderness these deserts and these frozen lakes for the palace at muscow  but my lord said i perhaps you not only are banished from the pleasures of the court and from the power and authority and wealth you enjoyed before but you may be absent too from some of the conveniences of life your estate perhaps confiscated and your effects plundered and the supplies left you here may not be suitable to the ordinary demands of life  ay says he that is as you suppose me to be a lord or a prince etc so indeed i am but you are now to consider me only as a man a human creature not at all distinguished from another and so i can suffer no want unless i should be visited with sickness and distempers however to put the question out of dispute you see our manner we are in this place five persons of rank we live perfectly retired as suited to a state of banishment we have something rescued from the shipwreck of our fortunes which keeps us from the mere necessity of hunting for our food but the poor soldiers who are here without that help live in as much plenty as we who go into the woods and catch sables and foxes the labor of a month will maintain them a year and as the way of living is not expensive so it is not hard to get sufficient to our selves so that objection is out of doors  i have not room to give a full account of the most agreeable conversation i had with this truly great man in all which he showed that his mind was so inspired with a superior knowledge of things so supported by religion as well as by a vast share of wisdom that his contempt of the world was really as much as he had expressed and that he was always the same to the last as will appear in the story i am going to tell  i had been here   months and a dark dreadful winter i thought it to be the cold so intense that i could not so much as look abroad without being wrapped in furs and a mask of fur before my face or rather a hood with only a hole for breath and two for sight the little daylight we had was as we reckoned for three months not above five hours a day and six at most only that the snow lying on the ground continually and the weather clear it was never quite dark our horses were kept or rather starved under ground and as for our servants for we hired three servants here to look after our horses and selves we had every now and then their fingers and toes to thaw and take care of lest they should mortify and fall off  it is true within doors we were warm the houses being close the walls thick the lights small and the glass all double our food was chiefly the flesh of deer dried and cured in the season good bread enough but baked as biskets dried fish of several sorts and some flesh of mutton and of the buffeloes which is pretty good beef all the stores of provision for the winter are laid up in the summer and well cured our drink was water mixed with aquavitae instead of brandy and for a treat mead instead of wine which however they have excellent good the hunters who venture abroad all weathers frequently brought us in fresh venison very fat and good and sometimes bears flesh but we did not much care for the last we had a good stock of tea with which we treated our friends as above and in a word we lived very cheerfully and well all things considered  it was now march and the days grown considerably longer and the weather at least tolerable so the other travelers began to prepare sleds to carry them over the snow and to get things ready to be going but my measures being fixed as i have said for archangel and not for muscovy or the baltic i made no motion knowing very well that the ships from the south do not set out for that part of the world till may or june and that if i was there by the beginning of august it would be as soon as any ships would be ready to go away and therefore i say i made no haste to be gone as others did in a word i saw a great many people nay all the travelers go away before me it seems every year they go from thence to muscow for trade viz to carry furs and buy necessaries with them which they bring back to furnish their shops also others went of the same errand to archangel but then they also being to come back again above  00 miles went all out before me  in short about the latter end of may i began to make all ready to pack up and as i was doing this it occurred to me that seeing all these people were banished by the czar of muscovy to siberia and yet when they came there were left at liberty to go whither they would why did they not then go away to any part of the world wherever they thought fit and i began to examine what should hinder them from making such an attempt  but my wonder was over when i entered upon that subject with the person i have mentioned who answered me thus consider first sir said he the place where we are and secondly the condition we are in especially said he the generality of the people who are banished hither we are surrounded said he with stronger things than bars and bolts on the north side an unnavigable ocean where ship never sailed and boat never swam neither if we had both could we know where to go with them every other way said he we have above a thousand miles to pass through the czars own dominions and byways utterly unpassable except by the roads made by the governor and by the towns garrisoned by his troops so that we could neither pass undiscovered by the road or subsist any other way so that it is in vain to attempt it  i was silenced indeed at once and found that they were in a prison every jot as secure as if they had been locked up in the castle at muscow however it came into my thought that i might certainly be made an instrument to procure the escape of this excellent person and that whatever hazard i run i would certainly try if i could carry him off upon this i took an occasion one evening to tell him my thoughts i represented to him that it was very easy for me to carry him away there being no guard over him in the country and as i was not going to muscow but to archangel and that i went in the nature of a caravan by which i was not obliged to lie in the stationary towns in the desert but could encamp every night where i would we might easily pass uninterrupted to archangel where i would immediately secure him on board an english or dutch ship and carry him off safe along with me and as to his subsistence and other particulars it should be my care till he could better supply himself  he heard me very attentively and looked earnestly on me all the while i spoke nay i could see in his very face that what i said put his spirits into an exceeding ferment his color frequently changed his eyes looked red and his heart fluttered that it might be even perceived in his countenance nor could he immediately answer me when i had done and as it were expected what he would say to it but after he had paused a little he embraced me and said how unhappy are we unguarded creatures as we are that even our greatest acts of friendship are made snares to us and we are made tempters of one another my dear friend said he your offer is so sincere has such kindness in it is so disinterested in it self and is so calculated for my advantage that i must have very little knowledge of the world if i did not both wonder at it and acknowledge the obligation i have upon me to you for it but did you believe i was sincere in what i have so often said to you of my contempt of the world did you believe i spoke my very soul to you and that i had really obtained that degree of felicity here that had placed me above all that the world could give me or do for me did you believe i was sincere when i told you i would not go back if i was recalld even to be all that once i was in the court with the favor of the czar my master did you believe me my friend to be an honest man or did you think me to be a boasting hypocrite here he stopped as if he would hear what i would say but indeed i soon after perceived that he stopped because his spirits were in motion his great heart was full of struggles and he could not go on i was i confess astonished at the thing as well as at the man and i used some arguments with him to urge him to set himself free that he ought to look upon this as a door opened by heaven for his deliverance and a summons by providence who has the care and disposition of all events to do himself good and to render himself useful in the world  he had by this time recovered himself how do you know sir says he warmly that instead of a summons from heaven it may not be a feint of another instrument representing in all the alluring colors to me the show of felicity as a deliverance which may in itself be my snare and tends directly to my ruin here i am free from the temptation of returning to my former miserable greatness there i am not sure but that all the seeds of pride ambition avarice and luxury which i know remain in nature may revive and take root and in a word again overwhelm me and then the happy prisoner who you see now master of his souls liberty shall be the miserable slave of his own senses in the full of all personal liberty dear sir let me remain in this blessed confinement banished from the crimes of life rather than purchase a show of freedom at the expense of the liberty of my reason and at the expense of the future happiness which now i have in my view but shall then i fear quickly lose sight of for i am but flesh a man a mere man have passions and affections as likely to possess and overthrow me as any man o be not my friend and my tempter both together  if i was surpised before i was quite dumb now and stood silent looking at him and indeed admired at what i saw the struggle in his soul was so great that though the weather was extremely cold it put him into a most violent sweat and i found he wanted to give vent to his mind so i said a word or two that i would leave him to consider of it and wait on him again and then i withdrew to my own apartment  about two hours after i heard some body at or near the door of my room and i was going to open the door but he had opened it and came in my dear friend says he you had almost overset me but i am recovered do not take it ill that i do not close with your offer i assure you it is not for want of a sense of the kindness of it in you and i came to make the most sincere acknowledgment of it to you but i hope i have got the victory over my self  my lord said i i hope you are fully satisfied that you do not resist the call of heaven sir said he if it had been from heaven the same power would have influenced me to accept it but i hope and am fully satisfied that it is from heaven that i decline it and i have an infinite satisfaction in the parting that you shall leave me an honest man still though not a free man  i had nothing to do but to acquiesce and make professions to him of my having no end in it but a sincere desire to serve him he embraced me very passionately and assured me he was sensible of that and should always acknowledge it and with that he offered me a very fine present of sables too much indeed for me to accept from a man in his circumstances and i would have avoided them but he would not be refused  the next morning i sent my servant to his lordship with a small present of tea and two pieces of china damask and four little wedges of japan gold which did not all weigh above six ounces or thereabour but were far short of the value of his sables which indeed when i came to england i found worth near  00 l he accepted the tea and one piece of the damask and one of the pieces of gold which had a fine stamp upon it of the japan coinage which i found he took for the rarity of it but would not take any more and he sent word by my servant that he desired to speak with me  when i came to him he told me i knew what had passed between us and hoped i would not move him any more in that affair out that since i had made such a generous offer to him he asked me if i had kindness enough to offer the same to another person that he would name to me in whom he had a great share of concern i told him that i could not say i inclined to do so much for any one but himself for whom i had a particular value and should have been glad to have been the instrument of his deliverance however if he would please to name the person to me i would give him my answer and hoped he would not be displeased with me if he was with my answer he told me it was only his son who though i had not seen yet was in the same condition with himself and above two hundred miles from him on the other side the oby but that if i consented he would send for him  i made no hesitation but told him i would do it i made some ceremony in letting him understand that it was wholly on his account and that seeing i could not prevail on him i would show my respect to him by my concern for his son but these things are too tedious to repeat here he sent away the next day for his son and in about twenty days he came back with the messenger bringing six or seven horses loaded with very rich furs and which in the whole amounted to a very great value  his servants brought the horses into the town but left the young lord at a distance till night when he came incognito into our apartment and his father presented him to me and in short we concerted there the manner of our traveling and every thing proper for the journey  i had bought a considerable quantity of sables black fox skins fine ermines and such other furs as are very rich i say i had bought them in that city in exchange for some of the goods i brought from china in particular for the cloves and nutmegs of which i sold the greatest part here and the rest afterward at archangel for a much better price than i could have done at london and my partner who was sensible of the profit and whose business more particularly than mine was merchandise was mightily pleased with our stay on account of the traffic we made here  it was the beginning of june when i left this remote place a city i believe little heard of in the world and indeed it is so far out of the road of commerce that i know not how it should be much talked of we were now come to a very small caravan being only thirty two horses and camels in all and all of them passed for mine though my new guest was proprietor of eleven of them it was most natural also that i should take more servants with me than i had before and the young lord passed for my steward what great man i passed for my self i know not neither did it concern me to enquire we had here the worst and the largest desert to pass over that we met with in all the journey indeed i call it the worst because the way was very deep in some places and very uneven in others the best we had to say for it was that we thought we had no troops of tartars and robbers to fear and that they never came on this side the river oby or at least but very seldom but we sound it otherwise  my young lord had with him a faithful muscovite servant or rather a siberian servant who was perfectly acquainted with the country and led us by private roads that we avoided coming in to the principal towns and cities upon the great road such as tumen solykamskoi and several others because the muscovite garrisons which are kept there are very curious and strict in their observation upon travelers and searching least any of the banished persons of note should make their escape that way into muscovy but by this means as we were kept out of the cities so our whole journey was a desert and we were obliged to encamp and lie in our tents when we might have had very good accommodation in the cities on the way this the young lord was so sensible of that he would not allow us to lie abroad when we came to several cities on the way but lay abroad himself with his servant in the woods and met us always at the appointed places  we were just entered europe having passed the river kama which in these parts is the boundary between europe and asia and the first city on the european side was called soloykamaskoy which is as much as to say the great city on the river kama and here we thought to have seen some evident alteration in the people their manner their habit their religion and their business but we were mistaken for as we had a vast desert to pass which by relation is near seven hundred miles long in some places but not above two hundred miles over where we passed it so till we came past that horrible place we found very little difference between that country and the mogul tartary the people mostly pagans and little better than the savages of america their houses and towns full of idols and their way of living wholly barbarous except in the cities as above and the villages near them where they are christians as they call themselves of the greek church but have their religion mingled with so many relics of superstition that it is scarce to be known in some places from mere sorcery and witchcraft  in passing this forest i thought indeed we must after all our dangers were in our imagination escaped as before have been plundered and robbed and perhaps murdered by a troop of thieves of what country they were whether the roving bands of the ostiachi a kind of tartars or wild people on the bank of the obi had ranged thus far or whether they were the sablehunters of siberia i am yet at a loss to know but they were all on horseback carried bows and arrows and were at first about five and forty in number they came so near to us as within about two musket shot and asking no questions they surrounded us with their horse and looked very earnestly upon us twice at length they placed themselves just in our way upon which we drew up in a little line before our camels being not above sixteen men in all and being drawn up thus we halted and sent out the siberian servant who attended his lord to see who they were his master was the more willing to let him go because he was not a little apprehensive that they were a syberian troop sent out after him the man came up near them with a flag of truce and called them but though he spoke several of their languages or dialects of languages rather he could not understand a word they said however after some signs to him not to come nearer to them at his peril so he said he understood them to mean offering to shoot at him if he advanced the fellow came back no wiser than he went only that by their dress he said he believed them to be some tartars of kalmuck or of the circassian hoords and that there must be more of them upon the great desert though he never heard that any of them ever were seen so far north before  this was small comfort to us however we had no remedy there was on our left hand at about a quarter of a miles distance a little grove or clump of trees which stood close together and very near the road i immediately resolved we would advance to those trees and fortify our selves as well as we could there for first i considered that the trees would in a great measure cover us from their arrows and in the next place they could not come to charge us in a body it was indeed my old portuguese pilot who proposed it and who had this excellency attending him namely that he was always readiest and most apt to direct and encourage us in cases of the most danger we advanced immediately with what speed we could and gained that little wood the tartars or thieves for we know not what to call them keeping their stand and not attempting to hinder us when we came thither we found to our great satisfaction that it was a swampy springy piece of ground and on the one side a very great spring of water which running out in a little rill or brook was a little farther joined by another of the like bigness and was in short the head or source of a considerable river called afterward the wirtska the trees which grew about this spring were not all above two hundred but were very large and stood pretty thick so that as soon as we got in we saw our selves perfectly safe from the enemy unless they alighted and attacked us on foot  but to make this more difficult our portugueze with indefatigable application cut down great arms of the trees and laid them hanging not quite cut off from one tree to another so that he made a continued fence almost round us  we stayed here waiting the motion of the enemy some hours without perceiving they made any motion when about two hours before night they came down directly upon us and though we had not perceived it we found they had been joined by some more of the same so that they were near fourscore horse where of however we fancied some were women they came on till they were within half shot of our little wood when we fired one musket without ball and called to them in the russian tongue to know what they wanted and bid them keep off but as if they knew nothing of what we said they came on with a double fury directly up to the wood side not imagining we were so barricadod that they could not break in our old pilot was our captain as well as he had been our engineer and desired of us not to fire upon them till they came within pistolshot and that we might be sure to kill and that when we did fire we should be sure to take good aim we bad him give the word of command which he delayed so long that they were some of them within two pikes length of us when we fired  we aimed so true or providence directed our shot so sure that we killed fourteen of them and wounded several others as also several of their horses for we had all of us loaded our pieces with two or three bullets at least  they were terribly surpised with our fire and retreated immediately about one hundred rods from us in which time we loaded our pieces again and seeing them keep that distance we sallied out and caught four or five of their horses whose riders we suppose were killed and coming up to the dead we could easily perceive they were tartars but knew not from what country or how they came to make an excursion such an unusual length  about an hour after they made a motion to attack us again and rode round our little wood to see where else they might break in but finding us always ready to face them they went off again and we resolved not to stir from the place for that night  we slept little you may be sure but spent the most part of the night in strengthening our situation and barricadoing the entrances into the wood and keeping a strict watch we waited for daylight and when it came it gave us a very unwelcome discovery indeed for the enemy who we thought were discouraged with the reception they had met with were now increased to no less than three hundred and had set up eleven or twelve huts and tents as if they were resolved to besiege us and this little camp they had pitched upon the open plain at about three quarters of a mile from us we were indeed surpised at this discovery and now i confess i gave my self over for lost and all that i had the loss of my effects did not lie so near me though they were very considerable as the thoughts of falling into the hands of such barbarians at the latter end of my journey after so many difficulties and hazards as i had gone through and even in sight of our port where we expected safety and deliverance as for my partner he was raging he declared that to lose his goods would be his ruin and he would rather die than be starved and he was for fighting to the last drop  the young lord as gallant as ever flesh showed it self was for fighting to the last also and my old pilot was of the opinion we were able to resist them all in the situation we were then in and thus we spent the day in debates of what we should do but toward evening we found that the number of our enemies still increased perhaps as they were abroad in several parties for prey the first had sent out scouts to call for help and to acquaint them of the booty and we did not know but by the morning they might still be a greater number so i began to enquire of those people we had brought from tobolski if there was no other or more private ways by which we might avoid them in the night and perhaps either retreat to some town or get help to guard us over the desert  the syberian who was servant to the young lord told us if we designed to avoid them and not fight he would engage to carry us off in the night to a way that went north toward the petrou by which he made no question but we might get away and the tartars never the wiser but he said his lord had told him he would not retreat but would rather choose to fight i told him he mistook his lord for that he was too wise a man to love fighting for the sake of it that i knew his lord was brave enough by what he had showed already but that his lord knew better than to desire to have seventeen or eighteen men fight five hundred unless an unavoidable necessity forced them to it and that if he thought it possible for us to escape in the night we had nothing else to do but to attempt it he answered if his lord gave him such orders he would lose his life if he did not perform it we soon brought his lord to give that order though privately and we immediately prepared for the putting it in practice  and first as soon as it began to be dark we kindled a fire in our little camp which we kept burning and prepared so as to make it burn all night that the tartars might conclude we were still there but as soon as it was dark that is to say so as we could see the stars for our guide would not stir before having all our horses and camels ready laden we followed our new guide who i soon found steered himself by the pole or north star all the country being level for a long way  after we had traveled two hours very hard it began to be lighter still not that it was quite dark all night but the moon began to rise so that in short it was rather lighter than we wished it to be but by six a clock the next morning we were gotten near forty miles though the truth is we almost spoiled our horses here we found a russian village named kermazinskoy where we rested and heard nothing of the calmuck tartars that day about two hours before night we set out again and traveled till eight the next morning though not quite so quite as before and about seven a clock we passed a little river called kirtza and came to a good large town inhabited by russians and very populous called ozomoys there we heard that several troops or hoords of calmucks had been abroad upon the desert but that we were now completely out of danger of them which was to our great satisfaction you may be sure here we were obliged to get some fresh horses and having need enough of rest we stayed five days and my partner and i agreed to give the honest syberian who brought us thither the value of ten pistoles for his conducting us  in five days more we came to veuslima upon the river witzogda and running into the dwina we were there very happily near the end of our travels by land that river being navigable in seven days passage to archangel from hence we came to lawrenskoy the  d of july and providing our selves with two luggage boats and a barge for our own convenience we embarked the  th and arrived all safe at archangel the   th having been a year and five months and three days on the journey including our stay of eight months and odd days at tobolski  we were obliged to stay at this place six weeks for the arrival of the ships and must have tarried longer had not a hamburgher come in above a month sooner than any of the english ships when after some consideration that the city of hamburgh might happen to be as good a market for our goods as london we all took freight with him and having put my goods on board it was most natural for me to put my steward on board to take care of them by which means my young lord had a sufficient opportunity to conceal himself never coming on shore in all the time we stayed there and this he did that he might not be seen in the city where some of the muscow merchants would certainly have seen and discovered him  we sailed from archangel the  0th of august the same year and after no extraordinary bad voyage arrived in the elbe the   th of september here my partner and i found a very good sale for our goods as well those of china as the sables etc of syberia and dividing the produce of our effects my share amounted to             d notwithstanding so many losses we had sustained and charges we had been at only remembering that i had included in this about six hundred pounds worth of diamonds which i had purchased at bengal  here the young lord took his leave of us and went up the elbe in order to go to the court of vienna where he resolved to seek protection and where he could correspond with those of his fathers friends who were left alive he did not part without all the testimonies he could give me of gratitude for the service i had done him and his sense of my kindness to the prince his father  to conclude having stayed near four months in hamburgh i came from thence over land to the hague where i embarked in the packet and arrived in london the  0th of january   0  having been gone from england ten years and nine months  and here resolving to harrass my self no more i am preparing for a longer journey than all these having lived
