lofty poet touch the sky the lamentation of glumdalclitch for the loss of grildrig a pastoral soon as glumdalclitch mist her pleasing care she wept she blubbered and she tore her hair no british miss sincerer grief has known her squirrel missing or her sparrow flown she furled her sampler and hawld in her thread and stuck her needle into grildrigs bed then spread her hands and with a bounce let fall her baby like the giant in guild hall in peals of thunder now she roars and now she gently whimpers like a lowing cow yet lovely in her sorrow still appears her locks dishevelled and her flood of tears seem like the lofty barn of some rich swain when from the thatch drips fast a shower of rain in vn she searched each cranny of the house each gaping chink impervious to a mouse  was it for this she cried with daily care  within thy reach i set the vinegar  and filled the cruet with the acid tide  while pepperwaterworms thy bait supplied  where twined the silver eel around thy hook  and all the little monsters of the brook  sure in that lake he dropped  my grillys drowned she dragged the cruet but no grildrig found  vain is thy courage grilly vain thy boast  but little creatures enterprise the most  trembling i have seen thee dare the kittens paw  nay mix with children as they played at taw  nor fear the marbles as they bounding flew  marbles to them but rolling rocks to you  why did i trust thee with that giddy youth  who from a page can ever learn the truth  versed in court tricks that moneyloving boy  to some lords daughter sold the living toy  or rent him limb from limb in cruel play  as children tear the wings of flies away  from place to place over brobdingnag i will roam  and never will return or bring thee home  but who has eyes to trace the passing wind  how then thy fairy footsteps can i find  do thou bewildred wander all alone  in the green thicket of a mossy stone  or tumbled from the toadstools slippery round  perhaps all maimed lie grovelling on the ground  do thou imbosomd in the lovely rose  or sunk within the peachs down repose  within the kingcup if thy limbs are spread  or in the golden cowslips velvet head  o show me flora midst those sweets the flower  where sleeps my grildrig in the fragrant bower  but ah i fear thy little fancy roves  on little females and on little loves  thy pigmy children and thy tiny spouse  the baby playthings that adorn thy house  doors windows chimneys and the spacious rooms  equal in size to cells of honeycombs  have thou for these now ventured from the shore  thy bark a beanshell and a straw thy oar  or in thy box now bounding on the main  shall i never bear thy self and house again  and shall i see thee on my hand no more  to see thee leap the lines and traverse over  my spacious palm of stature scarce a span  mimick the actions of a real man  no more behold thee turn my watches key  as seamen at a capstern anchors weigh  how were thou wont to walk with cautious tread  a dish of tea like milkpale on thy head  how chase the mite that bore thy cheese away  and keep the rolling maggot at a bay she spoke but broken accents stopped her voice soft as the speaking trumpets mellow noise she sobd a storm and wiped her flowing eyes which seemed like two broad suns in misty skies o squander not thy grief those tears command to weep upon our cod in newfoundland the plenteous pickle shall preserve the fish and europe taste thy sorrows in her dish to mr lemuel gulliver the grateful address of the unhappy houyhnhnms now in slavery and bondage in england to thee we wretches of the
