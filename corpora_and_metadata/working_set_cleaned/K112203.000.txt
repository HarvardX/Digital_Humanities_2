superior excellence in his profession which was drawing the principal part of painting was very learned in all the italian arts and particularly in their poetry and music the subject of this little work more learned i believe than any man in great britain as beauty is pretty much the same in all the fine arts there being a cognation as cicero expresses it by which they are connected and related more or less to one another mr brown has shown in this work that he knew very well what beauty was in writing as well as in other arts for there is in his style a copiousness and elegance and withal an accuracy of expression which are seldom to be met with in the compositions of this age and both for matter and style i will venture to set this little piece against any thing that has been written en the subject of the fine arts in modern times and i am persuaded it would have been still more perfect in every respect if he had lived to publish it himself he has explained most accurately every thing belonging to the italian opera beginning with the recitative by which the business or action of the opera the principal thing in all dramatic performances is carried on and then proceeding to the airs or songs by which the sentiments and passions of the dramatis personae are expressed these airs he has divided and explained so accurately as to show very clearly that there is no affection of the human breast to use his own words and i cannot use better from the slightest and most gentle stirring of sentiment to the most frantic degree of passion which some one of these classes of airs is not aptly suited to express letter   in the beginning  he has also shown how the descriptive part in the opera is executed and of what good use the orchestra is there which is so indiscreetly employed in the british operas page        in this passage he has very justly censured our taste in operas and in another passage page          he has said that the admiration bestowed in britain on difficulty and novelty in preference to beauty and simplicity is the effect not of the decline but of the total want of taste and proceeds from the same principles with the admiration of tumbling and ropedancing which the multitude may gaze on with astonishment long before they are susceptible of the charms of graceful and elegant pantomime these feats of agility having exactly the same relation to fine dancing that the above mentioned airs have to expressive music and in the same passage he observes that this admiration of the new and difficult which begins to prevail in italy is a symptom of the decline of the arts there so that he appears to me to have had a taste not only superior to what is to be found in britain but even to the taste at present in italy the country of the fine arts and i have heard from others as well as from him that the burletta and the taste for the ridiculous is prevailing very much in italy than which there can be no surer sign of the decline of genius and taste in a nation but the serious italian opera as he has described it and as it is acted in rome though it may not be so perfect as it formerly was is still the most perfect junction of poetry music and action or dancing as the ancients called it which among them was an art of imitation as well as poetry and music the three finest of the fine arts that is now to be found in the world and such as only can give us any idea of attic tragedies of stateliest and most regal argument to use an expression of milton with which that learned and elegant people were so much delighted and upon the representation of which they bestowed the greatest part of the revenue of their state this work therefore of mr brown will give great pleasure not only to the connoisseurs in music but also i hope to all the admirers of ancient arts and i am sure that all those who were acquainted with him and knew him to be a man of great worth as well as genius will be very glad to encourage this publication for the benefit of his widow and child  the following character written by a learned and ingenious friend of the deceased mr brown appeared in a periodical publication a short time after his death joannes

italians in their opera but of the principles also by which the application of that variety is directed i find it necessary to take into consideration the union of poetry and music which is peculiar to this species of drama the nature of this union seems to have been well understood by their best dramatic writers and they have seldom lost sight of it in their works whilst those of our poets who have written cantatas or other compositions for music appear either to have been not at all acquainted with it or if they were to have totally disregarded it the italians have with great propriety considered that the speeches in the drama whether in dialogue or soliloquy must be either such as are expressive of passion and sentiment or such as are not so on this real distinction and not as with us on the mere caprice of the composer is founded their first great division of vocal music into recitative and air it is evident on the slightest consideration that in the progress of the drama many passages must necessarily occur such as simple narration of facts directions given plain answers made to plain questions sometimes abstract truths or moral reflections  none of which as they contain nothing of passion or sentiment can ever become the subject of musical expression simply to have spoken these passages however and then abruptly to have set up a singing when any pathetic part presented itself would have produced exactly that barbarous jumble of prose and poetry of music and dissonance which characterizes the english comic opera to avoid this and at the same time not idly to bestow the charms of fancy and feeling where embellishment and expression would be improper the italians have invented that species of singing termed by them simple recitative its name almost sufficiently explains its nature it is a succession of notes so arranged as to coincide with the laws of harmony though never accompanied but by a single instrument whose office is merely to support the voice and to direct it in its modulations though for the sake of this accompanyment recitative is like other music divided into bars yet are not these bars as in other music necessarily of equal lengths the notes of which they are composed being subjected to no precise musical measure but regulated in this respect almost wholly by the natural prosody of the language thus this kind of recitative answers completely its end it detains the audience very little longer than the spoken recital would do and being music itself the transition from it to the higher and more interesting parts is perfectly natural and agreeable to the ear according to your lordships opinion that there is scarcely any such thing as long and short syllables in modern languages the notes of the italian recitative would be all of equal lengths to obviate this objection i must take notice that what your lordship would call the accented syllable they esteem the long one and whatever may be the case in speech in pronouncing the recitative they most certainly render it longer in the proportion generally of two to one thus the words amo talor cde fni tornai in which the accent is laid on the last syllable are in recitative positively iambics the first syllable being expressed by a quaver the other by a crotchet thus amo talor   etc the last of which characters is the sign of a duration of time exactly double the length of that denoted by the first those again which have the accent on the first syllable as amo ben cielo tromba     are trochaics all the articles of two syllables such as delle alli etc and the pronouns personal when joined with another monosyllable such as mean celo vela tissi glielo etc may with the strictest propriety be considered as each a pyrrhic foot which in recitative would accordingly be expressed bv two quavers mn clo  etc the words docl flebl mormora    are thus real dactyles whilst such as these again tmor onor etc   are to all intents and purposes each a foot consisting of a short a long and a short syllable nay i may go so far as to say that no species of foot occurs in the ancient poetry which is not frequently to be found in the italian recitative in which three successive short three successive long syllables and often four of each are to be found and indeed all the possible varieties in which long and short syllables can be combined together now though it be allowed that the italian verse is formed not by the number of feet but of syllables it is fair to conclude that this manner of reciting it by which not only various combinations of them are formed but their respective length and brevity positively ascertained must not only give additional beauty and variety to the verse but render the pronunciation itself more clear and explicit   the verse appropriated to recitative is of a mixed kind consisting of the heroic line of eleven syllables and of a line of seven syllables with now and then a rhyme in the intermingling however these lines with each other as well as with respect to the introduction of the rhymes the poet is entirely left to the guidance of his own ear and sentiment this kind of mixed verse from the variety of the cadences which it affords seems well calculated to give to the recitative as marked a resemblance to common speech as is consistent with the dignity and beauty of numbers whilst the sparing and judicious introduction of rhyme either to finish more highly some beautiful passage or more strongly to point some remarkable assertion or reflection serves to preserve throughout the piece a proper degree of unity of effect by preventing that irksome and unnatural dissimilarity between the recitative and the airs which would in some degree be the consequence of the want of this kind of medium upon the whole it appears admirably well suited to the less important parts of a production so refined and artificial as the opera whose object like that of the arts of painting and sculpture amongst the ancients is not so much the exact imitation of nature as the union in as high a degree as possible of what is beautiful with what is natural  letter ii my lord in the former sheets i have endeavored to explain to your lordship the nature of simple recitative and to describe the kind of verse appropriated to it i proceed now to treat of the higher parts of vocal music those namely which are adapted to the more interesting and pathetic passages of the drama with respect to these distinctions have been likewise made by the italians which seem perfectly well founded they must in the first place have observed that all those passages in which the mind of the speaker is agitated by a rapid succession of various emotions are from their nature incompatible with any particular strain or length of melody for that which constitutes such particular strain is the relation of several parts to one whole now it is this whole which the italians distinguish by the name of motivo which may be translated strain or subject of the air and which they conceive to be inconsistent with the brevity and desultory sense of those ejaculations which are the effect of a high degree of agitation air they think even inadmissible in those passages in which though the emotions be not various yet the sentences are broken and incoherent to give an instance the following speech though terror be uniformly expressed by the whole of it seems not at all a subject fit to be comprehended under or expressed by one regular strain bring me unto my trial when you will  died he not in his bed  where should he die oh torture me no more  i will confess  alive again  then show me where he is i will give a thousand pounds to look on him  he has no eyes  the dust has blinded them  comb down his hair  look look it stands upright like limetwigs set to catch my winged soul  give me some drink etc  shakespeares henry vi  but whilst the italians conceived such passages to be incompatible with that regularity of measure and that unity of strain which is essential to air they felt however that they were of all others the most proper subject for musical expression and accordingly both the poet and musician seem by mutual consent to have bestowed on such passages their chief study and the musician in particular never fails to exert on them his highest and most brilliant powers it is to them they adapt that species of recitative termed recitativo instrumentato or recitativo obligato  accompanied recitative in this kind of recitative the singer is in a more special manner left to the dictates of his own feelings and judgment with respect to the measure he must not indeed reverse the natural prosody of the language by making short what should be long or vice versa but he may not only proportionally lengthen the duration of each syllable but he may give to particular syllables what length he pleases and precipitate considerably the pronunciation of others just as he thinks the expression requires the march of the notes is very different in this from that of the common or simple recitative delicacy pathos force dignity according to the different expressions of the words are its characteristics it is in this species of song that the finest effects of the chromatic and as far as our system of musical intervals is susceptible of it even of the enharmonic scale are peculiarly felt and it is here also that the powers of modulation are most happily because most properly employed by changes of tone analogous to the variety of the matter in a wonderful manner enforcing and characterizing the transitions which are made from one subject or emotion to another here too the whole orchestra lends its aid nor are the instruments limited to the simple duty of supporting and directing the voice in this high species of recitative it is the peculiar province of the instrumental parts during those pauses which naturally take place between the bursts of passion which a mind strongly agitated breaks into to produce such sounds as serve to awake in the audience sensations and emotions similar to those which are supposed to agitate the speaker here again another fine distinction is made by the italians between the descriptive and the pathetic powers of music these last are proper to the voice the former to the orchestra alone thus the symphonies which accompany this kind of recitative besides the general analogy they must have to the immediate sentiments and even to the character of the speaker are often particularly descriptive of the place in which he is or of some other concomitant circumstance which may serve to heighten the effect of the speech itself suppose for example the scene to be a prison the symphonies whilst they accord with the general tenor of the words will paint if i may be allowed the expression the horrors of the dungeon itself  and i can assure your lordship that i have heard symphonies of this kind strongly expressive of such horrors again suppose the scene by moon light and the general tone of the passion plaintive the sweetness the serenity and though to those who have never experienced the effects of music in this degree it may seem paradoxical to say so even the solitude nay the silence of the scene would make part of the ideas suggested by the symphonies should a storm be introduced the skilful composer would contrive to make the rain beat and the tempest howl most fearfully by means of the orchestra nay in a scene such as that of the dying beaufort which i have quoted above page    to your lordship the musician following close the wild ravings of the speaker would during the pauses of the speech call forth from the instruments such sounds as would thrill with terror the audience by realizing in a manner to their sense and feeling the horrible apprehensions of his distracted mind but the combined powers of melody and harmony are never more effectually felt than when in this kind of recitative they are employed to mark some very striking transition in a scene of madness for example where the imagination of the speaker is supposed to start from a gloomy desert to flowery meads the orchestra would by an immediate change of measure of melody of harmony perhaps of sounds too mark the transition  would proceed to spread out the smiling landscape to adorn it with gayest flowers to awake the zephyr and in short give to the audience by means of a wonderful analogy of sounds the most lively representation of the new image which is supposed to have taken possession of the madmans mind  these are effects of what i have ventured to call the descriptive or imitative powers of music with respect to the transitions of passion such as from tenderness to jealousy from joy to anger etc these belong to the pathetic powers of music and are the peculiar province of the vocal part often in the middle of a very agitated recitative on the occurrence of some tender idea on which the mind is supposed to dwell with a kind of melancholy pleasure the music loses by degrees the irregular character of recitative and resolves gradually into the even measure and continued melody of air  then on a sudden at the call of some idea of an opposite nature breaks off again into its former irregularity this change from recitative to air and thence to recitative again never fails when properly introduced to have a very striking and beautiful effect whilst it is the business of the orchestra thus closely to accompany the sentiments and situation of the singer the actor in his turn as there is no note without a meaning must be continually attentive to the orchestra during those intervals in which the instruments may be said to speak his action must be in strick concert with the music every thing must tend to the same point so that the poet the musician the actor must all seem to be informed by one soul  if your lordship to the natural voice of passion and the proper and graceful expression of action imagines thus united the intrinsic charm of sound itself and the wonderful powers of melody and harmony i hope you will join with me in opinion that the effect produced by such union is much richer much more beautiful much more powerful and affecting than any that can be produced by simple declamation though in passages of this description the language ought certainly to rise with the subject yet the verse which is here made use of is of the same kind with that employed in the common recitative as being that which has the greatest variety and suffers the fewest restrictions and as such the best adapted to the irregular nature of such passages  having thus endeavored to explain to your lordship the nature of recitative simple and accompanied of those distinctions on which they are respectively founded and of the species of verse in which they are written i proceed to treat of air and of the different kinds of versification which are employed in it as to the principles which direct the choice in adapting particular measures to particular airs i shall have nothing to say they being exactly the same with those by which the lyric poet adapts the verse to the various subject of an ode  the heroic to the grave and sublime  that which still partakes of dignity though rather smooth than grand to the tender and pathetic  that which is more violent and unequal to the highly impassioned parts  and that which is of the airy dancing kind to the lighter and more lively passages of the piece distinctions which it may be observed are evidently consequences of the original union of poetry and music  i am well aware that great part of what i have here said of the power of the italian music would to many perhaps to most people appear the language rather of enthusiasm than of any thing else perhaps it partly is so for my own feelings on the authority alone of which i speak may in some degree proceed from enthusiasm whether this be the case or whether the effects i mention be completely real but take place in consequence of certain sensibilities so partially distributed among mankind that perhaps even the lesser number are susceptible of these effects i do not presume to determine if this last be the case and there is no absurdity in supposing it to be so it is evident however that those who profess so great a degree of sensibility to the powers of music will be very apt to appear affected and enthusiastic to the rest of mankind who are surely in some degree justified for calling in question the existence of pleasures to which possessing the same organs all in seeming equal perfection they find themselves perfect strangers whilst on the other hand those who acknowledge the power of music will think they have a complete right to assert the reality of that of which they have so feeling a conviction for my own part i am firmly persuaded that what i have ventured to advance to your lordship touching the effects of music is not at all exaggerated with respect to the feelings of thousands besides myself nay it is my opinion that were musical entertainments arrived to that degree of perfection to which they might be brought they could not fail of producing effects much more powerful than any i ever had an opportunity of experiencing  letter iii my lord recitative and air may be considered as genera in music and the different kinds of each as species  what i have already had the honor of submitting to your lordships perusal on the subject of recitative may serve partly to explain the nature of air all those passages where the transition from one emotion to another is sudden and violent and which therefore can neither on account of their brevity make each a whole of itself nor by reason of their variety be made parts of the same whole are expressed in recitative those on the other hand in which one sentiment pervades a whole sentence composed of different parts become proper subjects for air and indeed every complete musical strain may with great justness be termed a sentence or period in melody  before proceeding to speak of the different kinds of airs it may not be improper to say something of the symphony by which they are in general preceded this symphony is the enunciation by the orchestra of the strain or subject what the italians call the motivo of the air and when not improperly introduced which it always is when the sense admits not of any pause serves several useful purposes  it gives time to the singer to breathe already perhaps fatigued by a long recitative  it often fills up with propriety a natural pause and always finely prepares the audience for what is to come after by enabling them having thus once heard the strain to listen with more intelligence and of consequence with more interest and pleasure to the song besides the general use of the symphony renders the omission of it on particular occasions beautiful and striking  thus for example at the end of a recitative or at the beginning of a scene when the audience are expecting as usual the preparatory symphony to the air they are suddenly surprised by the violent burst of some impetuous passion which admitted of no possible pause the propriety of having in such a circumstance omitted the symphony comes forcibly on the mind as vice versa the effect of the omission here confirms the propriety of using it where the sense allows it to be introduced sometimes again the symphony is omitted in a very different manner though with equal propriety when for instance in an accompanied recitative after a succession of very different emotions some sentiment is supposed to take possession of the mind related to that which is to be the subject of the air and to which it is afterward led by a gradation of kindred emotions  the progress in this case from recitative to air is so gentle that the audience frequently find themselves melting into tears at the affecting and continued melody of the air before they are aware that the recitative is ended this imperceptible transition is effected sometime by subjecting the recitative itself to musical measure and making the notes of it by degrees take a resemblance to those of the air at other times it is brought about by introducing in the instrumental parts during the pauses of the recitative passages of the strain which is to make the subject of the air sometimes by both these means the effect of this gradual transition is always very fine and as your lordship will observe is in part derived from that habitual distinction which the audience are accustomed to make between recitative and air  as to the airs themselves your lordship will conceive that they are as various as their subjects these are every possible sentiment affection or passion the expression of which is extended through one sentence of a certain length such sentences as these  i love  i fear his wrath  i mourn her loss  though all proper subjects for musical expression being evidently too short to afford matter for a strain or melody which however simple must still be composed of parts the relations of which to one another and to one whole constitute indeed the essence of such strain  the air though it must contain at least one complete sentence is not however limited to one alone it is often composed of two sometimes of more parts but these whether related by analogy or by contrast to the principal one must each strictly belong to the same whole the airs are divided by the italians into certain classes these classes are originally founded on real distinctions drawn from the nature of the various affections of the mind but musicians who like other artists are seldom philosophers have distinguished them by names relative to the practice of their own profession  the principal are the following  aria cantabile  by preeminence so called as if it alone were song and indeed it is the only kind of song which gives the singer an opportunity of displaying at once and in the highest degree all his powers of whatever description they be the proper subjects for this air are sentiments of tenderness  aria di portamento  a denomination expressive of the carriage as they thus call it of the voice this kind of air is chiefly composed of long notes such as the singer can dwell on and have thereby an opportunity of more effectually displaying the beauties and calling forth the powers of his voice for the beauty of sound itself and of voice in particular as being the finest of all sounds is held by the italians to be one of the chief sources of the pleasure we derive from music the subjects proper for this air are sentiments of dignity  aria di mezzo caratttre  your lordship can be at no loss to understand this term though i know no words in our language by which i could properly translate it it is a species of air which though expressive neither of the dignity of this last nor of the pathos of the former is however serious and pleasing  aria parlante  speaking air is that which from the nature of its subject admits neither of long notes in the composition nor of many ornaments in the execution the rapidity of the motion of this air is proportioned to the violence of the passion which is expressed by it this species of air goes sometimes by the name of aria di nota e parola and likewise of aria agitata but these are rather subdivisions of the species and relate to the different degrees of violence of the passion expressed  aria di bravura aria di agilita  is that which is composed chiefly indeed too often merely to indulge the singer in the display of certain powers in the execution particularly extraordinary agility or compass of voice though this kind of air may be sometimes introduced with some effect and without any great violation of propriety yet in general the means are here consounded with the end  rondo  is a term of french origin unknown i believe till of late to the italian musicians it relates merely to a certain peculiarity in the construction of the song in which the composer after having properly established the subject carries it through a variety of tones every now and then returning to the principal strain or part and always concluding with it  cavatina  is an expression which likewise relates to the form alone meaning an air of one part without repetition  these to the best of my remembrance  the classes into which the italians  divided air  i shall now say something of each class and in doing so i hope to give your lordship some idea of the great extent as well as precision of the italian music and to show that though the names of these classes be evidently taken from circumstances of practice yet these circumstances if properly attended to will be found to be strictly connected with and indeed to originate from distinctions of a higher kind which must have been previously made with respect to the nature of the passions and their effect on utterance and expression whether the italian composers in observing these distinctions have been guided by some system or have been merely influenced by feeling i cannot take upon me to say i am rather however inclined to think that the latter is the case in the first place because i never heard of any such system existing among them and because i have been personally acquainted with several of their finest composers now living that had no idea of it and again because i think that to the want of such a system can be alone attributed the gross deviations which even in the works of their greatest masters are sometimes to be met with from its most obvious and most essential principles  letter iv my lord the aria cantabile is emphatically so called as being the highest species of song it is that indeed which affords the singer an opportunity of displaying in the execution of it all his powers and skill  if he has voice if he has feeling if he has taste if he has fancy if he has science  here he has ample scope for the exertion of them all the subject proper for this air is the expression of tenderness though this be an expression which always tends to sadness yet the sadness is of that pleasing kind which the mind loves to indulge thus the memory of pleasures that are past the complaints of a lover absent from his faithful mistress and such like are proper themes for this air hence it arises that the aria cantabile whilst it is susceptible of great pathos admits without prejudice to the expression of being highly ornamented for this plain reason that though the sentiments it expresses are affecting they are at the same time such as the mind dwells on with pleasure and it is likewise for this reason that the subject of the cantabile must never border on deep distress nor approach to violent agitation both of which are evidently inconsistent with ornament the motion of this air though not so solemn as that which belongs to still graver subjects is very slow and its constituent notes of consequence proportionally long i say constituent notes in order to distinguish those which the singer introduces as ornamental from those which constitute the melody itself these last are in general very few extremely simple in their march and so arranged as to allow great latitude to the skill of the singer the instrumental parts are in this kind of song restricted to almost nothing for though the accompanyment is of use to the singer because it supports the voice yet ought it to be kept so subordinate to the vocal part as never during the song to become the object of attention the singer who attempts the cantabile should be endowed in the first place with a fine voice of the sweet and plaintive kind that the long notes of which this song is composed may of themselves delight the ear he ought to have great sensibility that he may nicely feel and express in an affecting manner the sentiment he should possess besides great taste and fancy highly to ornament the melody and thereby give to it that elegance which is essential to this kind of song an accurate judgment is likewise necessary to keep his fancy within due bounds and he ought to be a perfect master of the science of counterpoint that he may know precisely what liberties he may take with respect to the harmony of the other parts as the productions of science are at least in part justly esteemed by the degree of utility which attends them so those of art may be by the degree of pleasure they afford now it is the superior degree of pleasure which proceeds from the joint exertion of so many powers of nature and art in the aria cantabile that gives to it the preeminence over every other kind of song for your lordship will observe that in listening to an air of this description though the mind is all awake to feeling yet are the emotions it experiences of that gentle kind which unfit it neither for the contemplation of beauty nor for the admiration of art on the contrary they serve to dispose it more effectually for both thus many of the noblest faculties of the mind are gratified at once we judge we admire we feel at the same instant of time and i may even say we are at the same instant sensibly feasted for there is no doubt but there is a charm not only in the harmony of sounds but even in the beauty of sound itself which acts physically on the machine and may be considered as actually producing a sensual gratification the following are examples of the cantabile from metastasio in the first a lover complaining to his friend of the cruelty of his mistress concludes the recitative by saying ma quanto ah tu nol sai quant e tiranna  but thou know not alas how unkind she is  air jo lo so che il bell sembiante un istante oh dio mirai e may piu da quell istante non lasciai di sospirar i know it who but for a moment beheld that lovely countenance and never from that moment hare ceased to sigh  jo lo so lo sanno queste valli ombrose erme foreste che han da me quel nome amato imparato a replicar i know it and these shady vales these solitary woods which have learned from me to repeat her beloved name know it also    in this second a young warrior about to take leave of his weeping mistress thus addresses her frena le belle lagrime idolo del mio cor no per vederti piangere cara non o valor ah non destarmi almeno nuovi tumulti in seno bastano i dolci palpiti che vi cagiona amor cease those gentle tears my souls idol if i see thee weep my fortitude forsakes me ah forbear to awake in my bosom new tumults the soft palpitations are sufficient which love causes there already    i have only now to add on the subject of this air that i should be sorry from what i have said of the ornament essential to it to have given rise to an opinion in your lordship which the general practice of singers is i own but too apt to confirm namely that the cantabile is little else than a string of flourishes originating almost entirely in the caprice of the performer this is very far from being the case though the melancholy expressed by the cantabile be of that soothing kind which the mind loves to indulge and is therefore not incompatible with some exertions of the fancy yet are these exertions clearly limited both with respect to number and quality by the sense of the words some admit of more some of less ornament the expression of tenderness as has been already observed is that which peculiarly characterises this air and just in proportion as this expression is allied to sentiments of hope or pleasure or tends rather toward sadness and despondency it admits more or less of being ornamented  as to the exact quantum no precise rules can be given  this it is evident must always depend on the nice judgment of the performer and it is certain that the greater his feeling and the more correct his taste the more sparing he will be in the application of embellishments  those he makes use of will resemble in kind and number not those ornaments which without distinction overload the whole surface of a gothic building but those with which the greeks adorned their architecture which in times of the purest taste were never so many as to disguise in any degree the appearance of simplicity nor so prominent as to disturb the symmetry of the great component parts of the edifice having mentioned architecture a very striking analogy presents itself to me between the corinthian order and the aria cantabile  as in this order it appears evidently to have been the intention of the inventor to unite as far as they are consistent with each other beauty and utility so it seems the object of the cantabile to unite in the same manner beauty and expression thus elegance and refinement are equally the character of both  in both have the same kind of limitation  in the former any thing however beautiful in itself that militated against utility would have been inadmissible  in the latter any ornament however graceful in itself that ran counterto or in the least diminished the expression would be unpardonable  for utility is the first principle of architecture and expression is the great end of music this analogy might be carried a great deal farther but i am afraid i have already exhausted your lordships patience  letter v my lord the second class of airs to be considered is the aria di portamento  a term expressive of a certain way of managing the voice it means that the voice must be strongly supported and artfully managed through the long notes of which this air is composed the motion of which is graver than that of any other species in the cantabile the notes are also long but their march is in general gradual and gliding here on the contrary the intervals ought to be bold striking and unexpected in the former the gentle dying away  here the grand swell of the voice ought to be principally attended to in short pathos and elegance are the characteristics of the cantabile  grandeur and sublimity of the portamento the great object which musicians seem to have had in view in this kind of air is to give full scope to the voice to display in the highest degree its powers and beauties  as the italians very emphatically express it far pompa della voce in the general definition of this air i took notice to your lordship of the high value which the italians put on the beauty of voice itself and indeed the effect of a powerful and at the same time harmonious voice in the execution of an air of this kind is such as i believe must be felt before it can be conceived  every sentiment which proceeds from greatness of mind or that speaks the admiration of what is itself sublime is a proper groundwork for this air the sentiment expressed by it may be accompanied with sensibility but must be calm and undisturbed by passion this being the case your lordship will see that the subject of the portamento is of a nature too serious and important to admit of that degree of ornament which is essential to the cantabile like the doric order in architecture though it rejects not ornament altogether yet it must owe its effect chiefly to its simplicity and grandeur if your lordship will allow me in another way to illustrate the specific difference of these two classes i might say that were venus to sing her mode of song would be the cantabile the portamento would be that of the queen of gods and men  your lordship will be sensible that though the line between these two classes be distinctly drawn yet they may more or less partake sometimes of the nature of each other some sentiments for example of a female lover all gentleness and sensibility may yet be accompanied with a degree of nobleness which if properly felt by the composer may induce him to give a grandeur to the music that will make it partake more than usual of the style of the portamento as on the other hand circumstances may be imagined in which the most heroic sentiments from the mixture of some tender affection may without losing their dignity be expressed by strains somewhat more approaching to the cantabile than the general character of the air allows but these indeed are nice shades of distinction which escape the control of fixed rules and can be appretiated only by correspondent feelings the peculiar qualities necessary for the proper performance of this air are first of all a powerful and beautiful voice for without this no skill no taste no feeling even can ever render long notes supportable much less make them a source of delight secondly a clear and unequivocal pronunciation by virtue of which notwithstanding the length of the notes the articulations with which they began may be so strongly impressed on the memory as to render the sense easily followed and understood lastly a graceful manner of acting without which in that kind of action soutenue which the great length of the notes requires the deportment of the actor must indeed be awkward in the extreme  i proceed now to give your lordship some examples of these airs beginning with one of the most serious kind and by its nature the farthest removed from the cantabile  it is likewise taken from metastasio  in the oratorio of the passion of christ dovunque il guardo giro immenso dio te vedo nell opre tue lammiro te reconosco in me wherever i turn my eyes great god i see thee i revere thee in thy works i feel thee in myself  la terra il mar le sfere mostran il tuo potere tu sei per tutto e noi tutti viviamo in te the earth the sea the heavens show forth thy power thou art over all and we all live in thee    the following example is from the opera of attilius regulus by the same author it is put in the mouth of the roman consul on hearing regulus insist on being sent back to carthage oh qual fiamma di gloria e donore sento scorrer per tutte le vene alma grande parlando con te oh what a flame of glory and honor i feel run through every vein thou great soul in conversing with thee  no non vive si timido core che in udirti con quelle catene non cambiasse la sort dun re no there lives not a soul so vile who hearing thee would not exchange with these chains even the fortune of a monarch    here is a third from the same opera  the daughter of regulus seeing her father so much occupied by the great public object he had in view that he appears dead to that paternal fondness which she had before experienced from him says  ah father why are you so much changed  to which he answers closing the recitative my fortunes are changed  i am still the same  air non perdo la calma fra i ceppi o gli allori non va sino ali alma la mia servitu whether bound in chains or encircled with laurels i lose not my serenity my servitude reaches not the soul  combatte i rigori di forte incostante in vario sembiante listessa virtu the same virtue under different appearances combats the rigor of inconstant fortune    letter vi my lord the aria di mezzo carattere comes next to be considered the subjects proper for this kind of air are many and very different its particular character being neither the pathetic the grand nor the passionate but the pleasing there may be an almost infinite variety of sentiments very pretty and very interesting which are not however of sufficient importance to be made the subject either of the cantabile or the portamento  the aria di mezzo carattere comprehends all such  from the great variety which this air of consequence embraces as well as from the less emphatic nature of the sentiments to which it belongs its general expression is not so determined as that of the former closses yet with respect to each individual air the expression is far from being vague or dubious and though some greater latitude be here granted to the fancy of the composer nothing is given to his caprice the sense itself of the words clearly ascertaining in point both of degree and quality the expression the degree ought to be in exact proportion to the placidity or warmth of the sentiment and its particular cast ought to be regulated by the nature of that passion to which the sentiment is naturally allied for sentiments are but gentler degrees of passion thus this class of airs whilst it retains its own particular character may by turns have some affinity with almost all the other classes but whilst its latitude is great in respect of variety its limitations with regard to degree are obvious  it may be soothing but not sad  it may be pleasing but not elevated  it may be lively but not gay the motion of this air is by the italians termed andante which is the exact medium of musical time between its extremes of slow and quick as the vocal part is never supposed here to be so beautiful and interesting as in the higher classes the orchestra though it ought never to cover the voice is not however kept in such subordination to it  it is not only allowed to play louder but may be more frequently introduced by itself and may on the whole contribute more to the general effect of the air  this kind of song is admirably well calculated to give repose and relief to the mind from the great degree of attention and with respect to myself at least i might say agitation excited by the higher and more pathetic parts of the piece  they possess the true character which belongs to the subordinate parts of a beautiful whole as affording a repose not the effect of a total want of interest but of an interest which they call forth of a different and more placid kind which the mind can attend to with more ease and can enjoy without being exhausted i could wish it were in my power to give here three or four examples of this air the more clearly to evince to your lordship that this air whilst it retains perfectly its own peculiar character may sometimes approach in its expression the cantabile sometimes the portamento and sometimes the parlante  but having but one volume of metastasio by me i cannot make that selection of examples which i could wish the following is from the sacred composition of the death of abel and as your lordship will observe partakes of the nature of the cantabile  abel speaks quel buon pastor son io che tanto il gregge apprezza che per la sua salvezza offer se stesso ancor i am that good shepherd who so loves his flock that in defense of it he offers his own life  conosco ad una ad una le mie dilette agnelle e riconoscon quelle il tenero pastor i know one by one my pretty little lambs and they in return know each their tender shepherd    letter vii my lord from what has been said of the foregoing classes it is evident that none of them are at all calculated to express any emotion which approaches to agitation their peculiar charasteristics dignity tenderness elegance are suitable to the more temperate and finer feelings their subject in short is sentiment rather than passion this last however affords yet a very wide field for musical expression and perhaps it is not going too far to say that the more violent the passion the more apt the expression of it is to receive additional energy from the power of music the kind of airs which go under the general denomination of aria parlante is that whose peculiar province is to express violent emotions of all kinds as on the one hand the necessary connection between the subject of the portamento the cantabile and the aria di mezzo carattere with the respective length of notes and of consequence slowness of measure which has been mentioned as characteristic of each of these classes is evident so on the other hand the incompatibility of emotions in any degree violent with slow and deliberate utterance is equally evident the circumstance from which this class takes its denomination being the acceleration of speech common to all emotions whatever of the impetuous kind it comprehends of consequence a vast variety with respect both to quality and degree  it may be said to take up expression just where the aria di mezzo carattere leaves it some airs of this last class of the liveliest cast may approach indeed so near to some of the parlante of the least agitated kind that it might perhaps be difficult to say to which class they belonged but as soon as the expression begins to be in any degree impetuous the distinction is evident as the degree of passion to be expressed increases the air assumes the name of aria agitata aria di strepito aria infuriata expressions of fear of joy of grief of rage when at all impetuous to their highest and most frantic degress are all comprehended under the various subdivisions of the class  their rhythm has its peculiar province the effect of this kind of airs depending perhaps chiefly on its powers the instrumental parts are here likewise of great efficacy particularly in the expression of the more violent passions giving by the addition of a great body of sound and by the distinctness and rapidity of their execution a force and energy to the whole which could never be the effect of a voice alone however flexible however powerful and if it be allowed that the beating of a drum has in consequence of certain principles of sound and rhythm a considerable effect on the mind and that ten drums have a proportionably greater effect than one it must i apprehend be also allowed that sounds more beautiful and as distinct nay infinitely more capable from their duration to mark the rhythm by distinguishing pause from length of note must have a similar effect on the mind  finer however and more powerful in proportion to their superior beauty accuracy and other advantages the instruments here far from being restricted to the mere support of the voice are called in to cooperate with it in producing one and the same effect but with greater power than that which could be produced by the voice alone  i am well aware it may be objected here that the greater the force of the instruments the more they will be apt to overpower the voice and of consequence to destroy the principal source of expression namely the sense of connection between the words and the notes and perhaps it may not be very easy to convince those who are not conversant with music how it is possible this should not be the case all those however who have been accustomed to hear good music well performed will be satisfied on recollection that in this kind of airs they have often heard a very numerous orchestra exert all its powers without in the least covering the voice or disguising the sense and the reason is simply this that what is called the fortissimo or extreme force of the orchestra is not continued uniformly throughout the accompanyment which would indeed have the effect of completely drowning the voice  but that this extreme exertion is instantaneously called forth either in those particular notes which are peculiarly significant of the rhythm such as the first of the bar etc or on some note or notes where the sense itself requires it after which the piano or hush of the orchestra immediately takes place bearing the voice excepting in such instantaneous lightnings of sound if i may be allowed the expression eminently superior throughout nor ever playing for any length of time with the same continued or with increasing force excepting in the case of some climax in the expression where the words have either been already heard or in which at least their sense even were they not distinctly heard cannot from the general tenor of the air be mistaken  this extraordinary swell from all the parts of the orchestra is in general practiced with great success at the conclusion of such airs in which supposing the words even not to be understood any further than they can be guessed at from the context and by the action of the speaker the effect they are intended to have on the audience is more happily obtained than it could be by the clear articulation of them unaccompanied by that torrent of passion if i may so speak which may be produced by this united exertion of all the instrumental parts  for it must be likewise observed that passion when very violent is expressed not so much by the words of the speaker as by other signs  the tones of the voice the acton of the face and the gesture insomuch that i am confident i have heard many airs of this kind in which had the actor without speaking a note looked and acted his part with propriety nobody would have been at a loss to judge either of the kind or of the degree of passion by which he seemed actuated rousseau somewhere in his works makes a very ingenious observation the truth of which the italian composers seem evidently to have selt  that as violent passion has a tendency to choke the voice so in the expression of it by musical sounds a roulade which is a regular succession of notes up or down or both rapidly pronounced on one vowel has often a more powerful effect than distinct articulation  such passages are sometimes introduced in airs of this kind and though i cannot help giving my assent to rousseaus observation yet i must at the same time confess that they are too apt to be abused and that if continued for any length of time they have always appeared to me unnatural upon the whole i hope however it must be evident even to those who are not conversant with music that in the expression of the more violent passions the instrumental parts my have a greater latitude than in other kinds of airs in which the emotions being more moderate the expression of them depends proportionally more on the force of the words and less on the tone and action with which they are accompanied but whatever may be the effect of airs of this kind when properly led by the circumstances of the piece and explained by the character of the speaker your lordship must see with what impropriety they are introduced as is frequently the case in our concerts where without the audience being apprised either of the interest of the piece or the nature of the characters they are sung by a fellow standing bolt upright with one hand in his side and the other in his breechespocket and where into the bargain the unmerciful scrapers of our orchestra taking the advantage of the fortissimo which they find now and then written above the notes of their parts seem to vie with one another who shall most effectually overpower throughout both the voice of the singer and the melody of the song it is this kind of ignorant selection and murderous execution which give sensible people a distaste to italian music in general nor can they surely be blamed for thinking it absurd that a man should say what cannot in the nature of things be heard and that all that violent fracas and noise of instruments is a most ridiculous accompanyment to the affected immobility and unmeaning simper of the singer but to return to the subject  your lordship will perceive that between those most violent expressions and those that are least so which this class comprehends there must be an almost infinite variety in respect both of kind and degree i shall therefore content myself with giving your lordship examples of the principal divisions only and shall begin by that kind which i mentioned before as taking up expression where the aria di mezzo carattere leaves it and as being of this nature that it might even be sometimes difficult to decide which of these classes it belonged to del sen gli ardori nessun mi vanti non soffro amori non voglio amanti troppo mie cara la liberta let no one boast to me the ardours of his bosom i suffer not loves i am adverse to lovers my liberty is too dear to me  se fosse ognuno cosi sincero meno importune sarrebbe il vero saria pui rara l infedelta if every one were as sincere truth would be less offensive and infidelity more rare    if the words of this air were put in the mouth of a gay young girl thus carefully signifying her insensibility to love and her desire of liberty it might with propriety be so composed as to rank with the airs di mezzo carattere and would be well expressed by that pleasing though unimpassioned cantileno which is characteristic of that class but if on the other hand we suppose them spoken with a degree of earnestness to an importunate lover in order to get rid of him it must in that case certainly be so composed as to belong to the first division of the aria parlante  in the following example no such uncertainty can take place the degree of passion or of interest at least expressed by it referring it plainly to this last class achilles speaks it about to leave deidamia dille che si consoli dille che m ami e dille che parti fido achille che fido tornera tell her to be comforted tell her to love me and tell her that achilles left her faithful that faithful he will return  che a suol bei occhi soli fia che l mio cor si stempre che l idol mio fu sempre che l idol mio fara that her charms alone shall have the sovereignty of my heart that she ever was that she ever shall be my only love    in order to be as explicit as possible i shall give your lordship two other examples from the same piece which with regard to the expression seem nearly equal in degree though widely different in kind  deidamia reproaching achilles for want of affection says no ingrato amor non senti o se pur senti amore perder non vuoi del cor por me la pace no ungrateful thou feel not love or if indeed thou feel it thou art not willing for my sake to lose the peace of thy bosom  amai se te l rammenti e puoi senza penar amare e disamar quando ti piace perhaps thou love but remember thou can not love and without pain cease to love at pleasure    the other is put in the mouth of achilles on his suspicion of being deprived of his raistress by a rival il volarmi il mio tesoro ah dov e quest alma ardita a da togliermi la vita che vuol togliermi il mio ben rob me of my treasure ah where is this presumptuous soul he must first take my life who would rob me of my love  m avvilisce in queste spoglie il poter di due pupille ma lo so chio sono achille ma mi sento achille in sen the power of too bright eyes disgraces me in these weeds but i know  i feel that i am achilles    though the general acceleration of speech common to each of these airs and which therefore brings them under the same class be perhaps nearly equal in both yet the skilful composer will nicely discriminate not only between the warlike audacity of achilles and the feminine softness of dudanio but also between the expression of disappointed affection in the former and of jealous resentment in the latter  i beg leave to offer the two following examples also as approaching in degree to the foregoing though very different in kind the first partaking somewhat of the tenderness which is characteristic of the cantabile the second of the dignity which belongs to the portamento parto non ti sdegnar si madre mia da te gli affetti a moderar quest alma impara i go be not offended yes my mother i go this soul shall learn from thee to moderate its affections  gran colpa pur non e se mal frenar si puo un figlio che perde un figlio che trovo si cara madre surely it is no heinous fault that a son cannot easily command himself who lost who found so dear a mother    in the following air xerxes on being reconciled to themistocles thus addresses him contrasto assai piu degno se vuoi cominciera or che la gloria in noi lodio in amor cambio a much nobler combat if thou will shall commence betwixt us now that glory has changed our hatred into love  scordati tu lo sdegno jo le vendette obblio tu mio sostegno ed io tuo difensor saro forget there thy enmity i will bury in oblivion my resentment thou shall be my support i will be thy protector    in the following examples the violence of the expression being increased the music assumes the denomination of aria agitata lalma delira par che manchino quasi i respiri che fuor del petto mi balza il cor my soul grows delirious with excessive joy i pant for breath my heart seems to jump from my bosom  quant e piu facile chun gran diletto giunga ad uccidere che un gran dolor how much more apt is excess of joy to kill than excess of grief    i cannot pass by this example however without observing to your lordship that the second part of the air is by no means proper for musical expression it ceases to be the language of passion and is besides a reflection which no person in such a state as the first part indicates would naturally make in setting the opera to music a judicious composer would strike it out altogether the next example though evidently different with regard to the kind of expression belongs to the same subdivision of this class gia lidea del giusto scempio mi rapisce mi diletta gia pensando alla vendetta mi commincio a vendicar already the idea of the just slaughter delights me already thinking of my vengeance i begin to be revenged  gia quel barbaro quel empio fa di sangue il suol vermiglio ed il sangue del mio figlio gia si sent rin facciar i see the impious wretch already dye the earth with his blood already the murder of my son stares him in the face    the examples i am next to give your lordship are of that kind which takes the name of aria di smanie for which i do not recollect any phrase in english exactly equivalent it is an appellation given to the expression of such emotions as take away in some degree the right use of reason and begin to border on insanity non vedi tiranno ch io moro daffanno che bramo che in pace mi lasci morir see thou not tyrant that i die of grief and only wish thou would suffer me to die in peace  cho lalma si oppressa che tutto mi spiace che quasi me stessa non posso soffrir that my soul is so oppressed that every thing is hateful to me that i can no longer suffer even myself  dimmi crudel dov e ah non tacer cosi barbaro ciel perch infino a questo di serbarmi in vita tell me cruel  where is she ah do not thus be silent barbarous heaven ah why did thou prolong my life to this day  corrasi  ah dove oh dei chi guida e passi miei chi almen chi per merce la via m addita let me run  where oh god who will guide my steps who for pitys sake will direct me  recitative  fuggi sebaste ah dove faggiro da me stesso ah porto in seno il carnefice mio dovunque vada il terror lo spavento seguiran la mia traccia la colpa mia mi stara sempre in faccia fly sebaste  ah whither shall i fly from myself alas i carry in my bosom my executioner wherever i go horror follows my steps my guilt must ever stare me in the face  air aspri remorsi atroci figli del fallo mio perch si tardi oh dio mi lacerate il cor cruel heartrending remorse offspring of my crime why oh god so late do thou tear my bosom  perch funeste voci chor mi sgridate appresso perch vi ascolto adesso ne vascoltar fin or ye fatal voices which now howl around me if deaf to you hitherto why do i listen to you now    the last division of this class of airs is that which is adapted to the expression of passion of whatever kind when become frantic and is properly termed aria infuriata recitative  non piu mandane il mio furor mi avanza non ispirarmi il tuo fremo abbastanza  no more mandane inspire me not with thine my own fury is sufficient  air men bramosa di stragi funeste va scorrendo larmene foreste fera tigre che i figli perde with less thirst for blood and slaughter the fierce tiger robbed of its young scours the armenian forests  ardo dira di rabbia deliro smanio fremo non odo non miro che le fury che porto con me my wrath consumes me i rave i rage i hear and see nothing but the furies which i carry with myself  rendimi il figlio mio ah mi si spezza il cor non son piu madre oh dio non o piu figlio give me back my son  oh my heart bursts  no longer am i a mother  oh god my child is no more  fra mill furori che calma non anno fra mill timori che intorno mi stanno accender mi sento mi sento gelar surrounded by a thousaud furies which know no calm by a thousand terrors which incessantly pursue me by turns i freeze i burn    i hope i have been able by the foregoing examples to give your lordship some idea of the nature extent and variety of this class of airs as well as of the reason why so great a variety is comprehended under the same general denomination a circumstance which without due attention to its cause would appear absurd and contradictory before i conclude it is proper to take notice to your lordship that the words of an air may be so written as to afford subject for two or even three of the classes hitherto mentioned not in a mixed manner but severally of which my memory furnishes me with the following example pria chio rieda al campo pensa chio son romano che duna spada il lampo no non mi fa terror before i return to the camp remember i am a roman that i rejoice in danger of battle  sposa signor che affanno deh tergi i vaghi rai che sol nel dirti addio vacilla il mio valor spouse  sir  what misery  for pitys sake dry up these tears only in bidding thee adieu my constancy is shaken  empio destin tiranno o cento smanie in seno o cento fury al cor cruel barbarous fate a thousand torments rend my bosom i have a thousand furies in my heart    this air your lordship sees is divided into three different parts the first of which expressing dignity of sentiment belongs to the portamento the second expressing tenderness to the cantabile and the third expressing rage to the last division of the aria parlante  letter viii my lord from what i have said of the aria di portamento the cantabile the mezzo carattere and the different subdivisions of the aria parlante i hope i have in some degree made it plain to your lordship that there is no affection of the human breast from the slightest and most gentle stirring of sentiment to the most frantic degrees of passion which some one of these classes is not aptly suited to express if this be true other classes must be either bad or superfluous this in fact is the case of the aria di agilita or aria di bravura as it is sometimes called in treating of which it will be almost sufficient to repeat to your lordship the description i gave of it in the general enumeration of the different classes it is an air composed chiefly indeed too often merely to indulge the singer in the display of certain powers in the execution particularly extraordinary agility or compass of voice in such a composition the means are evidently confounded with the end of the art dexterity if i may be allowed the expression and artifice instead of serving as the instruments being made the object of the work such are the airs which with us we so frequently observe sung to ears erect and gaping mouths whilst the heart in honest apathy is carrying on its mere animal function and of this kind indeed are all the attempts in the different arts to substitute what is difficult or novel for what is beautiful and natural where there has ever been a genuine taste for any of the arts this aptness to admire what is new and difficult is one of the first symptoms of the decline of that taste such is at present the case in italy with respect to all the arts but the admiration bestowed in britain on difficulty and novelty in preference to beauty and simplicity is the effect not of the decline but of the total want of taste and proceeds from the same principles with the admiration of tumbling and ropedancing which the multitude may gaze on with astonishment long before they are susceptible of the charms of graceful and elegant pantomime these feats of agility having exactly the same relation to fine dancing that the above mentioned airs have to expressive music they are therefore i conceive incompatible with the nature of a serious drama but in the burletta or comic opera in which much greater liberties may be taken i think i have sometimes heard them introduced with success in a comedy a pretty frolicsome coquette may be supposed to cut an elegant caper at once to show her legs and to display her skill in dancing nay such a stroke might be characteristic and therefore proper so a gay fashionable lady might with a kind of graceful levity express by an air of this kind some of her pretty capricious humors equally unintelligible with the music itself the merit of both consisting merely in the prettiness of the manner for this kind of music though incapable of any expression excepting that perhaps of gaiety in general may yet have all the beauty which can be given to it by a fine voice running with ease and velocity though an arrangment of notes not in itself unpleasing just as the humor of the lady though perhaps rather unmeaning may be accompanied with many graces of countenance figure voice and motion  now the union of all this with the music produces often without any violation of propriety a very happy effect on the stage but your lordship will observe with what absurd impropriety these airs often make a part of our concerts where all this elegant flirtation of face and figure is forbidden and where these fanciful and exuberant sallies are gravely pronounced by a lady standing at the harpsicord with downcast or at best unmeaning eyes and without the smallest apparent tendency to motion  letter ix my lord have now endeavored to give your lordship as distinct an idea as i could of the simple and accompanied recitative and of all those classes of airs which have names in italian and which i mentioned in the first general enumeration i made of them there is however another species of airs which i have not classed with them because it has no particular denomination though it appears to me well deserving of that distinction but this is easily accounted for when it is considered as i took occasion to observe in the beginning that the names of these classes are all taken from circumstances of the practical part of the art the airs alluded to here are those whose subject is a simile and which i shall venture to call airs of imitation these though essentially different from all those before mentioned yet from some circumstance of similarity in the practical part have been referred to one or other of the above classes  though upon the whole similes of any length be perhaps seldom admissible in dramatic poetry being in general repugnant to the genuine expression of passion yet sometimes they may be introduced without impropriety more particularly in the musical drama which like all the other arts justly claims some license in practice with respect to that beauty which is its chief object or that species of pleasure which it is peculiarly calculated to inspire  now the greatest possible variety of musical effect being exactly the perfection of this kind of drama and those airs which have for their subject a simile by giving scope to the descriptive powers of music being a source of great beauty and variety to the piece a more frequent introduction of similes may on this principle be allowed in the opera than in dramatic works unaccompanied by music before i proceed to give your lordship any examples of this air i beg leave to say something on the principle of musical imitation in general and first it is evident that besides the relations of acute and grave of loud and soft of continuous and discontinuous which are simply the same in noise of all kinds as in musical sounds there are many circumstances of resemblance between these last and other sounds for some of which we have not even names the found of a little flute for example resembles the singing of birds not from its shrillness merely but on account of a certain quality of sound common to both which every ear is sensible of but which we have no words to express it is by this quality of sound that we distinguish the voices of persons though speaking perhaps nearly on the same pitch and discriminate different instruments while playing the same musical notes and the italians have therefore very properly termed it il metallo della voce again motion in bodies though not common to motion in music in all its extent is in some respects the same in others similar or at least analogous slow and quick with regard to succession with all the possible degrees between their perceptible extremes are common to both the same may be said of regular and irregular and where these fail analogies can be affected by different means as striking as circumstances of positive fameness or resemblance gliding as it is sometimes practiced both by the voice and by certain instruments is the same in music as in bodies it being in reality the effect of that motion in some body acting on another the notes of music however being each by its nature stationary cannot strictly speaking be said to glide yet the idea of a gliding motion is easily conveyed by a certain arrangement of notes in the same manner soaring sinking and even level motion are equally easily expressed and though to be sure a note cannot be said to turn or run round like a body yet a succession of notes may be found that may give an idea of circular motion the difference between these motions in music and in bodies being something like the difference between these circles setting aside then the more obscure analogies in music which are felt perhaps only in consequence of a certain organization or a degree of imagination not common to all men it is surely evident that resemblances or analogies may be produced by means of sounds and of their rythm and arrangement to every thing in nature which we perceive in consequence of sound and motion thus the whistling of the winds the noise of thunder the roaring and dashing of the sea the murmurs of a stream the whispers of the breeze  the solemn waving of a lofty pine the forked motion and momentary appearance of lightning the grand swell of a billow the rapidity of a torrent the meanders of a rivulet or the smooth gliding of a silent stream must even to those who have not a musical ear appear all within the compass of musical imitation for this plain reason that positive resemblance is in fact the ground of this imitation nor does the analogy seem much strained when we say that music may imitate the tread of a giant the light and nimble footsteps of a nymph or even the motion of those fanciful beings whom shakespeare has described as chasing with printless feet the ebbing neptune but the imitation of which music is capable is not stinted to such positive resemblances as those now cited general ideas of hugeness and immensity of lightness and elegance of operations that are performed with difficulty or with facility of order of confusion of exertion of repose of energy of debility of similarity of discrepancy of union of incompatibility and many more may be clearly conveyed by different qualities modifications arrangements rythm and combinations of musical sounds with respect to the more distant and obscure analogies such as that to cold light darkness pain and the like as to those who are less sensible of the effects of music they may seem to originate rather in the enthusiasm of the hearer than in any reality in the art i shall not insist on them  i hope upon the whole your lordship will agree with me that it is evident that there are sufficient grounds to go upon to justify the attempt of imitative music as distinct from passionate and that the introduction of airs of this last kind must in consequence of the variety they give tend to beautify the whole and render it more complete i must confess however that i have often seen them used too frequently in the same piece and that the effect of them can never be completely fine when they are not dictated by and accompanied throughout with some sentiment or passion of the speaker  the following is an example in point recitative  in ogni sort listessa e la virtu lagita e vero il nemico destin ma non iopprime e quando e men felice e piu sublime in every state virtue is the same adverse fate it is true agitates but cannot oppress it and when it is least happy it is then most sublime  air quercia annosa su lerte pendici fra il contrasto di venti nemici pin secura piu salda fi fa the knotted oak which high on the rugged cliffs braves the contending winds becomes by them more firm and more secure  che sel verno di chiome le sfronda piu nel suolo col pie si profonda forza aquista se perde belta and if the winter despoils it of its leaves it makes it sink deeper in the earth its roots and it acquires strength in proportion as it loses beauty    in the foregoing example the image of the oak itself on the high cliffs the raging of the winds and the dignity of the sentiment in the speaker all conspire to produce the same effect of grandeur but i have seen airs in which the subject of the passionate part was different from that of the imitative so contrived as to keep each most distinctly separate from the other whilst at the same time the union of both made one beautiful whole handel in his oratorio of acis and galatea has produced a masterstroke of this kind  galatea addressing herself to the birds that are supposed to be singing around her says hush hush ye little warbling quire your thrilling strains awake my pains and kindle fierce desire   in this example there is no comparison made the imitative part is only suggested by the sense and the composer has taken the hint in adapting the music to it and has indeed done it with the utmost propriety as well as ingenuity it is plain in this air that if the imitation of any thing is to be at all attempted it must be that of the warbling quire and it is as plain that the passionate expression of the speaker has not even the most distant relation to the singing of birds  to have set the voice a singing in imitation of the birds or whilst the voice sang the passionate part to have made the birds sing either in unison or in direct harmony with the voice would have been each equally absurd it would seem indeed at first sight almost impossible to reconcile two things so different yet this great genius by confining each part to its proper province has so artfully managed the composition that whilst the vocal part most feelingly speaks the passion a little flagellet from the orchestra carries on throughout the delightful warbling of the quire and though perfectly different in sound melody and rythm from the notes sung by the voice instead of distracting the attention from it or confounding the expression serves to add new beauty and grace to the effect just as your lordship may conceive a naked figure so veiled with some light and transparent vestment floating to the wind as at once completely to reveal the figure and by its undulating folds add new charms both to the motion and the form nothing can put in a stronger light the discrimination which i before made to your lordship of the passionate and imitative powers of music than the above mentioned air or more clearly evince the propriety of assigning the first to the voice alone and of confining the instruments to the other only this principle indeed long before it was perhaps ever thought of either by philosophers or composers must have been generally felt and even the powers of the great handel could not compensate its violation in composition for in the very same opera a little after when galatea is made to convert acis into a stream and after the symphony has made a fine imitation of the winding of the stream through the vale he makes galatea repeat it with her voice and though the music of the air be in other respects beautiful in the extreme yet i do not believe it was ever performed without appearing tedious even to those who never dreamed of this principle and to those who were acquainted with it at once tedious and absurd  in the first example i gave your lordship of these airs of imitation the comparison is itself the subject and the nature of the sentiment coinciding perfectly with it only serves to increase perhaps the general pathos without forming in any degree a separate subject  the second contains plainly a double subject contrived with wonderful art to go on together to set off each other and to form one beautiful whole there is still a third kind of these airs that holds a middle place between those two in which there being no express comparison the imitative part as in the last is only suggested by the words but being as in the first of the same quality as it were with the sentiment does not make the immediate subject of the music but is kept subordinate to the expression of the passion or sentiment the following air is of this species intendo amico rio quel basso mormorio tu chiedi in tua favella il nostro ben dov e i understand thee gentle river in that plaintive murmur thou inquirest with me where our love is gone    as the comparisons which make the subject of these airs or as the objects of which they only suggest the imitation may be sublime elegant gay boisterous etc so they may severally have a relation to some one or other of the classes before mentioned the portamento the cantabile the mezzo carattere and the different divisions of the aria parlante  and of consequence may be referred to them the division which i have made of music into passionate and imitative being rather of a philosophical kind whilst that by which the italians have formed the different classes of their airs originates as i have said in circumstances of practice only so just is their division that to give a distinct idea of any of these airs we must say it is an air of imitation of the portamento style or of the cantabile etc  finis
