an essay concerning the outward and salutary application of oils on the human body  by the rev william martin trinder md  london printed for the author by w wilson st peters hill doctors commons and

chancellor the heads of colleges and halls and the other constituent members thereof this humble attempt to be useful is in all filial duty and respect inscribed by william martin trinder a graduate of oxford and doctor of physic at leyden  an essay we read in the holy scriptures not only of wine that makes glad the heart of man but of oil to make his face to shine or his outside for so the word  frequently signifies and it ought in this place psalm civ    so to be understood  the ancients accustomed themselves to the outward application of oil in order to heighten the comeliness of their persons  and they did well for what constitutes beauty more than the natural diffusion of gelatinous juices extracted from the aliment and brought forward through the arteries to all parts of the body or if these be wanting what better substitute can there be than oils properly applied  this practice of inunction was so general and so frequent that our savior gently reproved simon the pharisee for omitting this instance of civility luke vii     the rich and honorable were anointed with oils of the greatest fragrance   homer thus due respect was shown to our blessed lord by having precious ointment poured upon his head mark xxvi    but the ancients used oil not only for the decoration and refreshment of their persons but for the preservation of their health and strength after bathing they rubbed themselves over with ceromata to close the pores of the body  and thus to give strength to the system they also anointed their heads with ointments to prevent drunkenness  anacreon athenaeus lib xv cap    before engaging in violent and fatiguing exercises they always used ceromata or medicated oils to prevent strains to make their limbs supple and by hindering transpiration to preclude any great waste of strength now although it must be confessed that the ancients were not the most improved anatomists yet their general and frequent practice in the use of ointments and friction was excellent being very preventative of disease and conducive to health as will appear from the following statement of facts   st all over the human body are innumerable inhalants which are the orifices and branches of the absorbent vessels that ultimately terminate in the great veins near the heart these absorb and carry fluids into the body but they cannot carry any out   dly there are also innumerable exhalants which perforate the surface of the skin that are the extremities of the arteries and which carry fluids out of the body but they cannot carry any in according to sanctorius the transpiration from the skin far exceeds in quantity all the excretions by the other emunctories and comparatively to alvine discharges the proportion is as one to four so that if the skin ejects twentyfour the intestines shall discharge only six ounces if by any means the exhalants be so closed as to hinder the greater part of transpiration it must be confessed that the deliciae animalis vitae that is to say good eating may be rendered for a time unnecessary for it appears in story that wetting the body with salt water prevented hunger in six people who were on a raft in the sea for six days in the gulf of mexico and captain bligh of the bounty experienced the same effect after he had been turned adrift in a boat by his crew in the pacific ocean    dly animal or vital heat which is most necessary to the nutrition and preservation of the body is generated by the decomposition in the lungs of atmospheric air by animal gas boerhaave martin and others were of opinion that the motion of the blood was the cause of animal heat if so how is it that the vital heat is nearly the same in all persons in health although the circulation of the blood be very different how is it that the vital heat shall be the same in a young lady sitting at her sampler as in a sawyer in the violent exercise of his trade the circulation shall be far above par in one and below it in the other but nevertheless the vital heat shall be the same in both plenck  and hence it is that the more and quicker we inspire atmospheric ai the warmer we become as in running up hill or in vehement reading and speaking vegetables perspire from their leaves as animals from their lungs this vegetable perspirable matter when acted upon by the suns light produces the pure part of the atmospheric or vital air hence it is that exercise in a garden caeteris paribus is far more salubrious than in the streets of a city that vital heat is generated by the aforesaid decomposition in the lungs appears from considering that animals destitute of lungs are not hotter than the circumambient air whereas the vital heat of animals possessed of lungs is by no means dependent on the temperature of the air in the human body it is hardly ever less than    degrees or more than  0  of fahrenheits tongue thermometer but if the living body in a healthy state be placed in contact to much hotter bodies it will not acquire their excess nor if in the midst of much colder bodies will it acquire their coldness thus on the coast of africa where the heat of the climate shall rise to   0 degrees of fahrenheits thermometer the human body will retain its natural heat of    degrees because of the evaporation of sweat which generates coldness hence it is that the negroes in the west india islands endure labor in the sun far better than white men because as it is said of their quicker evaporation of perspirable matter from their skin and lungs so again in the frozen regions of the north the heat of the living body shall experience no material change and this is providential for if the living body had not the means to resist excessive heat the heat of the room in which dr blagden and others entered was raised whilft they were in it to   0o and to   0o these excessive heats were borne for a considerable time with little inconvenience by the gentlemen who exposed themselves to them both naked and with their clothes on nor was the heat of dr blagdens body at all increased though the velocity of his pulse was in one instance more than doubled a blast of the heated air from a pair of bellows was searcely to be endured for the following obvious reason when the same air remained for any time in contact with the body part of its heat was destroyed and consequently the body was surrounded with a colder medium than the air of the room whereas when fresh portions of the air were applied to the body in such a quick succession that no part of it could remain in contact a sufficient time to be cooled the heat was seasibly greater vide chamberss dictionary under the article heat   the fluids would become too thin run out or putrify and if it could not resist excessive cold the fluids of the body could not circulate and of course become coagulant  this vital heat is the cause of that strong intestine action by which the solids of the body are expanded the fluids broke down and divided and superfluous and heterogeneous matter separated and discharged when it is sufficiently strong in a healthy state this vital heat may be in excess as in hectic and inflammatory fevers acute rheumatism etc quee  is not vitiated air in jails when combined with animal gas productive of patrid miasma it forces the blood and juices into the extreme arteries the skin becomes soft and glowing and the flesh turgescent from that bland oleaginous aliment so well and so universally diffused   thly friction although far less preservative and restorative than bodily exercise in the open country air especially if used to the point of fatigue yet in one particular it is more serviceable because of its topical application  friction by obliging the veins to admit of distension causes the arterial blood more abundantly to flow into them hereby increasing the velocity of the circulation diffusing the vital heat and augmenting vigor moreover the venal blood by means of friction runs quicker toward the heart which it stimulates to a greater propulsion of the blood and juices over the whole body  if cold coagulated blood be rubbed in a glass mortar it will again become a frothy liquid of a crimson color it is said indeed that this effect arises from fresh surfaces of blood being exposed to the atmospheric air with the oxygen of which it immediately combines restoring it to the same floridity as when in the body nevertheless it is also true that gentle friction so attenuates stagnant blood in bruises that it will enter into the mouths of the bibulous veins  friction moves and attenuates the otherwise immeable juices in the vessels that encumber and relax the nervous system but if vehemently and immoderately used it excites inflammation and by too much increasing the contraction of the heat and arteries the liquids exhale and the body becomes parched and dry immoderate labor in like manner is prejudicial to the health and it prevents longevity for hardworking people soon look old and it is observable that women in general live longer than men   thly oil whether contained in the celular membrane of the body or externally applied greatly by its lubricity facilitates muscular motion it keeps off the coldness of the atmosphere hence fat persons are not so susceptible of cold as lean people and it is the best preventive against chilblains it gives whiteness to the tender skin hence it is that the fattest parts of the body are the whitest as the breasts of young women  it gives roundness and beauty to the human form for the skin when not distended by it contracts itself into unsightly wrinkles it gives nourishment to the body for being absorbed by the inhalants it is carried with the chyle into the blood if it be said that oil externally applied stops the excretory pores thereby preventing sweat and insensible perspiration i answer from my own experience that it does not but it rather promotes both especially if applied by brisk friction for it cleanses the exhalants of that ever encrusting luting sordes which covers even the most delicate persons and which the vapor bath soon discovers to every individual the cuticle or upper skin by time wears rough and decays and a new one is generated hence it is that serpenes and shellfish every summer become new coated vegetables and trees seem to have this property according to the ingenious mr forsyths experiments on this curious subject the ancients who were in the frequent practice of inunction never found plain oil to stop the pores for when they wished to stop or hinder transpiration they used wax with their oil such were the precious ceromata mentioned by athenaeus deipnosoph   as of saffron sweet marjoram fenugreek flowerdeluce and of roses and not thinking even these preparations sufficiently obstructive of the pores they before engaging in gymnastic exercises and after anointing themselves with oil rolled themselves in the sand  from what i have written concerning the inhalants the exhalants vital heat friction and oil i think that the following practice will be thought by the public reasonable useful and important  in incipient dropsy particularly the leucophlegmatic and anasarcous arising from the debility of the vascular system the chief cure is to strengthen the vessels by friction and a stimulating oil so that the absorbents shall take up the water from the cavities and the perspiratory powers recover their wonted action that the dropsy does not arise as is commonly imagined from an atony or laxity of the whole body and the viscera thereof appears from this consideration that many cachectic persons are not dropsical and many who have cisted dropsy are entirely free from any cachexy whatsoever  in chronic rheumatism owing to a serous colluvies of humors predominant about the moving fibers of the muscles as also in stiffness and rigidity of the joints and muscles particularly in old military men arising from frequent and long exposures to the injuries of the weather and from old healedup wounds and fractures medicated oils with a fleshbrush together with electrical shocks on the stiffened parts will be found very serviceable  the fibers of old people are hard and rigid their perspiration is little and that bland vapor which formerly bedewed their bodies is no more inunction with friction to them is most salutary for the animal warmth and juices are hereby drawn into the skin and the oil by its nourishing powers renovates and invigorates the whole system the sagacious sydenham had great success in the recovery of debilitated nature by recommending healthy young men as bedfellows to the aged and infirm he said that heat alone was not the cause of restoration for the application of warm napkins did no good sec i cap iv p    it was therefore only to be ascribed to the mild oleaginous effluvia now if the human oleaginous effluvia be so penetrating and balsamic as to afford revivifying nourishment by absorption why should not the oil of sweetalmonds for instance do the same thing especially when broke down and pressed in by heat and friction  soldiers that are exposed to excessive heats in hot countries should frequently be ordered to rub their bodies with ceromata to prevent too great a waste of strength by perspiration and when in cold countries they are exposed to rain and sleep in damp camps they should be enjoined to follow the practice of inunction for being generally young men such stimuli would quickly arouse their native heat draw it to the surface and keep it there and also by closing the inhalants effectually shut out an otherwise too penetrating a humidity  after hard labor or excessive fatigue the outward use of oil is wonderfully restorative and refreshing this is not only testified by the practice of the ancient athletae but by some mowers at hendon this summer who before the application were nearly exhausted by excessive labor at task work but afterward followed it up with ease and pleasure  after warm bathing in the winter season the application of a ceroma is very advisable for by rendering the inhalants impervious to the cold air colds are prevented and by closing the orifices of exhalants the dewy nutritious juice and vital heat drawn toward the skin by the bath is then retained which must greatly warm and invigorate the system  an imperfect paralysis in the aged not only arises from a deficiency of vigor and a relaxation of nerves strained and worn by various destroying causes as gluttony ebriety etc but often it is owing to a supineness of the vital principle or the animamedica see the curious and elegant oration of the late learned dr nicholls physician to george the iid on the powers of the anima medica before the college of physicians in london for terror or imminent danger has often been the means of restoring those limbs during the paroxysm of fear that were before useless here then it seems that impotency is not the cause but sloth surely then the natural and best cure must be obtained from exercise friction and stimulating oil  chilly sedentary persons who ill endure the winters cold should frequently use friction and a stimulating oil for it is through debility from want of exertion that the arteries do not propel the fluids with such force as would prove sufficient to distend the exhalants in the skin  a nervous unhappiness with susceptibility of cold is often occasioned by a thick cacochymy of humors not at all inflammatory in this case after proper evacuation it is proper to draw the juices to the surface of the body by light frictions with the aromata so indeed as to promote the due circulation of the blood but not by violent application to encumber the heart and lungs by the reflux of these thick and foul humors the mind of man may be considered figuratively as the axletree round which the wheel of life can best turn for although it may be unconscious of its power yet it works wonders on the solids and fluids of the body rectifying their irregularity and reducing them to moderation or else rendering them inordinate and destructive but if the mind have power over the body so also has the body a wonderworking power over the mind for it is the blood that constitutes the temperament of different persons the red part abounds in the sanguineous whose veins are large and cerulean the head thin of hair the flesh soft and abundant and the cheeks of a rosy color persons of this temperament are fond of pleasure they are soon but not long angry easily persuaded and inconstant  the albumenous part of the blood abounds in the petuitous whose veins are small and almost imperceptible the face pale the flesh abundant but cold and flaccid the mind is usually placid and serene regardful of decorum and of the honestum and of what it ought to do but generally too lazy to exert its powers  when the blood is too concrete having lost its proper fluidity it forms the melancholic temperament the flesh and hair are of a very dark color as among the jews who are commonly of this temperament the head frequently bald the body is very lean and dry the blood vessels dense and thin the mind is constant to its purpose not hasty mindful of injuries and remarkable for earnestness in thinking  from these temperaments are made up the rest as the bilious where the body is thin the color brown the hair black crisp and bushy the veins large the mind intelligent and resolute  the phlegmatic are cold not hairy subject to baldness fat and unweildly liable to tumors the mind sometimes timid generally inoffensive the warm temperament is in body agile and robust well covered with yellow thick and copious pile as the head with hair the angles of the eyes and also the face and lips are of a very red color the pulse full and frequent the mind capable but impetuous  but nevertheless to vindicate the supremacy of the mind over the body it is to be observed that by the medicinal and dietetic art one temperament may be altered in some degree into another so that the pituitous may become sanguineous the sanguineous melancholic et vice versa st paul says i keep my body under and bring it into subjection lest that by any means when i have preached to others i myself should be a cast away   cor ix    undoubtedly the mind can and often does reduce the body to reason by the means of diet and the forbearing virtues hence the use of fasting and religious meditation but here observe that what would stimulate one person say of a hot temperament into passion might only lift up another who is pituitous into reasonable comfort  phlegmatic persons of irritable habits of body whose circulation is weak the blood not being sent in sufficient force to the surface so as in a due degree to promote perspiration and who by their inhalants absorb more moisture from the atmosphere than stronger people should perseveringly use friction if not oil they should also pay particular attention to diet they should avoid sugar and butter which by thickening the juices impedes the circulation instead of eating glary food as pigmeat and fatted calf they should be contented with a more drying and attenuating diet which would prevent alarming portions of lymph from collecting in the lungs or in the joints true indeed it is that although a person be charged with too much lymph he may continue in health but how long these defluxions may remain benign and unhurtful no one can say for also true it is that by the adverse diameters of a very few vessels the juices may soon become stagnant and banefully acrimonious the too abundant lymph should be discharged by drastic purges at long intervals and for diet such as strengthens the elasticity of the fibers should be recommended roast meat roasting except the little that flies off by vapor concentrates the juices of the meat within it giving the meat an empyreumatic and stimulating flavor whereas boiling discharges the gelatinous part and essential oil of the meat into the water rendering it insapid therefore it will not i believe be too much to say that half a pound of roast will afford as much nourishment with a greater stimulus as three quarters of a pound of boiled meat moreover the organs of digestion require fibrous matter to work upon as will appear from the following experiment which i heard was tried by an eminent surgeon in london he confined one large dog to the broth of meat boiled down as we say to rags and another large dog to the ragged meat so boiled down allowing him i suppose a little water to quench his thirst the dog that drank the broth soon became emaciated and died but he that eat the fibers of the meat remained in health and grew fat the old french way of dressing meat with little or no water but with a few vegetables as potatoes in a pan so closely covered or luted as to confine all the vapor or essential oil within is me judice the most palatable and the best mode of cookery   and game are proper fruits if any should be somewhat austere and also the wine say good rough port but ever let this dietetic rule be carefully observed ne quid nemis  wine if medically taken augments the strength of the animal fibers and rarifies the juices of the body but if immoderately drank it excites a universal spasm that ends in weakness and relaxation as the trembling hands and staggering gate of bacchanalians sufficiently evince wine after much use loses its stimulating power hence it is that harddrinkers proceed from bad to worse from wine to the drinking of pure spirit thus destroying their health their reputation and their life for a very transient and miserable satisfaction in general debility brought on by drinking spirituous liquors with loss of appetite it is first advisable for the patient to leave off drinking one fourth of his usual quantity if in a fortnight his appetite somewhat returns let him leave off another fourth part and so every fortnight continue the decrease till the burning potation be totally exchanged for a daily but small quantity of red port wine if indeed the natural powers of digestion be quite destroyed by the means of spirituous liquors then there is but little hope of restoration but wine if moderately taken enables the vessels of the body with increased alacrity to take up and disperse nourishment over the system it is of excellent use after fatigue also in the cure of mental languors and in urgent fears for it not only braces the fibers but it tonifies the mind and therefore it is that soldiers and sailors after a dram of spirituous liquor despise danger and joyously enter into a battle  again pituitous persons who use but little exercise are particularly susceptible of the ill effects of a damp air which although by the thermometer may not be colder than a dry one is more penetrating because it conducts better filling the inhalants with crude noxious vapor hence swellings of the great joints of the limbs are frequent which are mistaken for the gout certainly the best preservatives are strong daily exercise to the point of fatigue so as to sweat a dry cardiac diet frequent friction with ceromata of essential oil to counteract the baneful effects of the atmosphere and such clothing as of wool close to the skin which being a bad conductor will prevent the inhalants from improper absorption by warm clothing we may indeed avoid in part a cold humidity but if we would do so entirely the face and the hands must be also clothed whereas by counteracting the humidity of the air by stimulants and essential oils every good effect will be answered without acquiring the bad habit of too warm clothing   it is also not uncommon for such persons to be troubled with an aqueous not a chyliferous diabetes for by checked exhalation what is not discharged by perspiration and sweat passes through the bladder and their too copious absorption of circumambient fluids doubtless increases the quantity of urine perspiratio ad urinam in aestate est in ratione     in hyeme vero ut     this very common and too unnoticed yet dangerous disease may i think be abated if not entirely cured by the following practice  if it arise from hectic fever mucilages perhaps with acids to correct the hectic are serviceable but if from hysteric or any transitory relaxing causes mucilages and diffusible stimuli are more proper in either case the primae viae should be cleansed first by ipecacuanha then by rhubarb strengtheners and mild astringents should be used a dry binding diet and morning and evening friction in a warm room with a defensive oil against damp weather cold gives additional strength to persons already strong in health because of the reaction of the vital power and because the air may be nearly uncharged with vapor and therefore more of it in a given time is inhaled but cold debilitates very weak and sedentary people because of the want of reaction damp and cold air or damp and hot air is hurtful to all persons because less pure air and too much humidity is inhaled by the skin and lungs certainly the healthiest is the warm and dry atmosphere which ought to be a consideration of some weight to valetudinarians who can afford either to change their residence or to make it comfortable should be earnestly recommended  sometimes cold and damp air shall so relax the nervous system as to deprive the patient of the use of his limbs then a brisk vomit and the application by friction of warm medicated oil on the back bone or on the inert limbs will be of great service  the disease of children called the rickets after discharging the redundant lymph by vomits and detergent doses of rhubarb is to be cured by friction and with woollen cloths properly fumigated  it is not uncommon to see in young sedentary people the skin discolored the muscles lank the face pale and variously disfigured with pustules the spirits generally in a low state and the body sluggish the cure is to excite the perspiratory powers by bodily labor friction roast meat and wine and to heal the face by lenient innoxious liniment  old strains and stubborn pains in the back loins and elsewhere are for the most part curable by friction and medicated oil and even incipient white swellings that would otherwise cripple or render the limb useless are thus to be dispersed and destroyed  dry white scaly eruptions on the elbows and knees even of long standing may be cured by friction and medicated oil when through neglect the hair of the head in children becomes matted and stuck together by a viscid humor that the exhalants cast upon the skin the safest and speediest cure after cutting off the hair is daily to sponge the head with hot water always taking care after spunging to dry the head well with hot cloths and here i must remark that although the cure of the sea scurvy may be obtained by the vegetable acid of oranges and lemons yet i submit to the consideration of the surgeons of the navy whether or not rubbing the oil of the rinds on the diseased parts would not accelerate the cure  after fevers and some chronical diseases the hair of the head falls off either because the skin shrinks and becomes dry through want of nutritious juices or because through diseased relaxation the stabulum of the hair becomes too weak in the first case baldness may be cured by oily liniments in the second good strengtheners of the system will be found most useful  if this publication should serve as a hint to a more enlarged mode of medical practice than the present i shall as a clergyman of the church of england most heartily rejoice as having been the humble means of doing some good to my fellow creatures  it may be necessary here to observe that i had been seven years in holy orders before i became doctor of physic at leyden never thinking it at all improper to blend two very useful professions together and more especially as our blessed lord himself healed the diseases of the body as well as of the soul  indeed i am strongly of opinion as i have elsewhere observed in my philanthropic monitor that the public and private good resulting from such a union of professions would be great and incalculable the unbeneficed clergy being physicians would enlarge the sphere of their usefulness especially amongst the poor people and by accepting moderate fees a visit near the practitioners residence might be rated at halfaguinea if two miles off one guinea and so on in modo journeys in the night and in bad weather when carriages must be hired deserve a larger consideration from the yeomanry and gentry they would soon disentangle themselves from that poverty and distress which is as subversive of their respectability in civilized life as of their deserved comfort  to the public at large the advantages would be very great having able practitioners always near at hand and the present enormous expense of cure so properly cut down as to exclude none from the benefit of good medical advice  if it be said that the clergy would not be so competent in the healing art as the faculty i will ask why not they have the same advantages of learning at oxford and cambridge where there are hospitals as other medical students and if degrees in physic are thought to be particularly honorable from oxford and cambridge surely the competency ought not to be disputed by this union of professions in the clergy as physicians no injury would be done to surgeons apothecaries and chemists nor no injustice to physicians of established fame and practice for if successful they would still retain their patients and even increase the number though possibly they might receive fees more suitable to their respective merit  he
