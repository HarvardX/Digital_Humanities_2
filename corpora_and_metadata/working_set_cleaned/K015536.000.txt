scan thou greatest monarch thou most godlike man or how the frailty of our frame confess when gods distinguished favorites thus transgress the sun adown the steep of heaven had rolled and fringed the purple clouds with skirts of gold when shunning grandeur and the noise of state on the high turrets of the royal seat david the sweets of deep rebellion sought indulging all the luxury of thought on sions mount the cedarfabrick stood the ruined honors of the tyrian wood hence stretched his eye around his large domain and much he joyd him in his ample reign pleased could the present with the past compare the regal glories with the rural care the rural care fair bethlems hill renewed which gently rising in the south he viewed lifes steps from that distinguished day could trace when though the youngest of the sons of jesse he first was destined by the sacred oil to splendid cares and eminence of toil how did he once the bear and lion slay while yet a swain to save the fleecy prey at elah how a beardless stripling dare the grim gigantick terror of the war harsh whizd the sling and with a thundering sound he fell enormous over a length of ground and now resolved he as new scenes he chose how still new labors and new dangers rose to envy doomed a sacrifice to fall how twice he scapd the vengeful hand of saul and how he foiled the proud goliahs arms to merit merabs falsely

youth approved met her new lord and unreservd she loved nor yet was the relentless father won by the true subject or the duteous son the thirsted blood still sought he to attain by fraud by force but fraud and force were vain the faithful michal bad her spouse depart mourned him as sick with all the womans art but through a window secretly conveyed to seek at ramah holy samuels aid  thence fled he the devoted life to save now to adullam now engeddis cave to parans desert or the ziphites wood to woods to caves to deserts saul pursued trusting a foe before a fathers wrath he sought protection in

gath kind akish gave him zicklags town and well the hero merited the boon till saul at gilboa fell and by his side the prince the other half of david died much he the father mourned but more the son he lost a scepter but the friend was gone and now what wars he waged what labors bore ever israels crown at ease the monarch wore employed his thoughts while ishbosheth in vain labored a lineal title to maintain murdered he fell who ill aspired to rule a traitors victim and a partys tool the hated crime the murdrers lives atone and david mounts the uncontested throne amazing toils but now the toils were over and banished sorrow should return no more united israel gloried in his reign and heaven his throne had promised to sustain had destined to a long successive race distinguished glory and peculiar grace sion he sees by his victorious hand the seat of worship and of empire stand the philistines and amleck dread his sword and vanquished edom owns him as her lord moabs proud sons a forced submission bring and syria mourns in blood the rashness of her king before his arms the strength of ammon falls and haughty hanan trembles in his walls repents the insult that his pride returned the friend provoked and proffered kindness scorned feared by his foes by his allies caressed loved by his god and by his people blessed remained there ought to fear or had there been a happier prince among the sons of men unhappily secure untimely vain sincerer ills and heavier griefs remain that hour that ease thou boasts shall hurt thee more than all the injuries in fortunes power a frontier town which crowded forces shield dares thus the gleamy squadrons of the field secure in arms on the high walls they shine while the foes labor in the secret mine till passed the gloomy vaults they rise to air horribly dreadful in the proudest square never felt his soul the sad effects of sin for all was pure and all was calm within tumultuous passion lust deceit despair and black remorse had never harbored there naught feared he from himself nor understood david was yet by david unsubdud now was the hour illfated he must know that vicious pleasures terminate in woe uriahs garden near the palace laid where twining trees a private arbor made yet from aloft the piercing eye might trace with ease the secrets of the dark recess hither a rivulet was taught to glide whose constant store a marble bath supplied and here to bathe about the settingsun the lovely bathsheba retired alone unconscious of a witness she displayed luxuriant beauty in the fraudful shade surveyed each charm that could uriah move and wandered over the mystery of love her comely limbs the curling stream embraced and flowed but limpid flowed around her waste to the kings view her snowy charms were bare he saw her naked and he owned her fair fair  she was wondrous fair  a lot too great for any subjects bliss oh she was heaven  and oh that she were his now through his soul an earnest wish there fled of furtive joys and an adultrous bed the handsbreadth cloud from whence the blackning storm arose to wreck his peace and all his joys deform nor rest nor ease the intruding thought affords till he reveals the secret to his lords the lords officious with a courtly care discharge the message and address the fair in moving terms the kings desires conveyed with too much ease were those desires obeyed soft love invites and proud ambition warms weak woman yields and meets the monarchs arms while these in love the flying hours employ revel secure and give a loose to joy laugh at the ignorance of the injured spouse the violated bed and cancelled vows at rabbahs siege uriah sought applause lavishly valiant in his countrys cause till the sad wantons news the king alarms that she was pregnant by the royal arms now must he be to the false bed beguiled the imagined father of the spurious child for this dispatched a feigned express to bring he leaves the camp attends the lustful king who wanted not credulity to force artful reception and prepared discourse inquired the monarch with designed address the generals welfare and the wars success curious he seemed each circumstance to know the site the strength the number of the foe received the answers with majestic pride forced a kind look and with a smile replied well have thou satisfied our royal care sure of our favor to thy house repair indulge the pleasures of the court awhile a short delay shall give thee back to toil let the rough labors of the warrior cease and taste till then soft love and joyous ease these i adjourn to peace the chief replied ill suit such pleasures with a martial mind the feast luxurious and the flowing bowl unstring the sinews and debase the soul say shall thy soldier the fond wife possess and melt inglorious in the soft caress or press the downy bed in silk enclosed while judah sees her ark in tents exposed and sheathed in arms the youths of israel dare the generous hardships of the toilsome war may heaven so bless thee as i disapprove this dull inaction and unmanly love to him the king  enough is given to fame at least a night domestic sweets may claim till morrows dawn thy purposed have delay and take thy journey with returning day he said  resolved the mirthful feast to prove if ought might fire him to the joys of love at his own table caused the chief to dine and the rich goblet flowed with generous wine in vain the feast was served the goblet flowed and all his arts the wily king bestowed stretched on the lonely couch the night he sped nor sought the pleasures of the nuptial bed he slept  but sleep the royal eyelids fled uriahs death the treacherous king designed and the black thought deep labored in his mind he rose the rash resolve to joab wrote beneath whose care his hosts at rabbah fought to place him where the surest danger lay in the sharp conflict of the doubtful day strict he enjoined till by the foes beset then to retire and leave him to his fate the royal signet closed the dire command and safe consigned it to uriahs hand all heedless of the murderous charge he held early the hero hasted to the field took his last orders with a joyous mind and rushed impatient to the post assigned he charged impetuous till he saw too late the foes surrounding and the friends retreat yet dear resolved the abandoned life to sell greatly he fought as loyally he fell and blessed with the expiring gasp of life the ungrateful sovereign and the faithless wife the monarch heard the news with artful care he blamed the sword unknowing how to spare and undiscerning chance of wasteful war but now avowed his flame the husband dead and took the widow to the royal bed a son she bore and for a transient time inly he joyd at the successful crime absurd mankind when in the ways of ill we for our reason substitute our will fondly secure and indolently gay in the smooth calm of flattering vice we play till over our heads the thunder bursting loud echoes tremendous and proclaims the god thus david found his sanguine hopes recede and all the gaudy dream of pleasure fled when nathan came a venerable sage in the grave majesty of hoary age awful his gesture and his words sincere nor knew he ought to flatter or to fear he bore his gods commission in his look hailed the vain king  and thus the prophet spoke plaintive i come of arbitrary ill the sad encroachment of the lawless will may israels king attend what i relate and say what vengeance meets a crime so great within thy realm a man there dwelt of late blessed with the plenty of a vast estate so large his herds that the increasing breed blackned the vales and lowed in every mead and flocks so numerous were around him spread that scarce he knew the hills on which they fed in the near cottage lived a laboring hind of scanty fortune but an easy mind nor sorrow he nor envy knew though poor a lamb was all his joy and all his store this darling partner of his board and bed with care he nursed with fond indulgence fed bred with his children as a child it fared loved with a parents tenderest regard mean while it chanced that to the neighboring dome an unexpected visitant was come the lordly master for his friends repast nor from the flock nor herd selects the feast his own he spared the little favorite ewe the bosomcomfort of the labrer slew feasting remorseless on a neighbors woe scarce to the finished tale the king suppressed the rising fury of the royal breast incontinent he gave the incensed reply  as the lord lives the man shall surely die the fourfold value of the lamb returned for force injurious and for pity scorned the seer stern anger frowning on his brow replied  the man whom thou condemnst art thou even david thus has sinned  and now prepare the sentence of an angry god to hear by me he cites thy folly and thy pride his goodness slighted and his power defied even thee o king who durst that power disdain raised by my favor from an abject swain i gave thee grace i gave thee strength in war and made thy safety my peculiar care lavishly bountiful i gave thee all the wealth the wives the diadem of saul peace through thy land and smiling plenty flowed foes spoke thee great while subjects spoke thee good these blessings why could judahs king destroy for the short transports of a guilty joy bethink o king for what have thou resigned thy peace thy sweet serenity of mind and raptures which the virtuous soul bestowed conscious of worth and conversant with god for the wild cravings of the vicious will and false appearance of a specious ill pursued with labor purchased with deceit enjoyed with shame and finished with regret nor end the evils of the crime therein lusts but the threshold to the gates of sin this well thou know for thou have found it led to the invasion of the nuptial bed the base deception of the fraudful word and the friend murdered by the hostile sword for this the insatiate sword with endless rage shall haunt thine house and persecute thine age for this thy wives estranged from davids arms shall to thy neighbors bed transfer their charms nor furtive shall like thine their joys be hid the noontide sun shall view the flagrant deed israel the justice of her god shall know who makes the offending crime the offenders woe what wild amazement seized the monarchs breast when vice appeared in all her shame confessed when now no more the glossy varnish shone the wretched mariner conceives alone who far has sailed and at his wished return has through the errors of a misty morn with eager joy imagined land pursued but when the splendour of the sun renewed has madly mourned the dear delusion lost and the ship bulging on the rocky coast he wept his folly and his crime he owned thy death remitted and thy crime atoned thy god declares the prophet said the lord slow to avenge as righteous to reward yet since by this thou did his name expose to the rude license of opprobrious foes since pleas for vice the libertine may bring from this excess of judahs favorite king die shall the child of the adultrous womb fixed is his fate and unreversd the doom thus spoke the seer nor farther would disclose the destined series of the monarchs woes though his prophetic soul in times dark law the scene of future miseries foresaw the royal offspring what black crimes should stain a sister ravished and a brother slain rash amnons death by absalom decreed for beauteous tamars violated bed and david grieving at the impious deed how he the slain and fugitive should mourn until the faithless absalom return return accursed ingratitude to show and plunge him farther in the depth of woe how forced over jordans stream the sire should shun the impious arms of the rebellious son yet in the anguish of a father sad with ashes sprinkled and with sackcloth clad should grieve the conquest that his death must cost and all the rebel in the son be lost farther he saw him destined to sustain a deeper anguish and a keener pain when summoned by the unrelenting seer to the sad choice of famine plague or war how each dire shaft from the almightys bow should pierce his soul with the severest woe while gasping he surveys on every side the guiltless thousands for the monarchs pride oppressed with grief he saw his hoary age by adonijahs plot and factious rage and even in death transmitted with his crown invidious vengeance on his favorite son these he foresaw yet wisely these suppressed safe in the close recesses of his breast for heaven in pity to our state conceals from human view the course of future ills reluctant else would wretched man essay the toilsome journey of the thorny way inly the fortunes of the king he mourned restrained the rising grief and home returned while david in the expiring child beheld the sad prediction of the seer fulfilled apart in bitterness of soul he sat and his repentance as his crime was great let us by his example warned beware of tempting vice and shun the fatal snare or by the frailty of our passions led atone with sorrow for the loathed misdeed on each offense a sad remembrance cast and mend the future as we mourn the past finis
