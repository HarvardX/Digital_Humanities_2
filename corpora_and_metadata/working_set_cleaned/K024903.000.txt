a new essay on the smallpox  price sixpence  a new essay on the smallpox with a view to preserve this nation from the infection of that distemper  humbly addressed to the legislature the physicians and inhabitants of great britain  by   m d  magna voluisse sat est salus populi suprema lex london printed for j roberts near the oxfordarms in warwick lane mdccxxv  a new essay on the smallpox every person is sensible how fatal the disease i insist on has been these late years and perhaps there is not a family in the kingdom that laments not the spoils of it which is sufficient to justify every honest attempt to free the public from such a calamity  i shall not enter into the dispute about inoculation which is now on the carpet by reason what i have in my views is the superseding any occasion for that operation which if it could be obtained must on many accounts be preferred to the general practice of it and render it more safe in the few instances wherein after all it may be esteemed proper  in order to introduce this proposal i think it necessary to observe what gave me the first hint and is the real foundation of it viz that the distemper it self is both of a foreign extract and of a late origin there are some parts of the world entirely unacquainted with it at this day and we are assured one quarter of it viz america was so till the spaniards subdued it when by the infection of a negro this cruel disease spread it self among the natives and has now almost extirpated great and populous clans  the old greek and latin physicians had no idea of this disorder for we have the first descriptions of it from the arabian writers i confess we read of eruptions in fevers and have reason to think these obtained in ancient time i know not whether what we term the chickenpox may not be a proper critical secretion of some humors in children for they often affect them without any previous contagion and are attended with no ill consequence but the moors and arabs who every person knows by their sordid nasty way of living in a hot climate have turned common fevers into plagues have perhaps in the same manner given that malignant contagious efficacy to those mild and natural pustules  from this account of the case it must evidently follow that the distemper i now treat of is one species of a plague and therefore both may and ought in the same manner to be extirpated from the nation  the late experiments of inoculating it confirm this account and at the same time sufficiently demonstrate how small a seed less than the hundredth part of a grain will produce a very plentiful crop it is true this may differ very much in regard of the soil which is a consideration in favor of a practice that allows us a convenient opportunity to prepare the body and to adjust both the quantity and situation of the particles that are thrown into it but why should we generally cultivate after this manner an eastern plant that has made such dreadful havoc among us especially since there is so much reason to question whether we could promise our selves that success if it were universally in use for the contagion must increase in proportion to the subjects whereas on the other hand when the disease has left us the few who on the account of traveling or physic may have leave to go through the operation will run less hazard in it  i confess there will be a difficulty in overcoming popular prejudices in favor of these disorders they esteem them sent of god for the sins of mankind which is a pious account of all our afflictions but when this representation discourages the proper endeavors to remove them it has generally been esteemed in other cases a criminal abuse of the doctrine this is perfectly the case in turkey where for that reason their great towns are no more free from the plague than ours are from the smallpox but i have the pleasure to observe that the articles of the church of england prudently caution us against this construction of the sentence of predestinanation which for curious and carnal persons to have before their eyes is there said to be a great downfall but i leave the management of this argument to our divines  when our people are well reconciled to the religion of the thing there can perhaps be nothing more easy or safe than to deliver us from the infection for the substance of my proposal is but in short to take the method that was insisted on as necessary to deliver us from the plague if it had been imported among us as we apprehended it might from marseilles  the thing is then so far done that i have reason to hope and say a few generations hence would enquire what sort of distemper their ancestors intended by the name of the smallpox and when so great an advantage may be procured by it there can be nothing unkind or difficult only in obliging the attendants and physicians where the smallpox are to perform a sort of quarantain to bury the furniture and purify the houses which is all that will be required and to which they will have sufficient inducement to consent if the loss they sustain by it is but supported by the public i know not whether an office of insurance might not be established for that purpose but this will be the care of the legislature if our physicians do but come into the scheme they are the only persons that will suffer in a profitable branch of their practice but whatever some impudent quacks may have in their view i have the assurance to say the gentlemen of the faculty upon the principles of the new philosophy and the best experience will esteem this proposal worthy their consideration they know very well that when the eruption is completed and the putrid particles have fixed on the lungs and vital parts the event must be left to nature for there is little room for the exercise of the best skill and upon that account they must be pleased with an expedient that will secure their art from the trials that are vain in themselves and often fatal to their reputation as for the scandal of our profession the men who have no comfort but in filth and ordure and are only caterers for the worms i am not ashamed to confess i have showed no regard to their mercenary ends  it is to the very learned and worthybody i submit this proposal who will i am persuaded at least honorably treat a plan that is formed upon the practice of some of the ancient physicians the fathers and first ornaments of this science who did not only consult particular cases but delivered whole nations at once from plagues if the method i have suggested appears to them as well calculated for this purpose as it is honestly designed i have no reason to doubt the approbation of persons of such a generous and genteel education and whose business is the health of the people  i know the fate of this scheme will depend on their representation of it and therefore by reason the royal college of physicians are best qualified to direct the execution i have not presumed to offer the particular rules that must be observed and that will require the sanction of the legislature it is what i do not doubt they will favor their country with if this proposal is so happy as to come recommended by them  his most sacred majesty whom god long preserve and their royal highnesses though they are now in no pain for the princes the young hopes and joys of these realms they have too much regard for their people not to encourage every thing that may make them happy and healthful  and i hope our nobility and gentry will esteem it too much a common interest to neglect this proposal if there is a prospect as i think there is a very good one in this way of being secure from this distemper and at the same time from a train of evils and ulcers that generally attend the worst sort of it for why should we cherish the cruel brood of africa or asia in our bowels that have made those frightful ravages among us and entail this poison on our posterity that was perhaps the import of our holy wars in former days  how great must be the happiness to observe the new scenes arise when a noisome plague shall cease to change our countenances and send us away or to make us a terror to our selves and others how desirable would it be no more unless by the special commission of heaven to feel any of the fury of it filling our graves or spoiling our features we should not then so frequently meet the dismal scars and indelible characters it has left on almost every face but britain no longer inhabited by these sort of picts would become fair albion once again  then to use the sacred style may our sons be as plants grown up in their youth they will always carry their first bloom and our daughters as cornerstones polished after the similitude of a palace or in our language more smooth and sparkling than the bestwrought marble then would all the domestic virtues flourish the beautiful mothers secure of the affection of their husbands would convey the healthy treasure to their offspring the ladies would shine in our assemblies and the gentlemen soften under their influence into every virtue let future ages tell the rest with joy  full of this project i cannot forbear imaging to my self the acknowledgments of a whole island and every person in it contributing to make my life easy and happy who have in this proposal studied to make theirs so  postscript when i wrote this scheme i was very sensible of some considerable objections which a learned gentleman who is a glory to the profession did me the honor to make to it as that the seeds of the smallpox are almost in every house which has made it the disease of the country but how much soever they are naturalized to the soil and have diffused themselves in it i have reason to hope care and industry might surmount this difficulty for the particles appear by their slow operation not to have that life and action which those have which constitute the plague if every house therefore in great britain that is suspected would but submit to such a purification as the inspired lawgiver i had almost said physician prescribed in another species of a plague levit xiii       etc and xiv    etc we might observe the happy effects of it not only in destroying the vegetation of the seeds of this distemper but of some others which subsist in rags and dirt in general it must render the nation more clean and healthful and why should not a divine law as far as it relates immediately to health lay us under a moral obligation now where there is any parity in the case as i apprehend in the present our critics may observe with pleasure the arabian physicians apply to the smallpox some of the terms which occur in the arabic version of these chapters if it is said the priests were to execute the sacred order it is because they were the ancient physicians but it is not my business here to consider the typical use of it  i apprehend it will be urged that after all this care when they are extirpated in one place they may possibly break out in another it is what may be expected for some time and will only require a more constant attendance on this distemper through the whole island in which this advantage will probably be gained that whenever it does sprout in any quarter there will be the greatest reason to expect where the soil is not too favorable if i may be allowed to pursue a figure that will best explain it to the common reader it will be a weak and tender shoot which we may easily weed out and not one rank crop upon another as we sometimes experience now  as for the time that will be required to accomplish all this it cannot be supposed i should presume to determine it for our physicians know it was several years before we were rid of the last plague it is sufficient that the affair is of so much consequence that the children who are yet unborn demand our attention to it  the greatest objection is from the prejudices of the people who are inclined to think every abridgment of their liberty though it is for their advantage inhuman and barbarous but in this instance i know not how it is persons of quality and fortune and very many of the populace are almost come into this practice of themselves from their own observations and reasonings upon the head the husband and wife we have seen content to live apart for a time or if they are determined against it they might perhaps be indulged to perform the quarantain together  the jews as stiffneckd and rebellious a people as they are represented in the holy writings had so much regard to their health as to submit to a much severer regimen for there is a vast difference between a separation from society for a few days which is all this scheme requires and theirs which in some cases continued for life  i cannot doubt the worthy and learned college of physicians if they came into the proposal would take care to direct the execution of it to a general satisfaction and upon this account if the legislature made them a sort of office of insurance the contributions they would receive from the whole nation and the voluntary benefactions of very many to whose families this distemper has been fatal would i am persuaded render them very capable of discharging that service by their agents with great applause i might suggest the pleasure they must have by that correspondence this would establish to observe the state of diseases and physic through the whole nation and to direct the practice of it in this instance which last is a consideration of too much weight not to be offered to the public for if any thing can it must reconcile every person to this proposal that he and his relations though they are the meanest of the people among whom this distemper generally lodges will have proper medicines and attendance and become the care of the most learned body of physicians in the world  finis
