subject it may be of use that i suggest some things concerning the properest means of improvement in the art of public speaking and the most necessary studies for that purpose  to be an eloquent speaker in the proper sense of the word is far from being either a common or an easy attainment indeed to compose a florid harangue on some popular topic and to deliver it so as to amuse an audience is a matter not very difficult but though some praise be due to this yet the idea which i have endeavored to give of eloquence is much higher it is a great exertion of the human powers it is the art of being persuasive and commanding the art not of pleasing the fancy merely but of speaking both to the understanding and to the heart of interesting the hearers in such a degree as to seize and carry them along with us and to leave them with a deep and strong impression of what they have heard how many talents natural and acquired must concur for carrying this to perfection a strong lively and warm imagination quick sensibility of heart joined with solid judgment good sense and presence of mind all improved by great and long attention to style and composition and supported also by the exterior yet important qualifications of a graceful manner a presence not ungainly and a full and tuneable voice how little reason to wonder that a perfect and accomplished orator should be one of the characters that is most rarely to be found  let us not despair however between mediocrity and perfection there is a very wide interval there are many intermediate spaces which may be filled up with honor and the more rare and difficult that complete perfection is the greater is the honor of approaching to it though we do not fully attain it the number of orators who stand in the highest class is perhaps smaller than the number of poets who are foremost in poetic fame but the study of oratory has this advantage above that of poetry that in poetry one must be an eminently good performer or he is not supportable  mediocribus esse poetis non homines non di non concessere columnae for god and man and lettered post denies that poets ever are of middling size francis  in eloquence this does not hold there one may possess a moderate station with dignity eloquence admits of a great many different forms plain and simple as well as high and pathetic and a genius that cannot reach the latter may shine with much reputation and usefulness in the former  whether nature or art contribute most to form an orator is a trifling enquiry in all seize whatever nature must be the prime agent she must bestow the original talents she must sow the seeds but culture is requisite for bringing those seeds to perfection nature must always have done somewhat but a great deal will always be left to be done by art this is certain that study and discipline are more necessary for the improvement of natural genius in oratory than they are in poetry what i mean is that though poetry be capable of receiving assistance from critical art yet a poet without any aid from art by the force of genius alone can rise higher than a public speaker can do who has never given attention to the rules of style composition and delivery homer formed himself demosthenes and cicero were formed by the help of much labor and of many assistances derived from the labor of others after these preliminary observations let us proceed to the main design of this lecture to consider of the means to be used for improvement in eloquence  in the first place what stands highest in the order of means is personal character and disposition in order to be a truly eloquent or persuasive speaker nothing is more necessary than to be a virtuous man this was a favorite position among the ancient rhetoricians non posse oratorem esse nisi virum bonum to find any such connection between virtue and one of the highest liberal arts must give pleasure and it can i think be clearly shown that this is not a mere topic of declamation but that the connection here alleged is undoubtedly founded in truth and reason  for consider first whether any thing be more essential to persuasion than the opinion which we entertain of the probity disinterestedness candor and other good moral qualities of the person who endeavors to persuade these give weight and force to every thing which he utters nay they add a beauty to it they dispose us to listen with attention and pleasure and create a secret partiality in favor of that side which he espouses whereas if we entertain a suspicion of craft and disingenuity of a corrupt or a base mind in the speaker his eloquence loses all its real effect it may entertain and amuse but it is viewed as artifice as trick as the play only of speech and viewed in this light whom can it persuade we even read a book with more pleasure when we think favorably of its author but when we have the living speaker before our eyes addressing us personally on some subject of importance the opinion we entertain of his character must have a much more powerful effect  but lest it should be said that this relates only to the character of virtue which one may maintain without being at bottom a truly worthy man i must observe farther that besides the weight which it adds to character real virtue operates also in other ways to the advantage of eloquence  first nothing is so favorable as virtue to the prosecution of honorable studies it prompts a generous emulation to excel it inures to industry it leaves the mind vacant and free master of itself disencumbered of those bad passions and disengaged from those mean pursuits which have ever been found the greatest enemies to true proficiency quinctilian has touched this consideration very properly quod si agrorum nimia cura et sollicitior rei familiaris diligentia et venandi voluptas and dati spectaculis dies multum studiis auferunt quid putamus facturas cupiditatem avaritiam invidiam nihil enim est tam occupatum tam multiforme tot ac tam variis affectibus concisum atque laceratum quam mala ac improba mens quis inter haec literis aut ulli bonae arti locus non hercle magis quam frugibus in terra sentibus ac rubis occupata if the management of an estate if anxious attention to domestic economy a passion for hunting or whole days given up to public places and amusements consume so much time that is due to study how much greater waste must be occasioned by licentious desires avarice or envy nothing is so much hurried and agitated so contradictory to itself or so violently torn and shattered by conflicting passions as a bad heart amidst the distractions which it produces what room is left for the cultivation of letters or the pursuit of any honorable art no more assuredly than there is for the growth of corn in a field that is overrun with thorns and brambles   but besides this consideration there is another of still higher importance though i am not sure of its being attended to as much as it deserves namely that from the fountain of real and genuine virtue are drawn those sentiments which will ever be most powerful in affecting the hearts of others bad as the world is nothing has so great and universal a command over the minds of men as virtue no kind of language is so generally understood and so powerfully felt as the native language of worthy and virtuous feelings he only therefore who possesses these full and strong can speak properly and in its own language to the heart on all great subjects and occasions there is a dignity there is an energy in noble sentiments which is overcoming and irresistible they give an ardour and a flame to ones discourse which seldom fails to kindle a like flame in those who hear and which more than any other cause bestows on eloquence that power for which it is famed of seizing and transporting an audience here art and imitation will not avail an assumed character conveys nothing of this powerful warmth it is only a native and unaffected glow of feeling which can transmit the emotion to others hence the most renowned orators such as cicero and demosthenes were no less distinguished for some of the high virtues as public spirit and zeal for their country than for eloquence beyond doubt to these virtues their eloquence owed much of its effect and those orations of theirs in which there breathes most of the virtuous and magnanimous spirit are those which have most attracted the admiration of ages  nothing therefore is more necessary for those who would excel in any of the higher kinds of oratory than to cultivate habits of the several virtues and to refine and improve all their moral feelings whenever these become dead or callous they may be assured that on every great occasion they will speak with less power and less success the sentiments and dispositions particularly requisite for them to cultivate are the following the love of justice and order and indignation at insolence and oppression the love of honesty and truth and detestation of fraud meanness and corruption magnanimity of spirit the love of liberty of their country and the public zeal for all great and noble designs and reverence for all worthy and heroic characters a cold and skeptical turn of mind is extremely adverse to eloquence and no less so is that cavilling disposition which takes pleasure in depreciating what is great and ridiculing what is generally admired such a disposition bespeaks one not very likely to excel in any thing but least of all in oratory a true orator should be a person of generous sentiments of warm feelings and of a mind turned toward the admiration of all those great and high objects which mankind are naturally formed to admire joined with the manly virtues he should at the same time possess strong and tender sensiblity to all the injuries distresses and sorrows of his fellow creatures a heart that can easily relent that can readily enter into the circumstances of others and can make their case his own a proper mixture of courage and of modesty must also be studied by every public speaker modesty is essential it is always and justly supposed to be a concomitant of merit and every appearance of it is winning and prepossessing but modesty ought not to run into excessive timidity every public speaker should be able to rest somewhat on himself and to assume that air not of selfcomplacency but of firmness which bespeaks a consciousness of his being thoroughly persuaded of the truth or justice of what he delivers a circumstance of no small consequence for making impression on those who hear  next to moral qualifications what in the second place is most necessary to an orator is a fund of knowledge much is this inculcated by cicero and quinctilian quod omnibus disciplinis et artibus debet esse instructus orator by which they mean that he ought to have what we call a liberal education and to be formed by a regular study of philosophy and the polite arts we must never forget that scribendi recte sapere est and principium and sons good sense and knowledge are the foundation of all good speaking there is no art that can teach one to be eloquent in any sphere without a sufficient acquaintance with what belongs to that sphere or if there were an art that made such pretensions it would be mere quackery like the pretensions of the sophists of old to teach their disciples to speak for and against every subject and would be deservedly exploded by all wise men attention to style to composition and all the arts of speech can only assist an orator in setting off to advantage the stock of materials which he possesses but the stock the materials themselves must be brought from other quarters than from rhetoric he who is to plead at the bar must make himself thoroughly master of the knowledge of the law of all the learning and experience that can be useful in his profession for supporting a cause or convincing a judge he who is to speak from the pulpit must apply himself closely to the study of divinity of practical religion of morals of human nature that he may be rich in all the topics both of instruction and of persuasion he who would fit himself for being a member of the supreme council of the nation or of any public assembly must be thoroughly acquainted with the business that belongs to such assembly he must study the forms of court the course of procedure and must attend minutely to all the facts that may be the subject of question or deliberation  besides the knowledge that properly belongs to that profession to which he addicts himself a public speaker if ever he expects to be eminent must make himself acquainted as far as his necessary occupations allow with the general circle of polite literature the study of poetry may be useful to him on many occasions for embellishing his style for suggesting lively images or agreeable allusions the study of history may be still more useful to him as the knowledge of facts of eminent characters and of the course of human affairs finds place on many occasions imprimis vero abundare debet orator exemplorum copia cum veterum tum etiam novorum adeo ut non modo quae conscripta sunt historiis aut sermonibus velut per manus tradita quaeque quotidie aguntur debeat nosse verum ne ea quidem quae a clarioribus poetis sunt ficta negligere quinct l xii cap    there are few great occasions of public speaking in which one will not derive assistance from cultivated taste and extensive knowledge they will often yield him materials for proper ornament sometimes for argument and real use a deficiency of knowledge even in subjects that belong not directly to his own profession will expose him to many disadvantages and give better qualified rivals a great superiority over him  allow me to recommend in the third place not only the attainment of useful knowledge but a habit of application and industry without this it is impossible to excel in any thing we must not imagine that it is by a sort of mushroom growth that one can rise to be a distinguished pleader or preacher or speaker in any assembly it is not by starts of application or by a few years preparation of study afterward discontinued that eminence can be attained no it can be attained only by means of regular industry grown up into a habit and ready to be exerted on every occasion that calls for industry this is the fixed law of our nature and he must have a very high opinion of his own genius indeed that can believe himself an exception to it a very wise law of our nature it is for industry is in truth the great condimentum the seasoning of every pleasure without which life is doomed to languish nothing is so great an enemy both to honorable seize and to the real to the brisk and spirited enjoyment of life as that relaxed state of mind which arises from indolence and dissipation one that is destined to excel in any art especially in the arts of speaking and writing will be known by this more than by any other mark whatever an enthusiasm for that art an enthusiasm which firing his mind with the object he has in view will dispose him to relish every labor which the means require it was this that characterised the great men of antiquity it is this which must distinguish the moderns who would tread in their steps this honorable enthusiasm it is highly necessary for such as are studying oratory to cultivate if youth wants it manhood will flag miserably  in the fourth place attention to the best models will contribute greatly toward improvement every one who speaks or writes should indeed endeavor to have somewhat that is his own that is peculiar to himself and that characterises his composition and style slavish imitation depresses genius or rather betrays the want of it but withal there is no genius so original but may be profited and assisted by the aid of proper examples in style composition and delivery they always open some new ideas they serve to enlarge and correct our own they quicken the current of thought and excite emulation  much indeed will depend upon the right choice of models which we purpose to imitate and supposing them rightly chosen a farther care is requisite of not being seduced by a blind universal admiration for decipit exemplar vitiis imitabile even in the most finished models we can select it must not be forgotten that there are always some things improper for imitation we should study to acquire a just conception of the peculiar characteristic beauties of any writer or public speaker and imitate these only one ought never to attach himself too closely to any single model for he who does so is almost sure of being seduced into a faulty and affected imitation his business should be to draw from several the proper ideas of perfection living examples of public speaking in any kind it will not be expected that i should here point out as to the writers ancient and modern from whom benefit may be derived in forming composition and style i have spoken so much of them in former lectures that it is needless to repeat what i have said of their virtues and defects i own it is to be regretted that the english language in which there is much good writing furnishes us however with but very few recorded examples of eloquent public speaking among the french there are more saurin bourdaloue flechier massillon particularly the last are eminent for the eloquence of the pulpit but the most nervous and sublime of all their orators is bossuet the famous bishop of meaux in whose oraisons funebres there is a very high spirit of oratory the criticism which mr crevier author of rhetorique francoise passes upon these writers whom i have abovenamed is bossuet est grande mais inegal flechier est plus egal mais moins eleve and souvent trop fleuri bourdaloue est solid and judicieux mais il neglige les graces legeres massillon est plus rich en images mais moins fort en raisonnement je souhaite donc que lorateur ne se content dans limitation dun seul de ces modeles mais quil tache de reunir en lui toutes leurs differentes vertus vol ii chap derniere  some of fontenelles harangues to the french academy are elegant and agreeable and at the bar the printed pleadings of cochin and daguesseau are highly extolled by the late french critics  there is one observation which it is of importance to make concerning imitation of the style of any favorite author when we would carry his style into public speaking we must attend to a very material distinction between written and spoken language these are in truth two different manners of communicating ideas a book that is to be read requires one sort of style a man that is to speak must use another in books we look for correctness precision all redundancies pruned all repetitions avoided language completely polished speaking admits a more easy copious style and less fettered by rule repetitions may often be necessary parentheses may sometimes be graceful the same thought must often be placed in different views as the hearers can catch it only from the mouth of the speaker and have not the advantage as in reading a book of turning back again and of dwelling on what they do not fully comprehend hence the style of many good authors would appear stiff affected and even obscure if by too close an imitation we should transfer it to a popular oration how awkward for example would lord shaftsburys sentences sound in the mouth of a public speaker some kinds of public discourse it is true such as that of the pulpit where more exact preparation and more studied style are admitted would bear such a manner better than others which are expected to approach more to extemporaneous speaking but still there is in general so much difference between speaking and composition designed only to be read as should guard us against a close and injudicious imitation  some authors there are whose manner of writing approaches nearer to the style of speaking than others and who therefore can be imitated with more safety in this class among the english authors are dean swift and lord bolingbroke the dean throughout all his writings in the midst of much correctness maintains the easy natural manner of an unaffected speaker and this is one of his chief excellencies lord bolingbrokes style is more splendid and more declamatory than dean swifts but still it is the style of one who speaks or rather who harangues indeed all his political writings for it is to them only and not to his philosophical ones that this observation can be applied carry much more the appearance of one declaiming with warmth in a great assembly than of one writing in a closet in order to be read by others they have all the copiousness the fervor the inculcating method that is allowable and graceful in an orator perhaps too much of it for a writer and it is to be regretted as i have formerly observed that the matter contained in them should have been so trivial or so false for from the manner and style considerable advantage might be reaped  in the fifth place besides attention to the best models frequent exercise both in composing and speaking will be admitted to be a necessary mean of improvement that sort of composition is doubtless most useful which relates to the profession or kind of public speaking to which persons addict themselves this they should keep ever in their eye and be gradually inuring themselves to it but let me also advise them not to allow themselves in negligent composition of any kind he who has it for his aim to write or to speak correctly should in the most trivial kind of composition in writing a letter nay even in common discourse study to acquit himself with propriety i do not at all mean that he is never to write or to speak a word but in elaborate and artificial language this would form him to a stiffness and affectation worse by ten thousand degrees than the greatest negligence but it is to be observed that there is in every thing a manner which is becoming and has propriety and opposite to it there is a clumsy and faulty performance of the same thing the becoming manner is very often the most light and seemingly careless manner but it requires taste and attention to seize the just idea of it that idea when acquired we should keep in our eye and form upon it whatever we write or say  exercises of speaking have always been recommended to students in order that they may prepare themselves for speaking in public and on real business the meetings or societies into which they sometimes form themselves for this purpose are laudable institutions and under proper conduct may serve many valuable purposes they are favorable to knowledge and study by giving occasion to enquiries concerning those subjects which are made the ground of discussion they produce emulation and gradually inure those who are concerned in them to somewhat that resembles a public assembly they accustom them to know their own powers and to acquire a command of themselves in speaking and what is perhaps the greatest advantage of all they give them a facility and fluency of expression and assist them in procuring that copia verborum which can be acquired by no other means but frequent exercise in speaking  but the meetings which i have now in my eye are to be understood of those academical associations where a moderate number of young gentlemen who are carrying on their studies and are connected by some affinity in the future pursuits which they have in view assemble privately in order to improve one another and to prepare themselves for those public exhibitions which may afterward fall to their lot as for those public and promiscuous societies in which multitudes are brought together who are often of low stations and occupations who are joined by no common bond of union except an absurd rage for public speaking and have no other object in view but to make a show of their supposed talents they are institutions not merely of an useless but of an hurtful nature they are in great hazard of proving seminaries of licentiousness petulance faction and folly they mislead those who in their own callings might be useful members of society into fantastic plans of making a figure on subjects which divert their attention from their proper business and are widely remote from their sphere in life  even the allowable meetings into which students of oratory form themselves stand in need of direction in order to render them useful if their subjects of discourse be improperly chosen if they maintain extravagant or indecent topics if they indulge themselves in loose and flimsy declamation which has no foundation in good sense or accustom themselves to speak pertly on all subjects without due preparation they may improve one another in petulance but in no other thing and will infallibly form themselves to a very faulty and vicious taste in speaking i would therefore advise all who are members of such societies in the first place to attend to the choice of their subjects that they be useful and manly either formed on the course of their studies or on something that has relation to morals and taste to action and life in the second place i would advise them to be temperate in the practice of speaking not to speak too often nor on subjects where they are ignorant or unripe but only when they have proper materials for a discourse and have digested and thought of the subject beforehand in the third place when they do speak they should study always to keep good sense and persuasion in view rather than an ostentation of eloquence and for this end i would in the fourth place repeat the advice which i gave in a former lecture that they should always choose that side of the question to which in their own judgment they are most inclined as the right and the true side and defend it by such arguments as seem to them most solid by these means they will take the best method of forming themselves gradually to a manly correct and persuasive manner of speaking  it now only remains to enquire of what use may the study of critical and rhetorical writers be for improving one in the practice of eloquence these are certainly not to be neglected and yet i dare not say that much is to be expected from them for professed writers on public speaking we must look chiefly amongst the ancients in modern times for reasons which were before given popular eloquence as an art has never been very much the object of study it has not the same powerful effects now that it had in more democratical states and therefore has not been cultivated with the same care among the moderns though there has been a great deal of good criticism on the different kinds of writing yet much has not been attempted on the subject of eloquence or public discourse and what has been given us of that kind has been drawn mostly from the ancients such a writer as joannes gerardus vossius who has gathered into one heap of ponderous lumber all the trifling as well as the useful things that are to be found in the greek and roman writers is enough to disgust one with the study of eloquence among the french there has been more attempted on this subject than among the english the bishop of cambrays writings on eloquence i before mentioned with honor rollin batteaux crevier gibert and several other french critics have also written on oratory but though some of them may be useful none of them are so considerable as to deserve particular recommendation  it is to the original ancient writers that we must chiefly have recourse and it is a reproach to any one whose profession calls him to speak in public to be unacquainted with them in all the ancient rhetorical writers there is indeed this defect that they are too systematical as i formerly showed they aim at doing too much at reducing rhetoric to a complete and perfect art which may even supply invention with materials on every subject insomuch that one would imagine they expected to form an orator by rule in as mechanical a manner as one would form a carpenter whereas all that can in truth be done is to give openings for assisting and enlightening taste and for pointing out to genius the course it ought to hold  aristotle laid the foundation for all that was afterward written on the subject that amazing and comprehensive genius which does honor to human nature and which gave light into so many different sciences has investigated the principles of rhetoric with great penetration aristotle appears to have been the first who took rhetoric out of the hands of the sophists and introduced reasoning and good sense into the art some of the profoundest things which have been written on the passions and manners of men are to be found in his treatise on rhetoric though in this as in all his writings his great brevity often renders him obscure succeeding greek rhetoricians most of whom are now lost improved on the foundation which aristotle had laid two of them still remain demetrius phalereus and dionysius of halicarnassus both write on the construction of sentences and deserve to be perused especially dionysius who is a very accurate and judicious critic  i need scarcely recommend the rhetorical writings of cicero whatever on the subject of eloquence comes from so great an orator must be worthy of attention his most considerable work on this subject is that de oratore in three books none of ciceros writings are more highly finished than this treatise the dialogue is polite the characters are well supported and the conduct of the whole is beautiful and agreeable it is indeed full of digressions and his rules and observations may be thought sometimes too vague and general useful things however may be learned from it and it is no small benefit to be made acquainted with ciceros own idea of eloquence the orator ad m brutum is also a considerable treatise and in general throughout all ciceros rhetorical works there run those high and sublime ideas of eloquence which are fitted both for forming a just taste and for creating that enthusiasm for the art which is of the greatest consequence for excelling in it  but of all the ancient writers on the subject of oratory the most instructive and most useful is quinctilian i know few books which abound more with good sense and discover a greater degree of just and accurate taste than quinctilians institutions almost all the principles of good criticism are to be found in them he has digested into excellent order all the ancient ideas concerning rhetoric and is at the same time himself an eloquent writer though some parts of his work contain too much of the technical and artificial system then in vogue and for that reason may be thought dry and tedious yet i would not advise the omitting to read any part of his institutions to pleaders at the bar even these technical parts may prove of some use seldom has any person of more sound and distinct judgment than quinctilian applied himself to the study of the art of oratory  lecture xxxv comparative merit of the ancients and the moderns  historical writing i have now finished that part of the course which respected oratory or public speaking and which as far as the subject allowed i have endeavored to form into some sort of system it remains that i enter on the consideration of the most distinguished kinds of composition both in prose and verse and point out the principles of criticism relating to them this part of the work might easily be drawn out to a great length but i am sensible that critical discussions when they are pursued too far become both trifling and tedious i shall study therefore to avoid unnecessary prolixity and hope at the same time to omit nothing that is very material under the several heads  i shall follow the same method here which i have all along pursued and without which these lectures could not be entitled to any attention that is i shall freely deliver my own opinion on every subject regarding authority no farther than as it appears to me founded on good sense and reason in former lectures as i have often quoted several of the ancient classics for their beauties so i have also sometimes pointed out their defects hereafter i shall have occasion to do the same when treating of their writings under more general heads it may be fit therefore that before proceeding farther i make some observations on the comparative merit of the ancients and the moderns in order that we may be able to ascertain rationally upon what foundation that deference rests which has so generally been paid to the ancients these observations are the more necessary as this subject has given rise to no small controversy in the republic of letters and they may with propriety be made now as they will serve to throw light on some things i have afterward to deliver concerning different kinds of composition  it is a remarkable phenomenon and one which has often employed the speculations of curious men that writers and artists most distinguished for their parts and genius have generally appeared in considerable numbers at a time some ages have been remarkably barren in them while at other periods nature seems to have exerted herself with a more than ordinary effort and to have poured them forth with a profuse fertility various reasons have been assigned for this some of the moral causes lie obvious such as favorable circumstances of government and of manners encouragement from great men emulation excited among the men of genius but as these have been thought inadequate to the whole effect physical causes have been also assigned and the abbe du bos in his reflections on poetry and painting has collected a great many observations on the influence which the air the climate and other such natural causes may be supposed to have upon genius but whatever the causes be the fact is certain that there have been certain periods or ages of the world much more distinguished than others for the extraordinary productions of genius  learned men have marked out four of these happy ages the first is the grecian age which commenced near the time of the peloponnesian war and extended till the time of alexander the great within which period we have herodotus thucydides xenophon socrates plato aristotle demosthenes aeschines lysias isocrates pindar aeschylus euripides sophocles aristophanes menander anacreon theocritus lysippus apelles phidias praxiteles the second is the roman age included nearly within the days of julius caesar and augustus affording us catullus lucretius terence virgil horace tibullus propertius ovid phaedrus caesar cicero livy sallust varro and vitruvius the third age is that of the restoration of learning under the popes julius ii and leo x when flourished ariosto tasso sannazarius vida machiavel guicciardini davila erasmus paul jovius michael angelo raphael titian the fourth comprehends the age of louis the xiv and queen anne when flourished in france corneille racine de retz moliere boileau fontaine baptiste rousseau bossuet fenelon bourdaloue pascall malebranche massillon bruyere bail fontenelle vertot and in england dryden pope addison prior swift parnell congreve otway young row atterbury shaftsbury bolingbroke tillotson temple boil lock newton clark  when we speak comparatively of the ancients and the moderns we generally mean by the ancients such as lived in the two first of these periods including also one or two who lived more early as homer in particular and by the moderns those who flourished in the two last of these ages including also the eminent writers down to our own times any comparison between these two classes of writers cannot be other than vague and loose as they comprehend so many and of such different kinds and degrees of genius but the comparison is generally made to turn by those who are fond of making it upon two or three of the most distinguished in each class with much heat it was agitated in france between boileau and mad dacier on the one hand for the ancients and perrault and la motte on the other for the moderns and it was carried to extremes on both sides to this day among men of taste and letters we find a learning to one or other side a few reflections may throw light upon the subject and enable us to discern upon what grounds we are to rest our judgment in this controversy  if any one at this day in the eighteenth century takes upon him to decry the ancient classics if he pretends to have discovered that homer and virgil are poets of inconsiderable merit and that demosthenes and cicero are not great orators we may boldly venture to tell such a man that he is come too late with his discovery the reputation of such writers is established upon a foundation too solid to be now shaken by any arguments whatever for it is established upon the almost universal taste of mankind proved and tried throughout the succession of so many ages imperfections in their works he may indeed point out passages that are faulty he may show for where is the human work that is perfect but if he attempts to discredit their works in general or to prove that the reputation which they have gained is on the whole unjust there is an argument against him which is equal to full demonstration he must be in the wrong for human nature is against him in matters of taste such as poetry and oratory to whom does the appeal lie where is the standard and where the authority of the last decision where is it to be looked for but as i formerly showed in those feelings and sentiments that are found on the most extensive examination to be the common sentiments and feelings of men these have been fully consulted on this head the public the unprejudiced public has been tried and appealed to for many centuries and throughout almost all civilized nations it has pronounced its verdict it has given its sanction to those writers and from this tribunal there lies no farther appeal  in matters of mere reasoning the world may be long in an error and may be convinced of the error by stronger reasonings when produced positions that depend upon science upon knowledge and matters of fact may be overturned according as science and knowledge are enlarged and new matters of fact are brought to light for this reason a system of philosophy receives no sufficient sanction from its antiquity or long currency the world as it grows older may be justly expected to become if not wiser at least more knowing and supposing it doubtful whether aristotle or newton were the greater genius yet newtons philosophy may prevail over aristotles by means of later discoveries to which aristotle was a stranger but nothing of this kind holds as to matters of taste which depend not on the progress of knowledge and science but upon sentiment and feeling it is in vain to think of undeceiving mankind with respect to errors committed here as in philosophy for the universal feeling of mankind is the natural feeling and because it is the natural it is for that reason the right feeling the reputation of the iliad and the aeneid must therefore stand upon sure ground because it has stood so long though that of the aristotelian or platonic philosophy every one is at liberty to call in question  it is in vain also to allege that the reputation of the ancient poets and orators is owing to authority to pedantry and to the prejudices of education transmitted from age to age these it is true are the authors put into our hands at schools and colleges and by that means we have now an early prepossession in their favor but how came they to gain the possession of colleges and schools plainly by the high fame which these authors had among their own cotemporaries for the greek and latin were not always dead languages there was a time when homer and virgil and horace were viewed in the same light as we now view dryden pope and addison it is not to commentators and universities that the classics are indebted for their fame they became classics and schoolbooks in consequence of the high admiration which was paid them by the best judges in their own country and nation as early as the days of juvenal who wrote under the reign of domitian we find virgil and horace become the standard books in the education of youth quot stabant pueri cum totus decolor esset flaccus and haereret nigro fuligo maroni sat   then thou art bound to smell on either hand as many stinking lamps as schoolboys stand when horace could not read in his own sullied book and virgils sacred page was all besmeared with smoke dryden   from this general principle then of the reputation of great ancient classics being so early so lasting so universal among all the most polished nations we may justly and boldly infer that their reputation cannot be wholly unjust but must have a solid foundation in the merit of their writings  let us guard however against a blind and implicit veneration for the ancients in every thing i have opened the general principle which must go far in instituting a fair comparison between them and the moderns whatever superiority the ancients may have had in point of genius yet in all arts where the natural progress of knowledge has had room to produce any considerable effects the moderns cannot but have some advantage the world may in certain respects be considered as a person who must needs gain somewhat by advancing in years its improvements have not i confess been always in proportion to the centuries that have passed over it for during the course of some ages it has sunk as into a total lethargy yet when roused from that lethargy it has generally been able to avail itself more or less of former discoveries at intervals there arose some happy genius who could both improve on what had gone before and invent something new with the advantage of a proper stock of materials an inferior genius can make greater progress than a much superior one to whom these materials are wanting  hence in natural philosophy astronomy chemistry and other sciences that depend on an extensive knowledge and observation of facts modern philosophers have an unquestionable superiority over the ancient i am inclined also to think that in matters of pure reasoning there is more precision among the moderns than in some instances there was among the ancients owing perhaps to a more extensive literary intercourse which has improved and sharpened the faculties of men in some studies too that relate to taste and fine writing which is our object the progress of society must in equity be admitted to have given us some advantages for instance in history there is certainly more political knowledge in several european nations at present than there was in ancient greece and rome we are better acquainted with the nature of government because we have seen it under a greater variety of forms and revolutions the world is more laid open than it was in former times commerce is greatly enlarged more countries are civilized posts are every where established intercourse is become more easy and the knowledge of facts by consequence more attainable all these are great advantages to historians of which in some measure as i shall afterward show they have availed themselves in the more complex kinds of poetry likewise we may have gained somewhat perhaps in point of regularity and accuracy in dramatic performances having the advantage of the ancient models we may be allowed to have made some improvements in the variety of the characters the conduct of the plot attentions to probability and to decorums  these seem to me the chief points of superiority we can plead above the ancients neither do they extend as far as might be imagined at first view for if the strength of genius be on one side it will go far in works of taste at least to counterbalance all the artificial improvements which can be made by greater knowledge and correctness to return to our comparison of the age of the world with that of a man it may be said not altogether without reason that if the advancing age of the world bring along with it more science and more refinement there belong however to its earlier periods more vigor more fire more enthusiasm of genius this appears indeed to form the characteristical difference between the ancient poets orators and historians compared with the modern among the ancients we find higher conceptions greater simplicity more original fancy among the moderns sometimes more art and correctness but feebler exertions of genius but though this be in general a mark of distinction between the ancients and moderns yet like all general observations it must be understood with some exceptions for in point of poetical fire and original genius milton and shakespeare are inferior to no poets in any age  it is proper to observe that there were some circumstances in ancient times very favorable to those uncommon efforts of genius which were then exerted learning was a much more rare and singular attainment in the earlier ages than it is at present it was not to schools and universities that the persons applied who sought to distinguish themselves they had not this easy recourse they traveled for their improvement into distant countries to egypt and to the east they enquired after all the monuments of learning there they conversed with priests philosophers poets with all who had acquired any distinguished fame they returned to their own country full of the discoveries which they had made and fired by the new and uncommon objects which they had seen their knowledge and improvements cost them more labor raised in them more enthusiasm were attended with higher rewards and honors than in modern days fewer had the means and opportunities of distinguishing themselves than now but such as did distinquish themselves were sure of acquiring that fame and even veneration which is of all other rewards the greatest incentive to genius herodotus read his history to all greece assembled at the olympic games and was publicly crowned in the peloponnesian war when the athenian army was defeated in sicily and the prisoners were ordered to be put to death such of them as could repeat any verses of euripides were saved from honor to that poet who was a citizen of athens these were testimonies of public regard far beyond what modern manners confer upon genius  in our times good writing is considered as an attainment neither so difficult nor so high and meritorious scribimus indocti doctique poemata passim now every desperate blockhead dares to write verse is the trade of every living wight francis  we write much more supinely and at our ease than the ancients to excel is become a much less considerable object less effort less exertion is required because we have many more instances than they printing has rendered all books common and easy to be had education for any of the learned professions can be carried on without much trouble hence a mediocrity of genius is spread over all but to rise beyond that and to overtop the crowd is given to few the multitude of assistances which we have for all kinds of composition in the opinion of sir william temple a very competent judge rather depresses than favors the exertions of native genius it is very possible says that ingenious author in his essay on the ancients and moderns that men may lose rather than gain by these may lessen the force of their own genius by forming it upon that of others may have less knowledge of their own for contenting themselves with that of those before them so a man that only translates shall never be a poet so people that trust to others charity rather than their own industry will be always poor who can tell he adds whether learning may not even weaken invention in a man that has great advantages from nature whether the weight and number of so many other mens thoughts and notions may not suppress his own as heaping on wood sometimes suppresses a little spark that would otherwise have grown into a flame the strength of mind as well as of body grows more from the warmth of exercise than of clothes nay too much of this foreign heat rather makes men faint and their constitutions weaker than they would be without them  from whatever cause it happens so it is that among some of the ancient writers we must look for the highest models in most of the kinds of elegant composition for accurate thinking and enlarged ideas in several parts of philosophy to the moderns we ought chiefly to have recourse of correct and finished writing in some works of taste they may afford useful patterns but for all that belongs to original genius to spirited masterly and high execution our best and most happy ideas are generally speaking drawn from the ancients in epic poetry for instance homer and virgil to this day stand not within many degrees of any rival orators such as cicero and demosthenes we have none in history notwithstanding some defects which i am afterward to mention in the ancient historical plans it may be safely asserted that we have no such historical narration so elegant so picturesque so animated and interesting as that of herodotus thucydides xenophon livy tacitus and sallust although the conduct of the drama may be admitted to have received some improvements yet for poetry and sentiment we have nothing to equal sophocles and euripides nor any dialogue in comedy that comes up to the correct graceful and elegant simplicity of terence we have no such love elegies as those of tibullus no such pastorals as some of theocrituss and for lyric poetry horace stands quite unrivalled the name of horace cannot be mentioned without a particular encomium that curiosa felicitas which petronius has remarked in his expression the sweetness elegance and spirit of many of his odes the thorough knowledge of the world the excellent sentiments and natural easy manner which distinguish his satyrs and epistles all contribute to render him one of those very few authors whom one never tires of reading and from whom alone were every other monument destroyed we would be led to form a very high idea of the taste and genius of the augustan age  to all such then as wish to form their taste and nourish their genius let me warmly recommend the assiduous study of the ancient classics both greek and roman nocturna versate manu versate diurna read them by day and study them by night francis  without a considerable acquaintance with them no man can be reckoned a polite scholar and he will want many assistances for writing and speaking well which the knowledge of such authors would afford him any one has great reason to suspect his own taste who receives little or no pleasure from the perusal of writings which so many ages and nations have consented in holding up as objects of admiration and i am persuaded it will be found that in proportion as the ancients are generally studied and admired or are unknown and disregarded in any country good taste and good composition will flourish or decline they are commonly none but the ignorant or superficial who undervalue them  at the same time a just and high regard for the prime writers of antiquity is to be always distinguished from that contempt of every thing that is modern and that blind veneration for all that has been written in greek or latin which belongs only to pedants among the greek and roman authors some assuredly deserve much higher regard than others nay some are of no great value even the best of them lie open occasionally to just censure for to no human performance is it given to be absolutely perfect we may we ought therefore to read them with a distinguishing eye so as to propose for imitation their beauties only and it is perfectly consistent with just and candid criticism to find fault with parts while at the same time it admires the whole  after these reflections on the ancients and moderns i proceed to a critical examination of the most distinguished kinds of composition and the characters of those writers who have excelled in them whether modern or ancient  the most general division of the different kinds of composition is into those written in prose and those written in verse which certainly require to be separately considered because subject to separate laws i begin as is most natural with writings in prose of orations or public discourses of all kinds i have already treated fully the remaining species of prose compositions which assume any such regular form as to fall under the cognizance of criticism seem to be chiefly these historical writing philosophical writing epistolary writing and fictitious history historical composition shall be first considered and as it is an object of dignity i purpose to treat of it at some length  as it is the office of an orator to persuade it is that of an historian to record truth for the instruction of mankind this is the proper object and end of history from which may be deduced many of the laws relating to it and if this object were always kept in view it would prevent many of the errors into which persons are apt to fall concerning this species of composition as the primary end of history is to record truth impartiality fidelity and accuracy are the fundamental qualities of an historian he must neither be a panegyrist nor a satyrist he must not enter into faction nor give scope to affection but contemplating past events and characters with a cool and dispassionate eye must present to his readers a faithful copy of human nature  at the same time it is not every record of facts however true that is entitled to the name of history but such a record as enables us to apply the transactions of former ages for our own instruction the facts ought to be momentous and important represented in connection with their causes traced to their effects and unfolded in clear and distinct order for wisdom is the great end of history it is designed to supply the want of experience though it enforce not its instructions with the same authority yet it furnishes us with a greater variety of instructions than it is possible for experience to afford in the course of the longest life its object is to enlarge our views of the human character and to give full exercise to our judgment on human affairs it must not therefore be a tale calculated to please only and addressed to the fancy gravity and dignity are essential characteristics of history no light ornaments are to be employed no flippancy of style no quaintness of wit but the writer must sustain the character of a wise man writing for the instruction of posterity one who has studied to inform himself well who has pondered his subject with care and addresses himself to our judgment rather than to our imagination not that this is inconsistent with ornamented and spirited narration history admits of much high ornament and elegance but the ornaments must be always consistent with dignity they should not appear to be sought after but to rise naturally from a mind animated by the events which it records  historical composition is understood to comprehend under it annals memoirs lives but these are its inferior subordinate species on which i shall hereafter make some reflections when i shall have first considered what belongs to a regular and legitimate work of history such a work is chiefly of two kinds either the entire history of some state or kingdom through its different revolutions such as livys roman history or the history of some one great event or some portion or period of time which may be considered as making a whole by itself such as thucydidess history of the peloponnesian war davilas history of the civil wars of france or clarendons of those of england  in the conduct and management of his subject the first attention requisite in an historian is to give it as much unity as possible that is his history should not consist of separate unconnected parts merely but should be bound together by some connecting principle which shall make the impression on the mind of something that is one whole and entire it is inconceivable how great effect this when happily executed has upon a reader and it is surprising that some able writers of history have not attended to it more whether pleasure or instruction be the end sought by the study of history either of them is enjoyed to much greater advantage when the mind has always before it the progress of some one great plan or system of actions when there is some point or center to which we can refer the various facts related by the historian  in general histories which record the affairs of a whole nation or empire throughout several ages this unity i confess must be more imperfect yet even there some degree of it can be preserved by a skilful writer for though the whole taken together be very complex yet the great constituent parts of it form so many subordinate wholes when taken by themselves each of which can be treated both as complete within itself and as connected with what goes before and follows in the history of a monarchy for instance every reign should have its own unity a beginning a middle and an end to the system of affairs while at the same time we are taught to discern how that system of affairs rose from the preceding and how it is inserted into what follows after we should be able to trace all the secret links of the chain which binds together remote and seemingly unconnected events in some kingdoms of europe it was the plan of many succeeding princes to reduce the power of their nobles and during several reigns most of the leading actions had a reference to this end in other states the rising power of the commons influenced for a tract of time the course and connection of public affairs among the romans the leading principle was a gradual extention of conquest and the attainment of universal empire the continual increase of their power advancing toward this end from small beginnings and by sort of regular progressive plan furnished to livy a happy subject for historical unity in the midst of a great variety of transactions  of all the ancient general historians the one who had the most exact idea of this quality of historical composition though in other respects not an elegant writer is polybius this appears from the account he gives of his own plan in the beginning of his third book observing that the subject of which he had undertaken to write is throughout the whole of it one action one great spectacle how and by what causes all the parts of the habitable world became subject to the roman empire this action says he is distinct in its beginning determined in its duration and clear in its final accomplishment therefore i think it of use to give a general view beforehand of the chief constituent parts which make up this whole in another place he congratulates himself on his good fortune in having a subject for history which allowed such variety of parts to be united under one view remarking that before this period the affairs of the world were scattered and without connection whereas in the times of which he writes all the great transactions of the world tended and verged to one point and were capable of being considered as parts of one system whereupon he adds several very judicious observations concerning the usefulness of writing history upon such a comprehensive and connected plan comparing the imperfect degree of knowledge which is afforded by particular facts without general views to the imperfect idea which one would entertain of an animal who had beheld its separate parts only without having ever seen its entire form and structure  polyb histor prim   such as write the history of some particular great transaction as confine themselves to one era or one portion of the history of a nation have so great advantages for preserving historical unity that they are inexcusable if they fail in it sallusts histories of the the catilinarian and jugurthine wars xenophons cyropoedia and his retreat of the ten thousand are instances of particular histories where the unity of historical object is perfectly well maintained thucycides otherwise a writer of great strength and dignity has failed much in this article in his history of the peloponnesian war no one great object is properly pursued and kept in view but his narration is cut down into small pieces his history is divided by summers and winters and we are every now and then leaving transactions unfinished and are hurried from place to place from athens to sicily from thence to peloponnesus to corcyra to mitylene that we may be told of what is going on in all these places we have a great many disjointed parts and scattered limbs which with difficulty we collect into one body and through this faulty distribution and management of his subject that judicious historian becomes more tiresome and less agreeable than he would otherwise be for these reasons he is severely censured by one of the best critics of antiquity dionysius of halicarnassus the censure which dionysius passes upon thucydides is in several articles carried too far he blames him for the choice of his subject as not sufficiently splendid and agreeable and as abounding too much in crimes and melancholy events on which he observes that thucydides loves to dwell he is partial to herodotus whom both for the choice and the conduct of his subject he prefers to the other historian it is true that the subject of thucydides wants the gaiety and splendour of that of herodotus but it is not deficient in dignity the peloponnesian war was the contest between two great rival powers the athenian and lacedemonian states for the empire of greece herodotus loves to dwell on prosperous incidents and retains somewhat of the amusing manner of the ancient poetical historians but herodotus wrote to the imagination thucydides writes to the understanding he was a grave reflecting man well acquainted with human life and the melancholy events and catastrophes which he records are often both the most interesting parts of history and the most improving to the heart  the critics observations on the faulty distribution which thucydides makes of his subject are better founded and his preference of herodotus in this respect is not unjust    with regard to style dionysius gives thucydides the just praise of energy and brevity but censures him on many occasions not without reason for harsh and obscure expression deficient in smoothness and ease     the historian must not indeed neglect chronological order with a view to render his narration agreeable he must give a distinct account of the dates and of the coincidence of facts but he is not under the necessity of breaking off always in the middle of transactions in order to inform us of what was happening elsewhere at the same time he discovers no art if he cannot form some connection among the affairs which he relates so as to introduce them in a proper train he will soon tire the reader if he goes on recording in strict chronological order a multitude of separate transactions connected by nothing else but their happening at the same time  though the history of herodotus be of greater compass than that of thucydides and comprehend a much greater variety of dissimilar parts he has been more fortunate in joining them together and digesting them into order hence he is a more pleasing writer and gives a stronger impression of his subject though in judgment and accuracy much inferior to thucydides with digressions and episodes he abounds but when these have any connection with the main subject and are inserted professedly as episodes the unity of the whole is less violated by them than by a broken and scattered narration of the principal story among the moderns the president thuanus has by attempting to make the history of his own times too universal fallen into the same error of loading the reader with a great variety of unconnected facts going on together in different parts of the world an historian otherwise of great probity candor and excellent understanding but through this want of unity more tedious and less interesting than he would otherwise have been  lecture xxxvi historical writing after making some observations on the controversy which has been often carried on concerning the comparative merit of the ancients and the moderns i entered in the last lecture on the consideration of historical writing the general idea of history is a record of truth for the instruction of mankind hence arise the primary qualities required in a good historian impartiality fidelity gravity and dignity what i principally considered was the unity which belongs to this sort of composition the nature of which i have endeavored to explain  i proceed next to observe that in order to fulfill the end of history the author must study to trace to their springs the actions and events which he records two things are especially necessary for his doing this successfully a thorough acquaintance with human nature and political knowledge or acquaintance with government the former is necessary to account for the conduct of individuals and to give just views of their character the latter to account for the revolutions of government and the operation of political causes on public affairs both must concur in order to form a completely instructive historian  with regard to the latter article political knowledge the ancient writers wanted some advantages which the moderns enjoy from whom upon that account we have a title to expect more accurate and precise information the world as i formerly hinted was more shut up in ancient times than it is now there was then less communication among neighboring states and by consequence less knowledge of one anothers affairs no intercourse by established posts or by ambassadors resident at distant courts the knowledge and materials of the ancient historians were thereby more limited and circumscribed and it is to be observed too that they wrote for their own countrymen only they had no idea of writing for the instruction of foreigners whom they despised or of the world in general and hence they are less attentive to convey all that knowledge with regard to domestic policy which we in distant times would desire to have learned from them perhaps also though in ancient ages men were abundantly animated with the love of liberty yet the full extent of the influence of government and of political causes was not then so thoroughly scrutinized as it has been in modern times when a longer experience of all the different modes of government has rendered men more enlightened and intelligent with respect to public affairs  to these reasons it is owing that though the ancient historians set before us the particular facts which they relate in a very distinct and beautiful manner yet sometimes they do not give us a clear view of all the political causes which affected the situation of affairs of which they treat from the greek historians we are able to form but an imperfect notion of the strength the wealth and the revenues of the different grecian states of the causes of several of those revolutions that happened in their government or of their separate connections and interfering interests in writing the history of the romans livy had surely the most ample field for displaying political knowledge concerning the rise of their greatness and the advantages or defects of their government yet the instruction in these important articles which he affords is not considerable an elegant writer he is and a beautiful relater of facts if ever there was one but by no means distinguished for profoundness or penetration sallust when writing the history of a conspiracy against the government which ought to have been altogether a political history has evidently attended more to the elegance of narration and the painting of characters than to the unfolding of secret causes and springs instead of that complete information which we would naturally have expected from him of the state of parties in rome and of that particular conjuncture of affairs which enabled so desperate a profligate as catiline to become so formidable to government he has given us little more than a general declamatory account of the luxury and corruption of manners in that age compared with the simplicity of former times  i by no means however mean to censure all the ancient historians as defective in political information no historians can be more instructive than thucydides polybius and tacitus thucydides is grave intelligent and judicious always attentive to give very exact information concerning every operation which he relates and to show the advantages or disadvantages of every plan that was proposed and every measure that was pursued polybius excels in comprehensive political views in penetration into great systems and in his profound and distinct knowledge of all military affairs tacitus is eminent for his knowledge of the human heart is sentimental and refined in a high degree conveys much instruction with respect to political matters but more with respect to human nature  but when we demand from the historian profound and instructive views of his subject it is not meant that he should be frequently interrupting the course of his history with his own reflections and speculations he should give us all the information that is necessary for our fully understanding the affairs which he records he should make us acquainted with the political constitution the force the revenues the internal state of the country of which he writes and with its interests and connections in respect of neighboring countries he should place us as on an elevated station whence we may have an extensive prospect of all the causes that cooperate in bringing forward the events which are related but having put into our hands all the proper materials for judgment he should not be too prodigal of his own opinions and reasonings when an historian is much given to dissertation and is ready to philosophise and speculate on all that he records a suspicion naturally arises that he will be in hazard of adapting his narrative of facts to favor some system which he has formed to himself it is rather by fair and judicious narration that history should instruct us than by delivering instruction in an avowed and direct manner on some occasions when doubtful points require to be scrutinized or when some great event is in agitation concerning the causes or circumstances of which mankind have been much divided the narrative may be allowed to stand still for a little the historian may appear and may with propriety enter into some weighty discussion but he must take care not to cloy his readers with such discussions by repeating them too often  when observations are to be made concerning human nature in general or the peculiarities of certain characters if the historian can artfully incorporate such observations with his narrative they will have a better effect than when they are delivered as formal detached reflections for instance in the life of agricola tacitus speaking of domitians treatment of agricola makes this observation proprium humani ingenii est odisse quem laeseris it belongs to human nature to hate the man whom you have injured  the observation is just and well applied but the form in which it stands is abstract and philosophical a thought of the same kind has a finer effect elsewhere in the same historian when speaking of the jealousies which germanicus knew to be entertained against him by livia and tiberius anxius said he occultis in se patrui aviaeque odiis quorum causae acriores quia iniquae uneasy in his mind on account of the concealed hatred entertained against him by his uncle and grandmother which was the more bitter because the cause of it was unjust  here a profound moral observation is made but it is made without appearing to make it in form it is introduced as a part of the narration in assigning a reason for the anxiety of germanicus we have another instance of the same kind in the account which he gives of a mutiny raised against rufus who was a praefectus castrorum on account of the severe labor which he imposed on the soldiers quippe rufus diu manipularis dein centurio mox castris praefectus antiquam duramque militiam revocabat vetus operis and laboris et eo immitior quia toleraverat for rufus who had long been a common soldier afterward a centurion and at length a general officer restored the severe military discipline of ancient times grown old amidst toils and labors he was the more rigid in imposing them because he had been accustomed to bear them  there was room for turning this into a general observation that they who have been educated and hardened in toils are commonly found to be the most severe in requiring the like toils from others but the manner in which tacitus introduces this sentiment as a stroke in the character of rufus gives it much more life and spirit this historian has a particular talent of intermixing after this manner with the course of his narrative many striking sentiments and useful observations  let us next proceed to consider the proper qualities of historical narration it is obvious that on the manner of narration much must depend as the first notion of history is the recital of past facts and how much one mode of recital may be preferable to another we shall soon be convinced by thinking of the different effects which the same story when told by two different persons is found to produce  the first virtue of historical narration is clearness order and due connection to attain this the historian must be completely master of his subject he must see the whole as at one view and comprehend the chain and dependence of all its parts that he may introduce every thing in its proper place that he may lead us smoothly along the track of affairs which are recorded and may always give us the satisfaction of seeing how one event arises out of another without this there can be neither pleasure nor instruction in reading history much for this end will depend on the observance of that unity in the general plan and conduct which in the preceding lecture i recommended much too will depend on the proper management of transitions which forms one of the chief ornaments of this kind of writing and is one of the most difficult in execution nothing tries an historians abilities more than so to lay his train beforehand as to make us pass naturally and agreeably from one part of his subject to another to employ no clumsy and awkward junctures and to contrive ways and means of forming some union among transactions which seem to be most widely separated from one another  in the next place as history is a very dignified species of composition gravity must always be maintained in the narration there must be no meanness nor vulgarity in the style no quaint nor colloquial phrases no affectation of pertness or of wit the smart or the sneering manner of telling a story are inconsistent with the historical character i do not say that an historian is never to let himself down he may sometimes do it with propriety in order to diversify the strain of his narration which if it be perfectly uniform is apt to become tiresome but he should be careful never to descend too far and on occasions where a light or ludicrous anecdote is proper to be recorded it is generally better to throw it into a note than to hazard becoming too familiar by introducing it into the body of the work  but an historian may possess these qualities of being perspicuous distinct and grave and may notwithstanding be a dull writer in which case we shall reap little benefit from his labors we will read him without pleasure or most probably we shall soon give over to read him at all he must therefore study to render his narration interesting which is the quality that chiefly distinguishes a writer of genius and eloquence  two things are especially conducive to this the first is a just medium in the conduct of narration between a rapid or crowded recital of facts and a prolix detail the former embarrasses and the latter tires us an historian that would interest us must know when to be concise and where he ought to enlarge passing concisely over slight and unimportant events but dwelling on such as are striking and considerable in their nature or pregnant with consequences preparing beforehand our attention to them and bringing them forth into the most full and conspicuous light the next thing he must attend to is a proper selection of the circumstances belonging to those events which he chooses to relate fully general facts make a slight impression on the mind it is by means of circumstances and particulars properly chosen that a narration becomes interesting and affecting to the reader these give life body and coloring to the recital of facts and enable us to behold them as present and passing before our eyes it is this employment of circumstances in narration that is properly termed historical painting  in all these virtues of narration particularly in this last of picturesque descriptive narration several of the ancient historians eminently excel hence the pleasure that is found in reading herodotus thucydides xenophon livy sallust and tacitus they are all conspicuous for the art of narration herodotus is at all times an agreeable writer and relates every thing with that naivete and simplicity of manner which never fails to interest the reader though the manner of thucydides be more dry and harsh yet on great occasions as when he is giving an account of the plague of athens the siege of plataea the sedition in corcyra the defeat of the athenians in sicily he displays a very strong and masterly power of description xenophons cyropaedia and his anabasis or retreat of the ten thousand are extremely beautiful the circumstances are finely selected and the narration is easy and engaging but his hellenics or continuation of the history of thucydides is a much inferior work sallusts art of historical painting in his catilinarian but more especially in his jugurthine war is well known though his style is liable to censure as too studied and affected  livy is more unexceptionable in his manner and is excelled by no historian whatever in the art of narration several remarkable examples might be given from him his account for instance of the famous defeat of the roman army by the samnites at the furcae caudinae in the beginning of the ninth book affords one of the most beautiful exemplifications of historical painting that is any where to be met with we have first an exact description of the narrow pass between two mountains into which the enemy had decoyed the romans when they find themselves caught and no hope of escape left we are made to see first their astonishment next their indignation and then their dejection painted in the most lively manner by such circumstances and actions as were natural to persons in their situation the restless and unquiet manner in which they pass the night the consultations of the samnites the various measures proposed to be taken the messages between the two armies all heighten the scene at length in the morning the consuls return to the camp and inform them that they could receive no other terms but that of surrendering their arms and passing under the yoke which was considered as the last mark of ignominy for a conquered army part of what then follows i shall give in the authors own words redintegravit luctum in castris consulum adventus ut vix ab iis abstinerent manus quorum temeritate in eum locum deducti essent alii alios intueri contemplari arma mox tradenda and inermes futuras dextras proponere sibimet ipsi ante oculos jugum hostile et ludibria victoris et vultus superbos et per armatos inermium iter inde faedi agminis miserabilem viam per sociorum urbes reditum in patriam

paludamentaque detracta tantam hoc inter ipsos qui paulo ante eos dedendos lacerandosque censuerant miserationem fecit ut suae quisque conditionis oblitus ab illa deformatione tantae majestatis velut ab nefando spectaculo averteret oculos primi consules prope seminudi sub jugum missi the arrival of the consuls in the camp wrought up up their passions to such a degree that they could scarcely abstain from laying violent hands on them as by their rashness they had been brought into this situation they began to look on one another to cast a melancholy eye on their arms which were now to be surrendered and on their right hands which were to become defenseless the yoke under which they were to pass the scoffs of the conquerors and their haughty looks when disarmed and stripped they should be led through the hostile lines all rose before their eyes they then looked forward to the sad journey which awaited them when they were to pass as a vanquished and disgraced army through the territories of their allies by whom they had often been beheld returning in triumph to their families and native land they alone they muttered to one another without an engagement without a single blow had been conquered to their hard fate it fell never to have had it in their power to draw a sword or to look an enemy in the face to them only arms strength and courage had been given in vain while they were thus giving vent to their indignation the fatal moment of their ignominy arrived first they were all commanded to come forth from the camp without armor and in a single garment next orders were given that the consuls should be left without their lictors and that they should be stripped of their robes such commiseration did this affront excite among them who but a little before had been for delivering up those very consuls to the enemy and for putting them to death that every one forgot his own condition and turned his eyes aside from this infamous disgrace suffered by the consular dignity as from a spectacle which was too detestable to be beheld the consuls almost half naked were first made to pass under the yoke etc  etc the rest of the story which it would be too long to insert is carried on with the same beauty and full of picturesque circumstances the description which caesar gives of the consternation occasioned in his camp by the accounts which were spread among his troops of the ferocity the size and the courage of the germans affords an instance of historical painting executed in a simple manner and at the same time exhibiting a natural and lively scene dum paucos dies ad vesontionem moratur ex percunctatione nostrorum vocibusque gallorum ac mercatorum qui ingenti magnitudine corporum germanos incredibili virtute atque exercitatione in armis

obsignabantur de bell gall l i   tacitus is another author eminent for historical painting though in a manner altogether different from that of livy livys descriptions are more full more plain and natural those of tacitus consist in a few bold strokes he selects one or two remarkable circumstances and sets them before us in a strong and generally in a new and uncommon light such is the following picture of the situation of rome and of the emperor galba when otho was advancing against him agebatur huc illuc galba vario turbae fluctuantis impulsu completis undique basilicis et templis lugubri prospectu neque populi aut plebis ulla vox sed attoniti vultus et conversae ad omnia aures non tumultus non quies sed quale magni metus et magnae irae silentium est galba was driven to an fro by the tide of the multitude shoving him from place to place the temples and public buildings were filled with crowds of a dismal appearance no clamours were heard either from the citizens or from the rabble their countenances were filled with consternation their ears were employed in listening with anxiety it was not a tumult it was not quietness it was the silence of terror and of wrath  no image in any poet is more strong and expressive than this last stroke of the description non tumultus non quies sed quale etc this is a conception of the sublime kind and discovers high genius indeed throughout all his work tacitus shows the hand of a master as he is profound in reflection so he is striking in description and pathetic in sentiment the philosopher the poet and the historian all meet in him though the period of which he writes may be reckoned unfortunate for a historian he has made it afford us many interesting exhibitions of human nature the relations which he gives of the deaths of several eminent personages are as affecting as the deepest tragedies he paints with a glowing pencil and possesses beyond all writers the talent of painting not to the imagination merely but to the heart with many of the most distinguished beauties he is at the same time not a perfect model for history and such as have formed themselves upon him have seldom been successful he is to be admired rather than imitated in his reflections he is too refined in his style too concise sometimes quaint and affected often abrupt and obscure history seems to require a more natural flowing and popular manner  the ancients employed one embellishment of history which the moderns have laid aside i mean orations which on weighty occasions they put into the mouths of some of their chief personages by means of these they diversified their history they conveyed both moral and political instruction and by the opposite arguments which were employed they gave us a view of the sentiments of different parties thucydides was the first who introduced this method the orations with which his history abounds and those too of some other greek and latin historians are among the most valuable remains which we have of ancient eloquence how beautiful soever they are it may be much questioned i think whether they find a proper place in history i rather incline to think that they are unsuitable to it for they form a mixture which is unnatural in history of fixion with truth we know that these orations are entirely of the authors own composition and that he has introduced some celebrated person haranguing in a public place purely that he might have an opportunity of showing his own eloquence or delivering his own sentiments under the name of that person this is a sort of poetical liberty which does not suit the gravity of history throughout which an air of the strictest truth should always reign orations may be an embellishment to history such might also poetical compositions be introduced under the name of some of the personages mentioned in the narration who were known to have possessed poetical talents but neither the one nor the other find a proper place in history instead of inserting formal orations the method adopted by later writers seems better and more natural that of the historian on some great occasion delivering in his own person the sentiments and reasonings of the opposite parties or the substance of what was understood to be spoken in some public assembly which he may do without the liberty of fiction  the drawing of characters is one of the most splendid and at the same time one of the most difficult ornaments of historical composition for characters are generally considered as professed exhibitions of fine writing and an historian who seeks to shine in them is frequently in danger of carrying refinement to excess from a desire of appearing very profound and penetrating he brings together so many contrasts and subtle oppositions of qualities that we are rather dazzled with sparkling expressions than entertained with any clear conception of a human character a writer who would characterise in an instructive and masterly manner should be simple in his style and should avoid all quaintness and affectation at the same time not contenting himself with giving us general outlines only but descending into those peculiarities which mark a character in its most strong and distinctive features the greek historians sometimes give elogiums but rarely draw full and professed characters the two ancient authors who have labored this part of historical composition most are sallust and tacitus  as history is a species of writing designed for the instruction of mankind sound morality should always reign in it both in describing characters and in relating transactions the author should always show himself to be on the side of virtue to deliver moral instruction in a formal manner falls not within his province but both as a good man and as a good writer we expect that he should discover sentiments of respect for virtue and of indignation at flagrant vice to appear neutral and indifferent with respect to good and bad characters and to affect a crafty and political rather than a moral turn of thought will besides other bad effects derogate greatly from the weight of historical composition and will render the strain of it much more cold and uninteresting we are always most interested in the transactions which are going on when our sympathy is awakened by the story and when we become engaged in the fate of the actors but this effect can never be produced by a writer who is deficient in sensibility and moral feeling  as the observations which i have hitherto made have mostly respected the ancient historians it may naturally be expected that i should also take some notice of the moderns who have excelled in this kind of writing  the country in europe where the historical genius has in latter ages shone forth with most luster beyond doubt is italy the national character of the italians seems favorable to it they were always distinguished as an acute penetrating reflecting people remarkable for political sagacity and wisdom and who early addicted themselves to the arts of writing accordingly soon after the restoration of letters machiavel guicciardin davila bentivoglio father paul became highly conspicuous for historical merit they all appear to have conceived very just ideas of history and are agreeable instructive and interesting writers in their manner of narration they are much formed upon the ancients some of them as bentivoglio and guicciardin have in imitation of them introduced orations into their history in the profoundness and distinctness of their political views they may perhaps be esteemed to have surpassed the ancients critics have at the same time observed some imperfections in each of them machiavel in his history of florence is not altogether so interesting as one would expect an author of his abilities to be either through his own defect or through some unhappiness in his subject which led him into a very minute detail of the intrigues of one city guicciardin at all times sensible and profound is taxed for dwelling so long on the tuscan affairs as to be sometimes tedious a defect which is also imputed occasionally to the judicious father paul bentivoglio in his excellent history of the wars of flanders is accused of approaching to the florid and pompous manner and davila though one of the most agreeable and entertaining relaters has manifestly this defect of spreading a sort of uniformity over all his characters by representing them as guided too regularly by political interest but although some such objections may be made to these authors they deserve upon the whole to be placed in the first rank of modern historical writers the wars of flanders written in latin by famianus strada is a book of some note but is not entitled to the same reputation as the works of the other historians i have named strada is too violently partial to the spanish cause and too open a panegyrist of the prince of parma he is florid diffuse and an affected imitator of the manner and style of livy  among the french as there has been much good writing in many kinds so also in the historical that ingenious nation who have done so much honor to modern literature possess in an eminent degree the talent of narration many of their later historical writers are spirited lively and agreeable and some of them not deficient in profoundness and penetration they have not however produced any such capital historians as the italians whom i mentioned above  our island till within these few years was not eminent for its historical productions early indeed scotland made some figure by means of the celebrated buchanan he is an elegant writer classical in his latinity and agreeable both in narration and description but one cannot but suspect him to be more attentive to elegance than to accuracy accustomed to form his political notions wholly upon the plans of ancient governments the feudal system seems never to have entered into his thoughts and as this was the basis of the scottish constitution his political views are of course inaccurate and imperfect when he comes to the transactions of his own time there is such a change in his manner of writing and such an asperity in his style that on what side soever the truth lies with regard to those dubious and long controverted facts which make the subject of that part of his work it is impossible to clear him from being deeply tinctured with the spirit of party  among the older english historians the most considerable is lord clarendon though he writes as the professed apologist of one side yet there appears more impartiality in his relation of facts than might at first be expected a great spirit of virtue and probity runs through his work he maintains all the dignity of an historian his sentences indeed are often too long and his general manner is prolix but his style on the whole is manly and his merit as a historian is much beyond mediocrity bishop burnet is lively and perspicuous but he has hardly any other historical merit his style is too careless and familiar for history his characters are indeed marked with a bold and strong hand but they are generally light and satirical and he abounds so much in little stories concerning himself that he resembles more a writer of memoirs than of history during a long period english historical authors were little more than dull compilers till of late the distinguished names of hume robertson and gibbon have raised the british character in this species of writing to high reputation and dignity  i observed in the preceding lecture that annals memoirs and lives are the inferior kinds of historical composition it will be proper before dismissing this subject to make a few observations upon them annals are commonly understood to signify a collection of facts digested according to chronological order rather serving for the materials of history than aspiring to the name of history themselves all that is required therefore in a writer of such annals is to be faithful distinct and complete  memoirs denote a sort of composition in which an author does not pretend to give full information of all the facts respecting the period of which he writes but only to relate what he himself had access to know or what he was concerned in or what illustrates the conduct of some person or the circumstances of some transaction which he chooses for his subject from a writer of memoirs therefore is not exacted the same profound research or enlarged information as from a writer of history he is not subject to the same laws of unvarying dignity and gravity he may talk freely of himself he may descend into the most familiar anecdotes what is chiefly required of him is that he be sprightly and interesting and especially that he inform us of things that are useful and curious that he convey to us some sort of knowledge worth the acquiring this is a species of writing very bewitching to such as love to write concerning themselves and conceive every transaction in which they had a share to be of singular importance there is no wonder therefore that a nation so sprightly as the french should for two centuries past have been pouring forth a whole flood of memoirs the greatest part of which are little more than agreeable trifles  some however must be excepted from this general character two in particular the memoirs of the cardinal de retz and those of the duke of sully from retzs memoirs besides the pleasure of agreeable and lively narration we may derive also much instruction and much knowledge of human nature though his politics be often too fine spun yet the memoirs of a professed factious leader such as the cardinal was wherein he draws both his own character and that of several great personages of his time so fully cannot be read by any person of good sense without benefit the memoirs of the duke of sully in the state in which they are now given to the public have great merit and deserve to be mentioned with particular praise no memoirs approach more near to the usefulness and the dignity of a full legitimate history they have this peculiar advantage of giving us a beautiful display of two of the most illustrious characters which history presents sully himself one of the ablest and most incorrupt ministers and henry iv one of the greatest and most amiable princes of modern times i know few books more full of virtue and of good sense than sullys memoirs few therefore more proper to form both the heads and the hearts of such as are designed for public business and action in the world  biography or the writing of lives is a very useful kind of composition less formal and stately than history but to the bulk of readers perhaps no less instructive as it affords them the opportunity of seeing the characters and tempers the virtues and failings of eminent men fully displayed and admits them into a more thorough and intimate acquaintance with such persons than history generally allows for a writer of lives may descend with propriety to minute circumstances and familiar incidents it is expected of him that he is to give the private as well as the public life of the person whose actions he records nay it is from private life from familiar domestic and seemingly trivial occurrences that we often receive most light into the real character in this species of writing plutarch has no small merit and to him we stand indebted for much of the knowledge that we possess concerning several of the most eminent personages of antiquity his matter is indeed better than his manner as he cannot lay claim to any peculiar beauty or elegance his judgment too and his accuracy have sometimes been taxed but whatever defects of this kind he may be liable to his lives of eminent men will always be considered as a valuable treasure of instruction he is remarkable for being one of the most humane writers of all antiquity less dazzled than many of them are with the exploits of valor and ambition and fond of displaying his great men to us in the more gentle lights of retirement and private life  i cannot conclude the subject of history without taking notice of a very great improvement which has of late years begun to be introduced into historical composition i mean a more particular attention than was formerly given to laws customs commerce religion literature and every other thing that tends to show the spirit and genius of nations it is now understood to be the business of an able historian to exhibit manners as well as facts and events and assuredly whatever displays the state and life of mankind in different periods and illustrates the progress of the human mind is more useful and interesting than the detail of sieges and battles the person to whom we are most indebted for the introduction of this improvement into history is the celebrated m voltaire whose genius has shone with such surprising luster in so many different parts of literature his age of louis xiv was one of the first great productions in this taste and soon drew throughout all europe that general attention and received that high approbation which so ingenious and eloquent a production merited his essay on the general history of europe since the days of charlemagne is not to be considered either as a history or the proper plan of an historical work but only as a series of observations on the chief events that have happened throughout several centuries and on the changes that successively took place in the spirit and manners of different nations though in some dates and facts it may perhaps be inaccurate and is tinged with those particularities which unhappily distinguished voltaires manner of thinking on religious subjects yet it contains so many enlarged and instructive views as justly to merit the attention of all who either read or write the history of those ages  lecture xxxvii philosophical writing  dialogue  epistolary writing  fictitious history as history is both a very dignified species of composition and by the regular form which it assumes falls directly under the laws of criticism i discoursed of it fully in the two preceding lectures the remaining species of composition in prose afford less room for critical observation  philosophical writing for instance will not lead us into any long discussion as the professed object of philosophy is to convey instruction and as they who study it are supposed to do so for instruction not for entertainment the style the form and dress of such writings are less material objects they are objects however that must not be wholly neglected he who attempts to instruct mankind without studying at the same time to engage their attention and to interest them in his subject by his manner of exhibiting it is not likely to prove successful the same truths and reasonings delivered in a dry and cold manner or with a proper measure of elegance and beauty will make very different impressions on the minds of men  it is manifest that every philosophical writer must study the utmost perspicuity and by reflecting on what was formerly delivered on the subject of perspicuity with respect both to single words and the construction of sentences we may be convinced that this is a study which demands considerable attention to the rules of style and good writing beyond mere perspicuity strict accuracy and precision are required in a philosophical writer he must employ no words of uncertain meaning no loose nor indeterminate expressions and should avoid using words which are seemingly synonymous without carefully attending to the variation which they make upon the idea  to be clear then and precise is one requisite which we have a title to demand from every philosophical writer he may possess this quality and be at the same time a very dry writer he should therefore study some degree of embellishment in order to render his composition pleasing and graceful one of the most agreeable and one of the most useful embellishments which a philosopher can employ consists in illustrations taken from historical facts and the characters of men all moral and political subjects naturally afford scope for these and wherever there is room for employing them they seldom fail of producing a happy effect they diversify the composition they relieve the mind from the fatigue of mere reasoning and at the same time raise more full conviction than any reasonings produce for they take philosophy out of the abstract and give weight to speculation by showing its connection with real life and the actions of mankind  philosophical writing admits besides of a polished a neat and elegant style it admits of metaphors comparisons and all the calm figures of speech by which an author may convey his sense to the understanding with clearness and force at the same time that he entertains the imagination he must take great care however that all his ornaments be of the chastest kind never partaking of the florid or the tumid which is so unpardonable in a professed philosopher that it is much better for him to err on the side of naked simplicity than on that of too much ornament some of the ancients as plato and cicero have left us philosophical treatises composed with much elegance and beauty seneca has been long and justly censured for the affectation that appears in his style he is too fond of a certain brilliant and sparkling manner of antitheses and quaint sentences it cannot be denied at the same time that he often expresses himself with much liveliness and force though his style upon the whole is far from deserving imitation in english mr lockes celebrated treatise on human understanding may be pointed out as a model on the one hand of the greatest clearness and distinctness of philosophical style with very little approach to ornament lord shaftsburys writings on the other hand exhibit philosophy dressed up with all the ornament which it can admit perhaps with more than is perfectly suited to it  philosophical composition sometimes assumes a form under which it mingles more with works of taste when carried on in the way of dialogue and conversation under this form the ancients have given us some of their chief philosophical works and several of the moderns have endeavored to imitate them dialogue writing may be executed in two ways either as direct conversation where none but the speakers appear which is the method that plato uses or as the recital of a conversation where the author himself appears and gives an account of what passed in discourse which is the method that cicero generally follows but though those different methods make some variation in the form yet the nature of the composition is at bottom the same in both and subject to the same laws  a dialogue in one or other of these forms on some philosophical moral or critical subject when it is well conducted stands in a high rank among the works of taste but is much more difficult in the execution than is commonly imagined for it requires more than merely the introduction of different persons speaking in succession it ought to be a natural and spirited representation of real conversation exhibiting the character and manners of the several speakers and suiting to the character of each that peculiarity of thought and expression which distinguishes him from another a dialogue thus conducted gives the reader a very agreeable entertainment as by means of the debate going on among the personages he receives a fair and full view of both sides of the argument and is at the same time amused with polite conversation and with a display of consistent and well supported characters an author therefore who has genius for executing such a composition after this manner has it in his power both to instruct and to please  but the greatest part of modern dialogue writers have no idea of any composition of this sort and bating the outward forms of conversation and that one speaks and another answers it is quite the same as if the author spoke in person throughout the whole he sets up a philotheos perhaps and a philatheos or an a and a b who after mutual compliments and after admiring the fineness of the morning or evening and the beauty of the prospects around them enter into conference concerning some grave matter and all that we know farther of them is that the one personates the author a man of learning no doubt and of good principles and the other is a man of straw set up to propose some trivial objections over which the first gains a most entire triumph and leaves his skeptical antagonist at the end much humbled and generally convinced of his error this is a very frigid and insipid manner of writing the more so as it is an attempt toward something which we see the author cannot support it is the form without the spirit of conversation the dialogue serves no purpose but to make awkward interruptions and we would with more patience hear the author continuing always to reason himself and to remove the objections that are made to his principles than be troubled with the unmeaning appearance of two persons whom we see to be in reality no more than one  among the ancients plato is eminent for the beauty of his dialogues the scenery and the circumstances of many of them are beautifully painted the characters of the sophists with whom socrates disputed are well drawn a variety of personages are exhibited to us we are introduced into a real conversation often supported with much life and spirit after the socratic manner for richness and beauty of imagination no philosophic writer ancient or modern is comparable to plato the only fault of his imagination is such an excess of fertility as allows it sometimes to obscure his judgment it frequently carries him into allegory fiction enthusiasm and the airy regions of mystical theology the philosopher is at times lost in the poet but whether we be edified with the matter or not and much edification he often affords we are always entertained with the manner and left with a strong impression of the sublimity of the authors genius  ciceros dialogues or those recitals of conversation which he has introduced into several of his philosophical and critical works are not so spirited nor so characteristical as those of plato yet some as that de oratore especially are agreeable and well supported they show us conversation carried on among some of the principal persons of ancient rome with freedom good breeding and dignity the author of the elegant dialogue de causis corruptae eloquentiae which is annexed sometimes to the works of quinctilian and sometimes to those of tacitus has happily imitated perhaps has excelled cicero in this manner of writing  lucian is a dialogue writer of much eminence though his subjects are seldom such as can entitle him to be ranked among philosophical authors he has given the model of the light and humorous dialogue and has carried it to great perfection a character of levity and at the same time of wit and penetration distinguish all his writings his great object was to expose the follies of superstition and the pedantry of philosophy which prevailed in his age and he could not have taken any more successful method for this end than what he has employed in his dialogues especially in those of the gods and of the dead which are full of pleasantry and satire in this invention of dialogues of the dead he has been followed by several modern authors fontenelle in particular has given us dialogues of this sort which are sprightly and agreeable but as for characters whoever his personages be they all become frenchmen in his hands indeed few things in composition are more difficult than in the course of a moral dialogue to exhibit characters properly distinguished as calm conversation furnishes none of those assistances for bringing characters into light which the active scenes and interesting situations of the drama afford hence few authors are eminent for characteristical dialogue on grave subjects one of the most remarkable in the english language is a writer of the last age dr henry more in his divine dialogues relating to the foundations of natural religion though his style be now in some measure obsolete and his speakers be marked with the academic stiffness of those times yet the dialogue is animated by a variety of character and a sprightliness of conversation beyond what are commonly met with in writings of this kind bishop berkeleys dialogues concerning the existence of matter do not attempt any display of characters but furnish an instance of a very abstract subject rendered clear and intelligible by means of conversation properly managed  i proceed next to make some observations on epistolary writing which possesses a kind of middle place between the serious and amusing species of composition epistolary writing appears at first view to stretch into a very wide field for there is no subject whatever on which one may not convey his thoughts to the public in the form of a letter lord shaftsbury for instance mr harris and several other writers have chosen to give this form to philosophical treatises but this is not sufficient to class such treatises under the head of epistolary composition though they bear in the title page a letter to a friend after the first address the friend disappears and we see that it is in truth the public with whom the author corresponds senecas epistles are of this sort there is no probability that they ever passed in correspondence as real letters they are no other than miscellaneous dissertations on moral subjects which the author for his convenience chose to put into the epistolary form even where one writes a real letter on some formal topic as of moral or religious consolation to a person under distress such as sir william temple has written to the countess of essex on the death of her daughter he is at liberty on such occasions to write wholly as a divine or as a philosopher and to assume the style and manner of one without reprehension we consider the author not as writing a letter but as composing a discourse suited particularly to the circumstances of some one person  epistolary writing becomes a distinct species of composition subject to the cognizance of criticism only or chiefly when it is of the easy and familiar kind when it is conversation carried on upon paper between two friends at a distance such an intercourse when well conducted may be rendered very agreeable to readers of taste if the subject of the letters be important they will be the more valuable even though there should be nothing very considerable in the subject yet if the spirit and turn of the correspondence be agreeable if they be written in a sprightly manner and with native grace and ease they may still be entertaining more especially if there be any thing to interest us in the characters of those who write them hence the curiosity which the public has always discovered concerning the letters of eminent persons we expect in them to discover somewhat of their real character it is childish indeed to expect that in letters we are to find the whole heart of the author unveiled concealment and disguise take place more or less in all human intercourse but still as letters from one friend to another make the nearest approach to conversation we may expect to see more of a character displayed in these than in other productions which are studied for public view we please ourselves with beholding the writer in a situation which allows him to be at his ease and to give vent occasionally to the overflowings of his heart  much therefore of the merit and the agreeableness of epistolary writing will depend on its introducing us into some acquaintance with the writer there if any where we look for the man not for the author its first and fundamental requisite is to be natural and simple for a stiff and labored manner is as bad in a letter as it is in conversation this does not banish sprightliness and wit these are graceful in letters just as they are in conversation when they flow easily and without being studied when employed so as to season not to cloy one who either in conversation or in letters affects to shine and to sparkle always will not please long the style of letters should not be too highly polished it ought to be neat and correct but no more all nicety about words betrays study and hence musical periods and appearances of number and harmony in arrangement should be carefully avoided in letters the best letters are commonly such as the authors have written with most facility what the heart or the imagination dictate always flows readily but where there is no subject to warm or interest these constraint appears and hence those lettersof mere compliment congratulation or affected condolance which have cost the authors most labor in composing and which for that reason they perhaps consider as their masterpieces never fail of being the most disagreeable and insipid to the readers  it ought at the same time to be remembered that the ease and simplicity which i have recommended in epistolary correspondence is not to be understood as importing entire carelessness in writing to the most intimate friend a certain degree of attention both to the subject and the style is requisite and becoming it is no more than what we owe both to ourselves and to the friend with whom we correspond a slovenly and neglected manner of writing is a disobliging mark of want of respect the liberty besides of writing letters with too careless a hand is apt to betray persons into imprudence in what they write the first requisite both in conversation and correspondence is to attend to all the proper decorums which our own character and that of others demand an imprudent expression in conversation may be forgotten and pass away but when we take the pen into our hand we must remember that litera scripta manet  plinys letters are one of the most celebrated collections which the ancients have given us in the epistolary way they are elegant and polite and exhibit a very pleasing and amiable view of the author but according to the vulgar phrase they smell too much of the lamp they are too elegant and fine and it is not easy to avoid thinking that the author is casting an eye toward the public when he is appearing to write only for his friends nothing indeed is more difficult than for an author who publishes his own letters to divest himself altogether of attention to the opinion of the world in what he says by which means he becomes much less agreeable than a man of parts would be if without any constraint of this sort he were writing to his intimate friend  ciceros epistles though not so showy as those of pliny are on several accounts a far more valuable collection indeed the most valuable collection of letters extant in any language they are letters of real business written to the greatest men of the age composed with purity and elegance but without the least affectation and what adds greatly to their merit written without any intention of being published to the world for it appears that cicero never kept copies of his own letters and we are wholly indebted to the care of his freedman tyro for the large collection that was made after his death of those which are now extant amounting to near a thousand see his letter to atticus which was written a year or two before his death in which he tells him in answer to some enquiries concerning his epistles that he had no collection of them and that tyro had only about seventy of them ad at       they contain the most authentic materials of the history of that age and are the last monuments which remain of rome in its free state the greatest part of them being written during that important crisis when the republic was on the point of ruin the most interesting situation perhaps which is to be found in the affairs of mankind to his intimate friends especially to atticus cicero lays open himself and his heart with entire freedom in the course of his correspondence with others we are introduced into acquaintance with several of the principal personages of rome and it is remarkable that most of ciceros correspondents as well as himself are elegant and polite writers which serves to heighten our idea of the taste and manners of that age  the most distinguished collection of letters in the english language is that of mr pope dean swift and their friends partly published in mr popes works and partly in those of dean swift this collection is on the whole an entertaining and agreeable one and contains much wit and ingenuity it is not however altogether free of the fault which i imputed to plinys epistles of too much study and refinement in the variety of letters from different persons contained in that collection we find many that are written with ease and a beautiful simplicity those of dr arbuthnot in particular always deserve that praise dean swifts also are unaffected and as a proof of their being so they exhibit his character fully with all its defects though it were to be wished for the honor of his memory that his epistolary correspondence had not been drained to the dregs by so many successive publications as have been given to the world several of lord bolingbrokes and of bishop atterburys letters are masterly the censure of writing letters in too artificial a manner falls heaviest on mr pope himself there is visibly more study and less of nature and the heart in his letters than in those of some of his correspondents he had formed himself on the manner of voiture and is too fond of writing like a wit his letters to ladies are full of affectation even in writing to his friends how forced an introduction is the following of a letter to mr addison i am more joyed at your return than i should be at that of the sun as much as i wish for him in this melancholy wet season but it is his fate too like yours to be displeasing to owls and obscene animals who cannot bear his luster how stiff a compliment is it which he pays to bishop atterbury though the noise and daily bustle for the public be now over i dare say you are still tendering its welfare as the sun in winter when seeming to retire from the world is preparing warmth and benedictions for a better season this sentence might be tolerated in a harangue but is very unsuitable to the style of one friend corresponding with another  the gaiety and vivacity of the french genius appear to much advantage in their letters and have given birth to several agreeable publications in the last age balzac and voiture were the two most celebrated epistolary writers balzacs reputation indeed soon declined on account of his swelling periods and pompous style but voiture continued long a favorite author his composition is extremely sparkling he shows a great deal of wit and can trifle in the most entertaining manner his only fault is that he is too open and professed a wit to be thoroughly agreeable as a letter writer the letters of madam de sevigne are now esteemed the most accomplished model of a familiar correspondence they turn indeed very much upon trifles the incidents of the day and the news of the town and they are overloaded with extravagant compliments and expressions of fondness to her favorite daughter but withal they show such perpetual sprightliness they contain such easy and varied narration and so many strokes of the most lively and beautiful painting perfectly free from any affectation that they are justly entitled to high praise the letters of lady mary wortley montague are not unworthy of being named after those of mad de sevigne they have much of the french ease and vivacity and retain more the character of agreeable epistolary style than perhaps any letters which have appeared in the english language  there remains to be treated of another species of composition in prose which comprehends a very numerous though in general a very insignificant class of writings known by the name of romances and novels these may at first view seem too insignificant to deserve that any particular notice should be taken of them but i cannot be of this opinion mr fletcher of salton in one of his tracts quotes it as the saying of a wise man that give him the making of all the ballads of a nation he would allow any one that pleased to make their laws the saying was founded on reflection and good sense and applies to the subject now before us for any kind of writing how trifling soever in appearance that obtains a general currency and especially that early preoccupies the imagination of the youth of both sexes must demand particular attention its influence is likely to be considerable both on the morals and taste of a nation  in fact fictitious histories might be employed for very useful purposes they furnish one of the best channels for conveying instruction for painting human life and manners for showing the errors into which we are betrayed by our passions for rendering virtue amiable and vice odious the effect of well contrived stories toward accomplishing these purposes is stronger than any effect that can be produced by simple and naked instruction and hence we find that the wisest men in all ages have more or less employed fables and fictions as the vehicles of knowledge these have ever been the basis of both epic and dramatic poetry it is not therefore the nature of this sort of writing considered in itself but the faulty manner of its execution that can expose it to any contempt lord bacon takes notice of our taste for fictitious history as a proof of the greatness and dignity of the human mind he observes very ingeniously that the objects of this world and the common traits of affairs which we behold going on in it do not fill the mind nor give it entire satisfaction we seek for something that shall expand the mind in a greater degree we seek for more heroic and illustrious deeds for more diversified and surprising events for a more splendid order of things a more regular and just distribution of rewards and punishments than what we find here because we meet not with these in true history we have recourse to fictitious we create worlds according to our fancy in order to gratify our capacious desires accommodando says that great philosopher rerum simu lachra ad animi desideria non submittendo animum rebus quod ratio facit et historia accommodating the appearances of things to the desires of the mind not bringing down the mind as history and philosophy do to the course of events  let us then since the subject wants neither dignity nor use make a few observations on the rise and progress of fictitious history and the different forms it has assumed in different countries  in all countries we find its origin very ancient the genius of the eastern nations in particular was from the earliest times much turned toward invention and the love of fiction their divinity their philosophy and their politics were clothed in fables and parables the indians the persians and arabians were all famous for their tales the arabian nights entertainments are the production of a romantic invention but of a rich and amusing imagination exhibiting a singular and curious display of manners and characters and beautified with a very humane morality among the ancient greeks we hear of the ionian and milesian tales but they are now perished and from any account that we have of them appear to have been of the loose and wanton kind some fictitious histories yet remain that were composed during the decline of the roman empire by apuleius achilles tatius and heliodorus bishop of trica in the  th century but none of them are considerable enough to merit particular criticism  during the dark ages this sort of writing assumed a new and very singular form and for a long while made a great figure in the world the martial spirit of those nations among whom the feudal government prevailed the establishment of single combat as an allowed method of deciding causes both of justice and honor the appointment of champions in the cause of women who could not maintain their own rights by the sword together with the institution of military tournaments in which different kingdoms vied with one another gave rise in those times to that mavelous system of chivalry which is one of the most singular appearances in the history of mankind upon this were founded those romances of knighterrantry which carried an ideal chivalry to a still more extravagant height than it had risen in fact there was displayed in them a new and very wonderful sort of world hardly bearing any resemblance to the world in which we dwell not only knights setting forth to redress all manner of wrongs but in every page magicians dragons and giants invulnerable men winged horses enchanted armor and enchanted castles adventures absolutely incredible yet suited to the gross ignorance of these ages and to the legends and superstitious notions concerning magic and necromancy which then prevailed this merit they had of being writings of the highly moral and heroic kind their knights were patterns not of courage merely but of religion generosity courtesy and fidelity and the heroines were no less distinguished for modesty delicacy and the utmost dignity of manners  these were the first compositions that received the name of romances the origin of this name is traced by mr huet the learned bishop of avranche to the provencal troubadoures a sort of storytellers and bards in the county of provence where there subsisted some remains of literature and poetry the language that prevailed in that country was a mixture of latin and gallic called the roman or romance language and their stories being written in that language hence it is said the name of romance which we now apply to all fictitious composition  the earliest of those romances is that which goes under the name of turpin the archbishop of rheims written in the   th century the subject is the achievements of charlemagne and his peers or paladins in driving the saracens out of france and part of spain the same subject which ariosto has taken for his celebrated poem of orlando furioso which is truly a chivalry romance as extravagant as any of the rest but partly heroic and partly comic embellished with the highest graces of poetry the romance of turpin was followed by amadis de gaul and many more of the same stamp the crusades both furnished new matter and increased the spirit for such writings the christians against the saracens made the common groundwork of them and from the   th to the   th century they continued to bewitch all europe in spain where the taste for this sort of writing had been most greedily caught the ingenious cervantes in the beginning of the last century contributed greatly to explode it and the abolition of tournaments the prohibition of single combat the disbelief of magic and enchantments and the change in general of manners throughout europe began to give a new turn to fictitious composition  then appeared the astraea of durfe the grand cyrus the clelia and cleopatra of mad scuderi the arcadia of sir philip sidney and other grave and stately compositions in the same style these may be considered as forming the second stage of romance writing the heroism and the gallantry the moral and virtuous turn of the chivalry romance were still preserved but the dragons the necromancers and the enchanted castles were banished and some small resemblance to human nature was introduced still however there was too much of the mavelous in them to please an age which now aspired to refinement the characters were discerned to be strained the style to be swollen the adventures incredible the books themselves were voluminous and tedious  hence this sort of composition soon assumed a third form and from magnificent heroic romance dwindled down to the familiar novel these novels both in france and england during the age of lewis xiv and king charles ii were in general of a trifling nature without the appearance of moral tendency or useful instruction since that time however somewhat better has been attempted and a degree of reformation introduced into the spirit of novel writing imitations of life and character have been made their principal object relations have been professed to be given of the behavior of persons in particular interesting situations such as may actually occur in life by means of which what is laudable or defective in character and in conduct may be pointed out and placed in a useful light upon this plan the french have produced some compositions of considerable merit gil blas by le sage is a book full of good sense and instructive knowledge of the world the works of marivaux especially his marianne discover great refinement of thought great penetration into human nature and paint with a very delicate pencil some of the nicest shades and features in the distinction of characters the nouvelle heloise of rousseau is a production of a very singular kind in many of the events which are related improbable and unnatural in some of the details tedious and for some of the scenes which are described justly blameable but withal for the power of eloquence for tenderness of sentiment for ardour of passion entitled to rank among the highest productions of fictitious history  in this kind of writing we are it must be confessed in great britain inferior to the french we neither relate so agreeably nor draw characters with so much delicacy yet we are not without some performances which discover the strength of the british genius no fiction in any language was ever better supported than the adventures of robinson crusoe while it is carried on with that appearance of truth and simplicity which takes a strong hold of the imagination of all readers it suggests at the same time very useful instruction by showing how much the native powers of man may be exerted for surmounting the difficulties of any external situation mr fieldings novels are highly distinguished for their humor a humor which if not of the most refined and delicate kind is original and peculiar to himself the characters which he draws are lively and natural and marked with the strokes of a bold pencil the general scope of his stories is favorable to humanity and goodness of heart and in tom jones his greatest work the artful conduct of the fable and the subserviency of all the incidents to the winding up of the whole deserve much praise the most moral of all our novel writers is richardson the author of clarissa a writer of excellent intentions and of very considerable capacity and genius did he not possess the unfortunate talent of spinning out pieces of amusement into an immensurable length the trivial performances which daily appear in public under the title of lives adventures and histories by anonymous authors if they be often innocent yet are most commonly insipid and though in the general it ought to be admitted that characteristical novels formed upon nature and upon life without extravagance and without licentiousness might furnish an agreeable and useful entertainment to the mind yet according as these writings have been for the most part conducted it must also be confessed that they oftener tend to dissipation and idleness than to any good purpose let us now therefore make our retreat from these regions of fiction  lecture xxxviii nature of poetry  its origin and progress  versification i have now finished my observations on the different kinds of writing in prose what remains is to treat of poetical composition before entering on the consideration of any of its particular kinds i design this lecture as an introduction to the subject of poetry in general wherein i shall treat of its nature give an account of its rise and origin and make some observations on versification or poetical numbers  our first enquiry must be what is poetry and wherein does it differ from prose the answer to this question is not so easy as might at first be imagined and critics have differed and disputed much concerning the proper definition of poetry some have made its essence to consist in fiction and support their opinion by the authority of aristotle and plato but this is certainly too limited a definition for though fiction may have a great share in many poetical compositions yet many subjects of poetry may not be feigned as where the poet describes objects which actually exist or pours forth the real sentiments of his own heart others have made the characteristic of poetry to lie in imitation but this is altogether loose for several other arts imitate as well as poetry and an imitation of human manners and characters may be carried on in the humblest prose no less than in the most lofty poetic strain  the most just and comprehensive definition which i think can be given of poetry is that it is the language of passion or of enlivened imagination formed most commonly into regular numbers the historian the orator the philosopher address themselves for the most part primarily to the understanding their direct aim is to inform to persuade or to instruct but the primary aim of a poet is to please and to move and therefore it is to the imagination and the passions that he speaks he may and he ought to have it in his view to instruct and to reform but it is indirectly and by pleasing and moving that he accomplishes this end his mind is supposed to be animated by some interesting object which fires his imagination or engages his passions and which of course communicates to his style a peculiar elevation suited to his ideas very different from that mode of expression which is natural to the mind in its calm ordinary state i have added to my definition that this language of passion or imagination is formed most commonly into regular numbers because though versification be in general the exterior distinction of poetry yet there are some forms of verse so loose and familiar as to be hardly distinguishable from prose such as the verse of terences comedies and there is also a species of prose so measured in its cadence and so much raised in its tone as to approach very near to poetical numbers such as the telemachus of fenelon and the english translation of ossian the truth is verse and prose on some occasions run into one another like light and shade it is hardly possible to determine the exact limit where eloquence ends and poetry begins nor is there any occasion for being very precise about the boundaries as long as the nature of each is understood these are the minutiae of criticism concerning which frivolous writers are always disposed to squabble but which deserve not any particular discussion the truth and justness of the definition which i have given of poetry will appear more fully from the account which i am now to give of its origin and which will tend to throw light on much of what i am afterward to deliver concerning its various kinds  the greeks ever fond of attributing to their own nation the invention of all sciences and arts have ascribed the origin of poetry to orpheus linus and musaeus there were perhaps such persons as these who were the first distinguished bards in the grecian countries but long before such names were heard of and among nations where they were never known poetry existed it is a great error to imagine that poetry and music are arts which belong only to polished nations they have their foundation in the nature of man and belong to all nations and to all ages though like other arts founded in nature they have been more cultivated and from a concurrence of favorable circumstances carried to greater perfection in some countries than in others in order to explore the rise of poetry we must have recourse to the deserts and the wilds we must go back to the age of hunters and of shepherds to the highest antiquity and to the simplest form of manners among mankind  it has been often said and the concurring voice of all antiquity affirms that poetry is older than prose but in what sense this seemingly strange paradox holds true has not always been well understood there never certainly was any period of society in which men conversed together in poetical numbers it was in very humble and scanty prose as we may easily believe that the first tribes carried on intercourse among themselves relating to the wants and necessities of life but from the very beginning of society there were occasions on which they met together for feasts sacrifices and public assemblies and on all such occasions it is well known that music song and dance made their principal entertainment it is chiefly in america that we have had the opportunity of being made acquainted with men in their savage state we learn from the particular and concurring accounts of travelers that among all the nations of that vast continent especially among the northern tribes with whom we have had most intercourse music and song are at all their meetings carried on with an incredible degree of enthusiasm that the chiefs of the tribe are those who signalize themselves most on such occasions that it is in songs they celebrate their religious rites that by these they lament their public and private calamities the death of friends or the loss of warriors express their joy on their victories celebrate the great actions of their nation and their heroes excite each other to perform brave exploits in war or to suffer death and torments with unshaken constancy  here then we see the first beginnings of poetic composition in those rude effusions which the enthusiasm of fancy or passion suggested to untaught men when roused by interesting events and by their meeting together in public assemblies two particulars would early distinguish this language of song from that in which they conversed on the common occurrences of life namely an unusual arrangement of words and the employment of bold figures of speech it would invert words or change them from that order in which they are commonly placed to that which most suited the train in which they rose in the speakers imagination or which was most accommodated to the cadence of the passion by which he was moved under the influence too of any strong emotion objects do not appear to us such as they really are but such as passion makes us see them we magnify and exaggerate we seek to interest all others in what causes our emotion we compare the least things to the greatest we call upon the absent as well as the present and even address ourselves to things inanimate hence in congruity with those various movements of the mind arise those turns of expression which we now distinguish by the learned names of hyperbole prosopopoeia simile etc but which are no other than the native original language of poetry among the most barbarous nations  man is both a poet and a musician by nature the same impulse which prompted the enthusiastic poetic style prompted a certain melody or modulation of sound suited to the emotions of joy or grief of admiration love or anger there is a power in sound which partly from nature partly from habit and association makes such pathetic impressions on the fancy as delight even the most wild barbarians music and poetry therefore had the same rise they were prompted by the same occasions they were united in song and as long as they continued united they tended without doubt mutually to heighten and exalt each others power the first poets sung their own verses and hence the beginning of what we call versification or words arranged in a more artful order than prose so as to be suited to some tune or melody the liberty of transposition or inversion which the poetic style as i observed would naturally assume made it easier to form the words into some sort of numbers that fell in with the music of the song very harsh and uncouth we may easily believe these numbers would be at first but the pleasure was felt it was studied and versification by degrees passed into an art  it appears from what has been said that the first compositions which were either recorded by writing or transmitted by tradition could be no other than poetical compositions no other but these could draw the attention of men in their rude uncivilized state indeed they knew no other cool reasoning and plain discourse had no power to attract savage tribes addicted only to hunting and war there was nothing that could either rouse the speaker to pour himself forth or draw the crowd to listen but the high powers of passion of music and of song this vehicle therefore and no other could be employed by chiefs and legislators when they meant to instruct or to animate their tribes there is likewise a farther reason why such compositions only could be transmitted to posterity because before writing was invented songs only could last and be remembered the ear gave assistance to the memory by the help of numbers fathers repeated and sung them to their children and by this oral tradition of national ballads was conveyed all the historical knowledge and all the instruction of the first ages  the earliest accounts which history gives us concerning all nations bear testimony to these facts in the first ages of greece priests philosophers and statesmen all delivered their instructions in poetry apollo orpheus and amphion their most ancient bards are represented as the first tamers of mankind the first founders of law and civilisation minos and thales sung to the lyre the laws which they composed strabo l  0  and till the age immediately preceding that of herodotus history had appeared in no other form than that of poetical tales  in the same manner among all other nations poets and songs are the first objects that make their appearance among the scythian or gothic nations many of their kings and leaders were scalders or poets and it is from their runic songs that the most early writers of their history such as saxogrammaticus acknowledge that they had derived their chief information among the celtic tribes in gaul britain and ireland we know in what admiration their bards were held and how great influence they possessed over the people they were both poets and musicians as all the first poets in every country were they were always near the person of the chief or sovereign they recorded all his great exploits they were employed as the ambassadors between contending tribes and their persons were held sacred  from this deduction it follows that as we have reason to look for poems and songs among the antiquities of all countries so we may expect that in the strain of these there will be a remarkable resemblance during the primitive periods of every country the occasions of their being composed are every where nearly the same the praises of gods and heroes the celebration of famed ancestors the recital of martial deeds songs of victory and songs of lamentation over the the misfortunes and death of their countrymen occur among all nations and the same enthusiasm and fire the same wild and irregular but animated composition concise and glowing style bold and extravagant figures of speech are the general distinguishing characters of all the most ancient original poetry that strong hyperbolical manner which we have been long accustomed to call the oriental manner of poetry because some of the earliest poetical productions came to us from the east is in truth no more oriental than occidental it is characteristical of an age rather than of a country and belongs in some measure to all nations at that period which first gives rise to music and to song mankind never resemble each other so much as they do in the beginnings of society its subsequent revolutions give birth to the principal distinctions of character among nations and divert into channels widely separated that current of human genius and manners which descends originally from one spring  diversity of climate and of manner of living will however occasion some diversity in the strain of the first poetry of nations chiefly according as those nations are of a more ferocious or of a more gentle spirit and according as they advance faster or slower in the arts of civilization thus we find all the remains of the ancient gothic poetry remarkable fierce and breathing nothing but slaughter and blood while the peruvian and the chinese songs turned from the earliest times upon milder subjects the celtic poetry in the days of ossian though chiefly of the martial kind yet had attained a considerable mixture of tenderness and refinement in consequence of the long cultivation of poetry among the celtae by means of a series and succession of bards which had been established for ages so lucan informs us vos quoque qui fortes animos belloque peremptos laudibus in longum vates diffunditis aevum plurima securi fudistis carmina bardi you too ye bards whom sacred raptures fire to chaunt your heroes to your countrys lyre who consecrate in your immortal strain brave patriot souls in righteous battle slain securely now the useful task renew and noblest themes in deathless songs pursue row  l      among the grecian nations their early poetry appears to have soon received a philosophical cast from what we are informed concerning the subjects of orpheus linus and musaeus who treated of creation and of chaos of the generation of the world and of the rise of things and we know that the greeks advanced sooner to philosophy and proceeded with a quicker pace in all the arts of refinement than most other nations  the arabians and the persians have always been the greatest poets of the east and among them as among other nations poetry was the earliest vehicle of all their learning and instruction vid voyages de chardin chap de la poesy des persans  the ancient arabs we are informed vid preliminary discourse to sales translation of the koran  valued themselves much on their metrical compositions which were of two sorts the one they compared to loose pearls and the other to pearls strung in the former the sentences or verses were without connection and their beauty arose from the elegance of the expression and the acuteness of the sentiment the moral doctrines of the persians were generally comprehended in such independent proverbial apothegms formed into verse in this respect they bear a considerable resemblance to the proverbs of solomon a great part of which book consists of unconnected poetry like the loose pearls of the arabians the same form of composition appears also in the book of job the greeks seem to have been the first who introduced a more regular structure and closer connection of parts into their poetical writings  during the infancy of poetry all the different kinds of it lay confused and were mingled in the same composition according as inclination enthusiasm or casual incidents directed the poets strain in the progress of society and arts they began to assume those different regular forms and to be distinguished by those different names under which we now know them but in the first rude state of poetical effusions we can easily discern the seeds and beginnings of all the kinds of regular poetry odes and hymns of every sort would naturally be among the first compositions according as the bards were moved by religious feelings by exultation resentment love or any other warm sentiment to pour themselves forth in song plaintive or elegiac poetry would as naturally arise from lamentations over their deceased friends the recital of the achievements of their heroes and their ancestors gave birth to what we now call epic poetry and as not content with simply reciting these they would infallibly be led at some of their public meetings to represent them by introducing different bards speaking in the character of their heroes and answering each other we find in this the first outlines of tragedy or dramatic writing  none of these kinds of poetry however were in the first ages of society properly distinguished or separated as they are now from each other indeed not only were the different kinds of poetry then mixed together but all that we now call letters or composition of any kind was then blended in one mass at first history eloquence and poetry were all the same whoever wanted to move or to persuade to inform or to entertain his countrymen and neighbors whatever was the subject accompanied his sentiments and tales with the melody of song this was the case in that period of society when the character and occupations of the husbandman and the builder the warrior and the statesman were united in one person when the progress of society brought on a separation of the different arts and professions of civil life it led also by degrees to a separation of the different literary provinces from each other  the art of writing was in process of time invented records of past transactions began to be kept men occupied with the subjects of policy and useful arts wished now to be instructed and informed as well as moved they reasoned and reflected upon the affairs of life and were interested by what was real not fabulous in past transactions the historian therefore now laid aside the buskins of poetry he wrote in prose and attempted to give a faithful and judicious relation of former events the philosopher addressed himself chiefly to the understanding the orator studied to persuade by reasoning and retained more or less of the ancient passionate and glowing style according as it was conducive to his purpose poetry became now a separate art calculated chiefly to please and confined generally to such subjects as related to the imagination and passions even its earliest companion music was in a great measure divided from it  these separations brought all the literary arts into a more regular form and contributed to the exact and accurate cultivation of each poetry however in its ancient original condition was perhaps more vigorous than it is in its modern state it included then the whole burst of the human mind the whole exertion of its imaginative faculties it spoke then the language of passion and no other for to passion it owed its birth prompted and inspired by objects which to him seemed great by events which interested his country or his friends the early bard arose and sung he sung indeed in wild and disorderly strains but they were the native effusions of his heart they were the ardent conceptions of admiration or resentment of sorrow or friendship which he poured forth it is no wonder therefore that in the rude and artless strain of the first poetry of all nations we should often find somewhat that captivates and transports the mind in after ages when poetry became a regular art studied for reputation and for gain authors began to affect what they did not feel composing coolly in their closets they endeavored to imitate passion rather than to express it they tried to force their imagination into raptures or to supply the defect of native warmth by those artificial ornaments which might give composition a splendid appearance  the separation of music from poetry produced consequences not favorable in some respects to poetry and in many respects hurtful to music see dr browns dissertation on the rise union and separation of poetry and music  as long as they remained united music enlivened and animated poetry and poetry gave force and expression to musical sound the music of that early period was beyond doubt extremely simple and must have consisted chiefly of such pathetic notes as the voice could adapt to the words of the song musical instruments such as flutes and pipes and a lyre with a very few strings appear to have been early invented among some nations but no more was intended by these instruments than simply to accompany the voice and to heighten the melody of song the poets strain was always heard and from many circumstances it appears that among the ancient greeks as well as among other nations the bard sung his verses and played upon his harp or lyre at the same time in this state the art of music was when it produced all those great effects of which we read so much in an ancient story and certain it is that from simple music only and from music accompanied with verse or song we are to look for strong expression and powerful influence over the human mind when instrumental music came to be studied as a separate art divested of the poets song and formed into the artificial and intricate combinations of harmony it lost all its ancient power of inflaming the hearers with strong emotions and sunk into an art of mere amusement among polished and luxurious nations  still however poetry preserves in all countries some remains of its first and original connection with music by being uttered in song it was formed into numbers or into an artificial arrangement of words and syllables very different in different countries but such as to the inhabitants of each seemed most melodious and agreeable in sound whence arises that great characteristic of poetry which we now call verse a subject which comes next to be treated of  it is a subject of a curious nature but as i am sensible that were i to pursue it as far as my inclination leads it would give rise to discussions which the greater part of readers would consider as minute i shall confine myself to a few observations upon english versification  nations whose language and pronunciation were of a musical kind rested their versification chiefly upon the quantities that is the length or shortness of their syllables others who did not make the quantities of their syllables be so distinctly perceived in pronouncing them rested the melody of their verse upon the number of syllables it contained upon the proper disposition of accents and pauses in it and frequently upon that return of corresponding sounds which we call rhyme the former was the case with the greeks and romans the latter is the case with us and with most modern nations among the greeks and romans every syllable or the far greatest number at least was known to have a fixed and determined quantity and their manner of pronouncing rendered this so sensible to the ear that a long syllable was counted precisely equal in time to two short ones upon this principle the number of syllables contained in their hexameter verse was allowed to vary it may extend to    it can contain when regular no fewer than    but the musical time was notwithstanding precisely the same in every hexameter verse and was always equal to that of    long syllables in order to ascertain the regular time of every verse and the proper mixture and succession of long and short syllables which ought to compose it were invented what the grammarians call metrical feet dactyles spondees iambus etc by these measures was tried the accuracy of composition in every line and whether is was so constructed as to fulfill its proper melody it was requisite for instance that the hexameter verse should have the quantity of its syllables so disposed that it could be scanned or measured by six metrical feet which might be either dactyles or spondees as the musical time of both these is the same with this restriction only that the fifth foot was regularly to be a dactyle and the last a spondee some writers imagine that the feet in latin verse were intended to correspond to bars in music and to form musical intervals or distinctions sensible to the ear in the pronunciation of the line had this been the case every kind of verse must have had a peculiar order of feet appropriated to it but the common prosodies show that there are several forms of latin verse which are capable of being measured indifferently by a series of feet of very different kinds for instance what is called the asclepedoean verse in which the first ode of horace is written may be scanned either by a spondeus two choriambuss and a pyrrichius or by a spondeus a dactylus succeeded by a caesura and two dactyluss the common pentameter and some other forms of verse admit the like varieties and yet the melody of the verse remains always the same though it be scanned by different feet this proves that the metrical feet were not sensible in the pronunciation of the line but were intended only to regulate its construction or applied as measures to try whether the succession of long and short syllables was such as suited the melody of the verse and as feet of different kinds could sometimes be applied for this purpose hence it happened that some forms of verse were capable of being scanned in different ways for measuring the hexameter line no other feet were found so proper as dactyles and spondees and therefore by these it is uniformly scanned but no ear is sensible of the termination of each foot in reading an hexameter line from a misapprehension of this matter i apprehend that confusion has sometimes arisen among writers in treating of the prosody both of latin and of english verse   the introduction of these feet into english verse would be altogether out of place for the genius of our language corresponds not in this respect to the greek or latin i say not that we have no regard to quantity or to long and short in pronouncing many words we have especially our words consisting of several syllables where the quantity or the long and short syllables are invariably fixed but great numbers we have also where the quantity is left altogether loose this is the case with a great part of our words consisting of two syllables and with almost all our monosyllables in general the difference made between long and short syllables in our manner of pronouncing them is so very inconsiderable and so much liberty is left us for making them either long or short at pleasure that mere quantity is of very little effect in english versification the only perceptible difference among our syllables arises from some of them being uttered with that stronger percussion of voice which we call accent this accent does not always make the syllable longer but gives it more force of sound only and it is upon a certain order and succession of accented and unaccented syllables infinitely more than upon their being long or short that the melody of our verse depends if we take any of mr popes lines and in reciting them alter the quantity of the syllables as far as our quantities are sensible the music of the verse will not be much injured whereas if we do not accent the syllables according as the verse dictates its melody will be totally destroyed see this well illustrated in lord monboddos treatise of the origin and progress of language vol ii under the head of the prosody of language he shows that this is not only the constitution of our own verse but that by our manner of reading latin verse we make its music nearly the same for we certainly do not pronounce it according to the ancient quantities so as to make the musical time of one long syllable equal to two short ones but according to a succession of accented and unaccented syllables only mixed in a ratio different from that of our own verse no roman could possibly understand our pronunciation   our english heroic verse is of what may be called an iambic structure that is composed of a succession nearly alternate of syllables not short and long but unaccented and accented with regard to the place of these accents however some liberty is admitted for the sake of variety very often though not always the line begins with an unaccented syllable and sometimes in the course of it two unaccented syllables follow each other but in general there are either five or four accented syllables in each line the number of syllables is ten unless where an alexandrian verse is occasionally admitted in verses not alexandrian instances occur where the line appears to have more than the limited number but in such instances i apprehend it will be found that some of the liquid syllables are so slurred in pronouncing as to bring the verse with respect to its effect upon the ear within the usual bounds  another essential circumstance in the constitution of our verse is the caesural pause which falls toward the middle of each line some pause of this kind dictated by the melody is found in the verse of most nations it is found as might be shown in the latin hexameter in the french heroic verse it is very sensible that is a verse of twelve syllables and in every line just after the sixth syllable there falls regularly and indispensably a caesural pause dividing the line into two equal hemistichs for example in the first lines of boileaus epistle to the king jeune and vaillant heroes dont la haute sagesse nest point le fruit tardif dune lent vieilesse qui seul sans ministre a lexample des dieux soutiens tout par toimeme and vois tous par ses yeux in this train all their verses proceed the one half of the line always answering to the other and the same chime returning incessantly on the ear without intermission or change which is certainly a defect in their verse and unfits it so very much for the freedom and dignity of heroic poetry on the other hand it is a distinguishing advantage of our english verse that it allows the pause to be varied through four different syllables in the line the pause may fall after the  th the  th the  th or the  th syllable and according as the pause is placed after one or other of these syllables the melody of the verse is much changed its air and cadence are diversified by this means uncommon richness and variety are added to english versification  when the pause falls earliest that is after the  th syllable the briskest melody is thereby formed and the most spirited air given to the line in the following lines of the rape of the lock mr pope has with exquisite propriety suited the construction of the verse to the subject on her white breast a sparkling cross she wore whis jews might kiss and infidels adore her lively looks a sprightly mind disclose quick as her eyes and as unfixd as those favors to none to all she smiles extends often she rejects but never once offends   when the pause falls after the  th syllable which divides the line into two equal portions the melody is sensibly altered the verse loses that brisk and sprightly air which it had with the former pause and becomes more smooth gentle and flowing eternal sunshine of the spotless mind each prayer accepted and each wish resigned   when the pause proceeds to follow the  th syllable the tenor of the music becomes solemn and grave the verse marches now with a more slow and measured pace than in any of the two former cases the wrath of peleus son the direful spring of all the grecian woes o goddess sing   but the grave solemn cadence becomes still more sensible when the pause falls after the  th syllable which is the nearest place to the end of the line that it can occupy this kind of verse occurs the seldomest but has a happy effect in diversifying the melody it produces that slow alexandrian air which is finely suited to a close and for this reason such lines almost never occur together but are used in finishing the couplet and in the smooth description murmur still long loved adored ideas all adieu   i have taken my examples from verses in rhyme because in these our versification is subjected to the strictest law as blank verse is of a freer kind and naturally is read with less cadence or tone the pauses in it and the effect of them are not always so sensible to the ear it is constructed however entirely upon the same principles with respect to the place of the pause there are some who in order to exalt the variety and the power of our heroic verse have maintained that it admits of musical pauses not only after those four syllables where i assigned their place but after any one syllable in the verse indifferently where the sense directs it to be placed this in my opinion is the same thing as to maintain that there is no pause at all belonging to the natural melody of the verse since according to this notion the pause is formed entirely by the meaning not by the music but this i apprehend to be contrary both to the nature of versification and to the experience of every good ear in the italian heroic verse employed by tasso in his gierusalemme and ariosto in his orlando the pauses are of the same varied nature with those which i have shown to belong to english versification and fall after the same four syllables in the line marmontel in his poetique francoise vol i p     takes notice that this construction of verse is common to the italians and the english and defends the uniformity of the french caesural pause upon this ground that the alteration of masculine and feminine rhymes furnishes sufficient variety to the french poetry whereas the change of movement occasioned by the four different pauses in english and italian verse produces according to him too great diversity on the head of pauses in english versification see the elements of criticism chap    sect    those certainly are the happiest lines wherein the pause prompted by the melody coincides in some degree with that of the sense or at least does not tend to spoil or interrupt the meaning wherever any opposition between the music and the sense chances to take place i observed before in treating of pronunciation or delivery that the proper method of reading these lines is to read them according as the sense dictates neglecting or slurring the caesural pause which renders the line less graceful indeed but however does not entirely destroy its sound  our blank verse possesses great advantages and is indeed a noble bold and disencumbered species of versification the principal defect in rhyme is the full close which it forces upon the ear at the end of every couplet blank verse is freed from this and allows the lines to run into each other with as great liberty as the latin hexameter permits perhaps with greater hence it is particularly suited to subjects of dignity and force which demand more free and manly numbers than rhyme the constraint and strict regularity of rhyme are unfavourable to the sublime or to the highly pathetic strain an epic poem or a tragedy would be fettered and degraded by it it is best adapted to compositions of a temperate strain where no particular vehemence is required in the sentiments nor great sublimity in the style such as pastorals elegies epistles satyrs etc to these it communicates that degree of elevation which is proper for them and without any other assistance sufficiently distinguishes the style from prose he who should write such poems in blank verse would render his work harsh and unpleasing in order to support a poetical style he would be obliged to affect a pomp of language unsuitable to the subject  though i join in opinion with those who think that rhyme finds its proper place in the middle but not in the higher regions of poetry i can by no means join in the invectives which some have poured out against it as if it were a mere barbarous gingling of sounds fit only for children and owing to nothing but the corruption of taste in the monkish ages rhyme might indeed be barbarous in latin or greek verse because these languages by the sonorousness of their words by their liberty of transposition and inversion by their fixed quantities and musical pronunciation could carry on the melody of verse without its aid but it does not follow that therefore it must be barbarous in the english language which is destitute of these advantages every language has powers and graces and music peculiar to itself and what is becoming in one would be ridiculous in another rhyme was barbarous in latin and an attempt to construct english verses after the form of hexameters and pentameters and sapphics is as barbarous among us it is not true that rhyme is merely a monkish invention on the contrary it has obtained under different forms in the versification of most known nations it is found in the ancient poetry of the northern nations of europe it is said to be found among the arabs the persians the indians and the americans this shows that there is something in the return of similar sounds which is grateful to the ears of most part of mankind and if any one after reading mr popes rape of the lock or eloisa to abelard shall not admit our rhyme with all its varieties of pauses to carry both elegance and sweetness of sound his ear must be pronounced to be of a very peculiar kind  the present form of our english heroic rhyme in couplets is a modern species of versification the measure generally used in the days of queen elizabeth king james and king charles i was the stanza of eight lines such as spencer employs borrowed from the italian a measure very constrained and artificial waller was the first who brought couplets into vogue and dryden afterward established the usage waller first smoothed our verse dryden perfected it mr popes versification has a peculiar character it is flowing and smooth in the highest degree far more labored and correct than that of any who went before him he introduced one considerable change into heroic verse by totally throwing aside the triplets or three lines rhyming together in which mr dryden abounded drydens versification however has very great merit and like all his productions has much spirit mixed with carelessness if not so smooth and correct as popes it is however more varied and easy he subjects himself less to the rule of closing the sense with the couplet and frequently takes the liberty of making his couplets run into one another with somewhat of the freedom of blank verse  lecture xxxix pastoral poetry  lyric poetry in the last lecture i gave an account of the rise and progress of poetry and made some observations on the nature of english versification i now proceed to treat of the chief kinds of poetical composition and of the critical rules that relate to them i shall follow that order which is most simple and natural beginning with the lesser forms of poetry and ascending from them to the epic and dramatic as the most dignified this lecture shall be employed on pastoral and lyric poetry  though i begin with the consideration of pastoral poetry it is not because i consider it as one of the earliest forms of poetical composition on the contrary i am of opinion that it was not cultivated as a distinct species or subject of writing until society had advanced in refinement most authors have indeed indulged the fancy that because the life which mankind at first led was rural therefore their first poetry was pastoral or employed in the celebration of rural scenes and objects i make no doubt that it would borrow many of its images and allusions from those natural objects with which men were best acquainted but i make as little doubt that the calm and tranquil scenes of rural felicity were not by any means the first objects which inspired that strain of composition which we now call poetry it was inspired in the first periods of every nation by events and objects which roused mens passions or at least awakened their wonder and admiration the actions of their gods and heroes their own exploits in war the successes or misfortunes of their countrymen and friends furnished the first themes to the bards of every country what was of a pastoral kind in their compositions was incidental only they did not think of choosing for their theme the tranquillity and the pleasures of the country as long as these were daily and familiar objects to them it was not till men had begun to be assembled in great cities after the distinctions of rank and station were formed and the bustle of courts and large societies was known that pastoral poetry assumed its present form men then began to look back upon the more simple and innocent life which their forefathers led or which at least they fancied them to have led they looked back upon it with pleasure and in those rural scenes and pastoral occupations imagining a degree of felicity to take place superior to what they now enjoyed conceived the idea of celebrating it in poetry it was in the court of king ptolomy that theocritus wrote the first pastorals with which we are acquainted and in the court of augustus he was imitated by virgil  but whatever may have been the origin of pastoral poetry it is undoubtedly a natural and very agreeable form of poetical composition it recalls to our imagination those gay scenes and pleasing views of nature which commonly are the delight of our childhood and youth and to which in more advanced years the greatest part of men recur with pleasure it exhibits to us a life with which we are accustomed to associate the ideas of peace of leisure and of innocence and therefore we readily set open our heart to such representations as promise to banish from our thoughts the cares of the world and to transport us into calm elysian regions at the same time no subject bids fairer for being favorable to poetry amidst rural objects nature presents on all hands the finest field for description and nothing appears to flow more of its own accord into poetical numbers than rivers and mountains meadows and hills flocks and trees and shepherds void of care hence this species of poetry has at all times allured many readers and excited many writers but notwithstanding those advantages it possesses it will appear from what i have farther to observe upon it that there is hardly any species of poetry which is more difficult to be carried to perfection or in which few writers have excelled  pastoral life may be considered in three different views either such as it now actually is when the state of shepherds is reduced to be a mean servile and laborious state when their employments are become disagreeable and their ideas gross and low or such as we may suppose it once to have been in the more early and simple ages when it was a life of ease and abundance when the wealth of men consisted chiefly in flocks and herds and the shepherd though unrefined in his manners was respectable in his state or lastly such as it never was and never can in reality be when to the ease innocence and simplicity of the early ages we attempt to add the polished taste and cultivated manners of modern times of these three states the first is too gross and mean the last too refined and unnatural to be made the groundwork of pastoral poetry either of these extremes is a rock upon which the poet will split if he approach too near it we shall be disgusted if he give us too much of the servile employments and low ideas of actual peasants as theocritus is censured for having sometimes done and if like some of the french and italian writers of pastorals he makes his shepherds discourse as if they were courtiers and scholars he then retains the name only but wants the spirit of pastoral poetry  he must therefore keep in the middle station between these he must form to himself the idea of a rural state such as in certain periods of society may have actually taken place where there was ease equality and innocence where shepherds were gay and agreeable without being learned or refined and plain and artless without being gross and wretched the great charm of pastoral poetry arises from the view which it exhibits of the tranquillity and happiness of a rural life this pleasing illusion therefore the poet must carefully maintain he must display to us all that is agreeable in that state but hide whatever is displeasing in the following beautiful lines of the first ecologue virgil has in the true spirit of a pastoral poet brought together as agreeable an assemblage of images of rural pleasure as can any where be found fortunate senex hic inter flumina nota et fontes sacros frigus captabis opacum hinc tibi quae semper vicino ab limite sepes hyblaeis apibus florem depasta salicti saepe levi somnum suadebit inire susurro hinc alta sub rupe canet frondator ad auras nec tamen interea raucae tua cura palumbes nec gemere aeria cessabit turtur ab ulmo happy old man here mid the accustomed streams and sacred springs you will shun the scorching beams while from yon willow fence thy pastures bound the bees that suck their flowery stores around shall sweetly mingle with the whispering boughs their lulling murmurs and invite repose while from steep rocks the pruners song is heard nor the soft cooing dove thy favorite bird meanwhile shall cease to breathe her melting strain nor turtles from the aerial elms to plain warton  let him paint its simplicity and innocence to the full but cover its rudeness and misery distresses indeed and anxieties he may attribute to it for it would be perfectly unnatural to suppose any condition of human life to be without them but they must be of such a nature as not to shock the fancy with any thing peculiarly disgusting in the pastoral life the shepherd may well be afflicted for the displeasure of his mistress or for the loss of a favorite lamb it is a sufficient recommendation of any state to have only such evils as these to deplore in short it is the pastoral life somewhat embellished and beautified at least seen on its fairest side only that the poet ought to present to us but let him take care that in embellishing nature he does not altogether disguise her or pretend to join with rural simplicity and happiness such improvements as are unnatural and foreign to it if it be not exactly real life which he presents to us it must however be somewhat that resembles it this in my opinion is the general idea of pastoral poetry but in order to examine it more particularly let us consider first the scenery next the characters and lastly the subjects and actions which this sort of composition should exhibit  as to the scene it is clear that it must always be laid in the country and much of the poets merit depends on describing it beautifully virgil is in this respect excelled by theocritus whose descriptions of natural beauties are richer and more picturesque than those of the other what rural scenery for instance can be painted in more lively colors than the following description exhibits                theocrit idyll vii      on soft beds recline of lentisk and young branches of the vine poplars and elms above their foliage spread lent a cool shade and waved the breezy head below a stream from the nymphs sacred cave in free meanders led its murmuring wave in the warm sunbeams verdant shades among shrill grasshoppers renewed their plaintive song at distance far concealed in shades alone sweet philomela poured her tuneful moan the lark the goldfinch warbled lays of love and sweetly pensive cood the turtle dove while honey bees for ever on the wing hummd round the flowers or sipt the silver spring the rich ripe season gratified the sense with summers sweets and autumns redolence apples and pears lay strewed in heaps around and the plums loaded branches kissed the ground fawkes  in every pastoral a scene or rural prospect should be distinctly drawn and set before us it is not enough that we have those unmeaning groupes of violets and roses of birds and brooks and breezes which our common pastoralmongers throw together and which are perpetually recurring upon us without variation a good poet ought to give us such a landscape as a painter could copy after his objects must be particularised the stream the rock or the tree must each of them stand forth so as to make a figure in the imagination and to give us a pleasing conception of the place where we are a single object happily introduced will sometimes distinguish and characterise a whole scene such as the antique rustic sepulcher a very beautiful object in a landscape which virgil has set before us and which he has taken from theocritus hinc adeo media est nobis via jamque sepulchrum incipit apparere bianoris hic ubi densas agricolae stringunt frondes  ecl ix  to our mid journey are we come i see the top of old bianors tomb here maeris where the swains thick branches prune and strew their leaves our voices let us tune warton not only in professed descriptions of the scenery but in the frequent allusions to natural objects which occur of course in pastorals the poet must above all things study variety he must diversify his face of nature by presenting to us new images or otherwise he will soon become insipid with those known topics of description which were original it is true in the first poets who copied them from nature but which are now worn threadbare by incessant imitation it is also incumbent on him to suit the scenery to the subject of the pastoral and according as it is of a gay or a melancholy kind to exhibit nature under such forms as may correspond with the emotions or sentiments which he describes thus virgil in his second eclogue which contains the lamentation of a despairing lover gives with propriety a gloomy appearance to the scene tantum inter densas umbrosa cacumina fagos assidue veniebat ibi haec incondita solus montibus and sylvis studio jactabat inani mid shades of thickest beech he pined alone to the wild woods and mountains made his moan still day by day in incoherent strains twas all he could despairing told his pains warton    with regard to the characters or persons which are proper to be introduced into pastorals it is not enough that they be persons residing in the country the adventures or the discourses of courtiers or citizens in the country are not what we look for in such writings we expect to be entertained by shepherds or persons wholly engaged in rural occupations whose innocence and freedom from the cares of the world may in our imagination form an agreeable contrast with the manners and characters of those who are engaged in the bustle of life  one of the principal difficulties which here occurs has been already hinted that of keeping the exact medium between too much rusticity on the one hand and too much resinement on the other the shepherd assuredly must be plain and unaffected in his manner of thinking on all subjects an amiable simplicity must be the groundwork of his character at the same time there is no necessity for his being dull and insipid he may have good sense and reflection he may have sprightliness and vivacity he may have very tender and delicate feelings since these are more or less the portion of men in all ranks of life and since undoubtedly there was much genius in the world before there were learning or arts to refine it but then he must not subtilise he must not deal in general reflections and abstract reasoning and still less in the points and conceits of an affected gallantry which surely belong not to his character and situation some of these conceits are the chief blemishes of the italian pastorals which are otherwise beautiful when aminta in tasso is disentangling his mistresss hair from a tree to which a savage had bound it he is represented as saying cruel tree how could thou injure that lovely hair which did thee so much honor thy rugged trunk was not worthy of such lovely knots what advantage have the servants of love if those precious chains are common to them and to the trees gia di nodi si bei non era degno cosi rovido tronco or che vantaggio ilanno i servi damor se lor commune econ le piante il pretioso laccio pianta crudel potesti quel bell crine offender tu cha te feo tanto onore atto iii sc i  such strained sentiments as these ill befit the woods rural personages are supposed to speak the language of plain sense and natural feelings when they describe or relate they do it with simplicity and naturally allude to rural circumstances as in these beautiful lines of one of virgils eclogues sepibus in nostris parvam te roscida mala dux ego vester eram vidi cum matre legentem alter ab undecimo turn me jam ceperat annus jam fragiles poteram a terra contingere ramos ut vidi ut perii ut me malus abstulit error once with your mother to our fields you came for dewy apples thence i date my flame the choicest fruit i pointed to your view though young my raptured soul was fixed on you the boughs i just could reach with little arms but then even then could feel thy powerful charms o how i gazed in pleasing transport lost how glowed my heart in sweet delusion lost warton    in another passage he makes a shepherdess throw an apple at her lover tum fugit ad salices and se cupit ante videri my phillis me with pelted apples plies then tripping to the wood the wanton hies and wishes to be seen before she flies dryden  this is naive as the french express it and perfectly suited to pastoral manners mr pope wanted to imitate this passage and as he thought to improve upon it he does it thus the sprightly sylvia trips along the green she runs but hopes she does not run unseen while a kind glance at her pursuer slies how much at variance are her feet and eyes this falls far short of virgil the natural and pleasing simplicity of the description is destroyed by the quaint and affected turn in the last line how much at variance are her feet and eyes  supposing the poet to have formed correct ideas concerning his pastoral characters and personages the next enquiry is about what is he to employ them and what are to be the subjects of his eclogues for it is not enough that he gives us shepherds discoursing together every good poem of every kind ought to have a subject which would in some way interest us now here i apprehend lies the chief difficulty of pastoral writing the active scenes of country life either are or to most describers appear to be too barren of incidents the state of a shepherd or a person occupied in rural employments only is exposed to few of those accidents and revolutions which render his situation interesting or produce curiosity or surprise the tenor of his life is uniform his ambition is conceived to be without policy and his love without intrigue hence it is that of all poems the most meagre commonly in the subject and the least diversified in the strain is the pastoral from the first lines we can generally guess at all that is to follow it is either a shepherd who sits down solitary by a brook to lament the absence or cruelty of his mistress and to tell us how the trees wither and the flowers droop now that she is gone or we have two shepherds who challenge one another to sing rehearsing alternate verses which have little either of meaning or subject till the judge rewards one with a studded crook and another with a beechen bowl to the frequent repetition of commonplace topics of this sort which have been thrummed over by all eclogue writers since the days of theocritus and virgil is owing much of that insipidity which prevails in pastoral compositions  i much question however whether this insipidity be not owing to the fault of the poets and to their barren and slavish imitation of the ancient pastoral topics rather than to the confined nature of the subject for why may not pastoral poetry take a wider range human nature and human passions are much the same in every rank of life and wherever these passions operate on objects that are within the rural sphere there may be a proper subject for pastoral one would indeed choose to remove from this sort of composition the operations of violent and direful passions and to present such only as are consistent with innocence simplicity and virtue but under this limitation there will still be abundant scope for a careful observer of nature to exert his genius the various adventures which give occasion to those engaged in country life to display their disposition and temper the scenes of domestic felicity or disquiet the attachment of friends and of brothers the rivalship and competitions of lovers the unexpected successes or misfortunes of families might give occasion to many a pleasing and tender incident and were more of the narrative and sentimental intermixed with the descriptive in this kind of poetry it would become much more interesting than it now generally is to the bulk of readers the above observations on the barrenness of the common eclogues were written before any translation from the german had made us acquainted in this country with gesners idylls in which the ideas that had occurred to me for the improvement of pastoral poetry are fully realized   the two great fathers of pastoral poetry are theocritus and virgil theocritus was a sicilian and as he has laid the scenes of his eclogues in his own country sicily became ever afterward a sort of consecrated ground for pastoral poetry his idyllia as he has entitled them are not all of equal merit nor indeed are they all pastorals but some of them poems of a quite different nature in such however as are properly pastorals there are many and great beauties he is distinguished for the simplicity of his sentiments for the great sweetness and harmony of his numbers and for the richness of his scenery and description he is the original of which virgil is the imitator for most of virgils highest beauties in his eclogues are copied from theocritus in many places he has done nothing more than translate him he must be allowed however to have imitated him with great judgment and in some respects to have improved upon him for theocritus it cannot be denied descends sometimes into ideas that are gross and mean and makes his shepherds abusive and immodest whereas virgil is free from offensive rusticity and at the same time preserves the character of pastoral simplicity the same distinction obtains between theocritus and virgil as between many other of the greek and roman writers the greek led the way followed nature more closely and showed more original genius the roman discovered more of the polish and correctness of art we have a few remains of other two greek poets in the pastoral style moschus and bion which have very considerable merit and if they want the simplicity of theocritus excel him in tenderness and delicacy  the modern writers of pastorals have generally contented themselves with copying or imitating the descriptions and sentiments of the ancient poets sannazarius indeed a famous latin poet in the age of leo x attempted a bold innovation he composed piscatory eclogues changing the scene from woods to the sea and from the life of shepherds to that of fishermen but the innovation was so unhappy that he has gained no followers for the life of fishermen is obviously much more hard and toilsome than that of shepherds and presents to the fancy much less agreeable images flocks and trees and flowers are objects of greater beauty and more generally relished by men than fishes and marine productions of all the moderns m gesner a poet of switzerland has been the most successful in his pastoral compositions he has introduced into his idylls as he entitles them many new ideas his rural scenery is often striking and his descriptions are lively he presents pastoral life to us with all the embellishments of which it is susceptible but without any excess of refinement what forms the chief merit of this poet is that he writes to the heart and has enriched the subjects of his idylls with incidents which give rise to much tender sentiment scenes of domestic felicity are beautifully painted the mutual affection of husbands and wives parents and children brothers and sisters as well as of lovers are displayed in a pleasing and touching manner from not understanding the language in which m gesner writes i can be no judge of the poetry of his style but in the subject and conduct of his pastorals he appears to me to have outdone all the moderns  neither mr popes nor mr philipss pastorals do any great honor to the english poetry mr popes were composed in his youth which may be an apology for other faults but cannot well excuse the barrenness that appears in them they are written in remarkably smooth and flowing numbers and this is their chief merit for there is scarcely any thought in them which can be called his own scarcely any description or any image of nature which has the marks of being original or copied from nature herself but a repetition of the common images that are to be found in virgil and in all poets who write of rural themes philips attempted to be more simple and natural than pope but he wanted genius to support his attempt or to write agreeably he too runs on the common and beaten topics and endeavoring to be simple he becomes flat and insipid there was no small competition between these two authors at the time when their pastorals were published in some papers of the guardian great partiality was shown to philips and high praise bestowed upon him mr pope resenting this preference under a feigned name procured a paper to be inserted in the guardian wherein he seemingly carries on the plan of extolling philips but in reality satirises him most severely with ironical praises and in an artful covered manner gives the palm to himself see guardian no  0  about the same time mr gay published his shepherds week in six pastorals which are designed to ridicule that sort of simplicity which philips and his partisans extolled and are indeed an ingenious burlesque of pastoral writing when it rises no higher than the manners of modern clowns and rustics mr shenstones pastoral ballad in four parts may justly be reckoned i think one of the most elegant poems of this kind which we have in english  i have not yet mentioned one form in which pastoral writing has appeared in latter ages that is when extended into a play or regular drama where plot characters and passions are joined with the simplicity and innocence of rural manners this is the chief improvement which the moderns have made on this species of composition and of this nature we have two italian pieces which are much celebrated guarinis pastor fido and tassos aminta both of these possess great beauties and are entitled to the reputation they have gained to the latter the preference seems due as being less intricate in the plot and conduct and less strained and affected in the sentiments and though not wholly free of italian refinement of which i already gave one instance the worst indeed that occurs in all the poem it is on the whole a performance of high merit the strain of the poetry is gentle and pleasing and the italian language contributes to add much of that softness which is peculiarly suited to pastoral it may be proper to take notice here that the charge against tasso for his points and conceits has sometimes been carried too far mr addison for instance in a paper of the guardian censuring his aminta gives this example that sylvia enters adorned with a garland of flowers and after viewing herself in a fountain breaks out in a speech to the flowers on her head and tells them that she did not wear them to adorn herself but to make them ashamed whoever can bear this he adds may be assured that he has no taste for pastoral guard no    but tassos sylvia in truth makes no such ridiculous figure and we are obliged to suspect that mr addison had not read the aminta daphne a companion of sylvia appears in conversation with thyrsis the confidant of aminta sylvias lover and in order to show him that sylvia was not so simple or insensible to her own charms as she affected to be gives him this instance that she had caught her one day adjusting her dress by a fountain and applying now one flower and now another to her neck and after comparing their colors with her own she broke into a smile as if she had seemed to say i will wear you not for my ornaments but to show how much you yield to me and when caught thus admiring herself she threw away her flowers and blushed for shame  this description of the vanity of a rural coquette is no more than what is natural and very different from what the author of the guardian represents it  this censure on tasso was not originally mr addisons bouhours in his maniere de bien penser dans les ouvrages desprit appears to have been the first who gave this misrepresentation of sylvias speech and founded a criticism on it fontenelle in his discourse on pastoral poetry followed him in this criticism mr addison or whoever was the author of that paper in the guardian copied from them both mr warton in the prefatory discourse to his translation of virgils eclogues repeats the observation sylvias speech to the flowers with which she was adorned is always quoted as the flagrant instance of the false taste of the italian poets whereas tasso gives us no such speech of sylvias but only informs us of what her companion supposed her to be thinking or saying to herself when she was privately admiring her own beauty after charging so many eminent critics for having fallen into this strange inaccuracy from copying one another without looking into the author whom they censure it is necessary for me to insert the passage which has occasioned this remark daphne speas thus to thyrsis hora per dirti il ver non mi resolvo si silvia e semplicetta come pare a le parole a gli atti hier vidi un segno cheme ne met in dubbio io la trovai la presso la cittade in quei gran prati ove fra stagni grace un isoletta sovra essa un lago limpido e tranquillo tutta pendente in atto che parea vagheggiar se medesma e nsieme insieme chieder consiglio a lacque in qual maniera dispor dovesse in su la front i crini e sovra i crini il velo e sovral velo i fior che tenea in grembo e spesso spesso hor prendeva un ligustro hor una rosa e laccostava al bell candido collo a le guancie vermiglie e de colori fea paragone e poi sicome lieta de la vittoria lampeggiava un riso che parea che dicesse io pur vi vinco ni porto voi per ornamento mio ma porto voi sol per vergogna vostra perch si veggia quanto mi cedete ma mentre ella sornava e vagheggiava rivolsi gli occhi a caso e si fu accorta chio di la m era accorta e vergognando rizzosi tosto e i fior lascio cadere in tanto io piu ridea del suo rossore ella piu sarrossia del riso mio aminta atto ii sc ii     i must not omit the mention of another pastoral drama which will bear being brought into comparison with any composition of this kind in any language that is allan ramsays gentle shepherd it is a great disadvantage to this beautiful poem that it is written in the old rustic dialect of scotland which in a short time will probably be entirely obsolete and not intelligible and it is a farther disadvantage that it is so entirely formed on the rural manners of scotland that none but a native of that country can thoroughly understand or relish it but though subject to those local disadvantages which confine its reputation within narrow limits it is full of so much natural description and tender sentiment as would do honor to any poet the characters are well drawn the incidents affecting the scenery and manners lively and just it affords a strong proof both of the power which nature and simplicity possess to reach the heart in every sort of writing and of the variety of pleasing characters and subjects with which pastoral poetry when properly managed is capable of being enlivened  i proceed next to treat of lyric poetry or the ode a species of poetical composition which possesses much dignity and in which many writers have distinguished themselves in every age its peculiar character is that it is intended to be sung or accompanied with music its designation implies this ode is in greek the same with song or hymn and lyric poetry imports that the verses are accompanied with a lyre or musical instrument this distinction was not at the first peculiar to any one species of poetry for as i observed in the last lecture music and poetry were coeval and were originally always joined together but after their separation took place after bards had begun to make verse compositions which were to be recited or read not to be sung such poems as were designed to be still joined with music or song were by way of distinction called odes  in the ode therefore poetry retains its first and most ancient form that form under which the original bards poured forth their enthusiastic strains praised their gods and their heroes celebrated their victories and lamented their misfortunes it is from this circumstance of the odes being supposed to retain its original union with music that we are to deduce the proper idea and the peculiar qualities of this kind of poetry it is not distinguished from other kinds by the subjects on which it is employed for these may be extremely various i know no distinction of subject that belongs to it except that other poems are often employed in the recital of actions whereas sentiments of one kind or other form almost always the subject of the ode but it is chiefly the spirit the manner of its execution that marks and characterises it music and song naturally add to the warmth of poetry they tend to transport in a higher degree both the person who sings and the persons who hear they justify therefore a bolder and more passionate strain than can be supported in simple recitation on this is formed the peculiar character of the ode hence the enthusiasm that belongs to it and the liberties it is allowed to take beyond any other species of poetry hence that neglect of regularity those digressions and that disorder which it is supposed to admit and which indeed most lyric poets have not failed sufficiently to exemplify in their practice  the effects of music upon the mind are chiefly two to raise it above its ordinary state and fill it with high enthusiastic emotions or to soothe and melt it into the gentle pleasurable feelings hence the ode may either aspire to the former character of the sublime and noble or it may descend to the latter of the pleasant and the gay and between these there is also a middle region of the mild and temperate emotions which the ode may often occupy to advantage  all odes may be comprised under four denominations first sacred odes hymns addressed to god or composed on religious subjects of this nature are the psalms of david which exhibit to us this species of lyric poetry in its highest degree of perfection secondly heroic odes which are employed in the praise of heroes and in the celebration of martial exploits and great actions of this kind are all pindars odes and some few of horaces these two kinds ought to have sublimity and elevation for their reigning character thirdly moral and philosophical odes where the sentiments are chiefly inspired by virtue friendship and humanity of this kind are many of horaces odes and several of our best modern lyric productions and here the ode possesses that middle region which as i observed it sometimes occupies fourthly festive and amorous odes calculated merely for pleasure and amusement of this nature are all anacreons some of horaces and a great number of songs and modern productions that claim to be of the lyric species the reigning character of these ought to be elegance smoothness and gaiety  one of the chief difficulties in composing odes arises from that enthusiasm which is understood to be a characteristic of lyric poetry a professed ode even of the moral kind but more especially if it attempt the sublime is expected to be enlivened and animated in an uncommon degree full of this idea the poet when he begins to write an ode if he has any real warmth of genius is apt to deliver himself up to it without control or restraint if he has it not he strains after it and thinks himself bound to assume the appearance of being all fervor and all flame in either case he is in great hazard of becoming extravagant the licentiousness of writing without order method or connection has infected the ode more than any other species of poetry hence in the class of heroic odes we find so few that one can read with pleasure the poet is out of sight in a moment he gets up into the clouds becomes so abrupt in his transitions so eccentric and irregular in his motions and of course so obscure that we essay in vain to follow him or to partake of his raptures i do not require that an ode should be as regular in the structure of its parts as a didactic or an epic poem but still in every composition there ought to be a subject there ought to be parts which make up a whole there should be a connection of those parts with one another the transitions from thought to thought may be light and delicate such as are prompted by a lively fancy but still they should be such as preserve the connection of ideas and show the author to be one who thinks and not one who raves whatever authority may be pleaded for the incoherence and disorder of lyric poetry nothing can be more certain than that any composition which is so irregular in its method as to become obscure to the bulk of readers is so much worse upon that account la plupart des ceux qui parlent de lenthousiasme de lode en parlent comme sils etoient euxmemes dans le trouble quils veulent definir ce ne sont que grands mots de fureur divine de transports de lame de mouvemens de lumieres qui mis boutabout dans des phrases pompeuses ne produisent pourtant

lautre au lieu de concourir ensemble a fixer et a lesprit oeuvres de m de la motte tome i discourse sur lode   the extravagant liberty which several of the modern lyric writers assume to themselves in their versification increases the disorder of this species of poetry they prolong their periods to such a degree they wander through so many different measures and employ such a variety of long and short lines corresponding in rhyme at so great a distance from each other that all sense of melody is utterly lost whereas lyric composition ought beyond every other species of poetry to pay attention to melody and beauty of sound and the versification of those odes may be justly accounted the best which renders the harmony of the measure most sensible to every common ear  pindar the great father of lyric poetry has been the occasion of leading his imitators into some of the defects i have now mentioned his genius was sublime his expressions are beautiful and happy his descriptions picturesque but finding it a very barren subject to sing the praises of those who had gained the prize in the public games he is perpetually digressive and fills up his poems with fables of the gods and heroes that have little connection either with his subject or with one another the ancients admired him greatly but as many of the histories of particular families and cities to which he alludes are now unknown to us he is so obscure partly from his subjects and partly from his rapid abrupt manner of treating them that notwithstanding the beauty of his expression our pleasure in reading him is much diminished one would imagine that many of his modern imitators thought the best way to catch his spirit was to imitate his disorder and obscurity in several of the choruses of euripides and sophocles we have the same kind of lyric poetry as in pindar carried on with more clearness and connection and at the same time with much sublimity  of all the writers of odes ancient or modern there is none that in point of correctness harmony and happy expression can view with horace he has descended from the pindaric rapture to a more moderate degree of elevation and joins connected thought and good sense with the highest beauties of poetry he does not often aspire beyond that middle region which i mentioned as belonging to the ode and those odes in which he attempts the sublime are perhaps not always his best there is no ode whatever of horaces without great beauties but though i may be singular in my opinion i cannot help thinking that in some of those odes which have been much admired for sublimity such as ode iv lib   qualem ministrum fulminis alitem etc there appears somewhat of a strained and forced effort to be lofty the genius of this amiable poet shows itself according to my judgment to greater advantage in themes of a more temperate kind  the peculiar character in which he excels is grace and elegance and in this style of composition no poet has ever attained to a greater perfection than horace no poet supports a moral sentiment with more dignity touches a gay one more happily or possesses the art of trifling more agreeably when he chooses to trifle his language is so fortunate that with a single word or epithet he often conveys a whole description to the fancy hence he ever has been and ever will continue to be a favorite author with all persons of taste  among the latin poets of later ages there have been many imitators of horace one of the most distinguished is casimir a polish poet of the last century who wrote four books of odes in graceful ease of expression he is far inferior to the roman he oftener affects the sublime and in the attempt like other lyric writers frequently becomes harsh and unnatural but on several occasions he discovers a considerable degree of original genius and poetical fire buchanan in some of his lyric compositions is very elegant and classical  among the french the odes of jean baptiste rousseau have been much and justly celebrated they possess great beauty both of sentiment and expression they are animated without being rhapsodical and are not inferior to any poetical productions in the french language  in our own language we have several lyric compositions of considerable merit drydens ode on st cecilia is well known mr gray is distinguished in some of his odes both for tenderness and sublimity and in dodsleys miscellanies several very beautiful lyric poems are to be found as to professed pindaric odes they are with a few exceptions so incoherent as seldom to be intelligible cowley at all times harsh is doubly so in his pindaric compositions in his anacreontic odes he is much happier they are smooth and elegant and indeed the most agreeable and the most perfect in their kind of all mr cowleys poems  lecture xl didactic poetry  descriptive poetry having treated of pastoral and lyric poetry i proceed next to didactic poetry under which is included a numerous class of writings the ultimate end of all poetry indeed of every composition should be to make some useful impression on the mind this useful impression is most commonly made in poetry by indirect methods as by fable by narration by representation of characters but didactic poetry openly professes its intention of conveying knowledge and instruction it differs therefore in the form only not in the scope and substance from a philosophical a moral or a critical treatise in prose at the same time by means of its form it has several advantages over prose instruction by the charm of versification and numbers it renders instruction more agreeable by the descriptions episodes and other embellishments which it may interweave it detains and engages the fancy it fixes also useful circumstances more deeply in the memory hence it is a field wherein a poet may gain great honor may display both much genius and much knowledge and judgment  it may be executed in different manners the poet may choose some instructive subject and he may treat it regularly and inform or without intending a great or regular work he may only inveigh against particular vices or make some moral observations on human life and characters as is commonly done in satires and epistles all these come under the denomination of didactic poetry  the highest species of it is a regular treatise on some philosophical grave or useful subject of this nature we have several both ancient and modern of great merit and character such as lucretiuss six books de rerum natura virgils georgics popes essay on criticism akensides pleasures of the imagination armstrong on health horaces vidas and boileaus art of poetry  in all such works as instruction is the professed object the fundamental merit consists in sound thought just principles clear and apt illustrations the poet must instruct but he must study at the same time to enliven his instructions by the introduction of such figures and such circumstances as may amuse the imagination may conceal the dryness of his subject and embellish it with poetical painting virgil in his georgics presents us here with a perfect model he has the art of raising and beautifying the most trivial circumstances in rural life when he is going to say that the labor of the country must be in spring he expresses himself thus vere novo gelidus canis cum montibus humor liquitur et zephyro putris se gleba resolvit depresso incipiat jam tum mihi taurus aratro ingemere and sulco attritus splendescere vomer while yet the spring is young while earth unbinds her frozen bosom to the western winds while mountain snows dissolve against the sun and streams yet new from precipices run even in this early dawning of the year produce the plough and yoke the sturdy steer and goad him till he groans beneath his toil till the bright share is buried in the soil dryden    instead of telling his husbandman in plain language that his crops will fail through bad management his language is heu magnum alterius frustra spectabis acervum concussaque famem in sylvis solabere quercu on others crops you may with envy look and shake for food the long abandoned oak dryden    instead of ordering him to water his grounds he presents us with a beautiful landscape ecce supercilio clivosi tramitis undam elicit illa cadens raucum per laevia murmur saxa ciet scatebrisque arentia temperat arva behold when burning suns or syrius beams strike fiercely on the field and withering stems down from the summit of the neighboring hills over the smooth stones he calls the bubbling rills soon as he clears whatever their passage stayed and marks their future current with his spade before him scattering they prevent his pains and roll with hollow murmurs over the plains warton    in all didactic works method and order is essentially requisite not so strict and formal as in a prose treatise yet such as may exhibit clearly to the reader a connected train of instruction of the didactic poets whom i before mentioned horace in his art of poetry is the one most censured for want of method indeed if horace be deficient in any thing throughout many of his writings it is in this of not being sufficiently attentive to juncture and connection of parts he writes always with ease and gracefulness often in a manner somewhat loose and rambling there is however in that work much good sense and excellent criticism and if it be considered as intended for the regulation of the roman drama which seems to have been the authors chief purpose it will be found to be a more complete and regular treatise than under the common notion of its being a system of the whole poetical art  with regard to episodes and embellishments great liberty is allowed to writers of didactic poetry we soon tire of a continued series of instructions especially in a poetical work where we look for entertainment the great art of rendering a didactic poem interesting is to relieve and amuse the reader by connecting some agreeable episodes with the principal subject these are always the parts of the work which are best known and which contribute most to support the reputation of the poet the principal beauties of virgils georgics lie in digressions of this kind in which the author has exerted all the force of his genius such as the prodigies that attended the death of julius caesar the praises of italy the happiness of a country life the fable of aristeus and the moving tale of orpheus and eurydice so also the favorite passages in lucretiuss work and which alone could render such a dry and abstract subject tolerable in poetry are the digressions on the evils of superstition the praise of epicurus and his philosophy the description of the plague and several other incident illustrations which are remarkably elegant and adorned with a sweetness and harmony of versification peculiar to that poet there is indeed nothing in poetry so entertaining or descriptive but what a didactic writer of genius may be allowed to introduce in some part of his work provided always that such episodes arise naturally from the main subject that they be not disproportioned in length to it and that the author know how to descend with propriety to the plain as well as how to rise to the bold and figured style  much art may be shown by a didactic poet in connecting his episodes happily with his subject virgil is also distinguished for his address in this point after seeming to have left his husbandmen he again returns to them very naturally by laying hold of some rural circumstance to terminate his digression thus having spoken of the battle of pharsalia he subjoins immediately with much art scilicet et tempus veniet cum finibus illis agricola incurvo terram molitus aratro exesa inveniet scabra rubigine pila aut gravibus rastris galeas pulsabit inanes grandiaque effossis mirabitur ossa sepulchris then after length of time the laboring swains who turn the turf of these unhappy plains shall rusty arms from the ploughd furrows take and over empty helmets pass the rake amused at antique titles on the stones and mighty relics of gigantic bones dryden    in english dr akenside has attempted the most rich and poetical form of didactic wriing in his pleasures of the imagination and though in the execution of the whole he is not equal he has in several parts succeeded happily and displayed much genius dr armstrong in his art of preserving health has not aimed at so high a strain as the other but he is more equal and maintains throughout a chaste and correct elegance  satires and epistles naturally run into a more familiar style than solemn philosophical poetry as the manners and characters which occur in ordinary life are their subject they require being treated with somewhat of the ease and freedom of conversation and hence it is commonly the musa pedestris which reigns in such compositions  satire in its first state among the romans had a form different from what it afterward assumed its origin is obscure and has given occasion to altercation among critics it seems to have been at first a relic of the ancient comedy written partly in prose partly in verse and abounding with scurrility ennius and lucilius corrected its grossness and at last horace brought it into that form which now gives the denomination to satirical writing reformation of manners is the end which it professes to have in view and in order to this end it assumes the liberty of boldly censuring vice and vicious characters it has been carried on in three different manners by the three great ancient satirists horace juvenal and persius horaces style has not much elevation he entitled his satires sermones and seems not to have intended rising much higher than prose put into numbers his manner is easy and graceful they are rather the follies and weaknesses of mankind than their enormous vices which he chooses for the object of his satire he reproves with a smiling aspect and while he moralizes like a sound philosopher discovers at the same time the politeness of a courtier juvenal is much more serious and declamatory he has more strength and fire and more elevation of style than horace but is greatly inferior to him in gracefulness and ease his satire is more zealous more sharp and pointed as being generally directed against more flagitious characters as scaliger says of him ardet instat jugulat whereas horaces character is admissus circum praecordia ludit persius has a greater resemblance of the force and fire of juvenal than of the politeness of horace he is distinguished for sentiments of noble and sublime morality he is a nervous and lively writer but withal often harsh and obscure  poetical epistles when employed on moral or critical subjects seldom rise into a higher strain of poetry than satires in the form of an epistle indeed many other subjects may be handled and either love poetry or elegiac may be carried on as in ovids epistolae heroidum and his epistolae de i onto such works as these are designed to be merely sentimental and as their merit consists in being proper expressions of the passion or sentiment which forms the subject they may assume any tone of poetry that is suited to it but didactic epistles of which i now speak seldom admit of much elevation they are commonly intended as observations on authors or on life and characters in delivering which the poet does not purpose to compose a formal treatise or to confine himself strictly to regular method but gives scope to his genius on some particular theme which at the time has prompted him to write in all didactic poetry of this kind it is an important rule quicquid precipies esto brevis much of the grace both of satirical and epistolary writing consists in a spirited conciseness this gives to such composition an edge and a liveliness which strike the fancy and keep attention awake much of their merit depends also on just and happy representations of characters as they are not supported by those high beauties of descriptive and poetical language which adorn other compositions we expect in return to be entertained with lively paintings of men and manners which are always pleasing and in these a certain sprightliness and turn of wit finds its proper place the higher species of poetry seldom admit it but here it is seasonable and beautiful  in all these respects mr popes ethical epistles deserve to be mentioned with signal honor as a model next to perfect of this kind of poetry here perhaps the strength of his genius appeared in the more sublime parts of poetry he is not so distinguished in the enthusiasm the fire the force and copiousness of poetic genius dryden though a much less correct writer appears to have been superior to him one can scarce think that he was capable of epic or tragic poetry but within a certain limited region he has been outdone by no poet his translation of the iliad will remain a lasting monument to his honor as the most elegant and highly finished translation that perhaps ever was given of any poetical work that he was not incapable of tender poetry appears from the epistle of eloisa to abelard and from the verses to the memory of an unfortunate lady which are almost his only sentimental productions and which indeed are excellent in their kind but the qualities for which he is chiefly distinguished are judgment and wit with a concise and happy expression and a melodious versification few poets ever had more wit and at the same time more judgment to direct the proper employment of that wit this renders his rape of the lock the greatest masterpiece that perhaps was ever composed in the gay and sprightly style and in his serious works such as his essay on man and his ethic epistles his wit just discovers itself as much as to give a proper seasoning to grave reflections his imitations of horace are so peculiarly happy that one is at a loss whether most to admire the original or the copy and they are among the few imitations extant that have all the grace and ease of an original his paintings of characters are natural and lively in a high degree and never was any writer so happy in that concise spirited style which gives animation to satyrs and epistles we are never so sensible of the good effects of rhyme in english verse as in reading these parts of his works we see it adding to the style and elevation which otherwise it could not have possessed while at the same time he manages it so artfully that it never appears in the least to encumber him but on the contrary serves to increase the liveliness of his manner he tells us himself that he could express moral observations more concisely and therefore more forcibly in rhyme than he could do in prose  among moral and didactic poets dr young is of too great eminence to be passed over without notice in all his works the marks of strong genius appear his universal passion possesses the full merit of that animated conciseness of style and lively description of characters which i mentioned as particularly requisite in satirical and didactic compositions though his wit may often be thought too sparkling and his sentences too pointed yet the vivacity of his fancy is so great as to entertain every reader in his night thoughts there is much energy of expression in the three first there are several pathetic passages and scattered through them all happy images and illusions as well as pious reflections occur but the sentiments are frequently overstrained and turgid and the style is too harsh and obscure to be pleasing among french authors boileau has undoubtedly much merit in didactic poetry their later critics are unwilling to allow him any great share of original genius or poetic fire vid poetique francoise de marmontel  but his art of poetry his satires and epistles must ever be esteemed eminent not only for solid and judicious thought but for correct and elegant poetical expression and fortunate imitation of the ancients  from didactic i proceed next to treat of descriptive poetry where the highest exertions of genius may be displayed by descriptive poetry i do not mean any one particular species or form of composition there are few compositions of any length that can be called purely descriptive or wherein the poet proposes to himself no other object but merely to describe without employing narration action or moral sentiment as the groundwork of his piece description is generally introduced as an embellishment rather than made the subject of a regular work but though it seldom form a separate species of writing yet into every species of poetical composition pastoral lyric didactic epic and dramatic it both enters and possesses in each of them a very considerable place so that in treating of poetry it demands no small attention  description is the great test of a poets imagination and always distinguishes an original from a secondrate genius to a writer of the inferior class nature when at any time he attempts to describe it appears exhausted by those who have gone before him in the same tract he sees nothing new or peculiar in the object which he would paint his conceptions of it are loose and vague and his expressions of course feeble and general he gives us words rather than ideas we meet with the language indeed of poetical description but we apprehend the object described very indistinctly whereas a true poet makes us imagine that we see it before our eyes he catches the distinguishing features he gives it the colors of life and reality he places it in such a light that a painter could copy after him this happy talent is chiefly owing to a strong imagination which first receives a lively impression of the object and then by employing a proper selection of circumstances in describing it transmits that impression in its full force to the imagination of others  in this selection of circumstances lies the great art of picturesque description in the first place they ought not to be vulgar and common ones such as are apt to pass by without remark but as much as possible new and original which may catch the fancy and draw attention in the next place they ought to be such as particularize the object described and mark it strongly no description that rests in generals can be good for we can conceive nothing clearly in the abstract all distinct ideas are formed upon particulars in the third place all the circumstances employed ought to be uniform and of a piece that is when describing a great object every circumstance brought into view should tend to aggrandize or when describing a gay and pleasant one should tend to beautify that by this means the impression may rest upon the imagination complete and entire and lastly the circumstances in description should be expressed with conciseness and with simplicity for when either too much exaggerated or too long dwelt upon and extended they never fail to enfeeble the impression that is designed to be made brevity almost always contributes to vivacity these general rules will be best understood by illustrations founded on particular instances  of all professed descriptive compositions the largest and fullest that i am acquainted with in any language is mr thomsons seasons a work which possesses very uncommon merit the style in the midst of much splendor and strength is sometimes harsh and may be censured as deficient in ease and distinctness but notwithstanding this defect thomson is a strong and a beautiful describer for he had a feeling heart and a warm imagination he had studied and copied nature with care enamoured of her beauties he not only described them properly but felt their impression with strong sensibility the impression which he felt he transmits to his readers and no person of taste can peruse any one of his seasons without having the ideas and feelings which belonged to that season recalled and rendered present to his mind several instances of most beautiful description might be given from him such as the shower in spring the morning in summer and the man perishing in snow in winter but at present i shall produce a passage of another kind to show the power of a single well chosen circumstance to heighten a description in his summer relating to the effects of heat in the torrid zone he is led to take notice of the pestilence that destroyed the english fleet at carthagena under admiral vernon when he has the following lines  you gallant vernon saw the miserable scene you pitying saw to infant weakness sunk the warriors arm saw the deep racking pang the ghastly form the lip pale quivering and the beamless eye no more with ardour bright you heard the groans of agonizing ships from shore to shore heard nightly plunged amid the sullen waves the frequent corse  l  0 0   all the circumstances here are properly chosen for setting this dismal scene in a strong light before our eyes but what is most striking in the picture is the last image we are conducted through all the scenes of distress till we come to the mortality prevailing in the fleet which a vulgar poet would have described by exaggerated expressions concerning the multiplied trophies and victories of death but how much more is the imagination impressed by this single circumstance of dead bodies thrown overboard every night of the constant sound of their falling into the waters and of the admiral listening to this melancholy sound so often striking his ear heard nightly plunged amid the sullen waves the frequent corse the elogium which dr johnson in his lives of the poets gives of thomson is high and in my opinion very just as a writer he is entitled to one praise of the highest kind his mode of thinking and of expressing his thoughts is original his blank verse is no more the blank verse of milton or of any other poet than the rhymes of prior are the rhymes of cowley his numbers his pauses his diction are of his own growth without transcription without imitation he thinks in a peculiar train and he thinks always as a man of genius he looks round on nature and life with the eye which nature bestows only on a poet the eye that distinguishes in every thing presented to its view whatever there is on which imagination can delight to be detained and with a mind that at once comprehends the vast and attends to the minute the reader of the seasons wonders that he never saw before what thomson shows him and that he never yet has felt what thomson impresses  his descriptions of extended scenes and general effects bring before us the whole magnificence of nature whether pleasing or dreadful the gaiety of spring the splendor of summer the tranquillity of autumn and the horror of winter take in their turn possession of the mind the poet leads us through the appearances of things as they are successively varied by the vicissitudes of the year and imparts to us so much of his own enthusiasm that our thoughts expand with his imagery and kindle with his sentiments the censure which the same eminent critic passes upon thomsons diction is no less just and well founded that it is too exuberant and may sometimes be charged with filling the ear more than the mind    mr parnells tale of the hermit is conspicuous throughout the whole of it for beautiful descriptive narration the manner of the hermits setting forth to visit the world his meeting with a companion and the houses in which they are successively entertained of the vain man the covetous man and the good man are pieces of very fine painting touched with a light and delicate pencil overcharged with no superfluous coloring and conveying to us a lively idea of the objects but of all the english poems in the descriptive style the richest and most remarkable are miltons allegro and penseroso the collection of gay images on the one hand and of melancholy ones on the other exhibited in these two small but inimitably fine poems are as exquisite as can be conceived they are indeed the storehouse whence many succeeding poets have enriched their descriptions of similar subjects and they alone are sufficient for illustrating the observations which i made concerning the proper selection of circumstances in descriptive writing take for instance the following passage from the penseroso  i walk unseen on the dry smoothshaven green to behold the wandering moon riding near her highest noon and often as if her head she bowed stooping through a fleecy cloud often on a plat of rising ground i hear the far off curfew sound over some wide watered shore swinging slow with solemn roar or if the air will not permit some still removed place will fit where glowing embers through the room teach light to counterfeit a gloom far from all resort of mirth save the cricket on the hearth or the belmans drowsy charm to bless the doors from nightly harm or let my lamp at midnight hour be seen in some high lonely tower exploring plato to unfold what worlds or what vast regions hold the immortal mind that has forsook her mansion in this fleshly nook and of these demons that are found in fire air flood or underground   here there are no unmeaning general expressions all is particular all is picturesque nothing forced or exaggerated but a simple style and a collection of strong expressive images which are all of one class and recall a number of similar ideas of the melancholy kind particularly the walk by moonlight the sound of the curfew bell heard distant the dying embers in the chamber the bellmans call and the lamp seen at midnight in the high lonely tower we may observe too the conciseness of the poets manner he does not rest long on one circumstance or employ a great many words to describe it which always makes the impression faint and languid but placing it in one strong point of view full and clear before the reader he there leaves it  from his shield and his helmet says homer describing one of his heroes in battle from his shield and helmet there sparkled an incessant blaze like the autumnal star when it appears in its brightness from the waters of the ocean this is short and lively but when it comes into mr popes hand it evaporates in three pompous lines each of which repeats the same image in different words high on his helm celestial lightnings play his beamy shield emits a living ray the unwearied blaze incessant streams supplies like the red star that fires the autumnal skies   it is to be observed in general that in describing solemn or great objects the concise manner is almost always proper descriptions of gay and smiling scenes can bear to be more amplified and prolonged as strength is not the predominant quality expected in these but where a sublime or a pathetic impression is intended to be made energy is above all things required the imagination ought then to be seized at once and it is far more deeply impressed by one strong and ardent image than by the anxious minuteness of labored illustration  his face was without form and dark says ossian describing a ghost the stars dim twinkled through his form thrice he sighed over the hero and thrice the winds of the night roared around  it deserves attention too that in describing inanimate natural objects the poet in order to enliven his description ought always to mix living beings with them the scenes of dead and still life are apt to pall upon us if the poet do not suggest sentiments and introduce life and action into his description this is well known to every painter who is a master in his art seldom has any beautiful landscape been drawn without some human being represented on the canvas as beholding it or on some account concerned in it hic gelidi fontes hic mollia prata lycori hic nemus hic ipso tecum consumerer aevo here cooling fountains roll through flowery meads here woods lycoris lift their verdant heads here could i wear my careless life away and in thy arms insensibly decay virg ecl x warton    the touching part of these fine lines of virgils is the last which sets before us the interest of two lovers in this rural scene a long description of the  fontes the  nemus and the  prata in the most poetical modern manner would have been insipid without this stroke which in a few words brings home to the heart all the beauties of the place hic ipso tecum consumerer aevo it is a great beauty in miltons allegro that it is all alive and full of persons  every thing as i before said in description should be as marked and particular as possible in order to imprint on the mind a distinct and complete image a hill a river or a lake rise up more conspicuous to the fancy when some particular lake or river or hill is specified than when the terms are left general most of the ancient writers have been sensible of the advantage which this gives to description thus in that beautiful pastoral composition the song of solomon the images are commonly particularised by the objects to which they allude it is the rose of sharon the lily of the valleys the flock which feeds on mount gilead the stream which comes from mount lebanon come with me from lebanon my spouse look from the top amana from the top of shenir and hermon from the mountains of the leopards chapter iv   so horace quid dedicatum poscit apollinem vates quid orat de patera novum fundens liquorem non opimas sardiniae segetes feracis non aestuosae grata calabriae armenta non aurum aut ebur indicum non rura quae liris quieta mordet aqua taciturnus amnis when at apollos hallowed shrine the poet hails the power divine and here his first libation pours what is the blessing he implores he nor desires the swelling grain that yellows over sardinias plain nor the fair herds that lowing feed on warm calabrias flowery mead nor ivory of spotless shine nor gold forth flaming from the mine nor the rich fields that liris laves and eats away with silent waves francis  lib i ode     both homer and virgil are remarkable for the talent of poetical description in virgils second aeneid where he describes the burning and sacking of troy the particulars are so well selected and represented that the reader finds himself in the midst of that scene of horror the death of priam especially may be singled out as a masterpiece of description all the circumstances of the aged monarch arraying himself in armor when he finds the enemy making themselves masters of the city his meeting with his family who are taking shelter at an altar in the court of the palace and their placing him in the midst of them his indignation when he beholds pyrrhus slaughtering one of his sons the feeble dart which he throws with pyrrhuss brutal behavior and his manner of putting the old man to death are painted in the most affecting manner and with a masterly hand all homers battles and miltons account both of paradise and of the infernal regions furnish many beautiful instances of poetical description ossian too paints in strong and lively colors though he employs few circumstances and his chief excellency lies in painting to the heart one of his fullest descriptions is the following of the ruins of balclutha i have seen the walls of balclutha but they were desolate the fire had resounded within the halls and the voice of the people is now heard no more the stream of clutha was removed from its place by the fall of the walls the thistle shook there its lonely head the moss whistled to the wind the fox looked out of the window the rank grass waved round his head desolate is the dwelling of moina silence is in the house of her fathers shakespeare cannot be omitted on this occasion as singularly eminent for painting with the pencil of nature though it be in manners and characters that his chief excellency lies yet his scenery also is often exquisite and happily described by a single stroke as in that fine line of the merchant of venice which conveys to the fancy as natural and beautiful an image as can possibly be exhibited in so few words how sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank here will we sit etc   much of the beauty of descriptive poetry depends on a right choice of epithets many poets it must be confessed are too careless in this particular epithets are frequently brought in merely to complete the verse or make the rhyme answer and hence they are so unmeaning and redundant expletive words only which in place of adding anything to the description clog and enervate it virgils liquidi fontes and horaces prata canis albicant pruinis must i am afraid be assigned to this class for to denote by an epithet that water is liquid or that snow is white is no better than mere tautology every epithet should either add a new idea to the word which it qualifies or at least serve to raise and heighten its known signification so in milton  who shall tempt with wandering feet the dark unbottomd infinite abyss and through the palpable obscure find out his uncouth way or spread his airy flight upborn with indefatigable wings over the vast abrupt b ii the epithets employed here plainly add strength to the description and assist the fancy in conceiving it  the wandering feet  the unbottomed abyss  the palpable obscure  the uncouth way  the indefatigable wing  serve to render the images more complete and distinct but there are a sort of general epithets which though they appear to raise the signification of the word to which they are joined yet leave it so undetermined and are now become so trite and beaten in poetical language as to be perfectly insipid of this kind are barbarous discord  hateful envy  mighty chiefs  bloody war  gloomy shades  direful scenes and a thousand more of the same kind which we meet with occasionally in good poets but with which poets of inferior genius abound every where as the great props of their affected sublimity they give a sort of swell to the language and raise it above the tone of prose but they serve not in the least to illustrate the object described on the contrary they load the style with a languid verbosity  sometimes it is in the power of a poet of genius by one wellchosen epithet to accomplish a description and by means of a single word to paint a whole scene to the fancy we may remark this effect of an epithet in the following fine lines of miltons lycidas where were ye nymphs when the remorseless deep closed over the head of your loved lycidas for neither were ye playing on the steep where your old bards the famous druids lie nor on the shaggy top of mona high nor yet where deva spreads her wizard stream   among these wild scenes devas wizard stream is admirably imagined by this one word presenting to the fancy all the romantic ideas of a river flowing through a desolate country with banks haunted by wizards and enchanters akin to this is an epithet which horace gives to the river hydaspes a good man says he stands in need of no arms sive per syrtes iter aestuosas sive facturus per inhospitalem caucasum vel quae loca fabulosus lambit hydaspes whether through lybias burning sands our journey leads or scythias lands amidst the unhospitable waste of snows or where the fabulous hydaspes flows francis  this epithet fabulosus one of the commentators on horace has changed into sabulosus or sandy substituting by a strange want of taste the common and trivial epithet of the sandy river in place of that beautiful picture which the poet gives us by calling hydaspes the romantic river or the scene of adventures and poetic tales  virgil has employed an epithet with great beauty and propriety when accounting for daedalus not having engraved the fortune of his son icarus bis conatus erat casus effingere in auro bis patriae cecidere manus here hapless icarus had found his part had not the fathers grief restrained his art he twice assayed to cast his son in gold twice from his hand he dropped the forming mould dryden in this translation the thought is justly given but the beauty of the expression patriae manus which in the original conveys the thought with so much tenderness is lost    aen vi  these instances and observations may give some just idea of true poetical description we have reason always to distrust an authors descriptive talents when we find him laborious and turgid amassing commonplace epithets and general expressions to work up a high conception of some object of which after all we can form but an indistinct idea the best describers are simple and concise they set before us such features of an object as on the first view strike and warm the fancy they give us ideas which a statuary or a painter could lay hold of and work after them which is one of the strongest and most decisive trials of the real merit of description  lecture xli the poetry of the hebrews among the various kinds of poetry which we are at present employed in examining the ancient hebrew poetry or that of the scriptures justly deserves a place viewing those sacred books in no higher light than as they present to us the most ancient monuments of poetry extant at this day in the world they afford a curious object of criticism they display the taste of a remote age and country they exhibit a species of composition very different from any other with which we are acquainted and at the same time beautiful considered as inspired writings they give rise to discussions of another kind but it is our business at present to consider them not in a theological but in a critical view and it must needs give pleasure if we shall find the beauty and dignity of the composition adequate to the weight and importance of the matter dr lowths learned treatise de sacra poesi hebraeorum ought to be perused by all who desire to become thoroughly acquainted with this subject it is a work exceedingly valuable both for the elegance of its composition and for the justness of the criticism which it contains in this lecture as i cannot illustrate the subject with more benefit to the reader than by following the track of that ingenious author i shall make much use of his observations  i need not spend many words in showing that among the books of the old testament there is such an apparent diversity in style as sufficiently discovers which of them are to be considered as poetical and which as prose compositions while the historical books and legislative writings of moses are evidently prosaic in the composition the book of job the psalms of david the song of solomon the lamentations of jeremiah a great part of the prophetical writings and several passages scattered occasionally through the historical books carry the most plain and distinguishing marks of poetical writing  there is not the least reason for doubting that originally these were written in verse or some kind of measured numbers though as the ancient pronunciation of the hebrew language is now lost we are not able to ascertain the nature of the hebrew verse or at most can ascertain it but imperfectly concerning this point there have been great controversies among learned men which it is immaterial to our present purpose to discuss taking the old testament in our own translation which is extremely literal we find plain marks of many parts of the original being written in a measured style and the disjecti membra poetae often show themselves let any person read the historical introduction to the book of job contained in the first and second chapters and then go on to jobs speech in the beginning of the third chapter and he cannot avoid being sensible that he passes all at once from the region of prose to that of poetry not only the poetical sentiments and the figured style warn him of the change but the cadence of the sentence and the arrangement of the words are sensibly altered the change is as great as when he passes from reading caesars commentaries to read virgils aeneid this is sufficient to show that the sacred scriptures contain what must be called poetry in the strictest sense of that word and i shall afterward show that they contain instances of most of the different forms of poetical writing it may be proper to remark in passing that hence arises a most invincible argument in honor of poetry no person can imagine that to be a frivolous and contemptible art which has been employed by writers under divine inspiration and has been chosen as a proper channel for conveying to the world the knowledge of divine truth  from the earliest times music and poetry were cultivated among the hebrews in the days of the judges mention is made of the schools or colleges of the prophets where one part of the employment of the persons trained in such schools was to sing the praises of god accompanied with various instruments in the first book of samuel chap x   we find on a public occasion a company of those prophets coming down from the hill where the school was prophesying it is said with the psaltery tabret and harp before them but in the days of king david music and poetry were carried to their greatest height for the service of the tabernacle he appointed four thousand levites divided into twentyfour courses and marshalled under several leaders whose sole business it was to sing hymns and to perform the instrumental music in the public worship asaph heman and jeduthun were the chief directors of the music and from the titles of some psalms it would appear that they were also eminent composers of hymns or sacred poems in chapter xxv of the first book of chronicles an account is given of davids institutions relating to the sacred music and poetry which were certainly more costly more splendid and magnificent than ever obtained in the public service of any other nation  the general construction of the hebrew poetry is of a singular nature and peculiar to itself it consists in dividing every period into correspondent for the most part into equal members which answer to one another both in sense and sound in the first member of the period a sentiment is expressed and in the second member the same sentiment is amplified or is repeated in different terms or sometimes contrasted with its opposite but in such a manner that the same structure and nearly the same number of words is preserved this is the general strain of all the hebrew poetry instances of it occur every where on opening the old testament thus in psalm xcvi sing unto the lord a new song  sing unto the lord all the earth sing unto the lord and bless his name  show forth his salvation from day to day declare his glory among the heathen  his wonders among all the people for the lord is great and greatly to be praised  he is to be feared above all the gods honor and majesty are before him  strength and beauty are in his sanctuary it is owing in a great measure to this form of composition that our version though in prose retains so much of a poetical cast for the version being strictly word for word after the original the form and order of the original sentence is preserved which by this artificial structure this regular alternation and correspondence of parts makes the ear sensible of a departure from the common style and tone of prose  the origin of this form of poetical composition among the hebrews is clearly to be deduced from the manner in which their sacred hymns were wont to be sung they were accompanied with music and they were performed by choirs or bands of singers and musicians who answered alternately to each other when for instance one band began the hymn thus the lord reigns let the earth rejoice the chorus or semichorus took up the corresponding versicle let the multitudes of the isles be glad thereof  clouds and darkness are round about him sung the one the other replied judgment and righteousness are the habitation of his throne and in this manner their poetry when set to music naturally divided itself into a succession of strophes and antistrophes correspondent to each other whence it is probable the origin of the antiphon or responsory in the public religious service of so many christian churches  we are expressly told in the book of ezra that the levites sung in this manner alternatim or by course ezra iii    and some of davids psalms bear plain marks of their being composed in order to be thus performed the   th psalm in particular which is thought to have been composed on the great and solemn occasion of the ark of the covenant being brought back to mount zion must have had a noble effect when performed after this manner as dr lowth has illustrated it the whole people are supposed to be attending the procession the levites and singers divided into their several courses and accompanied with all their musical instruments lead the way after the introduction to the psalm in the two first verses when the procession begins to ascend the sacred mount the question is put as by a semichorus who shall ascend unto the hill of the lord and who shall stand in his holy place the response is made by the full chorus with the greatest dignity he that has clean hands and a pure heart who has not lifted up his soul to vanity nor sworn deceitfully as the procession approaches to the doors of the tabernacle the chorus with all their instruments join in this exclamation lift up your heads ye gates and be ye lifted up ye everlasting doors and the king of glory shall come in here the semichorus plainly break in as with a lower voice who is this king of glory and at the moment when the ark is introduced into the tabernacle the response is made by the burst of the whole chorus the lord strong and mighty the lord mighty in battle i take notice of this instance the rather as it serves to show how much of the grace and magnificence of the sacred poems as indeed of all poems depend upon our knowing the particular occasions for which they were composed and the particular circumstances to which they were adapted and how much of this beauty must now be lost to us through our imperfect acquaintance with many particulars of the hebrew history and hebrew rites  the method of composition which has been explained by correspondent versicles being universally introduced into the hymns or musical poetry of the jews easily spread itself through their other poetical writings which were not designed to be sung in alternate portions and which therefore did not so much require this mode of composition but the mode became familiar to their ears and carried with it a certain solemn majesty of style particularly suited to sacred subjects hence throughout the prophetical writings we find it prevailing as much as in the psalms of david as for instance in the prophet isaiah chap lx   arise shine for thy light is come  and the glory of the lord is risen upon thee for lo darkness shall cover the earth  and gross darkness the people but the lord shall rise upon thee  and his glory shall be seen upon thee and the gentiles shall come to thy light  and kings to the brightness of thy rising this form of writing is one of the great characteristics of the ancient hebrew poetry very different from and even opposite to the style of the greek and roman poets  independent of this peculiar mode of construction the sacred poetry is distinguished by the highest beauties of strong concise bold and figurative expression  conciseness and strength are two of its most remarkable characters one might indeed at first imagine that the practice of the hebrew poets of always amplifying the same thought by repetition or contrast might tend to enfeeble their style but they conduct themselves so as not to produce this effect their sentences are always short few superfluous words are used the same thought is never dwelt upon long to their conciseness and sobriety of expression their poetry is indebted for much of its sublimity and all writers who attempt the sublime might profit much by imitating in this respect the style of the old testament for as i have formerly had occasion to show nothing is so great an enemy to the sublime as prolixity or diffuseness the mind is never so much affected by any great idea that is presented to it as when it is struck all at once by attempting to prolong the impression we at the same time weaken it most of the ancient original poets of all nations are simple and concise the superfluities and excrescencies of style were the result of imitation in after times when composition passed into inferior hands and flowed from art and study more than from native genius  no writings whatever abound so much with the most bold and animated figures as the sacred books it is proper to dwell a little upon this article as through our early familiarity with these books a familiarity too often with the sound of the words rather than with their sense and meaning beauties of style escape us in the scripture which in any other book would draw particular attention metaphors comparisons allegories and personifications are there particularly frequent in order to do justice to these it is necessary that we transport ourselves as much as we can into the land of judaea and place before our eyes that scenery and those objects with which the hebrew writers were conversant some attention of this kind is requisite in order to relish the writings of any poet of a foreign country and a different age for the imagery of every good poet is copied from nature and real life if it were not so it could not be lively and therefore in order to enter into the propriety of his images we must endeavor to place ourselves in his situation now we shall find that the metaphors and comparisons of the hebrew poets present to us a very beautiful view of the natural objects of their own country and of the arts and employments of their common life  natural objects are in some measure common to them with poets of all ages and countries light and darkness trees and flowers the forest and the cultivated field suggest to them many beautiful figures but in order to relish their figures of this kind we must take notice that several of them arise from the particular circumstances of the land of judaea during the summer months little or no rain falls throughout all that region while the heats continued the country was intolerably parched want of water was a great distress and a plentiful shower falling or a rivulet breaking forth altered the whole face of nature and introduced much higher ideas of refreshment and pleasure than the like causes can suggest to us hence to represent distress such frequent allusions amongst them to a dry and thirsty land where no water is and hence to describe a change from distress to prosperity their metaphors are ounded on the falling of showers and the bursting out of springs in the desert thus in isaiah the wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad and the desert shall rejoice and blossom as the rose for in the wilderness shall waters break out and streams in the desert and the parched ground shall become a pool and the thirsty land springs of water in the habitation of dragons there shall be grass with rushes and reeds chap xxxv i     images of this nature are very familiar to isaiah and occur in many parts of his book  again as judaea was a hilly country it was during the rainy months exposed to frequent inundations by the rushing of torrents which came down suddenly from the mountains and carried every thing before them and jordan their only great river annually overflowed its banks hence the frequent allusions to the noise and to the rushings of many waters and hence great calamities so often compared to the overflowing torrent which in such a country must have been images particularly striking deep calls unto deep at the noise of thy waterspouts all thy waves and thy billows are gone over me psalm xlii    the two most remarkable mountains of the country were lebanon and carmel the former noted for its height and the woods of lofty cedars that covered it the latter for its beauty and fertility the richness of its vines and olives hence with the greatest propriety lebanon is employed as an image of whatever is great strong or magnificent carmel of what is smiling and beautiful the glory of lebanon says isaiah shall be given to it and the excellency of carmel xxxv   lebanon is often put metaphorically for the whole state or people of israel for the temple for the king of assyria carmel for the blessings of peace and prosperity his countenance is as lebanon says solomon speaking of the dignity of a mans appearance but when he describes female beauty thine head is like mount carmel song v    and vii    it is farther to be remarked under this head that in the images of the awful and terrible kind with which the sacred poets abound they plainly draw their descriptions from that violence of the elements and those concussions of nature with which their climate rendered them acquainted earthquakes were not unfrequent and the tempests of hail thunder and lightning in judaea and arabia accompanied with whirlwinds and darkness far exceed any thing of that sort which happens in more temperate regions isaiah describes with great majesty the earth reeling to and fro like a drunkard and removed like a cottage xxiv  0 and in those circumstances of terror with which an appearance of the almighty is described in the   th psalm when his pavilion round about him was darkness when hailstones and coals of fire were his voice and when at his rebuke the channels of the waters are said to be seen and the foundations of the hills discovered though there may be some reference as dr lowth thinks to the history of gods descent upon mount sinai yet it seems more probable that the figures were taken directly from those commotions of nature with which the author was acquainted and which suggested stronger and nobler images than what now occurs to us  besides the natural objects of their own country we find the rites of their religion and the arts and employments of their common life frequently employed as grounds of imagery among the hebrews they were a people chiefly occupied with agriculture and pasturage these were arts held in high honor among them not disdained by their patriarchs kings and prophets little addicted to commerce separated from the rest of the world by their laws and their religion they were during the better days of their state strangers in a great measure to the refinements of luxury hence flowed of course the many allusions to pastoral life to the green pastures and the still waters and to the care and watchfulness of a shepherd over his flock which carry to this day so much beauty and tenderness in them in the   d psalm and in many other passages of the poetical writings of scripture hence all the images founded upon rural employments upon the wine press the threshing floor the stubble and the chaff to disrelish all such images is the effect of false delicacy homer is at least as frequent and much more minute and particular in his similies founded on what we now call low life but in his management of them far inferior to the sacred writers who generally mix with their comparisons of this kind somewhat of dignity and grandeur to ennoble them what inexpressible grandeur does the following rural image in isaiah for instance receive from the intervention of the deity the nations shall rush like the rushings of many waters but god shall rebuke them and they shall fly far off and they shall be chased as the chaff of the mountain before the wind and like the down of the thistle before the whirlwind  figurative allusions too we frequently find to the rites and ceremonies of their religion to the legal distinctions of things clean and unclean to the mode of their temple service to the dress of their priests and to the most noted incidents recorded in their sacred history as to the destruction of sodom the descent of god upon mount sinai and the miraculous passage of the israelites through the red sea the religion of the hebrews included the whole of their laws and civil constitution it was full of splendid external rites that occupied their senses it was connected with every part of their national history and establishment and and hence all ideas founded on religion possessed in this nation a dignity and importance peculiar to themselves and were uncommonly fitted to impress the imagination  from all this it results that the imagery of the sacred poets is in a high degree expressive and natural it is copied directly from real objects that were before their eyes it has this advantage of being more complete within itself more entirely founded on national ideas and manners than that of most other poets in reading their works we find ourselves continually in the land of judaea the palm trees and the cedars of lebanon are ever rising in our view the face of their territory the circumstance of their climate the manners of the people and the august ceremonies of their religion constantly pass under different forms before us  the comparisons employed by the sacred poets are generally short touching on one point only of resemblance rather than branching out into little episodes in this respect they have perhaps an advantage over the greek and roman authors whose comparisons by the length to which they are extended sometimes interrupt the narration too much and carry too visible marks of study and labor whereas in the hebrew poets they appear more like the glowings of a lively fancy just glancing aside to some resembling object and presently returning to its tract such is the following fine comparison introduced to describe the happy influence of good government upon a people in what are called the last words of david recorded in the  d book of samuel xxiii   he that rules over men must be just ruling in the fear of god and he shall be as the light of the morning when the sun rises even a morning without clouds as the tender grass springing out of the earth by clear shining after rain this is one of the most regular and formal comparisons in the sacred books  allegory likewise is a figure frequently found in them when formerly treating of this figure i gave for an instance of it that remarkably fine and well supported allegory which occurs in the  0th psalm wherein the people of israel are compared to a vine of parables which form a species of allegory the prophetical writings are full and if to us they sometimes appear obscure we must remember that in these early times it was universally the mode throughout all the eastern nations to convey sacred truths under mysterious figures and representations  but the poetical figure which beyond all others elevates the style of scripture and gives it a peculiar boldness and sublimity is prosopopoeia or personification no personifications employed by any poets are so magnificent and striking as those of the inspired writers on great occasions they animate every part of nature especially when any appearance or operation of the almighty is concerned before him went the pestilence  the waters saw thee o god and were afraid  the mountains saw thee and they trembled  the overflowing of the water passed by  the deep uttered his voice and lifted up his hands high when enquiry is made about the place of wisdom job introduces the deep saying it is not in me and the sea says it is not in me destruction and death say we have heard the fame thereof with our ears that noted sublime passage in the book of isaiah which describes the fall of the king of assyria is full of personified objects the firtrees and cedars of lebanon breaking forth into exultation on the fall of the tyrant hell from beneath stirring up all the dead to meet him at his coming and the dead kings introduced as speaking and joining in the triumph in the same strain are these many lively and passionate apostrophes to cities and countries to persons and things with which the prophetical writings every where abound o thou sword of the lord how long will it be ere thou be quiet put thyself up into the scabbard rest and be still how can it be quiet as the reply is instantly made seeing the lord has given it a charge against askelon and the seashore there has he appointed it jerem xlvii    in general for it would carry us too far to enlarge upon all the instances the style of the poetical books of the old testament is beyond the style of all other poetical works fervid bold and animated it is extremely different from that regular correct expression to which our ears are accustomed in modern poetry it is the burst of inspiration the scenes are not coolly described but represented as passing before our eyes every object and every person is addressed and spoken to as if present the transition is often abrupt the connection often obscure the persons are often changed figures crowded and heaped upon one another bold sublimity not correct elegance is its character we see the spirit of the writer raised beyond himself and laboring to find vent for ideas too mighty for his utterance  after these remarks on the poetry of the scriptures in general i shall conclude this dissertation with a short account of the different kinds of poetical composition in the sacred books and of the distinguishing characters of some of the chief writers  the several kinds of poetical composition which we find in scripture are chiefly the didactic elegiac pastoral and lyric of the didactic species of poetry the book of proverbs is the principal instance the nine first chapters of that book are highly poetical adorned with many distinguished graces and figures of expression at the  0th chapter the style is sensibly altered and descends into a lower strain which is continued to the end retaining however that sententious pointed manner and that artful construction of period which distinguishes all the hebrew poetry the book of ecclesiastes comes likewise under this head and some of the psalms as the    th in particular  of elegiac poetry many very beautiful specimens occur in scripture such as the lamentation of david over his friend jonathan several passages in the prophetical books and several of davids psalms composed on occasions of distress and mourning the   d psalm in particular is in the highest degree tender and plaintive but the most regular and perfect elegiac composition in the scripture perhaps in the whole world is the book entitled the lamentations of jeremiah as the prophet mourns in that book over the destruction of the temple and the holy city and the overthrow of the whole state he assembles all the affecting images which a subject so melancholy could suggest the composition is uncommonly artificial by turns the prophet and the city of jerusalem are introduced as pouring forth their sorrows and in the end a chorus of the people send up the most earnest and plaintive supplications to god the lines of the original too as may in part appear from our translation are longer than is usual in the other kinds of hebrew poetry and the melody is rendered thereby more flowing and better adapted to the querimonious strain of elegy  the song of solomon affords us a high exemplification of pastoral poetry considered with respect to its spiritual meaning it is undoubtedly a mystical allegory in its form it is a dramatic pastoral or a perpetual dialogue between personages in the character of shepherds and suitably to that form it is full of rural and pastoral images from beginning to end  of lyric poetry or that which is intended to be accompanied with music the old testament is full besides a great number of hymns and songs which we find scattered in the historical and prophetical books such as the song of moses the song of deborah and many others of like nature the whole book of psalms is to be considered as a collection of sacred odes in these we find the ode exhibited in all the varieties of its form and supported with the highest spirit of lyric poetry sometimes sprightly cheerful and triumphant sometimes solemn and magnificent sometimes tender and soft from these instances it clearly appears that there are contained in the holy scriptures full exemplifications of several of the chief kinds of poetical writing  among the different composers of the sacred books there is an evident diversity of style and manner and to trace their different characters in this view will contribute not a little toward our reading their writings with greater advantage the most eminent of the sacred poets are the author of the book of job david and isaiah as the compositions of david are of the lyric kind there is a greater variety of style and manner in his works than in those of the other two the manner in which considered merely as a poet david chiefly excels is the pleasing the soft and the tender in his psalms there are many lofty and sublime passages but in strength of description he yields to job in sublimity he yields to isaiah it is a sort of temperate grandeur for which david is chiefly distinguished and to this he always soon returns when upon some occasions he rises above it the psalms in which he touches us most are those in which he describes the happiness of the righteous or the goodness of god expresses the tender breathings of a devout mind or sends up moving and affectionate supplications to heaven isaiah is without exception the most sublime of all poets this is abundantly visible in our translation and what is a material circumstance none of the books of scripture appear to have been more happily translated than the writings of this prophet majesty is his reigning character a majesty more commanding and more uniformly supported than is to be found among the rest of the old testament poets he possesses indeed a dignity and grandeur both in his conceptions and expressions which is altogether unparalleled and peculiar to himself there is more clearness and order too and a more visible distribution of parts in his book than in any other of the prophetical writings  when we compare him with the rest of the poetical prophets we immediately see in jeremiah a very different genius isaiah employs himself generally on magnificent subjects jeremiah has little turn for the sublime and inclines always to the tender and elegiac ezechiel in poetical grace and elegance is much inferior to them both but he is distinguished by a character of uncommon force and ardour to use the elegant expressions of bishop lowth with regard to this prophet est atrox vehemens tragicus in sensibus fervidus acerbus indignabundus in imaginibus fecundus truculentus et nonnunquam pene deformis in dictione grandiloquus gravis austerus et interdum incultus frequens in repetitionibus non decoris aut gratiae causa sed ex indignatione et violentia quicquid susceperit tractandum id sedulo persequitur in eo unice haeret defixus a proposito raro deflectens in caeteris a plerisque vatibus fortasse superatus sed in eo genere ad quod videtur a natura unice comparatus nimirum vi pondere impetu granditate nemo unquam eum superavit the same learned writer compares isaiah to homer jeremiah to simonides and ezechiel to aeschylus most of the book of isaiah is strictly poetical of jeremiah and ezechiel not above one half can be held to belong to poetry among the minor prophets hosea joel michah habakkuk and especially nahum are distinguished for poetical spirit in the prophecies of daniel and jonah there is no poetry  it only now remains to speak of the book of job with which i shall conclude it is known to be extremely ancient generally reputed the most ancient of all the poetical books the author uncertain it is remarkable that this book has no connection with the affairs or manners of the jews or hebrews the scene is laid in the land of uz or idumaea which is a part of arabia and the imagery employed is generally of a different kind from what i before showed to be peculiar to the hebrew poets we meet with no allusions to the great events of sacred history to the religious rites of the jews to lebanon or to carmel or any of the peculiarities of the climate of judaea we find few comparisons founded on rivers or torrents these were not familiar objects in arabia but the longest comparison that occurs in the book is to an object frequent and well known in that region a brook that fails in the season of heat and disappoints the expectation of the traveller  the poetry however of the book of job is not only equal to that of any other of the sacred writings but is superior to them all except those of isaiah alone as isaiah is the most sublime david the most pleasing and tender so job is the most descriptive of all the inspired poets a peculiar glow of fancy and strength of description characterise the author no writer whatever abounds so much in metaphors he may be said not to describe but to render visible whatever he treats of a variety of instances might be given let us remark only those strong and lively colors with which in the following passages taken from the   th and  0th chapters of his book he paints the condition of the wicked observe how rapidly his figures rise before us and what a deep impression at the same time they leave on the imagination know thou not this of old since man was placed upon the earth that the triumphing of the wicked is short and the joy of the hypocrite but for a moment though his excellency mount up to the heavens and his head reach the clouds yet he shall perish for ever he shall fly away as a dream and shall not be found yea he shall be chased away as a vision of the night the eye also which saw him shall see him no more they which have seen him shall say where is he  he shall suck the poison of asps the vipers tongue shall slay him in the fullness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits every hand shall come upon him he shall flee from the iron weapon and the bow of steel shall strike him through all darkness shall be hid in his secret places a fire not blown shall consume him the heaven shall reveal his iniquity and the earth shall rise up against him the increase of his house shall depart his goods shall flow away in the day of wrath the light of the wicked shall be put out the light shall be dark in his tabernacle the steps of his strength shall be straitened and his own counsel shall cast him down for he is cast into a net by his own feet he walks upon a snare terrors shall make him afraid on every side and the robber shall prevail against him brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation his remembrance shall perish from the earth and he shall have no name in the street he shall be driven from light into darkness they that come after him shall be astonished at his day he shall drink of the wrath of the almighty  lecture xlii epic poetry it now remains to treat of the two highest kinds of poetical writing the epic and the dramatic i begin with the epic this lecture shall be employed upon the general principles of that species of composition after which i shall take a view of the character and genius of the most celebrated epic poets  the epic poem is universally allowed to be of all poetical works the most dignified and at the same time the most difficult in execution to contrive a story which shall please and interest all readers by being at once entertaining important and instructive to fill it with suitable incidents to enliven it with a variety of characters and of descriptions and throughout a long work to maintain that propriety of sentiment and that elevation of style which the epic character requires is unquestionably the highest effort of poetical genius hence so very few have succeeded in the attempt that strict critics will hardly allow any other poems to bear the name of epic except the iliad and the aeneid  there is no subject it must be confessed on which critics have displayed more pedantry than on this by tedious disquisitions founded on a servile submission to authority they have given such an air of mystery to a plain subject as to render it difficult for an ordinary reader to conceive what an epic poem is by bossus definition it is a discourse invented by art purely to form the manners of men by means of instructions disguised under the allegory of some important action which is related in verse this definition would suit several of aesops fables if they were somewhat extended and put into verse and accordingly to illustrate his definition the critic draws a parallel in form between the construction of one of aesops fables and the plan of homers iliad the first thing says he which either a writer of fables or of heroic poems does is to choose some maxim or point of morality to inculcate which is to be the design of his work next he invents a general story or a series of facts without any names such as he judges will be most proper for illustrating his intended moral lastly he particularises his story that is if he be a fabulist he introduces his dog his sheep and his wolf or if he be an epic poet he looks out in ancient history for some proper names of heroes to give to his actors and then his plan is completed  this is one of the most frigid and absurd ideas that ever entered into the mind of a critic homer he says saw the grecians divided into a great number of independent states but very often obliged to unite into one body against their common enemies the most useful instruction which he could give them in this situation was that a misunderstanding between princes is the ruin of the common cause in order to enforce this instruction he contrived in his own mind such a general story as this several princes join in a confederacy against their enemy the prince who was chosen as the leader of the rest affronts one of the most valiant of the confederates who thereupon withdraws himself and refuses to take part in the common enterprise great misfortunes are the consequence of this division till at length both parties having suffered by the quarrel the offended prince forgets his displeasure and is reconciled to the leader and union being once restored there ensues complete victory over their enemies upon this general plan of his fable adds bossu it was of no great consequence whether in filling it up homer had employed the names of beasts like aesop or of men he would have been equally instructive either way but as he rather fancied to write of heroes he pitched upon the war of troy for the scene of his fable he feigned such an action to happen there he gave the name of agamemnon to the common leader that of achilles to the offended prince and so the iliad arose  he that can believe homer to have proceeded in this manner may believe any thing one may pronounce with great certainty that an author who should compose according to such a plan who should arrange all the subject in his own mind with a view to the moral before he had ever thought of the personages who were to be his actors might write perhaps useful fables for children but as to an epic poem if he adventured to think of one it would be such as would find few readers no person of any taste can entertain a doubt that the first objects which strike an epic poet are the hero whom he is to celebrate and the action or story which is to be the groundwork of his poem he does not sit down like a philosopher to form the plan of a treatise of morality his genius is fired by some great enterprise which to him appears noble and interesting and which therefore he pitches upon as worthy of being celebrated in the highest strain of poetry there is no subject of this kind but will always afford some general moral instruction arising from it naturally the instruction which bossu points out is certainly suggested by the iliad and there is another which arises as naturally and may just as well be assigned for the moral of that poem namely that providence avenges those who have suffered injustice but that when they allow their resentment to carry them too far it brings misfortunes upon themselves the subject of the poem is the wrath of achilles caused by the injustice of agamemnon jupiter avenges achilles by giving success to the trojans against agamemnon but by continuing obstinate in his resentment achilles loses his beloved friend patroclus  the plain account of the nature of an epic poem is the recital of some illustrious enterprise in a poetical form this is as exact a definition as there is any occasion for on this subject it comprehends several other poems besides the iliad of homer the aeneid of virgil and the jerusalem of tasso which are perhaps the three most regular and complete epic works that ever were composed but to exclude all poems from the epic class which are not formed exactly upon the same model as these is the pedantry of criticism we can give exact definitions and descriptions of minerals plants and animals and can arrange them with precision under the different classes to which they belong because nature affords a visible unvarying standard to which we refer them but with regard to works of taste and imagination where nature has fixed no standard but leaves scope for beauties of many different kinds it is absurd to attempt defining and limiting them with the same precision criticism when employed in such attempts degenerates into trifling questions about words and names only i therefore have no scruple to class such poems as miltons paradise lost lucans pharsalia statiuss thebaid ossians fingal and temora camoens lusiad voltaires henriade cambrays telemachus glovers leonidas wilkies epigoniad under the same species of composition with the iliad and the aeneid though some of them approach much nearer than others to the perfection of these celebrated works they are undoubtedly all epic that is poetical recitals of great adventures which is all that is meant by this denomination of poetry  though i cannot by any means allow that it is the essence of an epic poem to be wholly an allegory or a fable contrived to illustrate some moral truth yet it is certain that no poetry is of a more moral nature than this its effect in promoting virtue is not to be measured by any one maxim or instruction which results from the whole story like the moral of one of aesops fables this is a poor and trivial view of the advantage to be derived from perusing a long epic work that at the end we shall be able to gather from it some commonplace morality its effect arises from the impression which the parts of the poem separately as well as the whole taken together make upon the mind of the reader from the great examples which it sets before us and the high sentiments with which it warms our hearts the end which it proposes is to extend our ideas of human perfection or in other words to excite admiration now this can be accomplished only by proper representations of heroic deeds and virtuous characters for high virtue is the object which all mankind are formed to admire and therefore epic poems are and must be favorable to the cause of virtue valor truth justice fidelity friendship piety magnanimity are the objects which in the course of such compos tions are presented to our minds under the most splendid and honorable colors in behalf of virtuous personages our affections are engaged in their designs and their distresses we are interested the generous and public affections are awakened the mind is purified from sensual and mean pursuits and accustomed to take part in great heroic enterprises it is indeed no small testimony in honor of virtue that several of the most refined and elegant entertainments of mankind such as that species of poetical composition which we now consider must be grounded on moral sentiments and impressions this is a testimony of such weight that were it in the power of skeptical philosophers to weaken the force of those reasonings which establish the essential distinction between vice and virtue the writings of epic poets alone were sufficient to refute their false philosophy showing by that appeal which they constantly make to the feelings of mankind in favor of virtue that the foundations of it are laid deep and strong in human nature  the general strain and spirit of epic composition sufficiently mark its distinction from the other kinds of poetry in pastoral writing the reigning idea is innocence and tranquillity compassion is the great object of tragedy ridicule the province of comedy the predominant character of the epic is admiration excited by heroic actions it is sufficiently distinguished from history both by its poetical form and the liberty of fiction which it assumes it is a more calm composition than tragedy it admits nay requires the pathetic and the violent on particular occasions but the pathetic is not expected to be its general character it requires more than any other species of poetry a grave equal and supported dignity it takes in a greater compass of time and action than dramatic writing admits and thereby allows a more full display of characters dramatic writing displays characters chiefly by means of sentiments and passions epic poetry chiefly by means of actions the emotions therefore which it raises are not so violent but they are more prolonged  these are the general characteristics of this species of composition but in order to give a more particular and critical view of it let us consider the epic poem under three heads first with respect to the subject or action secondly with respect to the actors or characters and lastly with respect to the narration of the poet  the action or subject of the epic poem must have three properties it must be one it must be great it must be interesting  first it must be one action or enterprise which the poet chooses for his subject i have frequently had occasion to remark the importance of unity in many kinds of composition in order to make a full and strong impression upon the mind with the highest reason aristotle insists upon this as essential to epic poetry and it is indeed the most material of all his rules respecting it for it is certain that in the recital of heroic adventures several scattered and independent facts can never affect a reader so deeply nor engage his attention so strongly as a tale that is one and connected where the several incidents hang upon one another and are all made to conspire for the accomplishment of one end in a regular epic the more that this unity is rendered sensible to the imagination the effect will be the better and for this reason as aristotle has observed it is not sufficient for the poet to confine himself to the actions of one man or to those which happened during a certain period of time but the unity must lie in the subject itself and arise from all the parts combining into one whole  in all the great epic poems unity of action is sufficiently apparent virgil for instance has chosen for his subject the establishment of aeneas in italy from the beginning to the end of the poem this object is ever in our view and links all the parts of it together with full connection the unity of the odyssey is of the same nature the return and reestablishment of ulysses in his own country the subject of tasso is the recovery of jerusalem from the infidels that of milton the expulsion of our first parents from paradise and both of them are unexceptionable in the unity of the story the professed subject of the iliad is the anger of achilles with the consequences which it produced the greeks carry on many unsuccessful engagements against the trojans as long as they are deprived of the assistance of achilles upon his being appeased and reconciled to agamemnon victory follows and the poem closes it must be owned however that the unity or connecting principle is not quite so sensible to the imagination here as in the aeneid for throughout many books of the iliad achilles is out of sight he is lost in inaction and the fancy terminates on no other object than the success of the two armies whom we see contending in war  the unity of the epic action is not to be so strictly interpreted as if it excluded all episodes or subordinate actions it is necessary to observe here that the term episode is employed by aristotle in a different sense from what we now give to it it was a term originally applied to dramatic poetry and thence transferred to epic and by episodes in an epic poem it would seem that aristotle understood the extension of the general fable or plan of the poem into all its circumstances what his meaning was is indeed not very clear and this obscurity has occasioned much altercation among critical writers bossu in particular is so perplexed upon this subject as to be unintelligible but dismissing so fruitless a controversy what we now understand by episodes are certain actions or incidents introduced into the narration connected with the principal action yet not so essential to it as to destroy if they had been omitted the mean subject of the poem of this nature are the interview of hector with andromache in the iliad the story of cacus and that of nisus and euryalus in the aeneid the adventures of tancred with erminia and clorinda in the jerusalem and the prospect of his descendants exhibited to adam in the last books of paradise lost  such episodes as these are not only permitted to an epic poet but provided they be properly executed are great ornaments to his work the rules regarding them are the following  first they must be naturally introduced they must have a sufficient connection with the subject of the poem they must seem inferior parts that belong to it not mere appendages stuck to it the episode of olindo and sophronia in the second book of tassos jerusalem is faulty by transgressing this rule it is too detached from the rest of the work and being introduced so near the opening of the poem misleads the reader into an expectation that it is to be of some future consequence whereas it proves to be connected with nothing that follows in proportion as any episode is slightly related to the mean subject it should always be the shorter the passion of dido in the aeneid and the snares of armida in the jerusalem which are expanded so fully in these poems cannot with propriety be called episodes they are constituent parts of the work and form a considerable share of the intrigue of the poem  in the next place episodes ought to present to us objects of a different kind from those which go before and those which follow in the course of the poem for it is principally for the sake of variety that episodes are introduced into an epic composition in so long a work they tend to diversify the subject and to relieve the reader by shifting the scene in the midst of combats therefore and episode of the martial kind would be out of place whereas hectors visit to andromache in the iliad and erminias adventure with the shepherd in the seventh book of the jerusalem afford us a welljudged and pleasing retreat from camps and battles  lastly as an episode is a professed embellishment it ought to be particularly elegant and well finished and accordingly it is for the most part in pieces of this kind that poets put forth their strength the episodes of teribazus and ariana in leonidas and of the death of hercules in the epigoniad are the two greatest beauties in these poems  the unity of the epic action necessarily supposes that the action be entire and complete that is as aristotle well expresses it that it have a beginning a middle and an end either by relating the whole in his own person or by introducing some of his actors to relate what had passed before the opening of the poem the author must always contrive to give us full information of every thing that belongs to his subject he must not leave our curiosity in any article ungratified he must bring us precisely to the accomplishment of his plan and then conclude  the second property of the epic action is that it be great that it have sufficient splendor and importance both to fix our attention and to justify the magnificent apparatus which the poet bestows upon it this is so evidently requisite as not to require illustration and indeed hardly any who have attempted epic poetry have failed in choosing some subject sufficiently important either by the nature of the action or by the fame of the personages concerned in it  it contributes to the grandeur of the epic subject that it be not of a modern date nor fall within any period of history with which we are intimately acquainted both lucan and voltaire have in the choice of their subjects transgressed this rule and they have upon that account succeeded worse antiquity is favorable to those high and august ideas which epic poetry is designed to raise it tends to aggrandise in our imagination both persons and events and what is still more material it allows the poet the liberty of adorning his subject by means of fiction whereas as soon as he comes within the verge of real and authenticated history this liberty is abridged he must either confine himself wholly as lucan has done to strict historical truth at the expense of rendering his story jejune or if he goes beyond it like voltaire in his henriade this disadvantage follows that in wellknown events the true and the fictitious parts of the plan do not naturally mingle and incorporate with each other these observations cannot be applied to dramatic writing where the personages are exhibited to us not so much that we may admire as that we may love or pity them such passions are much more consistent with the familiar historical knowledge of the persons who are to be the objects of them and even require them to be displayed in the light and with the failings of ordinary men modern and wellknown history therefore may furnish very proper materials for tragedy but for epic poetry where heroism is the groundwork and where the object in view is to excite admiration ancient or traditionary history is assuredly the safest region there the author may lay hold on names and characters and events not wholly unknown on which to build his story while at the same time by reason of the distance of the period or of the remoteness of the scene sufficient license is left him for fiction and invention  the third property required in the epic poem is that it be interesting it is not sufficient for this purpose that it be great for deeds of mere valor how heroic soever may prove cold and tiresome much will depend on the happy choice of some subject which shall by its nature interest the public as when the poet selects for his hero one who is the founder or the deliverer or the favorite of his nation or when he writes of achievements that have been highly celebrated or have been connected with with important consequences to any public cause most of the great epic poems are abundantly fortunate in this respect and must have been very interesting to those ages and countries in which they were composed  but the chief circumstance which renders an epic poem interesting and which tends to interest not one age or country alone but all readers is the skilful conduct of the author in the management of his subject he must so contrive his plan as that it shall comprehend many affecting incidents he must not dazzle us perpetually with valiant achievements for all readers tire of constant fighting and battles but he must study to touch our hearts he may sometimes be awful and august he must often be tender and pathetic he must give us gentle and pleasing scenes of love friendship and affection the more that an epic poem abound with situations which awaken the feelings of humanity it is the more interesting and these form always the favorite passages of the work i know no epic poets so happy in this respect as virgil and tasso  much too depends on the characters of the heroes for rendering the poem interesting that they be such as shall strongly attach the readers and make them take part in the dangers which the heroes encounter these dangers or obstacles form what is called the nodus or the intrigue of the epic poem in the judicious conduct of which consists much of the poets art he must rouse our attention by a prospect of the difficulties which seem to threaten disappointment to the enterprise of his favorite personages he must make these difficulties grow and thicken upon us by degrees till after having kept us for some time in a state of agitation and suspense he paves the way by a proper preparation of incidents for the winding up of the plot in a natural and probable manner it is plain that every tale which is designed to engage attention must be conducted on a plan of this sort  a question has been moved whether the nature of the epic poem does not require that it should always end successfully most critics incline to think that a successful issue is the most proper and they appear to have reason on their side an unhappy conclusion depresses the mind and is opposite to the elevating emotions which belong to this species of poetry terror and compassion are the proper subjects of tragedy but as the epic poem is of larger compass and extent it were too much if after the difficulties and troubles which commonly abound in the progress of the poem the author should bring them all at last to an unfortunate issue accordingly the general practice of epic poets is on the side of a prosperous conclusion not however without some exceptions for two authors of great name lucan and milton have held a contrary course the one concluding with the subversion of the roman liberty the other with the expulsion of man from paradise  with regard to the time or duration of the epic action no precise boundaries can be ascertained a considerable extent is always allowed to it as it does not necessarily depend on those violent passions which can be supposed to have only a short continuance the iliad which is formed upon the anger of achilles has with propriety the shortest duration of any of the great epic poems according to bossu the action lasts no longer than fortyseven days the action of the odyssey computed from the taking of troy to the peace of ithaca extends to eight years and a half and the action of the aeneid computed in the same way from the taking of troy to the death of turnus includes about six years but if we measure the period only of the poets own narration or compute from the time in which the hero makes his first appearance till the conclusion the duration of both these last poems is brought within a much smaller compass the odyssey beginning with ulysses in the island of calypso comprehends fiftyeight days only and the aeneid beginning with the storm which throws aeneas upon the coast of africa is reckoned to include at the most a year and some months  having thus treated of the epic action or the subject of the poem i proceed next to make some observations on the actors or personages  as it is the business of an epic poet to copy after nature and to form a probable interesting tale he must study to give all his personages proper and wellsupported characters such as display the features of human nature this is what aristotle calls giving manners to the poem it is by no means necessary that all his actors be morally good imperfect nay vicious characters may find a proper place though the nature of epic poetry seems to require that the principal figures exhibited should be such as to tend to raise admiration and love rather than hatred or contempt but whatever the character be which a poet gives to any of his actors he must take care to preserve it uniform and consistent with itself every thing which that person says or does must be suited to it and must serve to distinguish him from any other  poetic characters may be divided into two kinds general and particular general characters are such as wise brave virtuous without any farther distinction particular characters express the species of bravery of wisdom of virtue for which any one is eminent they exhibit the peculiar features which distinguish one individual from another which mark the difference of the same moral quality in different men according as it is combined with other dispositions in their temper in drawing such particular characters genius is chiefly exerted how far each of the three great epic poets have distinguished themselves in this part of composition i shall have occasion afterward to show when i come to make remarks upon their works it is sufficient now to mention that it is in this part homer has principally excelled tasso has come the nearest to homer and virgil has been the most deficient  it has been the practice of all epic poets to select some one personage whom they distinguish above all the rest and make the hero of the tale this is considered as essential to epic composition and is attended with several advantages it renders the unity of the subject more sensible when there is one principal figure to which as to a center all the rest refer it tends to interest us more in the enterprise which is carried on and it gives the poet an opportunity of exerting his talents for adorning and displaying one character with peculiar splendour it has been asked who then is the hero of paradise lost the devil it has been answered by some critics and in consequence of this idea much ridicule and censure has been thrown upon milton but they have mistaken that authors intention by proceeding upon a supposition that in the conclusion of the poem the hero must needs be triumphant whereas milton followed a different plan and has given a tragic conclusion to a poem otherwise epic in its form for adam is undoubtedly his hero that is the capital and most interesting figure in his poem  besides human actors there are personages of another kind that usually occupy no small place in epic poetry i mean the gods or supernatural beings this brings us to the consideration of what is called the machinery of the epic poem the most nice and difficult part of the subject critics appear to me to have gone to extremes on both sides almost all the french critics decide in favor of machinery as essential to the constitution of an epic poem they quote that sentence of petronius arbiter as if it were an oracle per ambages deorumque ministeria precipitandus est liber spiritus and hold that though a poem had every other requisite that could be demanded yet it could not be ranked in the epic class unless the main action was carried on by the intervention of the gods this decision seems to be founded on no principle or reason whatever unless a superstitious reverence for the practice of homer and virgil these poets very properly embellished their story by the traditional tales and popular legends of their own country according to which all the great transactions of the heroic times were intermixed with the fables of their deities but does it thence follow that in other countries and other ages where there is not the like advantage of current superstition and popular credulity epic poetry must be wholly confined to antiquated fictions and fairy tales lucan has composed a very spirited poem certainly of the epic kind where neither gods nor supernatural beings are at all employed the author of leonidas has made an attempt of the same kind not without success and beyond doubt wherever a poet gives us a regular heroic story well connected in its parts adorned with characters and supported with proper dignity and elevation though his agents be every one of them human he has fulfilled the chief requisites of this sort of composition and has a just title to be classed with epic writers  but though i cannot admit that machinery is necessary or essential to the epic plan neither can i agree with some late critics of considerable name who are for excluding it totally as inconsistent with that probability and impression of reality which they think should reign in this kind of writing see elm of criticism chapter     mankind do not consider poetical writings with so philosophical an eye they seek entertainment from them and for the bulk of readers indeed for almost all men the mavelous has a great charm it gratifies and fills the imagination and gives room for many a striking and sublime description in epic poetry in particular where admiration and lofty ideas are supposed to reign the mavelous and supernatural find if any where their proper place they both enable the poet to aggrandize his subject by means of those august and solemn objects which religion introduces into it and they allow him to enlarge and diversify his plan by comprehending within it heaven and earth and hell men and invisible beings and the whole circle of the universe  at the same time in the use of this supernatural machinery it becomes a poet to be temperate and prudent he is not at liberty to invent what system of the mavelous he pleases it must always have some foundation in popular belief he must avail himself in a decent manner either of the religious faith or the superstitious credulity of the country wherein he lives or of which he writes so as to give an air of probability to events which are most contrary to the common course of nature whatever machinery he employs he must take care not to overload us with it not to withdraw human actions and manners too much from view nor to obscure them under a cloud of incredible fictions he must always remember that his chief business is to relate to men the actions and exploits of men that it is by these principally he is to interest us and to touch our hearts and that if probability be altogether banished from his work it can never make a deep or a lasting impression indeed i know nothing more difficult in epic poetry than to adjust properly the mixture of the mavelous with the probable so as to gratify and amuse us with the one without sacrificing the other i need hardly observe that these observations affect not the conduct of miltons work whose plan being altogether theological his supernatural beings form not the machinery but are the principal actors in the poem  with regard to allegorical personages fame discord love and the like it may be safely pronounced that they form the worst machinery of any in description they are sometimes allowable and may serve for embellishment but they should never be permitted to bear any share in the action of the poem for being plain and declared fictions mere names of general ideas to which even fancy cannot attribute any existence as persons if they are introduced as mingling with human actors an intolerable confusion of shadows and realities arises and all consistency of action is utterly destroyed  in the narration of the poet which is the last head that remains to be considered it is not material whether he relate the whole story in his own character or introduce some of his personages to relate any part of the action that had passed before the poem opens homer follows the one method in his iliad and the other in his odyssey virgil has in this respect imitated the conduct of the odyssey tasso that of the iliad the chief advantage which arises from any of the actors being employed to relate part of the story is that it allows the poet if he chooses it to open with some interesting situation of affairs informing us afterward of what had passed before that period and gives him the greater liberty of spreading out such parts of the subject as he inclines to dwell upon in person and of comprehending the rest within a short recital where the subject is of great extent and comprehends the transactions of several years as in the odyssey and the aeneid this method therefore seems preferable when the subject is of a smaller compass and shorter duration as in the iliad and the jerusalem the poet may without disadvantage relate the whole in his own person according as is done in both these poems  in the proposition of the subject the invocation of the muse and other ceremonies of the introduction poets may vary at their pleasure it is perfectly trifling to make these little formalities the object of precise rule any farther than that the subject of the work should always be clearly proposed and without affected or unsuitable pomp for according to horaces noted rule no introduction should ever set out too high or promise too much lest the author should not fulfill the expectations he has raised  what is of most importance in the tenor of the narration is that it be perspicuous animated and enriched with all the beauties of poetry no sort of composition requires more strength dignity and fire than the epic poem it is the region within which we look for every thing that is sublime in description tender in sentiment and bold and lively in expression and therefore though an authors plan should be faultless and his story ever so well conducted yet if he be feeble or flat in style destitute of affecting scenes and deficient in poetical coloring he can have no success the ornaments which epic poetry admits must all be of the grave and chaste kind nothing that is loose ludicrous or affected finds any place there all the objects which it presents ought to be either great or tender or pleasing descriptions of disgusting or shocking objects should as much as possible be avoided and therefore the fable of the harpies in the third book of the aeneid and the allegory of sin and death in the second book of paradise lost had been better omitted in these celebrated poems  lecture xliii homers iliad and odyssey  virgils aeneid as the epic poem is universally allowed to possess the highest rank among poetical works it merits a particular discussion having treated of the nature of this composition and the principal rules relating to it i proceed to make some observations on the most distinguished epic poems ancient and modern  homer claims on every account our first attention as the father not only of epic but in some measure of poetry in general whoever sits down to read homer must consider that he is going to read the most ancient book in the world next to the bible without making this reflection he cannot enter into the spirit nor relish the composition of the author he is not to look for the correctness and elegance of the augustan age he must divest himself of our modern ideas of dignity and refinement and transport his imagination almost three thousand years back in the history of mankind what he is to expect is a picture of the ancient world he must reckon upon finding characters and manners that retain a considerable tincture of the savage state moral ideas as yet imperfectly formed and the appetites and passions of men brought under none of those restraints to which in a more advanced state of society they are accustomed but bodily strength prized as one of the chief heroic endowments the preparing of a meal and the appeasing of hunger described as very interesting objects and the heroes boasting of themselves openly scolding one another outrageously and glorying as we would now think very indecently over their fallen enemies  the opening of the iliad possesses none of that sort of dignity which a modern looks for in a great epic poem it turns on no higher subject than the quarrel of two chieftans about a female slave the priest of apollo beseeches agamemnon to restore his daughter who in the plunder of a city had fallen to agamemnons share of booty he refuses apollo at the prayer of his priest sends a plague into the grecian camp the augur when consulted declares that there is no way of appeasing apollo but by restoring the daughter of his priest agamemnon is enraged at the augur professes that he likes his slave better than his wife clytemnestra but since he must restore her in order to save the army insists to have another in her place and pitches upon briseis the slave of achilles achilles as was to be expected kindles into rage at this demand reproaches him for his rapacity and insolence and after giving him many hard names solemnly swears that if he is to be thus treated by the general he will withdraw his troops and assist the grecians no more against the trojans he withdraws accordingly his mother the goddess thetis interests jupiter in his cause who to revenge the wrong which achilles had suffered takes part against the greeks and suffers them to fall into great and long distress until achilles is pacified and reconciliation brought about between him and agamemnon  such is the basis of the whole action of the iliad hence rise all those speciosa miracula as horace terms them which fill that extraordinary poem and which have had the power of interesting almost all the nations of europe during every age since the days of homer the general admiration commanded by a poetical plan so very different from what any one would have formed in our times ought not upon reflection to be matter of surprise for besides that a fertile genius can enrich and beautify any subject on which it is employed it is to be observed that ancient manners how much soever they contradict our present notions of dignity and refinement afford nevertheless materials for poetry superior in some respects to those which are furnished by a more polished state of society they discover human nature more open and undisguised without any of those studied forms of behavior which now conceal men from one another they give free scope to the strongest and most impetuous emotions of the mind which make a better figure in description than calm and temperate feelings they show us our native prejudices appetites and desires exerting themselves without control from this state of manners joined with the advantages of that strong and expressive style which as i formerly observed commonly distinguishes the compositions of early ages we have ground to look for more of the boldness ease and freedom of native genius in compositions of such a period than in those of more civilized times and accordingly the two great characters of the homeric poetry are fire and simplicity let us now proceed to make some more particular observations on the iliad under the three heads of the subject and action the characters and narration of the poet  the subject of the iliad must unquestionably be admitted to be in the main happily chosen in the days of homer no object could be more splendid and dignified than the trojan war so great a confederacy of the grecian states under one leader and the ten years siege which they carried on against troy must have spread far abroad the renown of many military exploits and interested all greece in the traditions concerning the heroes who had most eminently signalized themselves upon these traditions homer grounded his poem and though he lived as is generally believed only two or three centuries after the trojan war yet through the want of written records tradition must by this time have fallen into the degree of obscurity most proper for poetry and have left him at full liberty to mix as much fable as he pleased with the remains of true history he has not chosen for his subject the whole trojan war but with great judgment he has selected one part of it the quarrel betwixt achilles and agamemnon and the events to which that quarrel gave rise which though they take up fortyseven days only yet include the most interesting and most critical period of the war by this management he has given greater unity to what would have otherwise been an unconnected history of battles he has gained one hero or principal character achilles who reigns throughout the work and he has shown the pernicious effect of discord among confederated princes at the same time i admit that homer is less fortunate in his subject than virgil the plan of the aeneid includes a greater compass and a more agreeable diversity of events whereas the iliad is almost entirely filled with battles  the praise of high invention has in every age been given to homer with the greatest reason the prodigious number of incidents of speeches of characters divine and human with which he abounds the surprising variety with which he has diversified his battles in the wounds and deaths and little history pieces of almost all the persons slain discover an invention next to boundless but the praise of judgment is in my opinion no less due to homer than that of invention his story is all along conducted with great art he rises upon us gradually his heroes are brought out one after another to be objects of our attention the distress thickens as the poem advances and every thing is so contrived as to aggrandize achilles and to render him as the poet intended he should be the capital figure  but that wherein homer excels all writers is the characteristical part here he is without a rival his lively and spirited exhibition of characters is in a great measure owing to his being so dramatic a writer abounding every where with dialogue and conversation there is much more dialogue in homer than in virgil or indeed than in any other poet what virgil informs  of by two words of narration homer bri about by a speech we may observe here that this method of writing is more ancient than the narrative manner of this we have a clear proof in the books of the old testament which instead of narration abound with speeches with answers and replies upon the most familiar subjects thus in the book of genesis joseph said unto his brethren whence come ye and they answered from the land of canaan we come to buy food and joseph said ye are spies to see the nakedness of the land are ye come and they said unto him nay my lord but to buy food are thy servants come we are all one mans sons we are true men thy servants are no spies and he said unto them nay but to see the nakedness of the land ye are come and they said thy servants are twelve brethren the sons of one man in the land of canaan and behold the youngest is this day with our father and one is not and joseph said unto them this it is that i spoke unto you saying ye are spies hereby ye shall be proved by the life of pharaoh ye shall not go forth except your youngest brother come hither etc genesis xlii     such a style as this is the most simple and artless form of writing and must therefore undoubtedly have been the most ancient it is copying directly from nature giving a plain rehearsal of what passed or was supposed to pass in conversation between the persons of whom the author treats in progress of time when the art of writing was more studied it was thought more elegant to compress the substance of conversation into short distinct narrative made by the poet or historian in his own person and to reserve direct speeches for solemn occasions only  the ancient dramatic method which homer practiced has some advantages balanced with some defects it renders composition more natural and animated and more expressive of manners and characters but withal less grave and majestic and sometimes tiresome homer it must be admitted has carried his propensity to the making of speeches too far and if he be tedious any where it is in these some of them trifling and some of them plainly unseasonable together with the greek vivacity he leaves upon our minds some impression of the greek loquacity also his speeches however are upon the whole characteristic and lively and to them we owe in a great measure that admirable display which he has given of human nature every one who reads him becomes familiarly and intimately acquainted with his heroes we seem to have lived among them and to have conversed with them not only has he pursued the single virtue of courage through all its different forms and features in his different warriors but some more delicate characters into which courage either enters not at all or but for an inconsiderable part he has drawn with singular art  how finely for instance has he painted the character of helen so as notwithstanding her frailty and her crimes to prevent her from being an odious object the admiration with which the old generals behold her in the third book when she is coming toward them presents her to us with much dignity her veiling herself and shedding tears her confusion in the presence of priam her grief and selfaccusations at the sight of menelaus her upbraiding of paris for his cowardice and at the same time her returning fondness for him exhibit the most striking features of that mixed female character which we partly condemn and partly pity homer never introduces her without making her say something to move our compassion while at the same time he takes care to contrast her character with that of a virtuous matron in the chaste and tender andromache  paris himself the author of all the mischief is characterised with the utmost propriety he is as we would expect him a mixture of gallantry and effeminacy he retreats from menelaus on his first appearance but immediately afterward enters into single combat with him he is a great master of civility remarkably courteous in his speeches and receives all the reproofs of his brother hector with modesty and deference he is described as a person of elegance and taste he was the architect of his own palace he is in the sixth book found by hector burnishing and dressing up his armor and issues forth to battle with a peculiar gaiety and ostentation of appearance which is illustrated by one of the finest comparisons in all the iliad that of the horse prancing to the river  homer has been blamed for making his hero achilles of too brutal and inamiable a character but i am inclined to think that injustice is commonly done to achilles upon the credit of two lines of horace who has certainly overloaded his character impiger iracundus inexorabilis acer jura negat sibi nata nihil non arrogat armis   achilles is passionate indeed to a great degree but he is far from being a contemner of laws and justice in the contest with agamemnon though he carries it on with too much heat yet he has reason on his side he was notoriously wronged but he submits and resigns briseis peaceably when the heralds come to demand her only he will fight no longer under the command of a leader who had affronted him besides his wonderful bravery and contempt of death he has several other qualities of a hero he is open and sincere he loves his subjects and respects the gods he is distinguished by strong friendships and attachments he is throughout high spirited gallant and honorable and allowing for a degree of ferocity which belonged to the times and enters into the characters of most of homers heroes he is upon the whole abundantly fitted to raise high admiration though not pure esteem  under the head of characters homers gods or his machinery according to the critical term come under consideration the gods make a great figure in the iliad much greater indeed than they do in the aeneid or in any other epic poem and hence homer has become the standard of poetic theology concerning machinery in general i delivered my sentiments in the former lecture concerning homers machinery in particular we must observe that it was not his own invention like every other good poet he unquestionably followed the traditions of his country the age of the trojan war approached to the age of the gods and demigods in greece several of the heroes concerned in that war were reputed to be the children of those gods of course the traditionary tales relating to them and to the exploits of that age were blended with the fables of the deities these popular legends homer very properly adopted though it is perfectly absurd to infer from this that therefore poets arising in succeeding ages and writing on quite different subjects are obliged to follow the same system of machinery  in the hands of homer it produces on the whole a noble effect it is always gay and amusing often lofty and magnificent it introduces into his poem a great number of personages almost as much distinguished by characters as his human actors it diversifies his battles greatly by the intervention of the gods and by frequently shifting the scene from earth to heaven it gives an agreeable relief to the mind in the midst of so much blood and slaughter homers gods it must be confessed though they be always lively and animated figures yet sometimes want dignity the conjugal contentions between juno and jupiter with which he entertains us and the indecent squabbles he describes among the inferior deities according as they take different sides with the contending parties would be very unlucky models for any modern poet to imitate in apology for homer however it must be remembered that according to the fables of those days the gods are but one remove above the condition of men they have all the human passions they drink and feast and are vulnerable like men they have children and kinsmen in the opposite armies and bating that they are immortal that they have houses on the top of olympus and winged chariots in which they are often flying down to earth and then reascending in order to feast on nectar and ambrosia they are in truth no higher beings than the human heroes and therefore very fit to take part in their contentions at the same time though homer so frequently degrades his divinities yet he knows how to make them appear in some conjunctures with the most awful majesty jupiter the father of gods and men is for the most part introduced with great dignity and several of the most sublime conceptions in the iliad are founded on the appearances of neptune minerva and apollo on great occasions  with regard to homers style and manner of writing it is easy natural and in the highest degree animated it will be admired by such only as relish ancient simplicity and can make allowance for certain negligencies and repetitions which greater refinement in the art of writing has taught succeeding though far inferior poets to avoid for homer is the most simple in his style of all the great poets and resembles most the style of the poetical parts of the old testament they can have no conception of his manner who are acquainted with him in mr popes translation only an excellent poetical performance that translation is and faithful in the main to the original in some places it may be thought to have even improved homer it has certainly softened some of his rudenesses and added delicacy and grace to some of his sentiments but withal it is no other than homer modernised in the midst of the elegance and luxuriancy of mr popes language we lose sight of the old bards simplicity i know indeed no author to whom it is more difficult to do justice in a translation than homer as the plainness of his diction were it literally rendered would often appear flat in any modern language so in the midst of that plainness and not a little heightened by it there are every where breaking forth upon us flashes of native fire of sublimity and beauty which hardly any language except his own could preserve his versification has been universally acknowledged to be uncommonly melodious and to carry beyond that of any poet a resemblance in the sound to the sense and meaning  in narration homer is at all times remarkably concise which renders him lively and agreeable though in his speeches as i have before admitted sometimes tedious he is every where descriptive and descriptive by means of those well chosen particulars which form the excellency of description virgil gives us the nod of jupiter with great magnificence annuit et totum nutu tremefecit olympum   but homer in describing the same thing gives us the sable eyebrows of jupiter bent and his ambrosial curls shaken at the moment when he gives the nod and thereby renders the figure more natural and lively whenever he seeks to draw our attention to some interesting object he particularises it so happily as to paint it in a manner to our sight the shot of pandarus arrow which broke the truce between the two armies as related in the fourth book may be given for an instance and above all the admirable interview of hector with andromache in the sixth book where all the circumstances of conjugal and parental tenderness the child affrighted with the view of his fathers helmet and chrest and clinging to the nurse hector putting off his helmet taking the child into his arms and offering up a prayer for him to the gods andromache receiving back the child with a smile of pleasure and at the same instant bursting into tears  as it is finely expressed in the original form the most natural and affecting picture that can possibly be imagined  in the description of battles homer particularly excels he works up the hurry the terror and confusion of them in so masterly a manner as to place the reader in the very midst of the engagement it is here that the fire of his genius is most highly displayed insomuch that virgils battles and indeed those of most other poets are cold and inanimated in comparison of homers  with regard to similies no poet abounds so much with them several of them are beyond doubt extremely beautiful such as those of the fires in the trojan camp compared to the moon and stars by night paris going sorth to battle to the warhorse prancing to the river and euphorbus slain to the flowering shrub cut down by a sudden blast all which are among the finest poetical passages that are any where to be found i am not however of opinion that homers comparisons taken in general are his greatest beauties they come too thick upon us and often interrupt the train of his narration or description the resemblance on which they are founded is sometimes not clear and the objects whence they are taken are too uniform his lions bulls eagles and herds of sheep recur too frequently and the allusions in some of his similies even after the allowances that are to be made for ancient manners must be admitted to be debasing the severest critic upon homer in modern times m la motte admits all that his admirers urge for the superiority of his genius and talents as a poet cetoit un genie naturellement poetique ami des fables and des merveilleux et port en general a limitation soit des objets de la nature oit des sentimens et des actions des hommes il avoit lesprit vaste et fecond plus eleve que delicat plus naturel quingenieux et plus amoureux de labondance que du choix  il a saisi par une superiorite de gout les premieres idees de leloquence dans toutes les genres il a parle la langage des toutes les passions et il a du moins ouvert aux ecrivains qui doivent le suivre une infinite de routes quil ne restoit plus qu aapplanir il y a appearance que en quelques temps qu homere eut vecu il eut ete du moins le plus grand poet de son pais et a ne le prendre que dans ce sens on peut dire quil est le maitre de ceux memes qui lont surpass  discourse sur homere oeuvres de la motte tome  de after these high praises of the author he indeed endeavors to bring the merit of the iliad very low but his principal objections turn on the debasing ideas which are there given of the gods the gross characters and manners of the heroes and the imperfect morality of the sentiments which as voltaire observes is like accusing a painter for having drawn his figures in the dress of the times homer painted his gods such as popular tradition then represented them and described such characters and sentiments as he found among those with whom he lived   my observations hitherto have been made upon the iliad only it is necessary to take some notice of the odyssey also longinuss criticism upon it is not without foundation that homer may in this poem be compared to the setting sun whose grandeur still remains without the heat of his meridian beams it wants the vigor and fublimity of the iliad yet at the same time possesses so many beauties as to be justly entitled to high praise it is a very amusing poem and has much greater variety than the iliad it contains many interesting stories and beautiful descriptions we see every where the same descriptive and dramatic genius and the same fertility of invention that appears in the other work it descends indeed from the dignity of gods and heroes and warlike achievements but in recompense we have more pleasing pictures of ancient manners instead of that ferocity which reigns in the iliad the odyssey presents us with the most amiable images of hospitality and humanity entertains us with many a wonderful adventure and many a landscape of nature and instructs us by a constant vein of morality and virtue which runs through the poem  at the same time there are some defects which must be acknowledged in the odyssey many scenes in it fall below the majesty which we naturally expect in an epic poem the last twelve books after ulysses is landed in ithaca are in several parts tedious and languid and though the discovery which ulysses makes of himself to his nurse euryclea and his interview with penelope before she knows him in the nineteenth book are tender and affecting yet the poet does not seem happy in the great anagnorisis or the discovery of ulysses to penelope she is too cautious and distrustful and we are disappointed of the surprise of joy which we expected on that high occasion  after having said so much of the father of epic poetry it is now time to proceed to virgil who has a very marked character quite distinct from that of homer as the distinguishing excellencies of the iliad are simplicity and fire those of the aeneid are elegance and tenderness virgil is beyond doubt less animated and less sublime than homer but to counterbalance this he has fewer negligencies greater variety and supports more of a correct and regular dignity throughout his work  when we begin to read the iliad we find ourselves in the region of the most remote and even unrefined antiquity when we open the aeneid we discover all the correctness and the improvements of the augustan age we meet with no contentions of heroes about a female slave no violent scolding nor abusive language but the poem opens with the utmost magnificence with juno forming designs for preventing aeneass establishment in italy and aeneas himself presented to us with all his fleet in the middle of a storm which is described in the highest style of poetry  the subject of the aeneid is extremely happy still more so in my opinion than either of homers poems as nothing could be more noble nor carry more of epic dignity so nothing could be more flattering and interesting to the roman people than virgils deriving the origin of their state from so famous a hero as aeneas the object was splendid in itself it gave the poet a theme taken from the ancient traditionary history of his own country it allowed him to connect his subject with homers stories and to adopt all his mythology it afforded him the opportunity of frequently glancing at all the future great exploits of the romans and of describing italy and the very territory of rome in its ancient and fabulous state the establishment of aeneas constantly traversed by juno leads to a great diversity of events of voyages and wars and furnishes a proper intermixture of the incidents of peace with martial exploits upon the whole i believe there is no where to be found so complete a model of an epic fable or story as virgils aeneid i see no foundation for the opinion entertained by some critics that the aeneid is to be considered as an allegorical poem which carries a constant reference to the character and reign of augustus caesar or that virgils main design in composing the aeneid was to reconcile the romans to the government of that prince who is supposed to be shadowed out under the character of aeneas virgil indeed like the other poets of that age takes every opportunity which his subject affords him of paying court to augustus as particularly in that noted passage of the  th book l     hic vir hic est tibi quem promitti saepius audis etc   but to imagine that he carried a political plan in his view through the whole poem appears to me no more than a fanciful refinement he had sufficient motives as a poet to determine him to the choice of his subject from its being in itself both great and pleasing from its being suited to his genius and its being attended with the peculiar advantages which i mentioned above for the full display of poetical talents  unity of action is perfectly preserved as from beginning to end one main object is always kept in view the settlement of aeneas in italy by order of the gods as the story comprehends the transactions of several years part of the transactions are very properly thrown into a recital made by the hero the episodes are linked with sufficient connection to the main subject and the nodus or intrigue of the poem is according to the plan of ancient machinery happily formed the wrath of juno who opposes herself to the trojan settlement in italy gives rise to all the difficulties which obstruct aeneass undertaking and connects the human with the celestial operations throughout the whole work hence arise the tempest which throws aeneas upon the shore of africa the passion of dido who endeavors to detain him at carthage and the efforts of turnus who opposes him in war till at last upon a composition made with jupiter that the trojan name shall be for ever sunk in the latin juno foregoes her resentment and the hero becomes victorious  in these main points virgil has conducted his work with great propriety and shown his art and judgment but the admiration due to so eminent a poet must not prevent us from remarking some other particulars in which he has failed first there are almost no characters at all marked in the aeneid in this respect it is insipid when compared to the iliad which is full of characters and life achates and cloanthes and gyas and the rest of the trojan heroes who accompanied aeneas into italy are so many undistinguished figures who are in no way made known to us either by any sentiments which they utter or any memorable exploits which they perform even aeneas himself is not a very interesting hero he is described indeed as pious and brave but his character is not marked with any of those strokes that touch the heart it is a sort of cold and tame character and throughout his behavior to dido in the fourth book especially in the speech which he makes after she suspected his intention of leaving her there appears a certain hardness and want of relenting which is far from rendering him amiable number fletu ingemuit nostro number lumina flexit number lacrymas victus dedit aut miseratus amantem est aen iv      didos own character is by much the best supported in the whole aeneid the warmth of her passions the keenness of her indignation and resentment and the violence of her whole character exhibit a figure greatly more animated than any other which virgil has drawn  besides this defect of character in the aeneid the distribution and management of the subject is in some respects exceptionable the aeneid it is true must be considered with the indulgence due to a work not thoroughly completed the six last books are said not to have received the finishing hand of the author and for this reason he ordered by his will the aeneid to be committed to the flames but though this may account for incorrectness of execution it does not apologize for a falling off in the subject which seems to take place in the latter part of the work the wars with the latins are inferior in point of dignity to the more interesting objects which had before been presented to us in the destruction of troy the intrigue with dido and the descent into hell and into those italian wars there is perhaps a more material fault still in the conduct of the story the reader as voltaire has observed is tempted to take part with turnus against aeneas turnus a brave young prince in love with lavinia his near relation is destined for her by general consent and highly favored by her mother lavinia herself discovers no reluctance to the match when there arrives a stranger a fugitive from a distant region who had never seen her and who founding a claim to an establishment in italy upon oracles and prophecies embroils the country in war kills the lover of lavinia and proves the occasion of her mothers death such a plan is not fortunately laid for disposing us to be favorable to the hero of the poem and the defect might have been easily remedied by the poets making aeneas instead of distressing lavinia deliver her from the persecution of some rival who was odious to her and to the whole country  but notwithstanding those defects which it was necessary to remark virgil possesses beauties which have justly drawn the admiration of ages and which to this day hold the balance in equilibrium between his fame and that of homer the principal and distinguishing excellency of virgil and which in my opinion he possesses beyond all poets is tenderness nature had endowed him with exquisite sensibility he felt every affecting circumstance in the scenes he describes and by a single stroke he knows how to reach the heart this in an epic poem is the merit next to sublimity and puts it in an authors power to render his composition extremely interesting to all readers  the chief beauty of this kind in the iliad is the interview of hector with andromache but in the aeneid there are many such the second book is one of the greatest masterpieces that ever was executed by any hand and virgil seems to have put forth there the whole strength of his genius as the subject afforded a variety of scenes both of the awful and tender kind the images of horror presented by a city burned and sacked in the night are finely mixed with pathetic and affecting incidents nothing in any poet is more beautifully described than the death of old priam and the familypieces of aeneas anchises and creusa are as tender as can be conceived in many passages of the aeneid the same pathetic spirit shines and they have been always the favorite passages in that work the fourth book for instance relating the unhappy passion and death of dido has been always most justly admired and abounds with beauties of the highest kind the interview of aeneas with andromache and helenus in the third book the episodes of pallas and evander of nisus and euryalus of lausus and mezentius in the italian wars are all striking instances of the poets power of raising the tender emotions for we must observe that though the aeneid be an unequal poem and in some places languid yet there are beauties scattered through it all and not a few even in the last six books the best and most finished books upon the whole are the first the second the fourth the sixth the seventh the eighth and the twelfth  virgils battles are far inferior to homers in point of fire and sublimity but there is one important episode the descent into hell in which he has outdone homer in the odyssey by many degrees there is nothing in all antiquity equal in its kind to the sixth book of the aeneid the scenery and the objects are great and striking and fill the mind with that solemn awe which was to be expected from a view of the invisible world there runs through the whole description a certain philosophical sublime which virgils platonic genius and the enlarged ideas of the augustan age enabled him to support with a degree of majesty far beyond what the rude ideas of homers age suffered him to attain with regard to the sweetness and beauty of virgils numbers throughout his whole works they are so well known that it were needless to enlarge in the praise of them  upon the whole as to the comparative merit of these two great princes of epic poetry homer and virgil the former must undoubtedly be admitted to be the greater genius the latter to be the more correct writer homer was an original in his art and discovers both the beauties and the defects which are to be expected in an original author compared with those who succeed him more boldness more nature and ease more sublimity and force but greater irregularities and negligencies in composition virgil has all along kept his eye upon homer in many places he has not so much imitated as he has literally translated him the description of the storm for instance in the first aeneid and aeneass speech upon that occasion are translations from the fifth book of the odyssey not to mention almost all the similies of virgil which are no other than copies of those of homer the preeminence in invention therefore must beyond doubt be ascribed to homer as to the preeminence in judgment though many critics incline to give it to virgil yet in my opinion it hangs doubtful in homer we discern all the greek vivacity in virgil all the roman stateliness homers imagination is by much the most rich and copious virgils the most chaste and correct the strength of the former lies in his power of warming the fancy that of the latter in his power of touching the heart homers style more simple and animated virgils more elegant and uniform the first has on many occasions a sublimity to which the latter never attains but the latter in return never sinks below a certain degree of epic dignity which cannot so clearly be pronounced of the former not however to detract from the admiration due to both these great poets most of homers defects may reasonably be imputed not to his genius but to the manners of the age in which he lived and for the feeble passages of the aeneid this excuse ought to be admitted that the aeneid was left an unfinished work  lecture xliv lucans pharsalia  tassos jerusalem  camoens lusiad  fenelons telemachus  voltaires henriade  miltons paradise lost after homer and virgil the next great epic poet of ancient times who presents himself is lucan he is a poet who deserves our attention on account of a very peculiar mixture of great beauties with great faults though his pharsalia discover too little invention and be conducted in too historical a manner to be accounted a perfectly regular epic poem yet it were the mere squeamishness of criticism to exclude it from the epic class the boundaries as i formerly remarked are far from being ascertained by any such precise limit that we must refuse the epic name to a poem which treats of great and heroic adventures because it is not exactly conformable to the plans of homer and virgil the subject of the pharsalia carries undoubtedly all the epic grandeur and dignity neither does it want unity of object viz the triumph of caesar over the roman liberty as it stands at present it is indeed brought to no proper close but either time has deprived us of the last books or it has been left by the author an incomplete work  though lucans subject be abundantly heroic yet i cannot reckon him happy in the choice of it it has two defects the one is that civil wars especially when as fierce and cruel as those of the romans present too many shocking objects to be fit for epic poetry and give odious and disgusting views of human nature gallant and honorable achievements furnish a more proper theme for the epic muse but lucans genius it must be confessed seems to delight in savage scenes he dwells upon them too much and not content with those which his subject naturally furnished he goes out of his way to introduce a long episode of marius and syllas proscriptions which abounds with all the forms of atrocious cruelty  the other defect of lucans subject is its being too near the times in which he lived this is a circumstance as i observed in a former lecture always unlucky for a poet as it deprives him of the assistance of fiction and machinery and thereby renders his work less splendid and amusing lucan has submitted to this disadvantage of his subject and in doing so has acted with more propriety than if he had made an unseasonable attempt to embellish it with machinery for the fables of the gods would have made a very unnatural mixture with the exploits of caesar and pompey and instead of raising would have diminished the dignity of such recent and wellknown facts  with regard to characters lucan draws them with spirit and with force but though pompey be his professed hero he does not succeed in interesting us much in his favor pompey is not made to possess any high distinction either for magnanimity in sentiment or bravery in action but on the contrary is always eclipsed by the superior abilities of caesar cato is in truth lucans favorite character and wherever he introduces him he appears to rise above himself some of the noblest and most conspicuous passages in the work are such as relate to cato either speeches put into his mouth or descriptions of his behavior his speech in particular to labienus who urged him to enquire at the oracle of jupiter ammon concerning the issue of the war book ix     deserves to be remarked as equal for moral sublimity to any thing that is to be found in all antiquity  in the conduct of the story our author has attached himself too much to chronological order this renders the thread of his narration broken and interrupted and makes him hurry us too often from place to place he is too digressive also frequently turning aside from his subject to give us sometimes geographical descriptions of a country sometimes philosophical disquisitions concerning natural objects as concerning the african serpents in the ninth book and the sources of the nile in the tenth  there are in the pharsalia several very poetical and spirited descriptions but the authors chief strength does not lie either in narration or description his narration is often dry and harsh his descriptions are often overwrought and employed too upon disagreeable objects his principal merit consists in his sentiments which are generally noble and striking and expressed in that glowing and ardent manner which peculiarly distinguishes him lucan is the most philosophical and the most publicspirited poet of all antiquity he was the nephew of the famous seneca the philosopher was himself a stoic and the spirit of that philosophy breathes throughout his poem we must observe too that he is the only ancient epic poet whom the subject of his poem really and deeply interested lucan recounted no fiction he was a roman and had felt all the direful effects of the roman civil wars and of that severe despotism which succeeded the loss of liberty his high and bold spirit made him enter deeply into this subject and kindle on many occasions into the most real warmth hence he abounds in exclamations and apostrophes which are almost always welltimed and supported with a vivacity and fire that do him no small honor  but it is the fate of this poet that his beauties can never be mentioned without their suggesting his blemishes also as his principal excellency is a lively and glowing genius which appears sometimes in his descriptions and very often in his sentiments his great defect in both is want of moderation he carries every thing to an extreme he knows not where to stop from an effort to aggrandise his objects he becomes tumid and unnatural and it frequently happens that where the second line of one of his descriptions is sublime the third in which he meant to rise still higher is perfectly bombast lucan lived in an age when the schools of the declaimers had begun to corrupt the eloquence and taste of rome he was not free from the infection and too often instead of showing the genius of the poet betrays the spirit of the declaimer  on the whole however he is an author of lively and original genius his sentiments are so high and his fire on occasions so great as to atone for many of his defects and passages can be produced from him which are inferior to none in any poet whatever the characters for instance which he draws of pompey and caesar in the first book are masterly and the comparison of pompey to the aged decaying oak is highly poetical  totus popularibus auris impelli plausuque sui gaudere theatri nec reparare novas vires multumque priori credere fortunae stat magni nominis umbra qualis frugifero quercus sublimis in agro exuvias veteres populi sacrataque gestans dona ducum nec jam validis radicibus haerens pondere fixa suo est nudosque per era ramos effundens trunco non frondibus efficit umbram at quamvis primo nutet casura sub euro et circum silvae firmo se robore tollant sola tamen colitur sed non in caesare tantum nomen erat nec fama ducis sed nescia virtus stare loco solusque pudor non vincere bello acer et indomitus with gifts and liberal bounty sought for fame and loved to hear the vulgar shoot his name in his own theater rejoiced to sit amidst the noisy praises of the pit careless of future ills that might betide no aid he sought to prop his falling side but on his former fortune much relied still seemed he to possess and fill his place but stood the shadow of what once he was so in the field with ceres bounty spread uprears some ancient oak his reverend head chaplets and sacred gifts his boughs adorn and spoils of war by mighty heroes worn but the first vigor of his root now gone he stands dependant on his weight alone all bare his naked branches are displayed and with his leafless trunk he forms a shade yet though the winds his ruin daily threat as every blast would heave him from his seat though thousand fairer trees the field supplies that rich in youthful verdure round him rise fixed in his ancient seat he yields to none and wears the honors of the grove alone but caesars greatness and his strength was more than past renown and antiquated power twas not the fame of what he once had been or tales in old records or annals seen but twas a valor restless unconfined which no success could sat nor limits bind twas shame a soldiers shame untaught to yield that blushed for nothing but an illfought field row   l i      but when we consider the whole execution of his poem we are obliged to pronounce that his poetical fire was not under the government of either sound judgment or correct taste his genius had strength but not tenderness nothing of what may be called amoenity or sweetness in his style there is abundance of force but a mixture of harshness and frequently of obscurity occasioned by his desire of expressing himself in a pointed and unusual manner compared with virgil he may be allowed to have more fine and higher sentiments but in every thing else falls infinitely below him particularly in purity elegance and tenderness  as statius and silius italicus though they be poets of the epic class are too inconsiderable for particular criticism i proceed next to tasso the most distinguished epic poet in modern ages  his jerusalem delivered was published in the year      it is a poem regularly and strictly epic in its whole construction and adorned with all the beauties that belong to that species of composition the subject is the recovery of jerusalem from the infidels by the united powers of christendom which in itself and more especially according to the ideas of tassos age was a splendid venerable and heroic enterprise the opposition of the christians to the saracens forms an interesting contrast the subject produces none of those fierce and shocking scenes of civil discord which hurt the mind in lucan but exhibits the efforts of zeal and bravery inspired by an honorable object the share which religion possesses in the enterprise both tends to render it more august and opens a natural field for machinery and sublime description the action too lies in a country and at a period of time sufficiently remote to allow an intermixture of fabulous tradition and fiction with true history  in the conduct of the story tasso has shown a rich and fertile invention which in a poet is a capital quality he is full of events and those too abundantly various and diversified in their kind he never allows us to be tired by mere war and fighting he frequently shifts the scene and from camps and battles transports us to more pleasing objects sometimes the solemnities of religion sometimes the intrigues of love at other times the adventures of a journey or even the incidents of pastoral life relieve and entertain the reader at the same time the whole work is artfully connected and while there is much variety in the parts there is perfect unity in the plan the recovery of jerusalem is the object kept in view through the whole and with it the poem closes all the episodes if we except that of olindo and sophronia in the second book on which i formerly passed a censure are sufficiently related to the main subject of the poem  the poem is enlivened with a variety of characters and those too both clearly marked and well supported godfrey the leader of the enterprise prudent moderate brave tancred amorous generous and gallant and well contrasted with the fierce and brutal argantes rinaldo who is properly the hero of the poem and is in part copied after homers achilles passionate and resentful seduced by the allurements of armida but a personage on the whole of much zeal honor and heroism the brave and highminded solomon the tender erminia the artful and violent armida the masculine clorinda are all of them well drawn and animated figures in the characteristical part tasso is indeed remarkably distinguished he is in this respect superior to virgil and yields to no poet except to homer  he abounds very much with machinery and in this part of the work his merit is more dubious wherever caelestial beings are made to interpose his machinery is noble god looking down upon the hosts and on different occasions sending an angel to check the pagans and to rebuke the evil spirits produces a sublime effect the description of hell too with the appearance and speech of satan in the beginning of the  th book is extremely striking and plainly has been imitated by milton though he must be allowed to have improved upon it but the devils the enchanters and the conjurers act too great a part throughout tassos poem and form a sort of dark and gloomy machinery not pleasing to the imagination the enchanted wood on which the nodus or intrigue of the poem is made in a great measure to depend the messengers sent in quest of rinaldo in order that he may break the charm their being conducted by a hermit to a cave in the center of the earth the wonderful voyage which they make to the fortunate islands and their recovering rinaldo from the charms of armida and voluptuousness are scenes which though very amusing and described with the highest beauty of poetry yet must be confessed to carry the mavelous to a degree of extravagance  in general that for which tasso is most liable to censure is a certain romantic vein which runs through many of the adventures and incidents of his poem the objects which he presents to us are always great but sometimes too remote from probability he retains somewhat of the taste of his age which was not reclaimed from an extra vagant admiration of the stories of knight errantry stories which the wild but rich and agreeable imagination of ariosto had raised into fresh reputation in apology however for tasso it may be said that he is not more mavelous and romantic than either homer or virgil all the difference is that in the one we find the romance of paganism in the other that of chivalry  with all the beauties of description and of poetical style tasso remarkably abounds both his descriptions and his style are much diversified and well suited to each other in describing magnificent objects his style is firm and majestic when he descends to gay and pleasing ones such as erminias pastoral retreat in the seventh book and the arts and beauty of armida in the fourth book it is soft and insinuating both those descriptions which i have mentioned are exquisite in their kind his battles are animated and very properly varied in the incidents inferior however to homers in point of spirit and fire  in his sentiments tasso is not so happy as in his descriptions it is indeed rather by actions characters and descriptions that he interests us than by the sentimental part of the work he is far inferior to virgil in tenderness when he aims at being pathetic and sentimental in his speeches he is apt to become artificial and strained  with regard to points and conceits with which he has often been reproached the censure has been carried too far affectation is by no means the general character of tassos manner which upon the whole is masculine strong and correct on some occasions indeed especially as i just now observed when he seeks to be tender he degenerates into forced and unnatural ideas but these are far from being so frequent or common as has been supposed threescore or fourscore lines retrenched from the poem would fully clear it i am persuaded of all such exceptionable passages  with boileau dacier and the other french critics of the last age the humor prevailed of decrying tasso and passed from them to some of the english writers but one would be apt to imagine they were not much acquainted with tasso or at least they must have read him under the influence of strong prejudices for to me it appears clear that the jerusalem is in rank and dignity the third regular epic poem in the world and comes next to the iliad and aeneid tasso may be justly held inferior to homer in simplicity and in fire to virgil in tenderness to milton in daring sublimity of genius but to no other he yields in any poetical talents and for fertility of invention variety of incidents expression of characters richness of description and beauty of style i know no poet except the three just named that can be compared to him  ariosto the great rival of tasso in italian poetry cannot with any propriety be classed among the epic writers the fundamental rule of epic composition is to recount a heroic enterprise and to form it into a regular story though there is a sort of unity and connection in the plan of orlando furioso yet instead of rendering this apparent to the reader it seems to have been the authors intention to keep it out of view by the desultory manner in which the poem is carried on and the perpetual interruptions of the several stories before they are finished ariosto appears to have despised all regularity of plan and to have chosen to give loose reins to a copious and rich but extravagant fancy at the same time there is so much epic matter in the orlando furioso that it would be improper to pass it by without some notice it unites indeed all sorts of poetry sometimes comic and satiric sometimes light and licentious at other times highly heroic descriptive and tender whatever strain the poet assumes he excels in it he is always master of his subject seems to play himself with it and leaves us sometimes at a loss to know whether he be serious or in jest he is seldom dramatic sometimes but not often sentimental but in narration and description perhaps no poet ever went beyond him he makes every scene which he describes and every event which he relates pass before our eyes and in his selection of circumstances is eminently picturesque his style is much varied always suited to the subject and adorned with a remarkably smooth and melodious versification  as the italians make their boast of tasso so do the portuguese of camoens who was nearly cotemporary with tasso but whose poem was published before the jerusalem the subject of it is the first discovery of the east indies by vasco de gama an enterprise splendid in its nature and extremely interesting to the countrymen of camoens as it laid the foundation of their future wealth and consideration in europe the poem opens with vasco and his fleet appearing on the ocean between the island madagascar and the coast of aethiopia after various attempts to land on that coast they are at last hospitably received in the kingdom of melinda vasco at the desire of the king gives him an account of europe recites a poetical history of portugal and relates all the adventures of the voyage which had preceded the opening of the poem this recital takes up three cantos or books it is well imagined contains a great many poetical beauties and has no defect except that vasco makes an unseasonable display of learning to the african prince in frequent allusions to the greek and roman histories vasco and his countrymen afterward set forth to pursue their voyage the storms and distresses which they encounter their arrival at calecut on the malabar coast their reception and adventures in that country and at last their return homewards fill up the rest of the poem  the whole work is conducted according to the epic plan both the subject and the incidents are magnificent and joined with some wildness and irregularity there appears in the execution much poetic spirit strong fancy and bold description as far as i can judge from translations without any knowledge of the original there is no attempt toward painting characters in the poem vasco is the hero and the only personage indeed that makes any figure  the machinery of the lusiad is perfectly extravagant not only is it formed of a singular mixture of christian ideas and pagan mythology but it is so conducted that the pagan gods appear to be the true deities and christ and the blessed virgin to be subordinate agents one great scope of the portuguese expedition our author informs us is to propagate the christian faith and to extirpate mahometanism in this religious undertaking the great protector of the portuguese is venus and their great adversary is bacchus whose displeasure is excited by vascos attempting to rival his fame in the indies councils of the gods are held in which jupiter is introduced as foretelling the downfall of mahometanism and the propagation of the gospel vasco in great distress from a strom prays most seriously to god implores the aid of christ and the virgin and begs for such assistance as was given to the israelites when they were passing through the red sea and to the apostle paul when he was in hazard of shipwreck in return to this prayer venus appears who discerning the storm to be the work of bacchus complains to jupiter and procures the winds to be calmed such strange and preposterous machinery shows how much authors have been misled by the absurd opinion that there could be no epic poetry without the gods of homer toward the end of the work indeed the author gives us an awkward salvo for his whole mythology making the goddess thetis inform vasco that she and the rest of the heathen deities are no more than names to describe the operations of providence  there is however some fine machinery of a different kind in the lusiad the genius of the river ganges appearing to emanuel king of portugal in a dream inviting that prince to discover his secret springs and acquainting him that he was the destined monarch for whom the treasures of the east were reserved is a happy idea but the noblest conception of this sort is in the fifth canto where vasco is recounting to the king of melinda all the wonders which he met with in his navigation he tells him that when the fleet arrived at the cape of good hope which never before had been doubled by any navigator there appeared to them on a sudden a huge and monstrous fantom rising out of the sea in the midst of tempests and thunders with a head that reached the clouds and a countenance that filled them with terror this was the genius or guardian of that hitherto unknown ocean it spoke to them with a voice like thunder menaced them for invading those seas which he had so long possessed undisturbed and for daring to explore those secrets of the deep which never had been revealed to the eye of mortals required them to proceed no farther if they should proceed foretold all the successive calamities that were to befall them and then with a mighty noise disappeared this is one of the most solemn and striking pieces of machinery that ever was employed and is sufficient to show that camoens is a poet though of an irregular yet of a bold and lofty imagination i have made no mention of the araucana an epic poem in spanish composed by alonzo dercilla because i am unacquainted with the original language and have not seen any translation of it a full account of it is given by mr hayley in the notes upon his essay on epic poetry   in reviewing the epic poets it were unjust to make no mention of the amiable author of the adventures of telemachus his work though not composed in verse is justly entitled to be held a poem the measured poetical prose in which it was written is remarkably harmonious and gives the style nearly as much elevation as the french language is capable of supporting even in regular verse  the plan of the work is in general well contrived and is deficient neither in epic grandeur nor unity of object the author has entered with much felicity into the spirit and ideas of the ancient poets particularly into the ancient mythology which retains more dignity and makes a better figure in his hands than in those of any other modern poet his descriptions are rich and beautiful especially of the softer and calmer scenes for which the genius of fenelon was best suited such as the incidents of pastoral life the pleasures of virtue or a country flourishing in peace there is an inimitable sweetness and tenderness in several of the pictures of this kind which he has given  the best executed part of the work is the first six books in which telemachus recounts his adventures to calypso the narration throughout them is lively and interesting afterward especially in the last twelve books it becomes more tedious and languid and in the warlike adventures which are attempted there is a great defect of vigor the chief objection against this work being classed with epic poems arises from the minute detail of virtuous policy into which the author in some places enters and from the discourses and instructions of mentor which recur upon us too often and too much in the strain of commonplace morality though these were well suited to the main design of the author which was to form the mind of a young prince yet they seem not congruous to the nature of epic poetry the object of which is to improve us by means of actions characters and sentiments rather than by delivering professed and formal instruction  several of the epic poets have described a descent into hell and in the prospects they have given us of the invisible world we may observe the gradual refinement of mens notions concerning a state of future rewards and punishments the descent of ulysses into hell in homers odyssey presents to us a very indistinct and dreary sort of object the scene is laid in the country of the cimmerians which is always covered with clouds and darkness at the extremity of the ocean when the spirits of the dead begin to appear we scarcely know whether ulysses is above ground or below it none of the ghosts even of the heroes appear satisfied with their condition in the other world and when ulysses endeavors to comfort achilles by reminding him of the illustrious figure which he must make in those regions achilles roundly tells him that all such speeches are idle for he would rather be a daylabourer on earth than have the command of all the dead  in the sixth book of the aeneid we discern a much greater refinement of ideas corresponding to the progress which the world had then made in philosophy the objects there delineated are both more clear and distinct and more grand and awful the separate mansions of good and of bad spirits with the punishments of the one and the employments and happiness of the other are finely described and in consistency with the most pure morality but the visit which fenelon makes telemachus pay to the shades is much more philosophical still than virgils he employs the same fables and the same mythology but we find the ancient mythology refined by the knowledge of the true religion and adorned with that beautiful enthusiasm for which fenelon was so distinguished his account of the happiness of the just is an excellent description in the mystic strain and very expressive of the genius and spirit of the author  voltaire has given us in his henriade a regular epic poem in french verse in every performance of that celebrated writer we may expect to find marks of genius and accordingly that work discovers in several places that boldness in the conceptions and that liveliness and felicity in the expression for which the author is so remarkably distinguished several of the comparisons in particular which occur in it are both new and happy but considered upon the whole i cannot esteem it one of his chief productions and am of opinion that he has succeeded infinitely better in tragic than in epic composition french versification seems ill adapted to epic poetry besides it being always fettered by rhyme the language never assumes a sufficient degree of elevation or majesty and appears to be more capable of expressing the tender in tragedy than of supporting the sublime in epic hence a feebleness and sometimes a prosaic flatness in the style of the henriade and whether from this or from some other cause the poem often languishes it does not seize the imagination nor interest and carry the reader along with that ardour which ought to be inspired by a sublime and spirited epic poem  the subject of the henriade is the triumph of henry the fourth over the arms of the league the action of the poem properly includes only the siege of paris it is in action perfectly epic in its nature great interesting and conducted with a sufficient regard to unity and all the other critical rules but it is liable to both the defects which i before remarked in lucans pharsalia it is founded wholly on civil wars and presents to us those odious and detestable objects of massacres and assassinations which throw a gloom over the poem it is also like lucans of too recent a date and comes too much within the bounds of well known history to remedy this last defect and to remove the appearance of being a mere historian voltaire has chosen to mix fiction with truth the poem for instance opens with a voyage of henrys to england and an interview between him and queen elizabeth though every one knows that henry never was in england and that these two illustrious personages never met in facts of such public notoriety a fiction like this shocks the reader and forms an unnatural and illsorted mixture with historical truth the episode was contrived in order to give henry an opportunity of recounting the former transactions of the civil wars in imitation of the recital which aeneas makes to dido in the aeneid but the imitation was injudicious aeneas might with propriety relate to dido transactions of which she was either entirely ignorant or had acquired only an imperfect knowledge by flying reports but queen elizabeth could not but be supposed to be perfectly apprised of all the facts which the poet makes henry recite to her  in order to embellish his subject voltaire has chosen to employ a great deal of machinery but here also i am obliged to censure his conduct for the machinery which he chiefly employs is of the worst kind and the least suited to an epic poem that of allegorical beings discord cunning and love appear as personages mix with the human actors and make a considerable figure in the intrigue of the poem this is contrary to every rule of rational criticism ghosts angels and devils have popular belief on their side and can be conceived as existing but every one knows that allegorical beings are no more than representations of human dispositions and passions they may be employed like other personifications and figures of speech or in a poem that is wholly allegorical they may occupy the chief place they are there in their native and proper region but in a poem which relates to human transactions as i had occasion before to remark when such beings are described as acting along with men the imagination is confounded it is divided between phantasms and realities and knows not on what to rest  in justice however to our author i must observe that the machinery of st louis which he also employs is of a better kind and possesses real dignity the finest passage in the henriade indeed one of the finest that occurs in any poem is the prospect of the invisible world which st louis gives to henry in a dream in the seventh canto death bringing the souls of the departed in succession before god their astonishment when arriving from all different countries and religious sects they are brought into the divine presence when they find their superstitions to be false and have the truth unveiled to them the palace of the destinies opened to henry and the prospect of his successors which is there given him are striking and magnificent objects and do honor to the genius of voltaire  though some of the episodes in this poem are properly extended yet the narration is on the whole too general the events are too much crowded and superficially related which is doubtless one cause of the poem making a faint impression the strain of sentiment which runs through it is high and noble religion appears on every occasion with great and proper luster and the author breathes that spirit of humanity and toleration which is conspicuous in all his works  milton of whom it remains now to speak has chalked out for himself a new and very extraordinary road in poetry as soon as we open his paradise lost we find ourselves introduced all at once into an invisible world and surrounded with celestial and infernal beings angels and devils are not the machinery but principal actors in the poem and what in any other composition would be the mavelous is here only the natural course of events a subject so remote from the affairs of this world may furnish ground to those who think such discussions material to bring it into doubt whether paradise lost can properly be classed among epic poems by whatever name it is to be called it is undoubtedly one of the highest efforts of poetical genius and in one great characteristic of the epic poem majesty and sublimity it is fully equal to any that bear that name  how far the author was altogether happy in the choice of his subject may be questioned it has led him into very difficult ground had he taken a subject that was more human and less theological that was more connected with the occurrences of life and afforded a greater display of the characters and passions of men his poem would perhaps have to the bulk of readers been more pleasing and attractive but the subject which he has chosen suited the daring sublimity of his genius he seems to have been well acquainted with his own genius and to know what it was that nature had bestowed upon him more bountifully than upon others the power of displaying the vast illuminating the splendid enforcing the awful darkening the gloomy and aggravating the dreadful he therefore chose a subject on which too much could not be said on which he might tire his fancy without the censure of extravagance dr johnsons life of milton  it is a subject for which milton alone was fitted and in the conduct of it he has shown a stretch both of imagination and invention which is perfectly wonderful it is astonishing how from the few hints given us in the sacred scriptures he was able to raise so complete and regular a structure and to fill his poem with such a variety of incidents dry and harsh passages sometimes occur the author appears upon some occasions a metaphysician and a divine rather than a poet but the general tenor of his work is interesting he seizes and fixes the imagination engages elevates and affects us as we proceed which is always a sure test of merit in an epic composition the artful change of his objects the scene laid now in earth now in hell and now in heaven affords a sufficient diversity while unity of plan is at the same time perfectly supported we have still life and calm scenes in the employments of adam and eve in paradise and we have busy scenes and great actions in the enterprise of satan and the wars of the angels the innocence purity and amiableness of our first parents opposed to the pride and ambition of satan furnishes a happy contrast that reigns throughout the whole poem only the conclusion as i before observed is too tragic for epic poetry  the nature of the subject did not admit any great display of characters but such as could be introduced are supported with much propriety satan in particular makes a striking figure and is indeed the best drawn character in the poem milton has not described him such as we suppose an infernal spirit to be he has more suitably to his own purpose given him a human that is a mixed character not altogether void of some good qualities he is brave and faithful to his troops in the midst of his impiety he is not without remorse he is even touched with pity for our first parents and justifies himself in his design against them from the necessity of his situation he is actuated by ambition and resentment rather than by pure malice in short miltons satan is no worse than many a conspirator or factious chief that makes a figure in history the different characters of beelzebub moloch belial are exceedingly well painted in those eloquent speeches which they make in the second book the good angels though always described with dignity and propriety have more uniformity than the infernal spirits in their appearance though among them too the mild condescension of raphael and the tried fidelity of abdiel form proper characteristical distinctions the attempt to describe god almighty himself and to recount dialogues between the father and the son was too bold and arduous and is that wherein our poet as was to have been expected has been most unsuccessful with regard to his human characters the innocence of our first parents and their love are finely and delicately painted in some of his speeches to raphael and to eve adam is perhaps too knowing and refined for his situation eve is more distinctly characterised her gentleness modesty and frailty mark very expressively a female character  miltons great and distinguishing excellence is his sublimity in this perhaps he excels homer as there is no doubt of his leaving virgil and every other poet far behind him almost the whole of the first and second books of paradise lost are continued instances of the highest sublime the prospect of hell and of the fallen host the appearance and behavior of satan the consultation of the infernal chiefs and satans flight through chaos to the borders of this world discover the most lofty ideas that ever entered into the conception of any poet in the sixth book also there is much grandeur particularly in the appearance of the messiah though some parts of that book are censurable and the witticisms of the devils upon the effect of their artillery form an intolerable blemish miltons sublimity is of a different kind from that of homer homers is generally accompanied with fire and impetuosity miltons possesses more of a calm and amazing grandeur homer warms and hurries us along milton fixes us in a state of astonishment and elevation homers sublimity appears most in the description of actions miltons in that of wonderful and stupendous objects  but though milton is most distinguished for his sublimity yet there is also much of the beautiful the tender and the pleasing in many parts of his work when the scene is laid in paradise the imagery is always of the most gay and smiling kind his descriptions show an uncommonly fertile imagination and in his similies he is for the most part remarkably happy they are seldom improperly introduced seldom either low or trite they generally present to us images taken from the sublime or the beautiful class of objects if they have any faults it is their alluding too frequently to matters of learning and to fables of antiquity in the latter part of paradise lost there must be confessed to be a falling off with the fall of our first parents miltons genius seems to decline beauties however there are in the concluding books of the tragic kind the remorse and contrition of the guilty pair and their lamentations over paradise when they are obliged to leave it are very moving the last episode of the angels showing adam the fate of his posterity is happily imagined but in many places the execution is languid  miltons language and versification have high merit his style is full of majesty and wonderfully adapted to his subject his blank verse is harmonious and diversified and affords the most complete example of the elevation which our language is capable of attaining by the force of numbers it does not flow like the french verse in tame regular uniform melody which soon tires the ear but is sometimes smooth and flowing sometimes rough varied in its cadence and intermixed with discords so as to suit the strength and freedom of epic composition neglected and prosaic lines indeed we sometimes meet with but in a work so long and in the main so harmonious these may be forgiven  on the whole paradise lost is a poem that abounds with beauties of every kind and that justly entitles its author to a degree of fame not inferior to any poet though it must be also admitted to have many inequalities it is the lot of almost every high and daring genius not to be uniform and correct milton is too frequently theological and metaphysical sometimes harsh in his language often too technical in his words and affectedly ostentatious of his learning many of his faults must be attributed to the pedantry of the age in which he lived he discovers a vigor a grasp of genius equal to every thing that is great sometimes he rises above every poet at other times he falls much below himself  lecture xlv dramatic poetry  tragedy dramatic poetry has among all civilized nations been considered as a rational and useful entertainment and judged worthy of careful and serious discussion according as it is employed upon the light and the gay or upon the grave and affecting incidents of human life it divides itself into the two forms of comedy or tragedy but as great and serious objects command more attention than little and ludicrous ones as the fall of a hero interests the public more than the marriage of a private person tragedy has been always held a more dignified entertainment than comedy the one rests upon the high passions the virtues crimes and sufferings of mankind the other on their humors follies and pleasures terror and pity are the great instruments of the former ridicule is the sole instrument of the latter tragedy shall therefore be the object of our fullest discussion this and the following lecture shall be employed on it after which i shall treat of what is peculiar to comedy  tragedy considered as an exhibition of the characters and behavior of men in some of the most trying and critical situations of life is a noble idea of poetry it is a direct imitation of human manners and actions for it does not like the epic poem exhibit characters by the narration and description of the poet but the poet disappears and the personages themselves are set before us acting and speaking what is suitable to their characters hence no kind of writing is so great a trial of the authors profound knowledge of the human heart no kind of writing has so much power when happily executed to raise the strongest emotions it is or ought to be a mirror in which we behold ourselves and the evils to which we are exposed a faithful copy of the human passions with all their direful effects when they are suffered to become extravagant  as tragedy is a high and distinguished species of composition so also in its general strain and spirit it is favorable to virtue such power has virtue happily over the human mind by the wise and gracious constitution of our nature that as admiration cannot be raised in epic poetry so neither in tragic poetry can our passions be strongly moved unless virtuous emotions be awakened within us every poet finds that it is impossible to interest us in any character without representing that character as worthy and honorable though it may not be perfect and that the great great secret for raising indignation is to paint the person who is to be the object of it in the colors of vice and depravity he may indeed nay he must represent the virtuous as sometimes unfortunate because this is often the case in real life but he will always study to engage our hearts in their behalf and though they may be described as unprosperous yet there is no instance of a tragic poet representing vice as fully triumphant and happy in the catastrophe of the piece even when bad men succeed in their designs punishment is made always to attend them and misery of one kind or other is shown to be unavoidably connected with guilt love and admiration of virtuous characters compassion for the injured and the distressed and indignation against the authors of their sufferings are the sentiments most generally excited by tragedy and therefore though dramatic writers may sometimes like other writers be guilty of improprieties though they may fail of placing virtue precisely in the due point of light yet no reasonable person can refuse tragedy to be a moral species of composition taking tragedies complexly i am fully persuaded that the impressions left by them upon the mind are on the whole favorable to virtue and good dispositions and therefore the zeal which some pious men have shown against the entertainments of the theater must rest only upon the abuse of comedy which indeed has frequently been so great as to justify very severe censures against it  the account which aristotle gives of the design of tragedy is that it is intended to purge our passions by means of pity and terror this is somewhat obscure various senses have been put upon his words and much altercation has followed among his commentators without entering into any controversy upon this head the intention of tragedy may i think be more shortly and clearly defined to improve our virtuous sensibility if an author interests us in behalf of virtue forms us to compassion for the distressed inspires us with proper sentiments on beholding the vicissitudes of life and by means of the concern which he raises for the misfortunes of others leads us to guard against errors in our own conduct he accomplishes all the moral purposes of tragedy  in order to this end the first requisite is that he pitch upon some moving and interesting story and that he conduct it in a natural and probable manner for we must observe that the natural and the probable must always be the basis of tragedy and are infinitely more essential there than in epic poetry the object of the epic poet is to excite our admiration by the recital of heroic adventures and a much slighter degree of probability is required when admiration is concerned than when the tender passions are intended to be moved the imagination in the former case is exalted accommodates itself to the poets idea and can admit the mavelous without being shocked but tragedy demands a stricter imitation of the life and actions of men for the end which it pursues is not so much to elevate the imagination as to affect the heart and the heart always judges more nicely than the imagination of what is probable passion can be raised only by making the impressions of nature and of truth upon the mind by introducing therefore any wild or romantic circumstances into his story the poet never fails to check passion in its growth and of course disappoints the main effect of tragedy  this principle which is founded on the clearest reason excludes from tragedy all machinery or fabulous intervention of the gods ghosts have indeed maintained their place as being strongly founded on popular belief and peculiarly suited to heighten the terror of tragic scenes but all unravellings of the plot which turn upon the interposition of deities such as euripides employs in several of his plays are much to be condemned both as clumsy and inartificial and as destroying the probability of the story this mixture of machinery with the tragic action is undoubtedly a blemish in the ancient theater  in order to promote that impression of probability which is so necessary to the success of tragedy some critics have required that the subject should never be a pure fiction invented by the poet but built on real history or known facts such indeed were generally if not always the subjects of the greek tragedians but i cannot hold this to be a matter of any great consequence it is proved by experience that a fictitious tale if properly conducted will melt the heart as much as any real history in order to our being moved it is necessary that the events related did actually happen provided they be such as might easily have happened in the ordinary course of nature even when tragedy borrows its materials from history it mixes many a fictitious circumstance the greatest part of readers neither know nor enquire what is fabulous or what is historical in the subject they attend only to what is probable and are touched by events which resemble nature accordingly some of the most pathetic tragedies are entirely fictitious in the subject such as voltaires zaire and alzire the orphan douglas the fair penitent and several others  whether the subject be of the real or feigned kind that on which most depends for rendering the incidents in a tragedy probable and by means of their probability affecting is the conduct or management of the story and the connection of its several parts to regulate this conduct critics have laid down the famous rule of the three unities the importance of which it will be necessary to discuss but in order to do this with more advantage it will be necessary that we first look backwards and trace the rise and origin of tragedy which will give light to several things relating to the subject  tragedy like other arts was in its beginnings rude and imperfect among the greeks from whom our dramatic entertainments are derived the origin of tragedy was no other than the song which was wont to be sung at the festival of bacchus a goat was the sacrifice offered to that god after the sacrifice the priests with the company that joined them sung hymns in honor of bacchus and from the name of the victim  a goat joined with  a song undoubtedly arose the word tragedy  these hymns or lyric poems were sung sometimes by the whole company sometimes by separate bands answering alternately to each other making what we call a chorus with its strophes and antistrophes in order to throw some variety into this entertainment and to relieve the singers it was thought proper to introduce a person who between the songs should make a recitation in verse thespis who lived about     years before the christian era made this innovation and as it was relished aeschylus who came  0 years after him and who is properly the father of tragedy went a step farther introduced a dialogue between two persons or actors in which he contrived to interweave some interesting story and brought his actors on a stage adorned with proper scenery and decorations all that these actors recited was called episode or additional song and the songs of the chorus were made to relate no longer to bacchus their original subject but to the story in which the actors were concerned this began to give the drama a regular form which was soon after brought to perfection by sophocles and euripides it is remarkable in how short a space of time tragedy grew up among the greeks from the rudest beginnings to its most perfect state for sophocles the greatest and most correct of all the tragic poets flourished only    years after aeschylus and was little more than  0 years posterior to thespis  from the account which i have now given it appears that the chorus was the basis or foundation of the ancient tragedy it was not an ornament added to it or a contrivance designed to render it more perfect but in truth the dramatic dialogue was an addition to the chorus which was the original entertainment in process of time the chorus from being the principal became only the accessory in tragedy till at last in modern tragedy it has disappeared altogether which forms the chief distinction between the ancient and the modern stage  this has given rise to a question much agitated between the partisans of the ancients and the moderns whether the drama has gained or has suffered by the abolition of the chorus it must be admitted that the chorus tended to render tragedy both more magnificent and more instructive and moral it was always the most sublime and poetical part of the work and being carried on by singing and accompanied with music it must no doubt have diversified the entertainment greatly and added to its splendor the chorus at the same time conveyed constant lessons of virtue it was composed of such persons as might most naturally be supposed present on the occasion inhabitants of the place where the scene was laid often the companions of some of the principal actors and therefore in some degree interested in the issue of the action this company which in the days of sophocles was restricted to the number of fifteen persons was constantly on the stage during the whole performance mingled in discourse with the actors entered into their concerns suggested counsel and advice to them moralized on all the incidents that were going on and during the intervals of the action sung their odes or songs in which they addressed the gods prayed for success to the virtuous lamented their misfortunes and delivered many religious and moral sentiments the office of the chorus is thus described by horace actoris parts chorus officiumque virile defendat neu quid medios intercinat actus quod non proposito conducat et haereat apt ille bonis faveatque et concilietur amicis et regat iratos et amet peccare timentes ille dapes laudet mensae brevis ille salubrem justitiam legesque and apertis otia portis ille tegat commissa deosque precetur et oret ut redeat miseris abeat fortuna superbis de art poet     the chorus must support an actors part defend the virtuous and advise with art govern the choleric and the proud appease and the short feasts of frugal tables praise applaud the justice of wellgoverned states and peace triumphant with her open gates entrusted secrets let them never betray but to the righteous gods with ardour pray that fortune with returning smiles may bless afflicted worth and impious pride depress yet let their songs with apt coherence join promote the plot and aid the just design francis   but notwithstanding the advantages which were obtained by means of the chorus the inconveniences on the other side are so great as to render the modern practice of excluding the chorus far more eligible upon the whole for if a natural and probable imitation of human actions be the chief end of the drama no other persons ought to be brought on the stage than those who are necessary to the dramatic action the introduction of an adventitious company of persons who have but a slight concern in the business of the play is unnatural in itself embarrassing to the poet and though it may render the spectacle splendid tends undoubtedly to render it more cold and uninteresting because more unlike a real transaction the mixture of music or song on the part of the chorus with the dialogue carried on by the actors is another unnatural circumstance removing the representation still farther from the resemblance of life the poet besides is subjected to innumerable difficulties in so contriving his plan that the presence of the chorus during all the incidents of the play shall consist with any probability the scene must be constantly and often absurdly laid in some public place that the chorus may be supposed to have free access to it to many things that ought to be transacted in private the chorus must ever be witnesses they must be the confederates of both parties who come successively upon the stage and who are perhaps conspiring against each other in short the management of a chorus is an unnatural confinement to a poet it requires too great a sacrifice of probability in the conduct of the action it has too much the air of a theatrical decoration to be consistent with that appearance of reality which a poet must ever preserve in in order to move our passions the origin of tragedy among the greeks we have seen was a choral song or hymn to the gods there is no wonder therefore that on the greek stage it so long maintained possession but it may confidently i think be asserted that if instead of the dramatic dialogue having been superadded to the chorus the dialogue itself had been the first invention the chorus would in that case never have been thought of  one use i am of opinion might still be made of the ancient chorus and would be a considerable improvement of the modern theater if instead of that unmeaning and often improperly chosen music with which the audience is entertained in the intervals between the acts a chorus were then to be introduced whose music and songs though forming no part of the play should have a relation to the incidents of the preceding act and to the dispositions which those incidents are presumed to have awakened in the spectators by this means the tone of passion would be kept up without interruption and all the good effects of the ancient chorus might be preserved for inspiring proper sentiments and for increasing the morality of the performance without those inconveniences which arose from the chorus forming a constituent part of the play and mingling unseasonably and unnaturally with the personages of the drama  after the view which we have taken of the rise of tragedy and of the nature of the ancient chorus with the advantages and inconveniences attending it our way is cleared for examining with more advantage the three unities of action place and time which have generally been considered as essential to the proper conduct of the dramatic fable  of these three the first unity of action is beyond doubt far the most important in treating of epic poetry i have already explained the nature of it as consisting in a relation which all the incidents introduced bear to some design or effect so as to combine naturally into one whole this unity of subject is still more essential to tragedy than it is to epic poetry for a multiplicity of plots or actions crowded into so short a space as tragedy allows must of necessity distract the attention and prevent passion from raising to any height nothing therefore is worse conduct in a tragic poet than to carry on two independent actions in the same play the effect of which is that the mind being suspended and divided between them cannot give itself up entirely either to the one or the other there may indeed be underplots that is the persons introduced may have different pursuits and designs but the poets art must be shown in managing these so as to render them subservient to the main action they ought to be connected with the catastrophe of the play and to conspire in bringing it forward if there be any intrigue which stands separate and independent and which may be left out without affecting the unravelling of the plot we may always conclude this to be a faulty violation of unity such episodes are not permitted here as in epic poetry  we have a clear example of this defect in mr addisons cato the subject of this tragedy is the death of cato and a very noble personage cato is and supported by the author with much dignity but all the love scenes in the play the passion of catos two sons for lucia and that of juba for catos daughter are mere episodes have no connection with the principal action and no effect upon it the author thought his subject too barren in incidents and in order to diversify it he has given us as it were by the bye a history of the amors that were going on in catos family by which he has both broken the unity of his subject and formed a very unseasonable junction of gallantry with the high sentiments and public spirited passions which predominate in other parts and which the play was chiefly designed to display  we must take care not to confound the unity of the action with the simplicity of the plot unity and simplicity import different things in dramatic composition the plot is said to be simple when a small number of incidents are introduced into it but it may be implex as the critics term it that is it may include a considerable number of persons and events and yet not be deficient in unity provided all the incidents be made to tend toward the principal object of the play and be properly connected with it all the greek tragedies not only maintain unity in the action but are remarkably simple in the plot to such a degree indeed as sometimes to appear to us too naked and destitute of interesting events in the oedipus coloneus for instance of sophocles the whole subject is no more than this oedipus blind and miserable wanders to athens and wishes to dye there creon and his son polynices arrive at the same time and endeavor separately to persuade the old man to return to thebes each with a view to his own interest he will not go theseus the king of athens protects him and the play ends with his death in the philoctetes of the same author the plot or fable is nothing more than ulysses and the son of achilles studying to persuade the diseased philoctetes to leave his uninhabited island and go with them to troy which he refuses to do till hercules whose arrows he possessed descends from heaven and commands him yet these simple and seemingly barren subjects are wrought up with so much art by sophocles as to become very tender and affecting  among the moderns much greater variety of events has been admitted into tragedy it has become more the theater of passion than it was among the ancients a greater display of characters is attempted more intrigue and action are carried on our curiosity is more awakened and more interesting situations arise this variety is upon the whole an improvement on tragedy it renders the entertainment both more animated and more instructive and when kept within due bounds may be perfectly consistent with unity of subject but the poet must at the same time beware of not deviating too far from simplicity in the construction of his fable for if he overcharges it with action and intrigue it becomes perplexed and embarrassed and by consequence loses much of its effect congreves mourning bride a tragedy otherwise far from being void of merit fails in this respect and may be given as an instance of one standing in perfect opposition to the simplicity of the ancient plots the incidents succeed one another too rapidly the play is too full of business it is difficult for the mind to follow and comprehend the whole series of events and what is the greatest fault of all the catastrophe which ought always to be plain and simple is brought about in a manner too artificial and intricate  unity of action must not only be studied in the general construction of the fable or plot but must regulate the several acts and scenes into which the play is divided  the division of every play into five acts has no other foundation than common practice and the authority of horace neve minor neu sit quinto productior actu fabula  de art poet if you would have your play deserve success give it five acts complete nor more nor less francis it is a division purely arbitrary there is nothing in the nature of the composition which fixes this number rather than any other and it had been much better if no such number had been ascertained but every play had been allowed to divide itself into as many parts or intervals as the subject naturally pointed out on the greek stage whatever may have been the case on the roman the division by acts was totally unknown the word act never once occurs in aristotles poetics in which he defines exactly every part of the drama and divides it into the beginning the middle and the end or in his own words into the prologue the episode and the exode the greek tragedy was indeed one continued representation from beginning to end the stage was never empty nor the curtain let fall but at certain intervals when the actors retired the chorus continued and sung neither do these songs of the chorus divide the greek tragedies into five portions similiar to our acts though some of the commentators have endeavored to force them into this office but it is plain that the intervals at which the chorus sung are extremely unequal and irregular suited to the occasion and the subject and would divide the play sometimes into three sometimes into seven or eight acts see the dissertation prefixed to franklins translation of sophocles   as practice has now established a different plan on the modern stage has divided every play into five acts and made a total pause in the representation at the end of each act the poet must be careful that this pause shall fall in a proper place where there is a natural pause in the action and where if the imagination has any thing to supply that is not represented on the stage it may be supposed to have been transacted during the interval  the first act ought to contain a clear exposition of the subject it ought to be so managed as to awaken the curiosity of the spectators and at the same time to furnish them with materials for understanding the sequel it should make them acquainted with the personages who are to appear with their several views and interest and with the situation of affairs at the time when the play commences a striking introduction such as the first speech of almeria in the mourning bride and that of lady randolph in douglas produces a happy effect but this is what the subject will not always admit in the ruder times of dramatic writing the exposition of the subject was wont to be made by a prologue or by a single actor appearing and giving full and direct information to the spectators some of aeschyluss and euripidess plays are opened inthis manner but such an introduction is extremely inartificial and therefore is now totally abolished and the subject made to open itself by conversation among the first actors who are brought upon the stage  during the course of the drama in the second third and fourth acts the plot should gradually thick the great object which the poet ought here to have in view is by interesting us in his story to keep our passions always awake as soon as he allows us to languish there is no more tragic merit he should therefore introduce no personages but such as are necessary for carrying on the action he should contrive to place those whom he finds it proper to introduce in the most interesting situations he should have no scenes of idle conversation or mere declamation the action of the play ought to be always advancing and as it advances the suspense and the concern of the spectators to be raised more and more this is the great excellency of shakespeare that his scenes are full of sentiment and action never of mere discourse whereas it is often a fault of the best french tragedians that they allow the action to languish for the sake of a long and artful dialogue sentiment passion pity and terror should reign throughout a tragedy every thing should be full of movements an useless incident or an unnecessary conversation weaken the interest which we take in the action and render us cold and inattentive  the fifth act is the seat of the catastrophe or the unravelling of the plot in which we always expect the art and genius of the poet to be most fully displayed the first rule concerning it is that it be brought about by probable and natural means hence all unravellings which turn upon disguised habits rencounters by night mistakes of one person for another and other such theatrical and romantic circumstances are to be condemned as faulty in the next place the catastrophe ought always to be simple to depend on few events and to include but few persons passion never rises so high when it is divided among many objects as when it is directed toward one or a few and it is still more checked if the incidents be so complex and intricate that the understanding is put on the stretch to trace them when the heart should be wholly delivered up to emotion the catastrophe of the mourning bride as i formerly hinted offends against both these rules in the last place the catastrophe of a tragedy ought to be the reign of pure sentiment and passion in proportion as it approaches every thing should warm and glow no long discourses no cold reasonings no parade of genius in the midst of those solemn and awful events that close some of the great revolutions of human fortune there if any where the poet must be simple serious pathetic and speak no language but that of nature  the ancients were fond of unravellings which turned upon what is called an anagnorisis or a discovery of some person to be different from what he was taken to be when such discoveries are artfully conducted and produced in critical situations they are extremely striking such as that famous one in sophocles which makes the whole subject of his oedipus tyrannus and which is undoubtedly the fullest of suspense agitation and terror that ever was exhibited on any stage among the moderns two of the most distinguished anagnorises are those contained in voltaires merope and mr homes douglas both of which are great masterpieces of the kind  it is not essential to the catastrophe of a tragedy that it should end unhappily in the course of the play there may be sufficient agitation and distress and many tender emotions raised by the sufferings and dangers of the virtuous though in the end good men are rendered successful the tragic spirit therefore does not want scope upon this system and accordingly the athalie of racine and some of voltaires finest plays such as abzire merope and the orphan of china with some few english tragedies likewise have a fortunate conclusion but in general the spirit of tragedy especially of english tragedy leans more to the side of leaving the impression of virtuous sorrow full and strong upon the heart  a question intimately connected with this subject and which has employed the speculations of several philosophical critics naturally occurs here how it comes to pass that those emotions of sorrow which tragedy excites afford any gratification to the mind for is not sorrow in its nature a painful passion is not real distress often occasioned to the spectators by the dramatic representations at which they assist do we not see their tears flow and yet while the impression of what they have suffered remains upon their minds they again assemble in crowds to renew the same distresses the question is not without difficulty and various solutions of it have been proposed by ingenious men see dr campbells philosophy of rhetorie book i chapter xi where an account is given of the hypotheses of different critics on this subject and where one is proposed with which in the main i agree  see also lord kaimess essays on the principles of morality essay i and mr david humes essay on tragedy  the most plain and satisfactory account of the matter appears to me to be the following by the wife and gracious constitution of our nature the exercise of all the social passions is attended with pleasure nothing is more pleasing and grateful than love and friendship wherever man takes a strong interest in the concerns of his fellow creatures an internal satisfaction is made to accompany the feeling pity or compassion in particular is for wise ends appointed to be one of the strongest instincts of our frame and is attended with a peculiar attractive power it is an affection which cannot but be productive of some distress on account of the sympathy with the sufferers which it necessarily involves but as it includes benevolence and friendship it partakes at the same time of the agreeable and pleasing nature of those affections the heart is warmed by kindness and humanity at the same moment at which it is afflicted by the distresses of those with whom it sympathises and the pleasure arising from those kind emotions prevails so much in the mixture and so far counterbalances the pain as to render the state of the mind upon the whole agreeable at the same time the immediate pleasure which always goes along with the operation of the benevolent and sympathetic affections derives an addition from the approbation of our own minds we are pleased with ourselves for feeling as we ought and for entering with proper sorrow into the concerns of the afflicted in tragedy besides other adventitious circumstances concur to diminish the painful part of sympathy and to increase the satisfaction attending it we are in some measure relieved by thinking that the cause of our distress is feigned not real and we are also gratified by the charms of poetry the propriety of sentiment and language and the beauty of action from the concurrence of these causes the pleasure which we receive from tragedy notwithstanding the distress it occasions seems to me to be accounted for in a satisfactory manner at the same time it is to be observed that as there is always a mixture of pain in the pleasure that pain is capable of being so much heightened by the representation of incidents extremely direful as to shock our feelings and to render us averse either to the reading of such tragedies or to the beholding of them upon the stage  having now spoken of the conduct of the subject throughout the acts it is also necessary to take notice of the conduct of the several scenes which make up the acts of a play  the entrance of a new personage upon the stage forms what is called a new scene these scenes or successive conversations should be closely linked and connected with each other and much of the art of dramatic composition is shown in maintaining this connection two rules are necessary to be observed for this purpose  the first is that during the course of one act the stage should never be left vacant though but for a single moment that is all the persons who have appeared in one scene or conversation should never go off together and be succeeded by a new set of persons appearing in the next scene independent of the former this makes a gap or total interruption in the representation which in effect puts an end to that act for wherever the stage is evacuated the act is closed this rule is very generally observed by the french tragedians but the english writers both of comedy and tragedy seldom pay any regard to it their personages succeed one another upon the stage with so little connection the union of their scenes is so much broken that with equal propriety their plays might be divided into ten or twelve acts as into five  the second rule which the english writers also observe little better than the former is that no person should come upon the stage or leave it without a reason appearing to us both for the one and the other nothing is more awkward and contrary to art than for an actor to enter without our seeing any cause for his appearing in that scene except that it was for the poets purpose he should enter precisely at such a moment or for an actor to go away without any reason for his retiring farther than that the poet had no more speeches to put into his his mouth this is managing the personae dramatis exactly like so many puppets who are moved by wires to answer the call of the master of the show whereas the perfection of dramatic writing requires that every thing should be conducted in imitation as near as possible of some real transaction where we are let into the secret of all that is passing where we behold persons before us always busy see them coming and going and know perfectly whence they come and whither they go and about what they are employed  all that i have hitherto said relates to the unity of the dramatic action in order to render the unity of action more complete critics have added the other two unities of time and place the strict observance of these is more difficult and perhaps not so necessary the unity of place requires that the scene should never be shifted but that the action of the play should be continued to the end in the same place where it is supposed to begin the unity of time strictly taken requires that the time of the action be no longer than the time that is allowed for the representation of the play though aristotle seems to have given the poet a little more liberty and permitted the action to comprehend the whole time of one day  the intention of both these rules is to overcharge as little as possible the imagination of the spectators with improbable circumstances in the acting of the play and to bring the imitation more close to reality we must observe that the nature of dramatic exhibitions upon the greek stage subjected the ancient tragedians to a more strict observance of those unities than is necessary in modern theaters i showed that a greek tragedy was one uninterrupted representation from beginning to end there was no division of acts no pauses or interval between them but the stage was continually full occupied either by the actors or the chorus hence no room was left for the imagination to go beyond the precise time and place of the representation any more than is allowed during the continuance of one act on the modern theater  but the practice of suspending the spectacle totally for some little time between the acts has made a great and material change gives more latitude to the imagination and renders the ancient strict confinement to time and place less necessary while the acting of the play is interrupted the spectator can without any great or violent effort suppose a few hours to pass between every act or can suppose himself moved from one apartment of a palace or one part of a city to another and therefore too strict an observance of these unities ought not to be preferred to higher beauties of execution nor to the introduction of more pathetic situations which sometimes cannot be accomplished in any other way than by the transgression of these rules  on the ancient stage we plainly see the poets struggling with many an inconvenience in order to preserve those unities which were then so necessary as the scene could never be shifted they were obliged to make it always lie in some court of a palace or some public area to which all the persons concerned in the action might have equal access this led to frequent improbabilities by representing things as transacted there which naturally ought to have been transacted before few witnesses and in private apartments the like improbabilities arose from limiting themselves so much in point of time incidents were unnaturally crowded and it is easy to point out several instances in the greek tragedies where events are supposed to pass during a song of the chorus which must necessarily have employed many hours  but though it seems necessary to set modern poets free from a strict observance of these dramatic unities yet we must remember there are certain bounds to this liberty frequent and wild changes of time and place hurrying the spectator from one distant city or country to another or making several days or weeks to pass during the course of the representation are liberties which shock the imagination which give to the performance a romantic and unnatural appearance and therefore cannot be allowed in any dramatic writer who aspires to correctness in particular we must remember that it is only between the acts that any liberty can be given for going beyond the unities of time and place during the course of each act they ought to be strictly observed that is during each act the scene should continue the same and no more time should be supposed to pass than is employed in the representation of that act this is a rule which the french tragedians regularly observe to violate this rule as is too often done by the english to change the place and shift the scene in the midst of one act shows great incorrectness and destroys the whole intention of the division of a play into acts mr addisons cato is remarkable beyond most english tragedies for regularity of conduct the author has limited himself in time to a single day and in place has maintained the most rigorous unity the scene is never changed and the whole action passes in the hall of catos house at utica  in general the nearer that a poet can bring the dramatic representation in all its circumstances to an imitation of nature and real life the impression which he makes on us will always be the more perfect probability as i observed at the beginning of the lecture is highly essential to the conduct of the tragic action and we are always hurt by the want of it it is this that makes the observance of the dramatic unities to be of consequence as far as they can be observed without sacrificing more material beauties it is not as has been sometimes said that by the preservation of the unities of time and place spectators when they assist at the theater are deceived into a belief of the reality of the objects which are there set before them and that when those unities are violated the charm is broken and they discover the whole to be a fiction no such deception as this can ever be accomplished no one ever imagines himself to be at athens or rome when a greek or roman subject is presented on the stage he knows the whole to be an imitation only but he requires that imitation to be conducted with skill and verisimilitude his pleasure the entertainment which he expects the interest which he is to take in the story all depend on its being so conducted his imagination therefore seeks to aid the imitation and to rest on the probability and the poet who shocks him by improbable circumstances and by awkward unskilful imitation deprives him of his pleasure and leaves him hurt and displeased this is the whole mystery of the theatrical illusion  lecture xlvi tragedy  greek  french  english tragedy having treated of the dramatic action in tragedy i proceed next to treat of the characters most proper to be exhibited it has been thought by several critics that the nature of tragedy requires the principal personages to be always of illustrious character and of high or princely rank whose misfortunes and sufferings it is said take faster hold of the imagination and impress the heart more forcibly than similar events happening to persons in private life but this is more specious than solid it is refuted by facts for the distresses of desdamona monimia and belvidera interest us as deeply as if they had been princesses or queens the dignity of tragedy does indeed require that there should be nothing degrading or mean in the circumstances of the persons which it exhibits but it requires nothing more their high rank may render the spectacle more splendid and the subject seemingly of more importance but conduce very little to its being interesting or pathetic which depends entirely on the nature of the tale on the art of the poet in conducting it and on the sentiments to which it gives occasion in every rank of life the relations of father husband son brother lover or friend lay the foundation of those affecting situations which make mans heart feel for man  the moral characters of the persons represented are of much greater consequence than the external circumstances in which the poet places them nothing indeed in the conduct of tragedy demands a poets attention more than so to describe his personages and so to order the incidents which relate to them as shall leave upon the spectators impressions favorable to virtue and to the administration of providence it is not necessary for this end that poetical justice as it is called should be observed in the catastrophe of the piece this has been long exploded from tragedy the end of which is to affect us with pity for the virtuous in distress and to afford a probable representation of the state of human life where calamities often befall the best and a mixed portion of good and evil is appointed for all but withal the author must beware of shocking our minds with such representations of life as tend to raise horror or to render virtue an object of aversion though innocent persons suffer their sufferings ought to be attended with such circumstances as shall make virtue appear amiable and venerable and shall render their condition on the whole preferable to that of bad men who have prevailed against them the stings and the remorse of guilt must ever be represented as productive of greater miseries than any that the bad can bring upon the good  aristotles observations on the characters proper for tragedy are very judicious he is of opinion that perfect unmixed characters either of good or ill men are not the fittest to be introduced the distresses of the one being wholly unmerited hurt and shock us and the sufferings of the other occasion no pity mixed characters such as in fact we meet with in the world afford the most proper field for displaying without any bad effect on morals the vicissitudes of life and they interest us the more deeply as they display emotions and passions which we have all been conscious of when such persons fall into distress through the vices of others the subject may be very pathetic but it is always more instructive when a person has been himself the cause of his misfortune and when his misfortune is occasioned by the violence of passion or by some weakness incident to human nature such subjects both dispose us to the deepest sympathy and administer useful warnings to us for our own conduct  upon theandse principles if surprises me that the story of oedipus should have been so much celebrated by all critics as one of the fittest for tragedy and so often brought upon the stage not by sophocles only but by corneille also and voltaire an innocent person one in the main of a virtuous character through no crime of his own nay not by the vices of others but through mere fatality an dblind chance is involved in the greatest of all human miseries in a casual recounter he kills his father without knowing him he afterward is married to his own mother and discovering himself in the end to have committed both parricide and incest he becomes frantic and dies in the utmost misery such a subject excites horror rather than pity as it is conducted by sophocles it is indeed extremely affecting but it conveys no instruction it awakens in the mind no tender sympathy it leaves no impression favorable to virtue or humanity  it must be acknowedged that the subjects of the ancient greek tragedies were too often founded on mere destiny and inevitable misfortunes they were too much mixed with their tales about oracles and the vengeance of th egods which led to many an incident sufficiently melancholy and tragical but rather purely tragical than useful or moral hence both the oedipuss of sophocles the iphigenia in aulis the hecuba of europides and several of the like kind in the course of the drama many moral sentiments occurred but the instruction which the fable of the play conveyed seldom was any more than that reverence was owing to th egods and submission due to the decrees of destiny modern tragedy has aimed at a higher object by becoming more the theater of passion pointing out to men the consequences of their own misconduct showing th direful effects which ambition jealousy love resentment and other such strong emotions when misguided or left unrestrained produce upon human life an othello hurried by jealousy to murder his innocent wife a jaffier ensnared by resentment an dwant to engage in a conspiracy and then stung with remorse and involved in ruin a siffredi through the deceit which he employs for publicspirited ends bringing destruction on all whom he loved a calista seduced into a criminal intrigue which overwhelms herself her father and all her friends in misery these and such as these are the examples which tragedy now displays to public view and by means of which it inculcatges on men the proper government of their passions  of all the passions which furnish matter to tragedy that which has most occupied the modern stage is love to the ancient theater it was in a manner wholly unknown in few of their tragedies is it ever mentioned and i remember no more than one which turns upon it the hippolitus of euripides this was owing to the national manners of the greeks and to that greater separation of the two sexes from one another than has taken place in modern times aided too perhaps by this circumstance that no female actors ever appeared on the ancient stage but though no reason appears for the total exclusion of love from the theater yet with what justice or propriety it has usurped so much place as to be in a manner the sole hinge of modern tragedy may be much questioned voltaire who is no less eminent as a critic than as a poet declares loudly and strongly against this predominancy of love as both degrading the majesty and confining the natural limits of tragedy and assuredly the mixing of it perpetually with all the great and solemn revolutions of human fortune which belong to the tragic stage tends to give tragedy too much the air of gallantry and juvenile entertainment the athalie of racine the merope of voltaire the douglas of mr home are sufficient proofs that without any assistance from love the drama is capable of producing its highest effects upon the mind  this seems to be clear that wherever love is introduced into tragedy it ought to reign in it and to give rise to the principal action it ought to be that sort of love which possesses all the force and majesty of passion and which occasions great and important consequences for nothing can have a worse effect or be more debasing to tragedy than together with the manly and heroic passions to mingle a trifling love intrigue as a sort of seasoning to the play the bad effects of this are sufficiently conspicuous both in the cato of mr addison as i had occasion before to remark and in the iphiginie of racine  after a tragic poet has arranged his subject and chosen his personages the next thing he must attend to is the propriety of sentiments that they may be perfectly suited to the characters of those persons to whom they are attributed and to the situations in which they are placed the necessity of observing this general rule is so obvious that i need not insist upon it it is principally in the pathetic parts that both the difficulty and the importance of it are the greatest tragedy is the region of passion we come to it expecting to be moved and let the poet be ever so judicious in his conduct moral in his intentions and elegant in his style yet if he fails in the pathetic he has no tragic merit we return cold and disappointed from the performance and never desire to meet with it more  to paint passion so truly and justly as to strike the hearts of the hearers with full sympathy is a prerogative of genius given to few it requires strong and ardent sensibility of mind it requires the author to have the power of entering deeply into the characters which he draws of becoming for a moment the very person whom he exhibits and of assuming all his feelings for as i have often had occasion to observe there is no possibility of speaking properly the language of any passion without feeling it and it is to the absence or deadness of real emotion that we must ascribe the want of success in so many tragic writers when they attempt being pathetic  no man for instance when he is under the strong agitations of anger or grief or any such violent passion ever thinks of describing to another what his feelings at that time are or of telling them what he resembles this never was and never will be the language of any person when he is deeply moved it is the language of one who describes coolly the condition of that person to another or it is the language of the passionate person himself after his emotion has subsided relating what his situation was in the moments of passion yet this sort of secondary description is what tragic poets too often give us instead of the native and primary language of passion thus in mr addisons cato when lucia confesses to portius her love for him but at the same time swears with the greatest solemnity that in the present situation of their country she will never marry him portius receives this unexpected sentence with the utmost astonishment and grief at least the poet wants to make us believe that he so received it how does he express these feelings fixed in astonishment i gaze upon thee like one just blasted by a stroke from heaven who pants for breath and stiffens yet alive in dreadful looks a monument of wrath this makes his whole reply to lucia now did any person who was of a sudden astonished and overwhelmed with sorrow ever since the creation of the world express himself in this manner this is indeed an excellent description to be given us by another of a person who was in such a situation nothing would have been more proper for a bystander recounting this conference than to have said fixed in astonishment he gazed upon her like one just blasted by a stroke from heaven who pants for breath etc but the person who is himself concerned speaks on such an occasion in a very different manner he gives vent to his feelings he pleads for pity he dwells upon the cause of his grief and astonishment but never thinks of describing his own person and looks and showing us by a simile what he resembles such representations of passions are no better in poetry than it would be in painting to make a label issue from the mouth of a figure bidding us remark that this figure represents an astonished or a grieved person  on some other occasions when poets do not employ this sort of descriptive language in passion they are too apt to run into forced and unnatural thoughts in order to exaggerate the feelings of persons whom they would paint as very strongly moved when osmyn in the mourning bride after parting with almeria regrets in a long soliloquy that his eyes only see objects that are present and cannot see almeria after she is gone when jane shore in mr rowes tragedy on meeting with her husband in her extreme distress and finding that he had forgiven her calls on the rains to give her their drops and the springs to give her their streams that she may never want a supply of tears in such passages we see very plainly that it is neither osmyn nor jane shore that speak but the poet himself in his own person who instead of assuming the feelings of those whom he means to exhibit and speaking as they would have done in such situations is straining his fancy and spurring up his genius to say something that shall be uncommonly strong and lively  if we attend to the language that is spoken by persons under the influence of real passion we shall find it always plain and simple abounding indeed with those figures which express a disturbed and impetuous state of mind such as interrogations exclamations and apostrophes but never employing those which belong to the mere embellishment and parade of speech we never meet with any subtilty or refinement in the sentiments of real passion the thoughts which passion suggests are always plain and obvious ones arising directly from its object passion never reasons nor speculates till its ardour begins to cool it never leads to long discourse or declamation on the contrary it expresses itself most commonly in short broken and interrupted speeches corresponding to the violent and desultory emotions of the mind  when we examine the french tragedians by these principles which seem clearly founded in nature we find them often deficient though in many parts of tragic composition they have great merit though in exciting soft and tender emotions some of them are very successful yet in the high and strong pathetic they generally fail their passionate speeches too often run into long declamation there is too much reasoning and refinement too much pomp and studied beauty in them they rather convey a feeble impression of passion than awaken any strong sympathy in the readers mind  sophocles and euripides are much more successful in this part of composition in their pathetic scenes we find no unnatural refinement no exaggerated thoughts they set before us the plain and direct feelings of nature in simple expressive language and therefore on great occasions they seldom fail of touching the heart nothing for instance can be more touching and pathetic than the address which medea in euripides makes to her children when she had formed the resolution of putting them to death and nothing more natural than the conflict which is described as suffering within herself on that occasion      etc eur med l  0 0  this too is shakespeares great excellency and to this it is principally owing that his dramatic productions notwithstanding their many imperfections have been so long the favorites of the public he is more faithful to the true language of nature in the midst of passion than any writer he gives us this language unadulterated by art and more instances of it can be quoted from him than from all other tragic poets put together i shall refer only to that admirable scene in macbeth where macduff receives the account of his wife and all his children being slaughtered in his absence the emotions first of grief and then of the most fierce resentment rising against macbeth are painted in such a manner that there is no heart but must feel them and no fancy can conceive any thing more expressive of nature  with regard to moral sentiments and reflections in tragedies it is clear that they must not recur too often they lose their effect when unseasonably crowded they render the play pedantic and declamatory this is remarkably the case with those latin tragedies which go under the name of seneca which are little more than a collection of declamations and moral sentiments wrought up with a quaint brilliancy which suited the prevalling taste of that age  i am not however of opinion that moral reflections ought to be altogether omitted in tragedies when properly introduced they give dignity to the composition and on many occasions they are extremely natural when persons are under any uncommon distress when they are beholding in others or experiencing in themselves the vicissitudes of human fortune indeed when they are placed in any of the great and trying situations of life serious and moral reflections naturally occur in them whether they be persons of much virtue or not hardly is there any person but who on such occasions is disposed to be serious it is then the natural tone of the mind and therefore no tragic poet should omit such proper opportunities when they occur for favoring the the interests of virtue cardinal wolseys soliloquy upon his fall for instance in shakespeare when he bids a long farewell to all his greatness and the advices which he afterward gives to cromwell are in his situation extremely natural touch and please all readers and are at once instructive and affecting much of the merit of mr addisons cato depends upon that moral turn of thought which distinguishes it i have had occasion both in this lecture and in the preceding one to take notice of some of its defects and certainly neither for warmth of passion nor proper conduct of the plot is it at all eminent it does not however follow that it is destitute of merit for by the purity and beauty of the language by the dignity of catos character by that ardour of public spirit and those virtuous sentiments of which it is full it has always commanded high regard and has both in our own country and among foreigners acquired no small reputation  the style and versification of tragedy ought to be free easy and varied our blank verse is happily suited to this purpose it has sufficient majesty for raising the style it can descend to the simple and familiar it is susceptible of great variety of cadence and is quite free from the constraint and monotony of rhyme for monotony is above all things to be avoided by a tragic poet if he maintains every where the same stateliness of style if he uniformly keeps up the same run of measure and harmony in his verse he cannot fail of becoming insipid he should not indeed sink into flat and careless lines his style should always have force and dignity but not the uniform dignity of epic poetry it should assume that briskness and ease which is suited to the freedom of dialogue and the fluctuations of passion  one of the greatest misfortunes of the french tragedy is its being always written in rhyme the nature of the french language indeed requires this in order to distinguish the style from mere prose but it fetters the freedom of the tragic dialogue fills it with a languid monotony and is in a manner fatal to the high strength and power of passion voltaire maintains that the difficulty of composing in french rhyme is one great cause of the pleasure which the audience receives from the composition tragedy would be ruined says he if we were to write it in blank verse take away the difficulty and you take away the whole merit a strange idea as if the entertainment of the audience arose not from the emotions which the poet is successful in awakening but from a reflection on the toil which he endured in his closet from assorting male and female rhymes with regard to those splendid comparisons in rhyme and strings of couplets with which it was some time ago fashionable for our english poets to conclude not only every act of a tragedy but sometimes also the most interesting scenes nothing need be said but that they were the most perfect barbarisms childish ornaments introduced to please a false taste in the audience and now universally laid aside  having thus treated of all the different parts of tragedy i shall conclude the subject with a short view of the greek the french and the english stage and with observations on the principal writers  most of the distinguished characters of the greek tragedy have been already occasionally mentioned it was embellished with the lyric poetry of the chorus of the origin of which and of the advantages and disadvantages attending it i treated fully in the preceding lecture the plot was always exceedingly simple it admitted of few incidents it was conducted for most part with a very exact regard to the unities of action time and place machinery or the intervention of the gods was employed and which is very faulty the final unravelling sometimes made to turn upon it love except in one or two instances was never admitted into the greek tragedy their subjects were often founded on destiny or inevitable misfortunes a vein of religious and moral sentiment always runs through them but they made less use than the moderns of the combat of the passions and of the distresses which our passions bring upon us their plots were all taken from the ancient traditionary stories of their own nation hercules furnishes matter for two tragedies the history of oedipus king of thebes and his unfortunate family for six the war of troy with its consequences for no fewer than seventeen there is only one of later date than this which is the persae or expedition of xerxes by aeschylus  aeschylus is the father of greek tragedy and exhibits both the beauties and the defects of an early original writer he is bold nervous and animated but very obscure and difficult to be understood partly by reason of the incorrect state in which we have his works they having suffered more by time than any of the ancient tragedians and partly on account of the nature of his style which is crowded with metaphors often harsh and tumid he abounds with martial ideas and descriptions he has much fire and elevation less of tenderness than of force he delights in the mavelous the ghost of darius in the persae the inspiration of cassandra in agamemnon and the songs of the furies in the eumenides are beautiful in their kind and strongly expressive of his genius  sophocles is the most masterly of the three greek tragedians the most correct in the conduct of his subjects the most just and sublime in his sentiments he is eminent for his descriptive talent the relation of the death of oedipus in his oedipus coloneus and of the death of haemon and antigone in his antigone are perfect patterns of description to tragic poets euripides is esteemed more tender than sophocles and he is fuller of moral sentiments but in the conduct of his plays he is more incorrect and negligent his expositions or openings of the subject are made in a less artful manner and the songs of his chorus though remarkably poetical have commonly less connection with the main action than those of sophocles both euripides and sophocles however have very high merit as tragic poets they are elegant and beautiful in their style just for the most part in their thoughts they speak with the voice of nature and making allowance for the difference of ancient and modern ideas in the midst of all their simplicity they are touching and interesting  the circumstances of theatrical representation on the stages of greece and rome were in several respects very singular and widely different from what obtains among us not only were the songs of the chorus accompanied with instrumental music but the abbe de bos in his reflections on poetry and painting has proved with much curious erudition that the dialogue part had also a modulation of its own which was capable of being set to notes that it was carried on in a sort of recitative between the actors and was supported by instruments he has farther attempted to prove but the proof seems more dubious that on some occasions on the roman stage the pronouncing and gesticulating parts were divided that one actor spoke and another performed the gestures and motions corresponding to what the first said the actors in tragedy wore a long robe called smyrna which flowed upon the stage they were raised upon cothurni which rendered their stature uncommonly high and they always played in masks these masks were like helmets which covered the whole head they mouths of them were so contrived as to give an artificial sound to the voice in order to make it be heard over their vast theaters and the visage was so formed and painted as to suit the age characters or dispositions of the persons represented when during the course of one scene different emotions were to appear in the same person the masque is said to have been so painted that the actor by turning one or other profile of his face to the spectators expressed the change of the situaation this however was a contrivance attended with many disadvantages the masque must have deprived the spectators of all the pleasure which arises from the natural animated expression of the eye and the countenance and joined with the other circumstances which i have mentioned is apt to give us but an unfavourable idea of the dramatic representations of the ancients in defense of them it must at the same time be remembered that their theaters were vastly more extensive in the area than ours and filled with immense crowds they were always uncovered and exposed to the open air the actors were beheld at a much greater distance and of course much more imperfectly by the bulk of the spectators which both rendered their looks of less consequence and might make it in some degree necessary that their features should be exaggerated the sound of their voices enlarged and their whole appearance magnified beyond the life in order to make the stronger impression it is certain that as dramatic spectacles were the favorite entertainments of the greeks and romans the attention given to their proper exhibition and the magnificence of the apparatus bestowed on their theaters far exceeded any thing that has been attempted in modern ages  in the compositions of some of the french dramatic writers particularly corneille racine and voltaire tragedy has appeared with much luster and dignity they must be allowed to have improved upon the ancients in introducing more incidents a greater variety of passions a fuller display of characters and in rendering the subject thereby more interesting they have studied to imitate the ancient models in regularity of conduct they are attentive to all the unities and to all the decorums of sentiment and morality and their style is generally very poetical and elegant what an english taste is most apt to censure in them is the want of fervor strength and the natural language of passion there is often too much conversation in their pieces instead of action they are too declamatory as was before observed when they should be passionate too refined when they should be simple voltaire freely acknowledges those defects of the french theater he admits that their best tragedies make not a deep enough impression the heart that the gallantry which reigns in them and the long fine spun dialogue with which they overabound frequently spread a languor over them that the authors seemed to be afraid of being too tragic and very heartily gives it as his judgment that an union of the vehemence and the action which characterise the english theater with the correctness and decorum of the french theater would be necessary to form a perfect tragedy  corneille who is properly the father of french tragedy is distinguished by the majesty and grandeur of his sentiments and the fruitfulness of his imagination his genius was unquestionably very rich but seemed more turned toward the epic than the tragic vein for in general he is magnificent and splendid rather than tender and touching he is the most declamatory of all the french tragedians he united the copiousness of dryden with the fire of lucan and he resembles them also in their faults in their extravagance and impetuosity he has composed a great number of tragedies very unequal in their merit his best and most esteemed pieces are the cid horace polyeucte and cinna  racine as a tragic poet is much superior to corneille he wanted the copiousness and grandeur of corneilles imagination but is free of his bombast and excels him greatly in tenderness few poets indeed are more tender and moving than racine his phaedra his andromaque his athalie and his mithridate are excellent dramatic performances and do no small honor to the french stage his language and versification are uncommonly beautiful of all the french authors he appears to me to have most excelled in poetical style to have managed their rhyme with the greatest advantage and facility and to have given it the most complete harmony voltaire has again and again pronounced racines athalie to be the chief doeuvre of the french stage it is altogether a sacred drama and owes much of its elevation to the majesty of religion but it is less tender and interesting than andromaque racine has formed two of his plays upon plans of euripides in the phaedra he is extremely successful but not so in my opinion in the iphigenie where he has degraded the ancient characters by unseasonable gallantry achilles is a french lover and eriphile a modern lady the characters of corneille and racine are happily contrasted with one another in the following beautiful lines of a french poet which will gratify several readers corneille illum nobilibus majestas evehit alis vertice tangentem nubes stant ordine longo magnanimi circum heroes fulgentibus omnes induti trabeis polyeuctus cinna seleucus et cidus et rugis signatus horatius ora racine hunc circumvolitat penna alludente cupido vincla triumphatis insternens florea scenis colligit haec mollis genius levibusque catenis heroas stringit dociles pyrrhosque

marsy e societate jesu   voltaire in several of his tragedies is inferior to none of his predecessors in one great article he has outdone them all in the delicate and interesting situations which he has contrived to introduce in these lies his chief strength he is not indeed exempt from the defects of the other french tragedians of wanting force and of being sometimes too long and declamatory in his speeches but his characters are drawn with spirit his events are striking and in his sentiments there is much elevation his zaire alzire merope and orphan of china are four capital tragedies and deserve the highest praise what one might perhaps not expect voltaire is in the strain of his sentiments the most religious and the most moral of all tragic poets  though the musical dramas of metastasio fulfill not the character of just and regular tragedies they approach however so near to it and possess so much merit that it would be unjust to pass them over without notice for the elegance of style the charms of lyric poetry and the beauties of sentiment they are eminent they abound in wellcontrived and interesting situations the dialogue by its closeness and rapidity carries a considerable resemblance to that of the ancient greek tragedies and is both more animated and more natural than the long declamation of the french theater but the shortness of the several dramas and the intermixture of so much lyric poetry as belongs to this sort of composition often occasions the course of the incidents to be hurried on too quickly and prevents that consistent display of characters and that full preparation of events which are necessary to give a proper verisimilitude to tragedy  it only now remains to speak of the state of tragedy in great britain the general character of which is that it is more animated and passionate than french tragedy but more irregular and incorrect and less attentive to decorum and to elegance the pathetic it must always be remembered is the soul of tragedy the english therefore must be allowed to have aimed at the highest species of excellence though in the execution they have not always joined the other beauties that ought to accompany the pathetic  the first object which presents itself to us on the english theater is the great shakespeare great he may be justly called as the extent and force of his natural genius both for tragedy and comedy is altogether unrivalled the character which dryden has drawn of shakespeare is not only just but uncommonly elegant and happy he was the man who of all modern and perhaps ancient poets had the largest and most comprehensive soul all the images of nature were still present to him and he drew them not laboriously but luckily when he describes any thing you more than see it you feel it too they who accuse him of wanting learning give him the greatest commendation he was naturally learned he needed not the spectacles of books to read nature he looked inward and found her there i cannot say he is every where alike were he so i should do him injury to compare him to the greatest of mankind he is many times flat and insipid his comic wit degenerating into clenches his serious swelling into bombast but he is always great when some great occasion is presented to him drydens essay of dramatic poetry  but at the same time it is genius shooting wild deficient in just taste and altogether unassisted by knowledge or art long has he been idolized by the british nation much has been said and much has been written concerning him criticism has been drawn to the very dregs in commentaries upon his words and witticisms and yet it remains to this day in doubt whether his beauties or his faults be greatest admirable scenes and passages without number there are in his plays passages beyond what are to be found in any other dramatic writer but there is hardly any one of his plays which can be called altogether a good one or which can be read with uninterrupted pleasure from beginning to end besides extreme irregularities in conduct and grotesque mixtures of serious and comic in one piece we are every now and then interrupted by unnatural thoughts harsh expressions a certain obscure bombast and a play upon words which he is fond of pursuing and these interruptions to our pleasure too frequently occur on occasions when we would least wish to meet with them all those faults however shakespeare redeems by two of the greatest excellencies which any tragic poet can possess his lively and diversified paintings of character his strong and natural expressions of passion these are his two chief virtues on these his merit rests notwithstanding his many absurdities all the while we are reading his plays we find ourselves in the midst of our fellows we meet with men vulgar perhaps in their manners coarse or harsh in their sentiments but still they are men they speak with human voices and are actuated by human passions we are interested in what they say or do because we feel that they are of the same nature with ourselves it is therefore no matter of wonder that from the more polished and regular but more cold and artificial performances of other poets the public should return with pleasure to such warm and genuine representations of human nature shakespeare possesses likewise the merit of having created for himself a sort of world of praeternatural beings his witches ghosts fairies and spirits of all kinds are described with such circumstances of awful and mysterious solemnity and speak a language so peculiar to themselves as strongly to affect the imagination his two masterpieces and in which in my opinion the strength of his genius chiefly appears are othello and mackbeth with regard to his historical plays they are properly speaking neither tragedies nor comedies but a peculiar species of dramatic entertainment calculated to describe the manners of the times of which he treats to exhibit the principal characters and to fix our imagination on the most interesting events and revolutions of our own country see an excellent defense of shakespeares historical plays and several just observations on his peculiar excellencies as a tragic poet in mr montagues essay on the writings and genius of shakespeare   after the age of shakespeare we can produce in the english language several detached tragedies of considerable merit but we have not many dramatic writers whose whole works are entitled either to particular criticism or very high praise in the tragedies of dryden and lee there is much fire but mixed with much fustian and rant lees theodosius or the force of love is the best of his pieces and in some of the scenes does not want tenderness and warmth though romantic in the plan and extravagant in the sentiments otway was endowed with a high portion of the tragic spirit which appears to great advantage in his two principal tragedies the orphan and venice preserved in these he is perhaps too tragic the distresses being so deep as to tear and overwhelm the mind he is a writer doubtless of genious and strong passion but at the same time exceedingly gross and indelicate no tragedies are less moral than those of otway there are no generous or noble sentiments in them but a licentious spirit often discovers itself he is the very opposite of the french decorum and has contrived to introduce obscenity and indecent allusions into the midst of deep tragedy  rowes tragedies make a contrast to those of otway he is full of elevated and moral sentiments the poetry is often good and the language always pure and elegant but in most of his plays he is too cold and uninteresting and flowery rather than tragic two however he has produced which deserve to be exempted from this censure jane shore and the fair penitent in both of which there are so many tender and truly pathetic scenes as to render them justly favorites of the public  dr younges revenge is a play which discovers genius and fire but wants tenderness and turns too much upon the shocking and direful passions in congreves mourning bride there are some fine situations and much good poetry the two first acts are admirable the meeting of almeria with her husband osmyn in the tomb of anselmo is one of the most solemn and striking situations to be found in any tragedy the defects in the catastrophe i pointed out in the last lecture mr thomsons tragedies are too full of a stiff morality which renders them dull and formal tancred and sigismunda far excels the rest and for the plot the characters and sentiments justly deserves a place among the best english tragedies of later pieces and of living authors i have all along declined to speak  upon the whole reviewing the tragic compositions of different nations the following conclusions arise a greek tragedy is the relation of any distressful or melancholy incident sometimes the effect of passion or crime oftener of the decree of the gods simply exposed without much variety of parts or events but naturally and beautifully set before us heightened by the poetry of the chorus a french tragedy is a series of artful and refined conversations founded upon a variety of tragical and interesting situations carried on with little action and vehemence but with much poetical beauty and high propriety and decorum an english tragedy is the combat of strong passions set before us in all their violence producing deep disasters often irregularly conducted abounding in action and filling the spectators with grief the ancient tragedies were more natural and simple the moderns are more artful and complex among the french there is more correctness among the english more fire andromaque and zayre soften othello and venice preserved rend the heart it deserves remark that three of the greatest masterpieces of the french tragic theater turn wholly upon religious subjects the athalie of racine the polyeucte of corneille and the zayre of voltaire the first is founded upon a historical passage of the old testament in the other two the distress arises from the zeal and attachment of the principal personages to the christian faith and in all the three the authors have with much propriety availed themselves of the majesty which may be derived from religious ideas  lecture xlvii comedy  greek and roman  french  english comedy comedy is sufficiently discriminated from tragedy by its general spirit and strain while pity and terror and the other strong passions form the province of the latter the chief or rather sole instrument of the former is ridicule comedy proposes for its object neither the great sufferings nor the great crimes of men but their follies and slighter vices those parts of their character which raise in beholders a sense of impropriety which expose them to be censured and laughed at by others or which render them troublesome in civil society  this general idea of comedy as a satirical exhibition of the improprieties and follies of mankind is an idea very moral and useful there is nothing in the nature or general plan of this kind of composition that renders it liable to censure to polish the manners of men to promote attention to the proper decorums of social behavior and above all to render vice ridiculous is doing a real service to the world many vices might be more successfully exploded by employing ridicule against them than by serious attacks and arguments at the same time it must be confessed that ridicule is an instrument of such a nature that when managed by unskilful or improper hands there is hazard of its doing mischief instead of good to society for ridicule is far from being as some have maintained it to be a proper test of truth on the contrary it is apt to mislead and seduce by the colors which it throws upon its objects and it is often more difficult to judge whether these colors be natural and proper than it is to distinguish between simple truth and error licentious writers therefore of the comic class have too often have it in their power to cast a ridicule upon characters and objects which did not deserve it but this is a fault not owing to the nature of comedy but to the genius and turn of the writers of it in the hands of a loose immoral author comedy will mislead and corrupt while in those of a virtuous and wellintentioned one it will be not only a gay and innocent but a laudable and useful entertainment french comedy is an excellent school of manners while english comedy has been too often the school of vice  the rules respecting the dramatic action which i delivered in the first lecture upon tragedy belong equally to comedy and hence of course our disquisitions concerning it are shortened it is equally necessary to both these forms of dramatic composition that there be a proper unity of action and subject that the unities of time and place be as much as possible preserved that is that the time of the action be brought within reasonable bounds and the place of the action never changed at least not during the course of each act that the several scenes or successive conversations be properly linked together that the stage be never totally evacuated till the act closes and that the reason should appear to us why the personages who fill up the different scenes enter and go off the stage at the time when they are made to do so the scope of all these rules i showed was to bring the imitation as near as possible to probability which is always necessary in order to any imitation giving us pleasure this reason requires perhaps a stricter observance of the dramatic rules in comedy than in tragedy for the action of comedy being more familiar to us than that of tragedy more like what we are accustomed to see in common life we judge more easily of what is probable and are more hurt by the want of it the probable and the natural both in the conduct of the story and in the characters and sentiments of the persons who are introduced are the great foundation it must always be remembered of the whole beauty of comedy  the subjects of tragedy are not limited to any country or to any age the tragic poet may lay his scene in whatever region he pleases he may form his subject upon the history either of his own or of a foreign country and he may take it from any period that is agreeable to him however remote in time the reverse of this holds in comedy for a clear and obvious reason in the great vices great virtues and high passions men of all countries and ages resemble one another and are therefore equally subjects for the tragic muse but those decorums of behavior those lesser discriminations of character which afford subject for comedy change with the differences of countries and times and can never be so well understood by foreigners as by natives we weep for the heroes of greece and rome as freely as we do for those of our own country but we are touched with the ridicule of such manners and such characters only as we see and know and therefore the scene and subject of comedy should always be laid in our own country and in our own times the comic poet who aims at correcting improprieties and follies of behavior should study to catch the manners living as they rise it is not his business to amuse us with a tale of the last age or with a spanish or a french intrigue but to give us pictures taken from among ourselves to satirize reigning and present vices to exhibit to the age a faithful copy of itself with its humors its follies and its extravagancies it is only by laying his plan in this manner that he can add weight and dignity to the entertainment which he gives us plautus it is true and terence did not follow this rule they laid the scene of their comedies in greece and adopted the greek laws and customs but it must be remembered that comedy was in their age but a new entertainment in rome and that then they contented themselves with imitating often with translating merely the comedies of menander and other greek writers in after times it is known that the romans had the comoedia togata or what was founded on their own manners as well as the comoedia palliata or what was taken from the greeks  comedy may be divided into two kinds comedy of character and comedy of intrigue in the latter the plot or the action of the play is made the principal object in the former the display of some peculiar character is chiefly aimed at the action is contrived altogether with a view to this end and is treated as subordinate to it the french abound most in comedies of character all molieres capital pieces are of this sort his avare for instance misanthrope tartuffe and such are destouchess also and those of the other chief french comedians the english have inclined more to comedies of intrigue in the plays of congreve and in general in all our comedies there is much more story more bustle and action than on the french theater  in order to give this sort of composition its proper advantage these two kinds should be properly mixed together without some interesting and wellconducted story mere conversation is apt to become insipid there should be always as much intrigue as to give us something to wish and something to fear the incidents should so succeed one another as to produce striking situations and to fix our attention while they afford at the same time a proper field for the exhibition of character for the poet must never forget that to exhibit characters and manners is his principal object the action in comedy though it demands his care in order to render it animated and natural is a less significant and important part of the performance than the action in tragedy as in comedy it is what men say and how they behave that draws our attention rather than what they perform or what they suffer hence it is a great fault to overcharge it with too much intrigue and those intricate spanish plots that were fashionable for awhile carried on by perplexed apartments dark entries and disguised habits are now justly condemned and laid aside for by such conduct the main use of comedy was lost the attention of the spectators instead of being directed toward any display of characters was fixed upon the surprising turns and revolutions of the intrigue and comedy was changed into a mere novel  in the management of characters one of the most common faults of comic writers is the carrying of them too far beyond life wherever ridicule is concerned it is indeed extremely difficult to hit the precise point where true wit ends and buffoonery begins when the miser for instance in plautus searching the person whom he suspects for having stolen his casket after examining first his right hand and then his left cries out ostende etiam tertiam show me your third hand a stroke too which moliere has copied from him there is no one but must be sensible of the extravagance certain degrees of exaggeration are allowed to the comedian but there are limits set to it by nature and good taste and supposing the miser to be ever so much engrossed by his jealousy and his suspicions it is impossible to conceive any man in his wits suspecting another of having more than two hands  characters in comedy ought to be clearly distinguished from one another but the artificial contrasting of characters and the introducing them always in pairs and by opposites gives too theatrical and affected an air to the piece this is become too common a resource of comic writers in order to heighten their characters and display them to more advantage as soon as the violent and impatient person arrives upon the stage the spectator knows that in the next scene he is to be contrasted with the mild and goodnatured man or if one of the lovers introduced be remarkably gay and airy we are sure that his companion is to be a grave and serious lover like frankly and bellamy clarinda and jacintha in dr hoadlys suspicious husband such productions of characters by pairs is like the employment of the antithesis in discourse which as i formerly observed gives brilliancy indeed upon occasions but is too apparently a rhetorical artifice in every sort of composition the perfection of art is to conceal art a masterly writer will therefore give us his characters distinguished rather by such shades of diversity as are commonly found in society than marked with such strong oppositions as are rarely brought into actual contrast in any of the circumstances of life  the style of comedy ought to be pure elegant and lively very seldom rising higher than the ordinary tone of polite conversation and upon no occasion descending into vulgar mean and gross expressions here the french rhyme which in many of their comedies they have preserved occurs as an unnatural bondage certainly if prose belongs to any composition whatever it is to that which imitates the conversation of men in ordinary life one of the most difficult circumstances in writing comedy and one too upon which the success of it very much depends is to maintain throughout a current of easy genteel unaffected dialogue without pertness and flippancy without too much studied and unseasonable wit without dullness and formality too few of our english comedies are distinguished for this happy turn of conversation most of them are liable to one or other of the exceptions i have mentioned the careless husband and perhaps we may add the provoked husband and the suspicious husband seem to have more merit than most of them for easy and natural dialogue  these are the chief observations that occur to me concerning the general principles of this species of dramatic writing as distinguished from tragedy but its nature and spirit will be still better understood by a short history of its progress and a view of the manner in which it has been carried on by authors of different nations  tragedy is generally supposed to have been more ancient among the greeks than comedy we have fewer lights concerning the origin and progress of the latter what is most probable is that like the other it took its rise accidentally from the diversions peculiar to the feast of bacchus and from thespis and his cart till by degrees it diverged into an entertainment of a quite different nature from solemn and heroic tragedy critics distinguish three stages of comedy among the greeks which they call the ancient the middle and the new  the ancient comedy consisted in direct and avowed satire against particular known persons who were brought upon the stage by name of this nature are the plays of aristophanes eleven of which are still extant plays of a very singular nature and wholly different from all compositions which have since that age born the name of comedy they show what a turbulent and licentious republic that of athens was and what unrestrained scope the athenians gave to ridicule when they could suffer the most illustrious personages of their state their generals and their magistrates cleon lamachus nicias alcibiades not to mention socrates the philosopher and euripides the poet to be publicly made the subject of comedy several of aristophaness plays are wholly political satires upon public management and the conduct of generals and statesmen during the peleponnesian war they are so full of political allegories and allusions that it is impossible to understand them without a considerable knowledge of the history of those times they abound too with parodies of the great tragic poets particularly of euripides to whom the author was a great enemy and has written two comedies almost wholly in order to ridicule him  vivacity satire and buffoonry are the characteristics of aristophanes genius and force he displays upon many occasions but his performances upon the whole are not calculated to give us any high opinion of the attic taste of wit in this age they seem indeed to have been composed for the mob the ridicule employed in them is extravagant the wit for the most part buffoonish and farcical the personal raillery biting and cruel and the obscenity that reigns in them is gross and intolerable the treatment given by this comedian to socrates the philosopher in his play of the clouds is well known but however it might tend to disparage socrates in the public esteem p brumoy in his theater grec makes it appear that it could not have been as is commonly supposed the cause of decreeing the death of that philosopher which did not happen till twentythree years after the representation of aristophaness clouds there is a chorus in aristophaness plays but altogether of an irregular kind it is partly serious partly comic sometimes mingles in the action sometimes addresses the spectators defends the author and attacks his enemies  soon after the days of aristophanes the liberty of attacking persons on the stage by name being found of dangerous consequence to the public peace was prohibited by law the chorus also was at this period banished from the comic theater as having been an instrument of too much license and abuse then what is called the middle comedy took rise which was no other than an elusion of the law fictitious names indeed were employed but living persons were still attacked and described in such a manner as to be sufficiently known of these comic pieces we have no remains to them succeeded the new comedy when the stage being obliged to desist wholly from personal ridicule became what it is now the picture of manners and characters but not of particular persons menander was the most distinguished author of this kind among the greeks and both from the imitations of him by terence and the account given of him by plutarch we have much reason to regret that his writings have perished as he appears to have reformed in a very high degree the public taste and to have set the model of correct elegant and moral comedy  the only remains which we now have of the new comedy among the ancients are the plays of plautus and terence both of whom were formed upon the greek writers plautus is distinguished for very expressive language and a great degree of the vis comica as he wrote in an early period he bears several marks of the rudeness of the dramatic art among the romans in his time he opens his plays with prologues which sometimes preoccupy the subject of the whole piece the representation too and the action of the comedy are sometimes confounded the actor departing from his character and addressing the audience there is too much low wit and scurrility in plautus too much of quaint conceit and play upon words but withal he displays more variety and more force than terence his characters are always strongly marked though sometimes coarsely his amphytrion has been copied both by moliere and by dryden and his miser also in the aulularia is the foundation of a capital play of molieres which has been once and again imitated on the english stage than terence nothing can be more delicate more polished and elegant his style is a model of the purest and most graceful latinity his dialogue is always decent and correct and he possesses beyond most writers the art of relating with that beautiful picturesque simplicity which never fails to please his morality is in general unexceptionable the situations which he introduces are often tender and interesting and many of his sentiments touch the heart hence he may be considered as the founder of that serious comedy which has of late years been revived and of which i shall have occasion afterward to speak if he fails in any thing it is in sprightliness and strength both in his characters and in his plots there is too much sameness and uniformity throughout all his plays he copied menander and is said not to have equalled him julius caefar has given us his opinion of terence in the following lines which are preserved in the life of terence ascribed to suetonius tu quoque tu in summis o dimidiate menander poneris et merito puri sermonis amator lenibus atque utinam scriptis adjuncta foret vis comica ut aequato virtus polleret honor cum graecis neque in hac despectus part jaceres unum hoc macerer et doleo tibi deesse terenti   in order to form a perfect comic author an union would be requisite of the spirit and fire of plautus with the grace and correctness of terence  when we enter on the view of modern comedy one of the first objects which presents itself is the spanish theater which has been remarkably fertile in dramatic productions lopez de vega guillin and calderon are the chief spanish comedians lopez de vega who is by much the most famous of them is said to have written above a thousand plays and our surprise at the number of his productions will be diminished by being informed of their nature from the account which m perron de castera a french writer gives of them it would seem that our shakespeare is perfectly a regular and methodical author in comparison of lopez he throws aside all regard to the three unities or to any of the established forms of dramatic writing one play often includes many years nay the whole life of a man the scene during the first act is laid in spain the next in italy and the third in africa his plays are mostly of the historical kind founded on the annals of the country and they are generally a sort of tragicomedies or a mixture of heroic speeches serious incidents war and slaughter with much ridicule and buffoonry angels and gods virtues and vices christian religion and pagan mythology are all frequently jumbled together in short they are plays like no other dramatic compositions full of the romantic and extravagant at the same time it is generally admitted that in the works of lopez de vega there are frequent marks of genius and much force of imagination many well drawn characters many happy situations many striking and interesting surprises and from the source of his rich invention the dramatic writers of other countries are said to have frequently drawn their materials he himself apologizes for the extreme irregularity of his composition from the prevailing taste of his countrymen who delighted in a variety of events in strange and surprising adventures and a labyrinth of intrigues much more than in a natural and regularly conducted story  the general characters of the french comic theater are that it is correct chaste and decent several writers of considerable note it has produced such as regnard dufresny dancourt and marivaux but the dramatic author in whom the french glory most and whom they justly place at the head of all their comedians is the famous moliere there is indeed no author in all the fruitful and distinguished age of louis xiv who has attained a higher reputation than moliere or who has more nearly reached the summit of perfection in his own art according to the judgment of all the french critics voltaire boldly pronounces him to be the most eminent comic poet of any age or country nor perhaps is this the decision of mere partiality for taking him upon the whole i know none who deserves to be preferred to him moliere is always the satirist only of vice or folly he has selected a great variety of ridiculous characters peculiar to the times in which he lived and he has generally placed the ridicule justly he possessed strong comic powers he is full of mirth and pleasantry and his pleasantry is always innocent his comedies in verse such as the misanthrope and tartuffe are a kind of dignified comedy in which vice is exposed in the style of elegant and polite satire in his prose comedies though there is abundance of ridicule yet there is never any thing found to offend a modest ear or to throw contempt on sobriety and virtue together with those high qualities moliere has also some defects which voltaire though his professed panegyrist heartily admits he is acknowledged not to be happy in the unravelling of his plots attentive more to the strong exhibition of characters than to the conduct of the intrigue his unravelling is frequently brought on with too little preparation and in an improbable manner in his verse comedies he is sometimes not sufficiently interesting and too full of long speeches and in his more risible pieces in prose he is censured for being too farcical few writers however if any ever possessed the spirit or attained the true end of comedy so perfectly upon the whole as moliere his tartuffe in the style of grave comedy and his avare in the gay are accounted his two capital productions  from the english theater we are naturally led to expect a great variety of original characters in comedy and bolder strokes of wit and humor than are to be found on any other modern stage humor is in a great measure the peculiar province of the english nation the nature of such a free government as ours and that unrestrained liberty which our manners allow to every man of living entirely after his own taste afford full scope to the display of singularity of character and to the indulgence of humor in all its forms whereas in france the influence of a despotic court the more established subordination of ranks and the universal observance of the forms of politeness and decorum spread a much greater uniformity over the outward behavior and characters of men hence comedy has a more ample field and can flow with a much freer vein in britain than in france but it is extremely unfortunate that together with the freedom and boldness of the comic spirit in britain there should have been joined such a spirit of indecency and licentiousness as has disgraced english comedy beyond that of any nation since the days of aristophanes  the first age however of english comedy was not infected by this spirit neither the plays of shakespeare nor those of ben johnson can be accused of immoral tendency shakespeares general character which i gave in the last lecture appears with as great advantage in his comedies as in his tragedies a strong fertile and creative genius irregular in conduct employed too often in amusing the mob but singularly rich and happy in the description of characters and manners johnson is more regular in the conduct of his pieces but stiff and pedantic though not destitute of dramatic genius in the plays of beaumont and fletcher much fancy and invention appear and several beautiful passages may be found but in general they abound with romantic and improbable incidents with overcharged and unnatural characters and with coarse and gross allusions those comedies of the last age by the change of public manners and of the turn of conversation since their time are now become too obsolete to be very agreeable for we must observe that comedy depending much on the prevailing modes of external behavior becomes sooner antiquated than any other species of writing and when antiquated it seems harsh to us and loses its power of pleasing this is especially the case with respect to the comedies of our own country where the change of manners is more sensible and striking than in any foreign production in our country the present mode of behavior is always the standard of politeness and whatever departs from it appears uncouth whereas in the writings of foreigners we are less acquainted with any standard of this kind and of course are less hurt by the want of it plautus appeared more antiquated to the romans in the age of augustus than he does now to us it is a high proof of shakespeares uncommon genius that notwithstanding these disadvantages his character of falstaff is to this day admired and his merry wives of windsor read with pleasure  it was not till the era of the restoration of king charles ii that the licentiousness which was observed at that period to infect the court and the nation in general seized in a peculiar manner upon comedy as its province and for almost a whole century retained possession of it it was then first that the rake became the predominant character and with some exceptions the hero of every comedy the ridicule was thrown not upon vice and folly but much more commonly upon chastity and sobriety at the end of the play indeed the rake is commonly in appearance reformed and professes that he is to become a sober man but throughout the play he is set up as the model of a fine gentleman and the agreeable impression made by a sort of sprightly licentiousness is left upon the imagination as a picture of the pleasurable enjoyment of life while the reformation passes slightly away as a matter of form merely to what sort of moral conduct such public entertainments as these tend to form the youth of both sexes may be easily imagined yet this has been the spirit which has prevailed upon the comic stage of great britain not only during the reign of charles ii but throughout the reigns of king william and queen anne and down to the days of king george ii  dryden was the first considerable dramatic writer after the restoration in whose comedies as in all his works there are found many strokes of genius mixed with great carelessness and visible marks of hasty composition as he sought to please only he went along with the manners of the times and has carried through all his comedies that vein of dissolute licentiousness which was then fashionable in some of them the indecency was so gross as to occasion even in that age a prohibition of being brought upon the stage the mirth which he excites in comedy will perhaps be found not so much to arise from any original humor or peculiarity of character nicely distinguished and diligently pursued as from incidents and circumstances artifices and surprises from jests of action rather than sentiment what he had of humorous or passionate he seems to have had not from nature but from other poets if not always a plagiary yet at least an imitator johnsons life of dryden   since his time the writers of comedy of greatest note have been cibber vanburgh farquhar and congreve cibber has written a great many comedies and though in several of them there be much sprightliness and a certain pert vivacity peculiar to him yet they are so forced and unnatural in the incidents as to have generally sunk into obscurity except two which have always continued in high favor with the public the careless husband and the provoked husband the former is remarkable for the polite and easy turn of the dialogue and with the exception of one indelicate scene is tolerably moral too in the conduct and in the tendency the latter the provoked husband which was the joint production of vanburgh and cibber is perhaps on the whole the best comedy in the english language it is liable indeed to one critical objection of having a double plot as the incidents of the wronghead family and those of lord townlys are separate and independent of each other but this irregularity is compensated by the natural characters the fine painting and happy strokes of humor with which it abounds we are indeed surprised to find so unexceptionable a comedy proceeding from two such loose authors for in its general strain it is calculated to expose licentiousness and folly and would do honor to any stage  sir john vanburgh has spirit wit and ease but he is to the last degree gross and indelicate he is one of the most immoral of all our comedians his provoked wife is full of such indecent sentiments and allusions as ought to explode it out of all reputable society his relapse is equally censurable and these are his only two considerable pieces congreve is unquestionably a writer of genius he is lively witty and sparkling full of character and full of action his chief fault as a comic writer is that he overflows with wit it is often introduced unseasonably and almost every where there is too great a proportion of it for natural wellbred conversation dr johnson says of him in his life that his personages are a kind of intellectual gladiators every sentence is to ward or to strike the contest of smartness is never intermitted his wit is a meteor playing to and fro with alternate corruscations  farquhar is a light and gay writer less correct and less sparkling than congreve but he has more ease and perhaps fully as great a share of the vis comica the two best and least exceptionable of his plays are the recruiting officer and the beaux stratagem i say the least exceptionable for in general the tendency of both congreve and farquhars plays is immoral throughout them all the rake the loose intrigue and the life of licentiousness are the objects continually held up to view as if the assemblies of a great and polished nation could be amused with none but vicious objects the indelicacy of these writers in the female characters which they introduce is particularly remarkable nothing can be more awkward than their representations of a woman of virtue and honor indeed there are hardly any female characters in their plays except two women of loose principles or women of affected manners when they attempt to draw a character of virtue  the censure which i have now passed upon these celebrated comedians is far from being overstrained or severe accustomed to the indelicacy of our own comedy and amused with the wit and humor of it its immorality too easily escapes our observation but all foreigners the french especially who are accustomed to a better regulated and more decent stage speak of it with surprise and astonishment voltaire who is assuredly none of the most austere moralists plumes himself not a little upon the superior bienseance of the french theater and says that the language of english comedy is the language of debauchery not of politeness m moralt in his letters upon the french and english nations ascribes the corruption of manners in london to comedy as its chief cause their comedy he says is like that of no other country it is the school in which the youth of both sexes familiarise themselves with vice which is never represented there as vice but as mere gaiety as for comedies says the ingenious m diderot in his observations upon dramatic poetry the english have none they have in their place satires full indeed of gaiety and force but without morals and without taste sans moeurs et sans gout there is no wonder therefore that lord kaims in his elements of criticism should have expressed himself upon this subject of the indelicacy of english comedy in terms much stronger than any that i have used concluding his invective against it in these words how odious ought those writers to be who thus spread infection through their native country employing the talents which they have received from their maker most traitorously against himself by endeavoring to corrupt and disfigure his creatures if the comedies of congreve did not rack him with remorse in his last moments he must have been lost to all sense of virtue vol ii      i am happy however to have it in my power to observe that of late years a sensible reformation has begun to take place in english comedy we have at last become ashamed of making our public entertainments rest wholly upon profligate characters and scenes and our later comedies of any reputation are much purified from the licentiousness of former times if they have not the spirit the ease and the wit of congreve and farquhar in which respect they must be confessed to be somewhat deficient this praise however they justly merit of being innocent and moral  for this reformation we are questionless much indebted to the french theater which has not only been at all times more chaste and inoffensive than ours but has within these few years produced a species of comedy of still a graver turn than any that i have yet mentioned this which is called the serious or tender comedy and was termed by its opposers la comedy larmoyante is not altogether a modern invention several of terences plays as the andria in particular partake of this character and as we know that terence copied menander we have sufficient reason to believe that his comedies also were of the same kind the nature of this composition does not by any means exclude gaiety and ridicule but it lays the chief stress upon tender and interesting situations it aims at being sentimental and touching the heart by means of the capital incidents it makes our pleasure arise not so much from the laughter which it excites as from the tears of affection and joy which it draws forth  in english steeles conscious lovers is a comedy which approaches to this character and it has always been favorably received by the public in french there are several dramatic compositions of this kind which possess considerable merit and reputation such as the melanide and prejuge a la mode of la chaussee the pere de famille of diderot the cenie of mad graffigny and the nanine and lenfant prodigue of voltaire  when this form of comedy first appeared in france it excited a great controversy among the critics it was objected to as a dangerous and unjustifiable innovation in composition it is not comedy said they for it is not founded on laughter and ridicule it is not tragedy for it does not involve us in sorrow by what name then can it be called or what pretensions has it to be comprehended under dramatic writing but this was trifling in the most egregious manner with critical names and distinctions as if these had invariably fixed the essence and ascertained the limits of every sort of composition assuredly it is not necessary that all comedies should be formed on one precise model some may be entirely light and gay others may incline more to the serious some may partake of both and all of them properly executed may furnish agreeable and useful entertainment to the public by suiting the different tastes of men il y a beaucoup de tres bonnes pieces ou il ne regne que de la gayete dautres toutes serieuses dautres melangees dautres ou lattendrissement va jusqaux larmes il ne faut donner exclusion a aucune genre and si lon me demandoit quel genre est le meilleur je repondrois celui qui est le mieux traite voltaire  serious and tender comedy has no title to claim to itself the possession of the stage to the exclusion of ridicule and gaiety but when it retains only its proper place without usurping the province of any other when it is carried on with resemblance to real life and without introducing romantic and unnatural situations it may certainly prove both an interesting and an agreeable species of dramatic writing if it become insipid and drawling this must be imputed to the fault of the author not to the nature of the composition which may admit much liveliness and vivacity  in general whatever form comedy assumes whether gay or serious it may always be esteemed a mark of society advancing in true politeness when those theatrical exhibitions which are designed for public amusement are cleared from indelicate sentiment or immoral tendency though the licentious buffoonery of aristophanes amused the greeks for a while they advanced by degrees to a chaster and juster taste and the like progress of refinement may be concluded to take place among us when the public receive with favor dramatic compositions of such a strain and spirit as entertained
