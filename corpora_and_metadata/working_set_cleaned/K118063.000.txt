hold up not arrogantly to provoke my trial but merely as a petitioner for a patient hearing  by all the laws of laughing every man has an undoubted right to play the fool with himself under that license this exhibition is attempted  good wine needs no bush  the bad deserves none if what i have to offer meets with your approbation you will applaud it if otherwise it will meet with the contempt it deserves  some of these heads are manufactured in wood and others in pasteboard to denote that there are not only blockheads but paper sculls  this is one of those extraordinary personages called conquerors he was called alexander the great from the great number of people his ambition had cut to pieces he was a most dexterous slaughterman and thought mankind only made for him to cut away with he was a great hero warrior and mankiller  formerly and  this is the head of a cherokee chief called sachemswampumscalpo tomahauk  he was a great hero warrior and mankiller  lately and  this is the head of a quackdoctor  a greater mankiller than either of the other two this head of the quack doctor is exhibited to show the weakness of wisdom and the strength of folly for if wisdom was not very weak would such fellows as carmen cobblers and porters be permitted to vend their unwholesome mixtures under letters patent  and if folly was not too strong would any body swallow their compositions  the madness of alexander this head made him a conqueror  the folly of the town dubbed the quackdoctor this a doctor  the exploits of alexander are celebrated by half the great writers of the age and yet this alexander was nothing more than a murderer and a madman who ran from one end of the world to the other seeking whom he might cut to pieces  and cherokee chief this coppercomplexioned hero wants nothing to make him as great as alexander but the rust of antiquity to varnish over his crimes and the pens of writers to illustrate his actions  the quackdoctor is his own historian and publishes in the daily advertiser and gazetteer accounts of cures never performed and copies of affidavits never sworn to  here is the quackdoctors coat of arms three ducks proper and quack quack quack for the motto  it is charged round with deaths heads and by way of crest a number of quack puffs and bills of mortality  it was made up for him by the worshipful company of undertakers and presented to him by the sextons and gravediggers to denote that these people look upon quackdoctors as their greatest benefactors  the ornaments of the head of a cuckold this head are not for what the wearer has done on the contrary he bears about him the constant memorial of the faults of others and is by the illjudging part of the world condemned for crimes he could not commit and the very commission of which constitute all his unhappiness these horns like the cornucopia of the ancients signify plenty and denote that this head has abundance of brethren in affliction they are gilt to show that there are wretches base enough to accept the wages of dishonor even in a point the most delicate  this brass buckshead we all well know is made use of both in public and private houses nor had it been made in this shape but to accustom mankind not only to the sight of horns but to the use of hanging their hats upon them  from the ancient custom of adorning the temple came the modern custom of embellishing the whole head hence arose the wig manufactory  the consequence of which we shall endeavor to illustrate  a counsellors head here is a head and only a head a plain simple naked unimbellished appearance which in its present situation conveys to us no other idea than that of a bruiser preparing to fight at broughtons behold how naked how simple a thing nature is but behold how luxuriant is a large tie wig upon the head art what importance is now seated on these brows what reverence the features demand what dignity is diffused on the whole countenance  this is a compendium of the law  special pleadings in the foretop pleas rejoinders replications and demurs in each turn of the head  the knotty points of practice in the twist of the tail  the depth of the full bottom denotes the length of a chancery suit while the black coif at top like a blister plaster seems to tell us that the law is a great irritator and never to be used but in very desperate cases  but as it is not enough to suppose a resemblance and as we have more blocks than one to try our wigs upon we will make an exchange and attempt an oration in praise of the law  law law law is like a fine womans temper  a very difficult study  law law is like a book of surgery  a great many terrible cases in it  law it is like fire and water very good servants but very bad when they get the upper hand of us  it is like a homely genteel woman very well to follow  it is also like a scolding wife very bad when it follows us  and again it is like bad weather most people choose to keep out of it  in law in law there are four parts the quid libet the quod libet the quid pro quo and the sine qua non  imprimis the quid libet or who began first because in all actions of assault the law is clear that primus strokus is absolutus malus sine jokus which being elegantly and classically rendered into english is that whosoever he be that gave the first stroke it was absolute ill and without a joke  secondly the quod libet or the damages but that the law has nothing to do with only to state them for whatever damages ensue they are all the clients perquisites according to that ancient norman motto  if he is cast or castandum he is semper idem ruinandum  thirdly the quid pro quo feeing council  giving words for money or having money for words according to that ancient norman motto si curat lex  we live to perplex  fourthly the sina qua non or without something what would any thing be good for without this wig what would the outlines of the law be good for  i shall illustrate this by a case in point peer williams p    daniel against dishclout  plaintiff daniel was groom in the same family where defendant dishclout was cook plaintiff daniel had been drinking or as dr bibbibus has it in his dissertation on bumpers he was homo duplicans that is he was a double man he was not as he should be ipse he but as he should not be tipse he  plaintiff daniel made a forcible entry on the cooks premises the kitchen  now the kitchen according to sergeant plodding as he has it in his    th vol folio of the abridgement of the statures page      there he says that the kitchen is camera necessaria in usu cookeraro where she has the overlooking the conduct the management the supervising the feeing to the superintendance and the speculation of all the sauspannis slewpannis frienpannis et stovis smoke jacko and where our cook was at this time employed in all the duties of her office where she was roastandum boilandum fyrandum frigaseyandum et plumb pludding magnum mixandum at this time plaintiff daniel made a forcible entry etc and demanded a sop in the pan defendant dishclout insisted on her right of refusal  a sop in the pan gemmen is a very serious thing and without perquisites what are all honors and places good for nothing more than an embroidered button hole and if we consider a minister of state as the nations cook then perquisites are the sop in the pan to the minister of state with which omnium gatherum choose to grease their fingers  well plaintiff daniel demanded a sop in the pan defendant dishclout insisted on a right of refusal daniel seized dishclout by the left hand there was the quid libet or the assault dishclout took daniel by the right hand and pulled him into the dripping pan there was the damages  the dripping pan  now if the drippingpan had not been there he could not have fallen into the dripping pan and if he had not been there the dripping pan could not have received him and this is law and the loquaciousness of the law is multi loquacious forasmuch nevertheless likewise moreover and also  the liberty of the law is the happiness of the english and it is very happy for us englishmen that we have the liberty to go to law  here is a wig as stiff as if chisseled out of a stone by a cutter and as unnatural as chinese ornaments and yet these wigs and the wearers of them too are in fashion in some parts of the town and thus plaistered like the top of a cabbage plant after a shower of snow it is called the journeymans jemmy and  this is sir languish lispy these creatures adorn the outside of their heads to attack ladies hearts and they are promoted to places in he service of the ladies in proportion to their respective merits they are teacup carriers fan bearers and snuff box holders this is the he at the one end of the down and this is the he at the other end of the town it would perhaps give pain to any one of this audience to have such a pomatum cake pasted to their heads but the extreme delicate creatures these represent seldom make any other use of their heads than to have their hair or wigs dressed upon them they smile and simper they ogle they admire every lady and every lady alike nay they copy the manners of the ladies so closely that grammarians are at a loss whether to rank them with the masculine or feminine and therefore put them down as the doubtful gender  these wigs from the quantity of powder that is lavished upon them are called ammunition caxons and thus sweetened over like the sugar at the top of a twelf cake may seem to denote that the wearers must needs be very sweet fellows  here is a full frizzel bob  the wearer of this wig looks like an ostrich in a fright as if he had run his head into a bush and brought it away with him about his ars  wigs may be considered as bearing great analogy to books this then will be an huge quarto in large paper as this is a duodecimo in small print and belongs to mr donefirst the long oddslayer and here is his man cross and jostle in sweated down to ride a sweepstakes and thus dressed in true turf taste they are called a brace of knowing ones  the head of a horse jockey and a jockeys horse may be said to have great affinity because the jockeys head can pull the horses head on which side the post he pleases but what sort of heads must those people have who know these things are done and yet trust their capitals with such sinking funds but we shall forbear to say any more on this head for fear of offending those high personages who choose to resemble grooms and horse jockeys  a conversation should have been formed for these heads and they should have talked on various subjects such as politics religion and cold cream eau de luce lavender water demyreps and french chicken gloves but as all that has been said is to no purpose and as least said is soonest mended and as those that say nothing cannot be blamed for speaking we have chosen to exhibit these capitals as mutes and hope the audience will not take offense at it  some heads are mute because they have nothing to say some should be mute because they say nothing to the purpose some men say nothing at all to their wives and some married men would be extremely happy if their wives said nothing at all to them  this is nobodys head or the head of nobody because thus adorned with the fools cap nobody chooses to own it  historians have left us in the dark with respect to these long eared bonnets but it is however supposed that the first who wore them was judge midas who had the inimitable art of turning every thing he touched into gold and now touch some people with gold and you may make any thing of them money getting consisting in the art of making fools or of properly suffering ourselves to be made fools of  life is said to be a lottery and folly concerned in the chances  now let us see if this fools cap has any prizes  this may appear as a satyr against card playing but it is not a just one on the contrary most card players are said to belong to four knaves held up this family and generally bear their name they are called court cards because when turned up trumps they become honors  which shows if you deal fairly you may gain honors and that often honors or no honors depend entirely on a shuffle  this crest belongs to those easy kind of mortals who are said to be nobodys enemy but their own they are divided into three classes there are your generous fellows  your honest fellows  and your devilish clever sellows  as to your generous fellow he is treat master you honest fellow he is toast master you devilish clever fellow he is singing master who is to keep the company alive for four or five hours and then your devilish honest fellow is to drink them all dead  they married into follys family and got this crest  the fools cap  and which to this day nobody chooses to be known by  if you ask why we so frequently use the term nothing let this serve as a reason from ten to twenty we go to school to learn what from twenty to thirty we are strangely apt to forget from thirty to forty we think things must needs be as we would have them from forty to fifty we find ourselves a little out in our reckoning and from fifty to sixty upon casting up lifes debtor and creditor we find a board held up with a parcel of noughts this the certain balance  these are a number of nothings which in their present state have no power or consequence yet by the addition of one they take rank and precedence immediately which shows that in life as well as arithmetic nothing may be turned into something by the assistance of any one lord of a golden manor take away the one and they are nothing again  to nothing we must all come happy they who amidst the variations of nothing have done nothing to be ashamed of if they have nothing to fear they have every thing to hope  thus ends the dissertation on nothing which the exhibitor hopes he has properly executed  by making nothing of it  from the dissertation on nothing we come to nobodys genealogical tables  this is nobodys crest because whoever this may suit nobody cares to own it  this is somebodys crest a screen because in all political disputes somebody is supposed to be behind the screen  this coat of legs and arms belongs to those easy kind of mortals who are always throwing their legs and arms about em restless every where at home no where how they live nobody knows and how they die nobody cares however insignificant this may appear yet that is of no small importance for the moment a man begins to fancy himself something he assumes a big look we have therefore given him a big belly with a vast corporation as for the absent members let them be thus made out let the mayor be the head the two sheriffs the arms as they execute the law the aldermen the legs as they support the chair and as to the eyes nose mouth etc why let them be composed of a committee of common councilmen and so the corporation is made out  this is any bodys coat of arms the shield is blank a blank for the crest it being as easy nowadays to buy a coat of arms as any other coat  the heralds office is the true monmouthstreet in the parish of pedigree it is honors piece brokers shop where every remnant of reputation is to be purchased it should seem as if the heralds office had the virtue of medeas kettle where every plebeian vulgarity is boiled away and out they come spick and span new gentlefolks  this is every bodys coat of arms  a bag of money and hands catching at it money reaping being mankinds universal harvest work we have given a deaths head to every bodys coat of arms being the exact likeness of every body drawn after the life  it may seem strange that we should exhibit such terms as esteem generosity friendship gratitude public spirit and common sense as belonging to nobodys family but the truth is that these fine qualifications have been so ill used that nobody cared to own them the consequence of which was that they were ordered into the workhouse but the parish officers unanimously agreed that they should have no admittance there mr overseer standing up and saying that as how  in the first place imprimis first of all and foremost  gemmen of the westry why what business have we with friendship i take it that as how the best friend a man has is a mans own money in a mans own pocket and friendship is nothing more or less as i take it in the whole versal world but to borrow a mans money out of a mans pocket i come now to your gratitudes and i take your gratitudes to be a sort of a foreign lingo which we english folk have nothing at all to do with to be sure there was such a person when doasyouwouldbedoneby was member of parliament and ye know gemmen of the westry since self interest was made receiver general gratitude has been turned out of the county  mr head borough slowly rising from his chair and gravely snuffing the candle begged leave to be hard  and he said that as how whereof and wherefore not so much for the saying of the thing as thof it should be said though to be sure no man should be sartain sure of his own judgment yet for his part now as to your generosity he looks upon it to be a sort of a something of a foreign plant and we have nothing to do with it  and as to your public spirit why ye know gemmen of the westry i need not tell you that is nothing more than a license for publicans to fell spirituous liquors and as to your esteem wh  y some people esteem brandy punch and some people esteem rum punch for my part give me a little sup of your rum punch and if i was the people of jamaica if the people of england would not drink rum punch why they should have no turtle and then they would all be starved and  now gemmen of the westry i come to my imprimis third and last and that is your common sense if i may be allowed to speak my reflections about it i look upon it to be too common and too vulgar a thing for the gemmen of the westry to trouble their heads with or be consarned about  all these fine qualifications must have perished in oblivion had not chance recommended them to the family of ostentation here is the lady of ostentations manor her name was vanity she had a sister named wit who ran away with judgment the house steward from which two was begat genius but as it is very common to use genius ill so she suffered many and great hardships till at length she was reduced to so low an ebb as to be obliged to lodge in a garret with the poet oblivion and his mother necessity in process of time judgment her father found her out and promoted a marriage between genius and science and from that marriage were produced these five sine children architecture painting poetry astronomy and music but the disturbance at that time between the goths and the vandals having overturned the temples of the arts and sciences these scientifics took shipping and a storm arising at sea they were shipwrecked on the inhospitable coast of sussex where after being plundered of their wearing apparel they were left to starve by the inhumanity of the country people the reason why our sea side savages may rob and plunder shipwrecked passengers with impunity is owing to a defect in the game act which was made for the preservation of the game all over england the gentlemen who drew up that act forgetting to make men women and children game though it is so common nowadays to make game of men women and children they begged their way up to london on foot where they were in hopes that the merit of their works would recommend them poor creatures it is a sign they knew very little of the world to imagine any such thing however to prevent starving architecture turned bricklayers labourer to a chinese builder painting was a grinder of colors to a paper stainer poetry turned printers devil music sung ballads about the streets and astronomy cried almanacks in some little time lady fashion found them out and as soon as lady fashion found them out all the world ran mad for their company  this is a most curious exhibition and very likely to make the learned look about them for as there is no mark or sign to discover what it is it is a sure proof of it is being a genuine antique  it may for ought we know be a king solomon or queen samerimis an old venus or a new nabob a methodist preacher or a bottle conjuror it was intended to place the face of probability upon it but that motion was soon laid aside as people in our days are only fond of improbabilities at length a part of the bronze or plaster being rubbed off a letter was discovered by which it appeared to be the remains of the statue of honesty thus mauled and mutilated by the various inroads that had been made upon it  imagine not spectators that this bust of honesty is exhibited as if the real face would be a stranger to any one of this company  no  she is only shown here emblematically the meaning of which is that the manners of the times are such as may put honesty out of countenance  not as a companion but as a contrast to the head of honesty is  this the head of flattery exhibited the ancients had days they called white or lucky days thus it is wiith flattery to the fortunate she turns her white her shining side to the unfortunate she is ever in eclipse upon the approach of any ill fortune flattery generally turns into reproach the meaning of which is that it is a reproach to our understandings to suffer flattery yet we continue to accept the injury though we despise the hand that offers it not remembering that the receiver is as bad as the thief  this being flattery was begot on poverty by wit which is the reason why poor wits are generally the greatest flatterers  this flattery was employed by the princes of the earth to carry their congratulations one to another but being at a certain time dispatched by the dutch with a card of compliments to the hottentots the ship she went in was taken by a pyrate the captain of which fell in love flattery left off the sea for her sake took an inn set up and made flattery his barkeeper a gentleman arriving in those parts in pursuit of an heiress and having tried all efforts in vain at last purchased flattery of the innkeeper and by her means gained the lady but to see the ingratitude of man kind he had not been married a fortnight before he kicked flattery out of doors and from that time to this she has had no settled place of abode but is usually to be found at the beginning of courtship and at the latter end of a petition this being flattery was the occasion of the very first duel that ever was fought she was placed at the top of a pyramid in the middle of an highway where four roads met two knights adventurers the one from the north and the other from the south arrived at the pyramid at the same instant the hero from the south who saw this white side said it was a shame that a white a silver profile should be trusted on the highway side the hero from the north who only saw this said  a white a silver profile why it is a black one flat contradictions produced fatal demonstrations their swords flew out and they cut and hewed one another in a most unmerciful manner till fainting with the loss of blood they both fell down each on the opposite side to that on which the combat begun when looking up too late they belield their mistake at this instant a venerable hermit coming by boundup their wounds and replaced them on their horses giving them this piece of friendly advice that hence forward in all political disputes and matters of a public nature never to trust themselves till they had examined both sides of the question  part ii in the first part of this lecture we considered mens heads in this second part we shall consider the head dress of the fine ladies for as the world is round and the world turns round and every thing turns round with it so no lunar or sublunar revolution has caused greater alteration in the affairs of men than has from time to time take place in the head dresses of the ladies  from the egyptians from whom we derive all our arts and sciences philosophy and fashions our good dames of antiquity seem to have borrowed this ridinghood behold the ridinghood how the lappets fall down the side of the face like the lappets on the side of the face of the egyptian mummy or like the cumbrous foliages of the fullbottomd peruke but our ancestors disliking the use of these fullbottoms contrived a method of tying up their wigs behind hence the origin of tyewigs  the ladies too not to be behindhand with the gentlemen in their fashions contrived a way to tie up their tails too and from the ridinghood they tucked up their tails and formed the ranelaghhood as for example  this is the hood in high taste at the lower end of the town and while this is wore by lady mary lady betty lady susan and women of great distinction this is wore by plain moll and bess and sue and women without any distinction at all this is the invariable mode or headdress of those ladies who used to supply the court end of the town with sea dainties before land carriage for fish came into fashion and there is not more difference between the head dress of these ladies than in their mode of conversation for while these fine ladies are continually making inroads upon their mother tongue and clipping polysyllables into monosyllables as when they tell us they caant and they shaant and they maant these coarse ladies make ample amends for their deficiency by the addition of supernumerary syllables when they talk of breakfastes and toasteses and running their fisteses against the posteses  these are the ancient laughing and crying philosophers perpetual presidents of the noble and venerable orders of the groaners and the grinners this the president of the dismal faction is always crying for fear the world should not last his time out  this the member of the choice spirits egad he dont care whether it does or not this laughs at the times this cries at the times and this blackguards the times and thus the times are generally handled old people praise the times past which they neglected to use when they might young people look forward with anxious care to the time to come neglecting the present and almost all people treat the present times as some folks do their wives  with indifference because they may possess them  this was the fashionable mode or head dress in the times of our forefathers and foremothers when a member of parliaments wife was jogged up to town once a year behind john just to see my lord mayors show and have her gown cut to the court fashion and then with her pillion new stuffed and her lap crammed with confectionary she was hoisted back again as fine as a gingerbread stall upon a fair day from minervas helmet the ladies seem to have taken the custom of wearing bonnets the pompoon or egret from the half moon that encircled the temple of diana  from the ancients too came this custom of giving lectures juno that termagant of antiquity being the first who ever gave her husband a lecture and which from the place where it was delivered was called a curtain lecture and philosophers are of opinion that these curtain lectures are not yet entirely out of fashion  homer the historian from whom all these facts are taken relates great things of the zone or girdle of venus  and to it he ascribes great virtue he says that whatever lady wears venuss girdle will infallibly possess the beauties of venus now ladies i have that very girdle mentioned by homer and every lady will look lovely as long as she chooses to appear in it good temper   this is a real antique the morning head dress of that celebrated demirep of antiquity cleopatra this is what astronomers call the night rain or shrouding the moon in a cloud and to this day the ladies of edinburgh when they go abroad in the morning fold a tarpin about their heads or as they express it they heep their heeds about in played but our ladies in the south disliking so cumbrous a fashion and imagining that something whimsically like it might be the invention of a new fashion invented this french night cap or cheek wrapper a lady in this dress looks hooded like a horse with eyeflaps  to keep them from looking one way or the other and perhaps that is the reason why most ladies in our days choose to look forward one would imagine that this cap was invented by some surly duana or illnatured guardian who being past the relish of beauty themselves would deny even the fight of it to the rest of mankind  since we are on the subject of ladies faces permit me a word on the pernicious practice of face painting or rubbing of rouge and white wash on the complexion women of the town may be allowed the use of paint because the dexterity of their profession like that of pirates consists in fighting under false colors but for the delicate the unculpable part of the sex to paint looks as if they would fish for lovers as men do for mackrel  by hanging something red upon the hook or as if they thought men were generally of the bull and turkey cock kind and would sly at any thing scarlet exercise is the best face painter innocence the best giver of complexion there is however a certain period in life among the ladies no less an enemy to the face than the custom of face painting it is called antiquated virginity when elderly unmarried ladies are supposed to be condemned to lead apes about because when they were young and handsome they made monkies of mankind shakespeare has beautifully described the difference of the two states in these few lines thus but earthly happier is the rose distilled than that which withering on the virgin thorn lives grows and dies in single blessedness   we have here two heads taken from these lines of shakespeare this is the married rose and this is that withering on the virgin thorn disappointments bring on wrinkles the wrinkles therefore of this face are no cause for wonder the best wines if kept too long will turn to vinegar but as this subject seems to grow serious well dismiss it with a wish may each married lady preserve her good man and the young ones get good ones as soon as they can   not to be partial to either sex this is exhibited as the head of an old bachelor these old batchelors are mere bullies in love continually abusing matrimony without daring to accept the challenge they tell ye if they were married their wives should not go abroad when they please the children should never cry the men should not kiss the maids o they would do mighty matters but these lionlike talkers abroad are mere baalambs at home and continually under subjection to some termagant of a mistress who makes them amply repay to her insolence the contempt in which they pretend to have held the worthier part of the sex as a punishment for their infidelity when they are old and superannuated they set up for suitors they ogle through spectacles and they sing love songs with catarrhs by way of symphony this laced coat solitaire and bag wig show what he would be and this fools cap what he is  as this is an head in ancient primitive simplicity so here is an head in modern simplicity and belongs to a lass of the spirit usually called a quaker and  this is the head of one moved by the spirit he wears this large umbrella like covering to keep off the outer light to strengthen the light within as this is the hat of one moved by the spirit so  this is a hat in the true spirit of the mode this is a niverne or a nivernoise or a nivernoise or a never enough it is all the same in the greek a fellow with such a hat as this looks like a man coming from market with a skimming dish on his head the french perhaps have acted wisely in curtailing the size of their hats because we have curtailed them of the fur trade but for englishmen to wear such hats is neither sound policy or common honesty yet we persist in copying the manners of the french though we know they despise us for imitation  as there are two hats contrasted so here are two heads contrasted  this a plain honest well meaning manly sentiment speaking countenance this with a french grin and simper seems to say  entendez vous monsieur entendez vous sire you have no complaisance to whom this replies but sir we have sincerity sire we have de gran monarch and we liberty sire we come over to england every year to learn you and yet sir we are very much your masters point du tout point du tout not at all not at all you beat us in one part and we go to anoder the french be de vise people they go all over the world to get money and the english they go all over the world to spend it  part iii in the first part of this lecture we considered wigs lexiconically in this part we shall consider them physically or rather a physical wig not as it relates to the faculty but only with an intent to show how some of the faculty treat their heads this wig is charactura of both doctor and apothecary according to the doctrine of topsy turvey which supposes that any apothecary may be a doctor though no doctor can be an apothecary  presuming we may now look something like some of the faculty we shall attempt a dissertation on sneezing and snufftaking and this we shall endeavor to execute in the true secundum  artem  medicum phrase which may serve either for doctor or apothecarysneezing otherwise learnedly called sternutation is occasioned by a violent involuntary impression repression compression suppression and oppression of the animal spirits and nervous luids which acting on the nerves which are subservient to the muscles and the diaphragma communicate the same vibration otherwise oscellations of the medellary substance of the nerves and excite those impulses and concussion of the thorax which accompany sternutation by which means the patient is in such a sort of a kind of situation that  if he has a pocket handkerchief he may wipe his nose with it there are several sorts of snuff physical and metaphysical with physical snuff the town has been sufficiently pestered let us consider metaphysical and first  the snuff of self consequence upon the sudden accession of any good fortune pride usually presents the possessor with a box of the snuff of self consequence on opening the lid the dust flies into his eyes and prevents his recollecting any of his old acquaintance on these occasions the eyes of the snuff taker are so injured that he cannot recognize those very friends whom perhaps but the day before he would have been glad to have received a dinner from  then  there is the snuff of contempt this is sure to be taken by all well dressed persons when they are in company with others with worse clothes on than themselves for though we know there is a material difference between real genius and monmouthstreet finery yet the pantheon of parade shall have crowded auditors while the temple of merit stands open without a worshipper  when the performance of an english artist is exhibited as the work of a master unknown its merit will have due praise but the moment his name is known and he is found guilty of being an englishman admiration changes into disgust and the club of connoisseurs take the snuff of contempt at him and his works immediately  pshaw  paltry  damned bad  vile etc etc  englishmen are supposed to be mere john trots incapable of of any thing but hauling a rope or pulling a trigger nor would merit have been allowed in this particular had not our soldiers and sailors so very lately shown all over the world such capital exhibitions  with these heads we intended to have begun our dissection this is the head of a blood he wears a bulls forehead for a foretop in imitation of that blood of old jupiter who turned himself into a bull to run away with europa and to this day your bloods are mighty fond of making beasts of themselves this is a fine fellow to kick up a dust or to keep it up when it is kicked up to chuck a waiter behind the fire toss a beggar in a blanket play at chuck with china plates hop round the room with a red hot poker in his mouth upon one leg say the belief backwards swallow red hot coals oh he was quite the thing he was a wit at wetherbys a toastmaster at bob derrys a constant customer at the roundhouse a terror to modest women and a dupe to women of the town as one of whom  this portait is exhibited this is a man of the town or a blood and this is a woman of the town or a  but by what other title the lady chooses to be called we are not entitled to mention suffice it to say that when we attempted dissection we found this head proof against our keenest apparatus and this so soft that it mouldered away at the first touch  this is the teatable critic or master among the maids he was mamas darling his mama would never let him learn to read for fear he should get a naasty custom of holding down his head but he was a purdigious scholar for all that he had got four pages of hoyle by heart which his mamas woman had taught him and he could calculate ho could calculate how much cream should be put into a codling tart he died of a fit of despair for the loss of his lapdog who was poisoned with eating up the cold cream that was prepared for his mamas next days complexion we divided the suitors of his brain with an ivory bodkin but instead of the cutis and the cuticula the cerebum and the cerebellum medula oblong and other hard words we found nothing of them and for brains we discovered this pincushion from the teatable critic we proceed to the learned critic or wordgrubber  this was an hunter after commas semicolons and underevatas this is a true classical conjugating countenance and denotes dictionary dignity he was one of those learned doctoribuss who always argued propria quae maribus he has for a band a pair of horn books to denote that he was a man of mere letters he lost his best friend in a dispute relative to the pronunciation of a word as he was one day walking in his friends garden little miss came running to him sir said she my papas horse cicero has won the race foaming with rage our grammarian bounces into the parlour madam says he why do you bring up your children thus how dare you suffer these violations of all grammar you will be the very destruction of all learning and of all common sense for the pronunciation of the word is not cicero but kickero nature never does her works by halves she proportions the parts of all animals to the use for which they are designed thus the ears of this critic are immensely large they are called trap doors to catch syllables on the contrary his eyes are half closed that is called the wisemans wink and shows he can see the world with half an eye he died of insanity of mind or furor mentis occasioned by a dispute relating to the restoring of oiled butter he said butter once oiled could never be restored and he proved it from the greek too at the very fame interim in came betty the cook maid with a little sprinkling of flower and no greek and restored it in a moment when we came to a dissection of this head instead of the hard terms used by anatomists we found none of the parts thereby described we found only large fragments of abuse epitomes of indexes and title pages and all the brain covered over with a blotting paper before we opened  this stockjobbers head we had a mind to make an experiment upon the ear but as to notes of music the cries of distress the praise of merit and the demand of gratitude the stockjobbers head was like his stock consolidated we then thought of a method of striking one piece of money against another we did so we struck one shilling against another the chink of the money alarmed the member and on our striking one guinea against another the ear expanded to its utmost extent in other subjects there are certain vessels that convey to the face a consciousness of guilt or the glow of innocence in the stockjobber they were all petrified in other subjects there are certain vessels between the head and the heart called the nerves of humanity in the stockjobber they were all eaten up by the scurvy  this is sir full fed domine double chin citizen turtle and venison eater he was one of the common council of farringdon within he was a very good sort of a man he was half brother to an alderman and had been deputy of his ward his time was taken up in the affairs of the state and the affairs of a kitchen he loved politics and he loved venison he thought a cook was the greatest genius in all the varsal world except a news writer he constantly read every political pamphlet that was published and on both sides of the question and always framed his opinion according to the writer he read last and according to the humor he happened to be in he would take his cap and his pipe and a glass of the righteous as he called it and he would be for setting the world to rights in an hurry ay ay neighbor coster all for their own ends now adays all for their own ends nobody do you see now adays loves their own country since queen semaramus and she invented solomon gundy and that is the best eating in all the varsal world it i was at the head of affairs things should not be as they are now that is all they shouldnt indeed i would show them another way of a manner of going to work now i will show you my plan of operations do you mind me now mark what i say suppose then these two or three bits of tobacco ashes to be the main land continent  ve  ry well and suppose now neighbor spriggins this little drop of milk punch well come here is the king god bless him suppose this little drop of milk punch to be the main sea ocean very well very well and suppose these three or four bits of cork to be all our great men of war very well but what shall i do now for fortified places oh here i have it he  re i have it here is your havannahs and your pondicherries and your tilbury ports and your tower ditches and all your damned strong places there is a plan of operations for ye now a  h well and then our army all should wear a new uniform all our horse infantry should wear air jackets and all our foot cavalry should wear cork waistcoats and then ye know why they would be all over the sea before you could say jack robinson well and where do you think i would land them now you dont know nor you dont know how the devil should you know you dont understand geometry why i will tell you where i would land them i would land them under the line close by the south pole th  ere i would land them and then i would ambuscade all the spaniards back settlements and take from them all their   pshaw  you know what i mean well enough all their  all them damned hard names mentioned in the news papers all their mexicos and their perus and their dimont islands and then i would come with a circumbendibus on the dutch in flat bottomed boats because ye know that is a flat bottomed country open the sluices  let in the water  drown all the poor dutch and then we should have the turtles and the spice islands for n in old england  while our politician was thus going on with his plan censuring men and measures he knew nothing about and it happening at a time when our army lay encamped on one side of the river and the french on the other an officer in company with his stick gave our politician a wrap on the knuckles what is that for a  y only sir replied the officer coolly to inform you that that commander who crosses a river to attack an enemy in front may chance to get a wrap on the knuckles that is all the transition is easy from politics to cunning  behold here the head of a sharper in truths dictionary under the article cunning is the verb to sharp from whence the noun substantive sharper that we may offend no countrymen by the birth of our hero be it known that he was born at sea on board a transport in which his mother was humbly requested by a rule of court to take a seven years tour to america at length by his unshaken resolution and matchless impudence he acquired a fortune of forty thousand pounds  this is his original face a heavy vulgar incurious downlooking countenance this was his holliday face that he went into company with and under this mask of affability he played off all his slight of hand artillery and this was his face when he awoke at midnight when conscience assisted by memory commanded him to undergo a severe self examination for as there was nothing too base for him to commit so neither was there any thing so dreadful but he had reason to fear he lived in the utmost dread and died in the utmost despair putting a period to his existence with this which in the catalogue of medicines bears this name suicides grandspecific he left all his fortune to the hospital for incurables in moorfields that as he had got all his money by the incurables so he was very willing now he could make no farther use of it to return it to the right owners  although he had lived a life so infamous he was buried in all the to be purchased pomp behold here the funeral of the gambler and two of his torch bearers such is the partiality of fate and such the different rewards of merit and infamy that that soldier and sailor are employed at the price of a shilling and glad too of that scanty pittance to attend the gambler to his grave the sailor lost his arm in one of the famous sea fights where sir edward hawke commanded and the soldier lost his leg in one of the sixregiments who so bravely fought upon the plains of minden to show however how we treat our soldiers and sailors when we have no occasion for them we will just beg leave to relate a story that happened in the year      when our army was marching into the north under the command of the gallant duke of cumberland the landlord of the house where one of the soldiers happened to be began to take great notice of him and would say to him why honest fellow says he you soldiers are the pillars of the nation you are the bravest men in nature without a standing army we should have no standing corn when you come home pray come and see me you and your wife and your children and stay as long as you please a week a month or a year as long as you please and make yourselves welcome to every thing you find here and he always wound up his invitation with telling him that soldiers were the pillars of the nation when the affair at culloden was happily over our soldier called rather to thank him for his kind invitation than with any design to accept it but the danger being past and peace being restored be began to talk about large taxes and standing armies and he did not know what occasion there was for a pack of lobstering dogs to be crawling about the country eating up peoples victuals and drink he saw no occasion we had for soldiers now not he we had peace had not we why cried our soldier with a generous disdain i did not invite myself did not you tell me to come me and my family and we should be welcome and says he did not you always close your invitation with saying that we soldiers were the pillars of the nation  pillars of the nation  well i believe i might say something about pillars but i meant  catterpillars  thus while true merit is neglected and despised to show how genius and science can condescend to decorate unworthiness behold here the monument of the gambler  justice and compassion weeping over his medallion and honor descending with a crown of laurels to reward his virtues in the bassorelief are four little boys representing the cardinal virtues as weeping for his death but we who are apt to moralize on things rather think they are four little boys whose parents the gambler has ruined and that they are now turned out of doors and crying for clothes to cover them  this is the head of another kind of sharper it is the head of a conjuror or fortune tellers not that he could see any further into futurity than other mortals no his art lay chiefly in a nice observation of the follies and passions which actuated the human species but chiefly the fair part of the creation and by the help of a wand gown long beard an old globe and other abstruce trumpery he persuaded his easy auditors that he conversed with the stars and according to the fee they gave him he would deliver his plausible prognostics for wishing nymphs he soon would find a husband wealthy handsome kind and for the ambitious he would six a coronet a coach and six he would give the avaricious store and food and raiment to the poor in short whatever their degree he would suit their wishes to a t most people thought that he conversed with the devil yet to show how little acquaintance he had with him he was frightened to death by the appearance of a large black dog and the strength of imagination which made him believe the candles burnt blue  from the head of one who lived by his wit we proceed to a real wit this is the famous yorick mentioned by shakespear and tristram shandy and he is supposed to have a good deal of the family likeness when we came to a dissection of this head we found one lobe of the brain swelled to a prodigious size and the other wasted almost to nothing he lived so long depending on what others would do for him that he was at length reduced to the necessity of asking charity amongst others of his resting places he one day set himself down at the door of a large mansion house some of the servants hearing he was a wit had him into the stewards parlour and where according to the notion some people have of wit they desired he would be comical one of them said if he was a wit to be sure he could run round the room with a red hot poker between his teeth  the cookmaid said to be sure if the gentleman was a wit she hoped he would be so kind and so civil and so obliging and so condescending and so complaisant and so good and so submissive as to tell her fortune on the cards  the butler was rather for a tune on the musical glasses  the groom said if so be as how the gentleman was a wit why he could not do no less than ride three horses at once  the laundry maid she said to be sure he could swallow a boxiron and heaters  while they were thus debating down came the french mammeselle and ordered him to be turned out of doors saying she wondered vat english vit vas good for  wit being thus turned out of doors went to visit hospitality but it being election time there was no room for him there he then paid his addresses to merit but merit could do nothing for him being at that time pursued by faction he then addressed himself to charity and she would have done any thing in the world to serve him but as ill luck would have it she was herself that very morning ran over by the bishops new set of coach horses he died at length of mere hunger and was interred in the poors burialground after his friends had raised money to pay the surplice fees  and the modes of christianity are such in our days that though any churchman may receive large benefices yet if any churchman be found guilty of giving away any of the churchs money in charity he would be thought guilty of being righteous overmuch  behold here one of the righteous overmuch  yet naught does he give away in charity no no he is the bellweather of the flock who has broken down orthodoxs bounds and now riots on the common of hypocrisy  with one eye he looks up to heaven to make his congregation think he is devout that is his spiritual eye and with the other eye he looks down to see what he can get and that is his carnal eye and thus with locks flowing down his face he says or seems to say or at least with your permission well attempt to say for him   brethren brethren brethren the word brethren comes from the tabernacle because we all may breathe there  in  if ye want rouzing i will rouse you i will beat a tattoo upon the parchment cases of your consciences and whip the devil about like a whirlagig  even as the cat upon the top of the house does squall out even so from the top of my voice will i bawl out and the organ pipes of my lungs shall play a voluntary among ye and the sweet words that i shall utter shall sugar candy over your souls and make carraway comfirts of your consciences  do you know how many tailors make a man  why nine  nine tailors make a man  and how many make half a man  why four journeymen and a prentice  even so have you all been bound prentice to missolly the fashion maker and now you are out of your times you have set up for yourselves  my great bowels and my sm  all guts groan for you  i have got the gripe of compassion and the bellyach of pity  give me a dram  do give me a dram  a dram of patience i mean while i explain unto you what reformation and what abomination mean which the worldly wicked have mixed together like potatoes and buttermilk and therewith made a sinful stirabout  reformation is like the comely froth at the top of a tankard of porter  and abomination  is like the dregs at the bottom of the tap tub  have you carried your consciences to the scowerers lately have you bought any fullers earth at my shop to take the stains out  you say yes you have you have you have  but i say no you lie you lie  i am no velvet mouth preacher i scorn your lawn sleeve language  you are all full of filth ye must be boiled down in our tabernacle to make portable soup for the saints to sup a ladleful of and then the scum and the sealdings of your iniquites will boil over and that is called the kitchen stuff of your consciences that serves to grease the cartwheels that carry us over the devils ditch and the devils gap  the devils ditch that is among the jockeys at newmarket and the devils gap that is among the other jockeys the lawyern in lincolns inn fields  and then there is the devil among the tailors and the devil among the players the players they play the devil to pay  the playhouse is satans ground where women stretch themselves out upon the tenterhooks of temptation  tragedy is the blank verse of beelzebub  comedy is his hasty pudding and  pantomime is the devils country dance  and yet you will pay the players for seeing plays yes yes but you will not pay me no no till beelzebubs bum bailiffs lay hold of you and then you think i will pay your garnish but i will not no you shall lay on the common side of the world like a toad in a hole that is baked for the devils dinner  do put some money in the plate  put some money in the plate  and then all your iniquities shall be scalded away even as they scald the bristles off the hogs back and you shall be cleansed from all your sins as easily as the barber shaveth away the weekly beard from the chin of the ungodly  do put some money in the plate or i your preacher cannot eat and it is with grief of heart i tell ye how much this preaching scowrs the belly how pinching to the human tripe is piteous bellyach and gripe but that religion lovely maid keeps a cooks shop to feed the trade the motives of our deeds the same with w  i put in my claim the pious thieves attack your purses with cries and tears and prayers and curses but i more modest in the trade dare never damn the fools i have made but will if so your worships please in future times on bended knees say sing and swear that those alone are right who crowd this tabernacle every night finis references to the heads in the plate i alexander the great ii cherokee chief iii quack doctor iv cuckold v naked head vi lawyer vii
