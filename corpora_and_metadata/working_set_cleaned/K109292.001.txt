the difference between words esteemed synonymous in the english language and the proper choice of them determined  the difference between words esteemed synonymous in the english language and the proper choice of them determined together with so much of abbe girards treatise on this subject as would agree with our mode of expression  useful to all who would either write or speak with propriety and elegance  in two volumes vol i  london printed for j dodsley in pall mall mdcclxvi  to the right honorable philip earl stanhope viscount mahon f r s sir to whom could a work of this kind which is a disquisition of what others have spent a whole life without the least attention to be inscribed with any seeming propriety if not to a gentleman who has himself passed years in the researches of literature but setting aside its propriety on this account the obligations you and your lordships family have been pleased to confer on me and mine are sufficient to engross my continual respect and claim every acknowledgement in my power to make accept then sir this public testimony of it and be assured the dedicating this work to your lordship proceeds more from an ambition of being thought one of your many admirers than from any view of profiting by your lordships patronage  believe me sir with the profoundest respect  your lordships most obliged and most obedient humble servant the author london may         a translation of abbe girards preface if society be formed by the communication of ideas and sentiments speech is undoubtedly its most essential and most graceful band being at once the pencil of the mind the image of its operations and the interpreter of the heart the more we go abroad among men the more we perceive that language is the true seasoning of every delight when all things else fail or when through age we have no other enjoyment that of conversation will furnish amusement in our latter hours and will at that time grow more and more satisfactory as it will in some measure make up for the want of those pleasures we are incapable of receiving in all times and on all occasions speech is delightful there can be no true happiness without the joys of the mind no good fortune that we do not long to make known no secret we do not wish to communicate no tender sentiment we are not anxious to declare no system we do not thirst to unfold no evil we are not eager to complain of no comfort without the sympathetic breathings of friendship no reputation without the voice of renown in a word nothing without the aid of language at least nothing which can satisfy our understandings or flatter our inclinations who then would be so indolent as to pay no attention to the graces or so wanting as to disregard the power of one faculty which gives luster to every other apolite nation can never entertain notions injurious to true taste good education extends her care equally to the language of a people as their morals she does not confine herself to the adorning of the mind inwardly with wisdom science and virtue but labors also to grace it outwardly by teaching it the art of showing itself to advantage her desire is that our expressions should correspond with our thoughts and that our reputation should be answerable to our merit speech then deserves our best attention and we ought to think ourselves indebted to those who study its cultivation whether by learned rules drawn up according to its peculiar genius to give a knowledge of it with precision or by judicious criticisms in order to preserve its purity without rejecting the new advantages of which it is susceptible or by such useful acquisitions as may enrich it without rendering it unintelligible but how much should we be obliged to that person who could in any measure fix it and put a stop to those many innovations which mere caprice daily strives to introduce this is a task i fear beyond the power of individuals the destiny of whatever is living forbids its continuing always in the same state however be the fate of our language in afterages as it may neither the fear of its alteration nor even its annihilation shall deter me from publishing the observations i have made they have neither the rules of grammar nor the purity of custom for their object but the delicate difference only between words reputed synonymous that is to say the distinguishing characteristics of such words as resembling each other in their general idea may nevertheless be distinguishable one from another by some additional one peculiar to each of them from whence arises on many occasions a necessity of choice in order to use them with propriety and elegance a thing as uncommon as it is beautiful and by which taste is enabled to give brilliancy to truth and solidity to wit avoiding all empty words it teaches us to reason soundly averse to the abuse of terms it makes our diction intelligible judicious in the choice of words it gives ease and elegance to our expressions with the greatest accuracy it banishes all farfetched vague and spiritless images with which the trifling and superficial are content to express themselves an enemy to confusion it prevents our rambling in the study of the sciences in short i will venture to affirm that this spirit of justness and distinction is the true ray that shines and in conversation is the lively touch that distinguishes the man of delicacy and discernment from the vulgar and illiterate  in order to acquire this justness we must be a little nice upon words not imagining that such as are called synonymous are really so exactly uniform in their sense and resemble each other as perfectly as two drops of water from the same spring for on a closer examination we shall see that this resemblance does not take in the whole extent and force of signification but consists only in one principal idea which they all express each word differing from the other by some relative one which constitutes its proper and particular character that resemblance which conveys one general idea makes then the words synonymous and the difference that arises from the particular idea that accompanies the general makes them far from being perfectly alike distinguishing them as various shades of the same color  i will not absolutely say that there are not occasions on which so nice a choice may be dispensed with but i maintain that there are still more where they ought not or cannot pass one for another especially in studied and elaborate compositions i will allow it to be a matter of indifference in choosing a yellow habit whether we take the hue of the marigold or jonquil but would we make an agreeable variety it is necessary to consult the different shades or tints how seldom then does it happen that the mind does not find itself in similar circumstances very rare indeed as in that consists the whole art of writing  lest any one under a false notion that the richness of a language consists in the plurality and abundance of words should explode this system of mine relative to the dictinction of those reputed synonymous i must say that though language is enriched by an abundance of words yet that abundance is not merely numeral which is fit for nothing but as it were to fill the coffers of a miser but such as springs from diversity like that which is observed in the various productions of nature it is the satisfaction of the mind and not the tickling of the ear which is the object of all conversation and writing for which reason the quantity of words is not so much to be esteemed as their quality if they vary only from each other in their sounds and not in their greater or less degrees of energy comprehension precision etc they in my opinion serve more to burden the memory than enrich or facilitate the art of speech to stand up for a number of words without any regard to their sense is confounding abundance with superfluity such a taste i cannot better compare than to that of the master of a feast who should think the magnificence of an entertainment consisted more in the number of dishes than of eatables where is the great utility in having many terms to express one single idea is there not more advantage in having proper expressions for every idea we can form  it will be in vain for pleonasm to allege in its defense that by this abundance we avoid the bad effects of repetition for we are deceived with respect to the cause of that effect it is not the repeating of the same sound that offends so much as the repetition of the same idea if the same word displeases when used a second time it is not because it has already struck the ear but because it has before affected the mind which grows weary and is disgusted without the graces of novelty hence came the establishment of certain words we call pronouns the repetition of which custom has made familiar having given them no other office than simply to recall the matter in question without any redundancy of words for the same reason what we call articles and prepositions are equally repeated without disgust nothing being expected from them but a bare nomination or indication for having nothing to determine of themselves they always appear new when the subject they indicate is new this is an undeniable proof that the beauty of words is more owing to their variety of meanings than to their different articulations and that it is a multiplicity of ideas that produces in effect a multiplicity of terms if any one yet doubts this he has nothing to do but to examine them a little closer and be a little nicer in his choice or without giving himself the trouble of such examination let him peruse only with attention the reflections here laid before him for be the remarks either just or not they will plainly show that there are no words so perfectly synonymous as to signify exactly the same upon all occasions consequently they admit of a particular nicety in choice it is this choice the following sheets endeavor to determine by definitions and examples which distinguish and disclose the proper character of these words in which it is hoped they will in some measure succeed  with respect to the work itself it may be said without either vanity or affected modesty that it is copied from no one neither was there any one to copy if it therefore merits nothing from the manner of its execution it will at least from its novelty to this may be added that of variety for almost every page contains something differing from and independent of that which goes before or follows after although of the same sort never book was at the same time more uniform and more diversisied its perusal needs not be either continued or regular let the reader open it where he will he cannot fail of finding something and that entire which will at least satisfy his curiosity if not content his understanding it will serve as well to amuse a quarter of an hour as employ a whole day and may be taken up and laid aside at any time  the authors preface after giving the reader a translation of girards preface it will be unnecessary to say more relative to the usefulness of the work than that as a great inattention to the beauties of language is general almost in every country a volume or two of this kind must be equally acceptable here as in france and it is hoped the great esteem the abbe acquired by his piece and the many editions that has run through are sufficient proofs of its excellence and will be some excuse for this similar attempt as much of the french treatise as would agree with the english mode of expression is translated and adapted to it and if such translation be found in no respect uniform it must be attributed to impossibility should any one imagine because some words which are here classed as passing for synonymous do not immediately strike the mind as such that laboring at a distinction was unnecessary and useless if he cannot recollect a passage where he has seen or call to mind that he has at any time heard them indiscriminately used let him cast his eye over the folio edition of johnsons dictionary and he will instantly discover that these endeavors though inadequate to the task have not been wholly fruitless and should the same error be remarked in the following pages which the tenor of the work condemns it is hoped it will be attributed to the necessity of varying the expressions in a treatise of this particular cast in order to make them agreeable to the mind there are it must be confessed many more words that might have been taken under consideration but on reflection that a thorough reform even in these at present taken notice of will go a considerable way toward the improvement of our tongue the work cannot but be thought of service one motive that prevented the extension of these sheets was a fear of frighting the reader from attempting to pass through them by laying before him the difficulty and length of the way should they chance to meet with approbation they may hereafter probably be enlarged but on the contrary should they on close examination be found too imperfect for public notice let them at least be considered as the wanton sallies of a mind greatly zealous for the beauty of its native language  errata vol i page   line  0 for decrease in virtue a decrease in piety etc read decrease in virtue a

signification of words esteemed synonymous in the english language investigated   to abandon forsake leave to relinquish desert quit the words abandon and leave imply involuntary acts the words forsake relinquish and desert those that are voluntary  to abandon is more applicable to things leave to persons he was under a necessity of abandoning his possessions and compelled to leave his friends  to forsake implies leaving in resentment or dislike to relinquish quitting any claim to to desert leaving meanly or treacherously  being treated with disrespect we are apt to forsake even the person whose cause we were studious to espouse every honest man finding his plea not backed by justice would readily relinquish his claim and even make his competitor a recompense adequate to the expense and trouble he had put him to it is an act of the greatest baseness to desert ones friend in time of distress  to quit implies the breaking off from and may be either voluntary or involuntary  when he had acquired by trade sufficient to support himself for the remainder of his life he prudently quitted his business being overpowered by superior strength he was obliged to quit his hold  we should by no means abandon while we can keep possession nor leave while we are able to stay we should not forsake without sufficient reason nor are we bound to relinquish but when our title is bad no color of excuse can be alleged for desertion nor should we ever quit with a view of laying hold again    to abdicate renounce resign to abdicate is an involuntary act renounce and resign are voluntary  abdicate more particularly relates to a throne renounce to matters of religion resign to employments  king james the second abdicated the throne of england when he could keep possession of it no longer many persons through conviction of mind have formally renounced the errors of the church of rome we frequently resign our employments through a desire of retirement  to abdicate a crown is ever looked upon as disgraceful to renounce a religion as honorable when done through the prevalence of truth and to resign and office as noble when generously given up in favor of another and with the approbation of the person we serve    to abale diminish to decrease lessen these words are nearly synonymous when they are verbs neuter they then mean to grow less as verbs active they are very different even as neuters they will carry some difference in their meaning  to abate implies a decrease in action diminish a waste in substance decrease a decay in moral virtue lessen a contraction of parts  want of spirits when a man is running will abate his ardour and consequently his pace febrifuges if properly applied will abate a fever put sugar into water and it will diminish visibly an object seemingly diminishes in proportion to the distance from which we view it  through a contempt of religion men daily decrease in virtue a decrease in piety is usually accompanied with false notions of god draw the air from a blownup bladder and it lessens proportionably  as verbs active to abate more particularly implies to lower in the price of diminish to make less by abscision or destruction either with respect to bulk value quality or quantity lessen to a voluntary act of degradation  shopkeepers generally ask their customers an advanced price for goods that they may be enabled to abate if desired  by dividing of substance we diminish its bulk by breaking a diamond we diminish its value by mixing water with spirits we diminish the quality and by taking one yard from ten we diminish the quantity  a mean action always lessens us in the sight of good men and whatever false notions vanity may inculcate we ever seem less when we strive to appear greater    to abhor hate to loath detest all these words imply aversion but require to be differently used upon different occasions  to abhor implys an aversion to that to which we have a natural antipathy hate an aversion actuated by revenge loath is more applicable to food detest implies aversion actuated by disapprobation  we abhor what we cannot endure we are apt to hate the person who injures us we loath the food by which we have been surfeited we detest the man who is guilty of a mean action  the spendthrift naturally abhors niggardliness and the niggard profligacy the hatred of the revengeful man is roused whenever the object of his revenge approaches the stomach loathes the very sight of that meat by which we have been satiated every thinking man detests the least degree of meanness more particularly that which is fordid or base    abject low mean beggarly as the words abject and low are indiscriminately used when meant to signify a persons state or condition so are the words mean and beggarly when we would express the disposition but the impropriety of so doing is very evident  by abject is understood that forlorn situation in life that a man brings himself into by ill conduct by low that in which providence has placed him the first is voluntary the latter involuntary  divine wisdom has thought proper for various reasons to make distinctions between men placing some in a higher sphere others in a lower but never was he the cause of any ones abjectness want of merit or fortune often renders a man low but it must be a villainous character to make him abject  with respect to the words mean and beggarly when meant to express the disposition the absurdity of using them one for the other is equally visible  mean signifies a mans readiness to perform a dirty or illicit action whereas beggarly is more particularly expressive of a narrow grovelling spirit  he who can stoop to be guilty of a meanness merits the contempt of all who know him it has ever been accounted beggarly to live below the rank of life we are in  when a man is brought into a state of penury and contempt by a long course of infamy we justly call him abject if his narrow circumstances are only owing to the poverty of his parents we then repute him low when guilty of any thing beneath the character of an honest man or a gentleman we account him mean and when the treasures of the rich are sullied by the narrow notions of the poor we call it beggarly    to abolish abrogate disannul to repeal revoke abolish is a term rather to be used with respect to customs abrogate and repeal with regard to laws disannul and revoke to private contracts  when old customs have been by long experience found to be detrimental they have very prudently been abolished new fashions abolish old ones  the word abrogate is generally used with respect to ancient laws repeal to modern that is when we talk of rendering old laws null we call it abrogating when those lately made repealing  despotic power has frequently abrogated what was instituted by equity upon the enaction of a new law many inconveniences have sometimes appeared before unthought of this has occasioned a repeal  the abrogation of a fundamental law frequently causes the ruin of the sovereign or of the people and sometimes of both the legislative power has often found itself obliged to repeal an act of parliament one sessions which passed the last merely to appease the clamours of the people  the difference in meaning between the words disannul and revoke is not very great yet such as to admit of a distinction  disannul is applied to a written contract revoke to a verbal  he who gives a conditional bond to another has a right to disannul it if the specified conditions are not punctually observed to revoke a promise nowadays is no other than fashionable whereas formerly it was considered as a breach of friendship    to finish complete to end conclude with respect to the three first words the proper idea of finishing is the bringing a thing to its last period the completion of any thing is the actual arrival of that last period and the characteristic of ending is cessation or discontinuation  lazy people begin many things without finishing any we ever feel a secret satisfaction in the completion of a work we have been long about may we not question the wisdom of those laws which instead of ending suits do but serve to prolong them  by the word conclude we understand performing the last act of ratiocination widely differing from complete we complete a piece of mechanism but conclude an oration  a piece of clockwork is of little value till completed it is allowed by all rhetoricians that the greatest ornament of an harangue is a well finished conclusion  we finish what we have begun by continuing to work at it we complete a work by putting the last hand to it we end it by discontinuation thus we may finish without ending and end without completing    on upon these two words are indiscriminately used one for another on all occasions but with great impropriety  on rather signifies by as on my word on my honor etc whereas upon means up on the top of and is applied to matter as upon the table upon the chair upon the house etc  the absurdity of a contrary diction is evident from the following change of words it was his honor upon which he swore  indeed the word upon is used with elegance even detached from substance when the sense is figurative as for instance he relied upon the promise of his friend intimating that that promise was the staff upon which he leaned but on other occasions the impropriety is gross    action act deed as custom has applied the word deed chiefly to signify the written evidence of any legal act it will be necessary only to show the difference between the words action and act  the word action then is applicable indifferently to every thing we do whether common or extraordinary but the word act should signify something done which is remarkable  an elegant speaker will not say a virtuous act a good or a vicious act but an act of virtue or of goodness or of iniquity whereas to say a virtuous action or a good or vicious action is proper and elegant  it is generally speaking a good action to conceal the faults of our neighbors and it is the rarest act of charity among mankind  the sentiments of the heart are not so much to be judged of from words as from actions it is an act of great heroism to pardon our enemies when we have power to be revenged on them  these two words are further distinguishable by our considering them somewhat physically the word action in this light relates more to the power that acts and the word act is more applicable to the effect itself produced by that power this makes the one properly the attribute of the other so that it may be justly said we should always have a presence of mind attendant upon our actions to render all of them either acts of bounty or acts of justice   0 to enlarge increase the word enlarge is properly used to signify an addition of extent increase is critically applicable only to number height and quantity  we enlarge a town a field a garden we increase the inhabitants of a town our expenses our revenues  the former word is more suitable to one entire and vast quantity of space the latter to any gross and multiplied quantity in general thus it is commonly said that we have enlarged our house when we have made it more extensive by adding buildings to the sides of it but we usually say a house is increased with an additional story or with several new rooms  by enlarging our territory we generally increase our riches princes certainly enlarge their renown by widening the bounds of their dominions and they are apt to think they at the same time increase their power but in this they are sometimes mistaken for such an enlargement may chance to produce only an increase of cares and troubles which may end in their utter ruin  a king who labors more after acquiring new subjects than in governing those he already has may enlarge his fame but will never increase his happiness     address air mien behavior manners deportment carriage what is called our air mien and carriage seem to be born with us and strike at first sight our address manners behavior and deportment are owing to education and gradually disclose themselves in our intercourse with the world  mien rather relates to our look carriage to our frame but the word air to both we usually judge of the mien by the face the carriage by the person and the air by both  how sweet is the mien that has good humor in the countenance a gentleman though in rags is easily discovered by his graceful carriage an open countenance and majesty of person give a man the most engaging air imaginable  address is confined to our words deportment to our actions behavior arises from both and the fruit of behavior is manners  our address shall often please when our deportment shall disgust and vice versa  when our address is engaging and our deportment comformable it is impossible our behavior should be otherwise  in order to be well with the world we should suit our behavior to our company which though in the eye of some persons has been considered as deceitful must in the end be looked upon as the height of good manners  an engaging air which is the union of a charming mien and graceful carriage is necessary to make any thing please but unless accompanied with good manners arising from a genteel address and deportment it becomes perfectly disgustful     to accost approach we accost those with whom we would speak but often approach without any intention to address  the bold can accost without the least hesitation we cannot approach the great without some kind of ceremony  when we have any thing to say to a person we naturally accost him when we would insinuate ourselves into his good graces we endeavor to approach him  education teaches us to accost the ladies with civility but to approach them requires some kind of assurance seafoned with respect     ingenuity cleverness abilities parts ingenuity relates more to the invention of things cleverness to the manner of executing them ability to the actual execution of them and parts to the discernment the third then puts in use what the second dictates pursuant to the digested plan of the fourth invented by the first  a man may be ingenious and not clever he may be clever without abilities to execute and he may have great abilities and yet not be a man of parts  admitting we are not very ingenious still if we are accustomed to the management of things we may be clever but it requires abilities to do with them as we would and parts to conduct them  he who discovered the powers of refraction and reflection had he known nothing more would have been ingenious he who constructed the telescope was clever the finisher was a man of abilities and without doubt the philosopher he who applies the instrument to the various purposes of astronomy must be a man of parts     to add augment by adding one thing to another we augment the same by the word adding we understand the joining of different things together or if they are things of the same kind joining them in such a manner as not to confound them but that after such junction each may be distinguished from the other whereas the word augment indicates our making a thing larger or more abundant by such an addition as shall cause it afterward to appear one and the same thing or at least that when the addition is made the whole together shall be conceived under one idea thus for example we add one basket of rubbish to another one room to another but we augment the heap and the house  there are many who would not scruple to augment their own stock by fraudulently adding to it that of another  to add is a verb active only augment both active and neuter  our ambition augments with our fortune and we are no sooner in possession of one hundred pounds than we are eager to add to it another     to study learn to study implies a uniform application in search of knowledge to learn that application with success  we study to learn and learn by dint of study  people of vivacity learn easily but are heavy at study  we can study but one thing at a time but we may learn many  the more we learn the more we know but oftentimes the more we study the less we know  we have studied well when we have learned to doubt  there are many things we learn without study and other things we study without learning  those are not the wisest who have studied most but those who have learnt most  we see some persons studying continually without learning any thing and others learning almost every thing without the least study  the time of our youth is the time of study but it is in a more advanced age when we truly can be said to learn it is then only we have capacity to digest what we have before laid up in the memory     buttress support prop the buttress fortifies it is fixed close to resist the impulsion of other bodies the support bears by being placed beneath a thing to prevent its falling under a weight the prop assists and its general use is to strengthen  a wall is frequently made stronger by buttresses an arch is supported by columns a house when in danger of falling is kept up by props  that which has received a violent thrust or is much bulged stands in need of a buttress that which is too heavy to carry itself is in want of supporters and that which ought to stand upright and cannot be made to do so of itself must be propped  in a figurative sense buttress relates more to defense support to credit and prop to friendship  the true christian seeks no buttress against the malignity of men but that of innocence and integrity he makes work the most solid support of his life and looks upon implicit obedience to the decree of heaven as the most steady prop of his felicity     enough sufficient the object of both these words is quantity but with this difference that enough relates more to the quantity one desires to have and sufficient to that quantity one really wants to employ  thus the avaritious man never has enough let him accumulate ever so much he still desires more and the prodigal never sufficient he still wanting to expend more than he has  we say we have enough when we wish not for more and we say we have sufficient when we have just what is necessary  when applied to such things as are consumable the word enough seems to denote a much greater quantity than the word sufficient for in relation to such things when we say we have enough it seems as though we should have too much had we more but what we call sufficient may be added to without coming near that extreme for we may say of a very small income or revenue that it is sufficient though at the same time we can hardly think it enough  the word enough has a more general and comprehensive meaning the word sufficient a more limited and particular one  an hour at table is certainly sufficient for our nourishment but not enough for some persons pleasure or satisfaction  an oeconomist can find enough where there is very little but the prodigal never has sufficient let him have ever so much     to declare affirm protest aver assert to maintain swear avouch attest in the first seven words we find different degrees of declaration to declare signifies to tell any thing simply but seriously to affirm means to say confidently to protest implies a solemn affirmation to aver signifies a positive declaration to assert that declaration defended to maintain implies a support of such assertion to swear is to ratify it by an oath  when we give our opinion on being seriously asked we are said to declare it when we would give that declaration more force we affirm it and to strengthen that affirmation we protest it solemnly that is we affirm it by invoking the deity  the other words are sufficiently explained above if ever we wish to gain credit in the world whatever we declare should be backed by truth true politeness forbids our affirming any thing unless required by the obligations of justice to make frequent use of protestations betrays a suspicion that our bare word is not to be believed always to aver has an appearance of dogmatising and shows us ignorant of that proper degree of diffidence which ever accompanies wisdom some persons are so ready to assert that let the matter be right or wrong it is equally the same when our opinions are just and wellgrounded we have an undoubted right to maintain them swearing was first instituted in courts of judicature as a conscientious testimony of truth  the words avouch and attest though often usedas synonynous with the foregoing have a very different signification the word avouch implies an assertion in defense of another attest a bearing witness to what another has just before said  when the reputation of an honest man has been undeservedly hurt it is the part of a friend to avouch his good character  too much care to attest all that is advanced renders our conversation tiresome  there is another verb warrant which has some affinity to the word maintain but as custom has made the use of it vulgar it is unnecessary to take any further notice of it     arms weapons by arms we understand those instruments of offense generally made use of in war such as firearms swords etc by weapons we more particularly mean instruments of other kinds exclusive of fire arms made use of as offensive on especial occasions  in the state of switzerland all men are obliged to learn the use of arms in their youth that in cases of extremity they may be capable of defending themselves against the attacks of their enemies  in times of insurrection people make use of such weapons as they can get   0 attractions allurements charms besides the general idea which makes these three words appear synonymous it is likewise their common fate scarce ever to be used in the singular number at least in those senses in which they are here considered that is whenever they are used to signify the power of beauty of agreeableness or of any thing which pleases  with respect to their different meanings it appears to me that attractions mean something natural allurements somewhat rather artificial and charms somewhat stronger and more uncommon than either  attractions may be said to engage us allurements to entice us charms to seduce us  the heart of man can scarce stand against the attractions of a pretty woman it is with difficulty he can defend himself against the allurements of a coquette but to resist the charms of a sweettempered beauty is impossible  ladies always owe their attractions and their charms to a happy formation of their features and persons but they sometimes procure their allurements at their toilettes  i know not whether i may fall in with the taste of mankind but in my opinion attractions rise from those ordinary graces which nature has bestowed upon the women with more or less liberality and which are the common appendages of the sex allurements from those cultivated graces which form a faithful mirror of the natural and are studied merely with a desire to please charms from those singular graces which nature sometimes bestows as a most valuable gift and which are more particular and personal  defects not seen at first but afterward observed lessen attractions greatly allurements vanish as soon as the artifice appears charms lose their force when time and custom has rendered them familiar  these words are not in use only with regard to beauty and the graces of the sex but with respect to every thing that pleases in this case attractions and charms are applied only to such things as are amiable in themselves whereas the word allurements is sometimes applied to such things as are even in themselves odious but which we love nevertheless  virtue has attractions which the most vicious of men cannot avoid being sensible of the riches of the world are allurements which never fail to captivate in spite of their ill tendency pleasure has such charms that it is hunted after by every one as well by the philosopher as the libertine  we say great attractions powerful allurements and invincible charms  honor attracts fortune allures but the charms of glory are invincible     miserly niggardly covetous avaritious the word miserly signifies rather a parcimonious disposition or a depriving ourselves of the necessaries of life merely to hoard the riches we possess by niggardly we understand that sordid temper that does things by halves covetous implies an eager craving for the possessions of another by avaritious we mean that inordinate thirst of gain that makes a man grasp atevery thing he sees taking the words in these fenses which are undoubtedly the proper ones we may be covetous and not avaritious niggardly and not miserly  he who never gives any thing away is justly called miserly he who fails to bestow when necessary or when he bestows gives too little draws on himself the epithet of niggardly he who longs for the goods of another is covetous and he who grasps at wealth by all means whatever avaritious  of all extraordinary beings there is no greater one than the miser who punishes himself and starves in the midst of plenty  the miser is laughed at but the niggard is despised  the contented man is at quiet within himself but the covetous is ever on the rack he eagerly wishes for what another possesses and his inability of obtaining it is his continual torment  it is necessary to be ever watchful of an avaritious man for his disposition leads him to take every opportunity of defrauding you     acknowledgment confession acknowledgment supposes a question asked whereas confession favors a little of accusation  we acknowledge what we had an inclination to conceal we confess that which we were blameable in doing  it is interrogation which causes acknowledgment repentance confession  it is better to make a sincere acknowledgment than a bad excuse  we should not confess to all sorts of people  an acknowledgment unasked is either noble or foolish according to the circumstances and effect it produces  confession unaccompanied with repentance is an insult to the deity  it would be want of spirit to acknowledge a fault without a certainty that such acknowledgment would be satisfactory and it would be foolish to make confession without hopes of pardon for why should we declare ourselves culpable to those who breathe nothing but vengeance     admonition advice counsel the end of admonition is gentle reproof advice and counsel are to convey instruction but with this difference that advice implies no superiority with respect either to rank or parts in the person who gives it whereas counsel generally carries with it one if not both  admonition in a master frequently has a greater effect than correction  people are readier to give advice than to take it  parents should take care to counsel their children before they turn them out into the world  admonition should be given with temper advice with sincerity and counsel with art and modesty  admonish a friend in private but reward him openly  nothing is more salutary than good advice and yet nothing is more nauseous to take  when counsel is given with an air of impertinence it is sure to make the counsel despised and the counselor odious     to have possess in order to have a thing it is not necessary to have the power of disposal of it or to have it actually in our hands it is sufficient that it belongs to us but to possess it it must be in our hands and we have the liberty of disposing of it whenever we think proper  thus we have an estate notwithstanding it is mortgaged for the benefit of our creditors but as to riches we possess them  we are not always masters of what we have we are of what we possess  a married man has continual torment when the demon of jealousy possesses him  we have often but the half of things partaking them with others we possess them when they are entirely our own  those who have only the knowledge of arts follow their rules but those who possess them lay down their rules to follow     battle combat fight battle is an action more general and commonly preceded by some preparation combat seems to be an action more particular and often unexpected fight may be either one or the other and is seldom used in the plural  thus the fight between the carthaginians and the romans and that at pharsalia between caesar and pompey were battles but those in which the horatii and the curatii decided the fate of rome were combats     handsome pretty beautiful it is the fate of these words when applied to the female sex to be used indiscriminately one for the other and yet at the same time no three words can be more different  by a handsome woman we understand one that is graceful and well shaped with a regular disposition of features by a pretty we mean one that is delicately made and whose features are so formed as to please by a beautiful a union of both  a lady may be handsome and not pretty pretty and not handsome but to be beautiful she must be both pretty and handsome  many a handsome woman has a forbidding countenance  it has been the misfortune of many a pretty woman to be crooked  a beautiful woman is nowadays very rare to be met with  prettiness carries an idea of simplicity handsomeness of nobility beauty of majesty  the ladies in romances are described as either beautiful or handsome the shepherdesses by the poets are represented as pretty so in other things we say a beautiful palace a handsome house a pretty cottage  a beautiful woman is an object of curiosity a handsome woman of admiration and a pretty one of love  when applied to other things beautiful relates to something more serious and engaging pretty to somewhat more gay and diverting this is the reason why we say a beautiful tragedy but a pretty comedy     benignity benevolence kindness tenderness humanity benignity is a sort of kind condescension and an attribute of princes only benevolence a wishing well to mankind and seems relative to those who have more particularly the power of doing good kindness is the same disposition among equals tenderness is a susceptibility of impression and more applicable to persons nearly connected humanity denotes a fellow feeling for the distresses even of a stranger  benegnity benevolence and kindness spring from the will tenderness and humanity from the heart  the benignity of a prince makes him universally beloved by his subjects  benevolence is a shining character and is more conspicuous for the charitable actions it produces  kindness is what one man naturally expects from another and what we are reciprocally bound to impart  the tenderness of a parent has often been the ruin of a child  the distresses of individuals will often draw tears from a person truly humane  from the very instant of our birth we experience the benignity of heaven and malignity of corrupt nature  the realized benevolence of some good men have almost made them worshipped by their fellow creatures  kindnesses are in the power of every one to show therefore he that withholds them favors more of the brute than of the man  the great tenderness of animals to their young is a standing reproof to the many unfeeling mothers  true humanity consists in not treating with rigor but excusing the weaknesses supplying the defects assuaging the pains and comforting the afflictions of our neighbor     poverty indigence want need necessity poverty is that situation of fortune opposed to riches in which we are deprived of the conveniences of life  indigence is a degree lower we there want the necessaries and is opposed to superfluity  want seems rather to arrive by accident implies a scarcity of provisions rather than a lack of money and is opposed to abundance  need and necessity relate less to the situation of life than the other three words but more to the relief we expect or the remedy we seek with this difference between the two that need seems less pressing than necessity  merit or a fortunate circumstance in life frequently extricates us from a state of poverty in which we were born and in which prodigality often plunges the rich  diligence is the best remedy against indigence which is generally the just punishment of idleness  wise precautions prevent want which is often brought on by extravagance  when we are in need we should seek assistance from our friends but be careful not to importune too much  the means of obtaining relief in extreme necessity is to implore the succor of the truly charitable  a state of poverty is most conducive to the health of the soul we being there out of the way of temptations  the man who opens his hand to the cravings of the indigent feels within his breast a secret satisfaction which the uncharitable man is an entire stranger to  he that will waste will want  a friend in need is a friend indeed  necessity is the mother of invention     goodfortune prosperity what we call goodfortune is the effect of chance it comes unexpected prosperity is the success of conduct and comes by degrees  fools have sometimes good fortune wise men do not always prosper  the capital that was saved by the cackling of geese and not by the vigilance of the sentinels is a piece of history more proper to show the goodfortune of the romans than their military government on that occasion though on all others their wise conduct has contributed as much to their prosperity as the valor of their soldiers   0 goodnature good humor these terms though very expressive of their respective meanings are too often for want of proper discernment confounded  we may be goodhumoured and not goodnatured goodnatured and yet not always goodhumoured  to make this properly appear it is necessary to give a full definition of each  by goodnature is meant that disposition which partakes the felicity of all mankind that promotes the satisfaction of every individual within the reach of its ability that relieves the distressed comforts the afflicted diffuses blessings and communicates happiness as far as its sphere of action can extend whereas good humor is nothing more than a cheerful pleasing deportment arising either from a natural gaiety of mind or an affectation of popularity joined to an affability of behavior which is the result of goodbreeding and a compliance with the taste of every company  this kind of good humor is by far the most striking quality it is frequently mistaken for and complimented with the superior name of real goodnature a man by this specious appearance has often acquired that appellation who in all the actions of his private life has been a morose cruel revengeful sullen haughty tyrant on the contrary a man of a true benevolent disposition and formed to promote the happiness of all around him may sometimes perhaps from an ill habit of body an accidental vexation or a commendable openness of heart above the meanness of disguise be guilty of little sallies of peevishness or illhumour that may carry the appearance of and be unjustly thought to proceed from ill nature by persons who are not acquainted with his true character and who take them for synonymous terms though in reality they have not the least analogy to each other     happiness felicity bliss these three words denote equally an advantageous state and agreeable situation but that of happiness marks properly the state of fortune capable of dispensing pleasures and placing them within our reach that of felicity expresses particularly the state of the heart disposed to tae pleasure which it finds in whatsoever it possesses that of bliss which conveys a mys idea paints a state of imagination which we anticipate as it were from a thorough conviction that we shall inherit it hereafter  our happiness glares in the eyes of the world and exposes us often to envy our felicity is known only to ourselves and gives us continual satisfaction the idea of bliss extends itself beyond a life temporal  we are sometimes in a state of happiness without being in a state of felicity happiness consists in the possession of wealth honors friends and health but it is the satisfaction of the mind and the enjoyment of those things that constitutes felicity as to bliss it is the portion of the godly and depends in each religion on the persuasion of the mind  satisfaction without forms the happiness of man satisfaction within his felicity bliss must be asked of god the first is within the reach of riches the second of wisdom but the third is reserved for those whom the scripture calls the poor in spirit     confines limits bounds confines are where we are at liberty to go limits are what we ought not to pass bounds are what we can not pass  we approach or get farther from the confines we contract or extend the limits we advance or remove the bounds  by confines we rather understand the edge or border the confines of a country not surrounded by the sea are generally distinguished by rivers or hills  he who continually exceeds the limits which temperance has set will soon find himself on the confines of the grave  they say with more eloquence than truth that the limits of the roman empire were those of the world  the sea the alps and the pirenean mountains are the natural bounds of france  ambition knows no bounds and we are never happy but when the bounds of our fortune are those of our desire     extremity end each of these words signifies the least of those parts which constitutes a thing but with this difference that extremity supposes a situation and an arrangement intimating the greatest distance whereas end supposes a length only and denotes that place where the length ceases  extremity answers to the center end to the beginning thus we say the extremity of a kingdom the end of life     aim view design the aim is more fixed we take every method to pursue it the view more vague we make use of means to accomplish it the design more close we leave nothing undone to complete it  a good prince has no other design in his government than to render his state flourishing because he has the happiness of his people in view and true glory is his aim  the true christian has no other aim than heaven no other view than to please god nor any other design to complete than his own salvation  we are said to lay an aim to have views to form a design  reason forbids our laying any aim that is impossible to attain to have any chimerical views or to form any design we are unable to execute  if my views are just i have a design in my head that will bring me to my aim     burden load by the word burden we understand a weight possible to be born by load a weight more than we are able to bear  a light burden is no inelegant expression but a light load certainly is  in the heat of summer our very clothes are a burden  many a poor animal is so inhumanly laden as to sink under the load  taken now in a figurative sense they are equally different  how unhappy is the man who feels the burden of an evil conscience  we have sometimes through a bad habit of body such a load upon our spirits as not to be able to support ourselves     charm enchantment spell the word charm carries an idea of force which puts a stop to ordinary effects and natural causes the word enchantment is used properly for that which regards the illusion of the senses the word spell bears particularly an idea of something which disturbs the reason all the three in the literal sense mark the effect of a magical operation condemned by religion and laughed at by philosophy  antiquated tales say there is a charm to destroy the effect of arms and make them invulnerable we read in old romances of the surprising power of enchantments that have suddenly changed the manners and reversed the fortune weak people have thought and do still believe that by means of a spell the health has been destroyed and the person so bewitched made raving mad but persons of good sense see no charm in the world but the caprice of passions with respect to reason which often suspends reflection and stops the effects which that would naturally and necessarily produce they are acquainted with no other enchantment than that seduction arising from a depraved taste and disordered imagination they know also that which is foolishly attributed to the power of a spell maliciously laid is no other than the effect of a bad constitution which is frequently remedied by an application of proper medicines     to chastise punish to correct discipline we chastise him who has committed a fault to prevent his doing the same again we punish the person guilty of a crime by way of expiation and as an example to others to correct signifies to amend by means of chastisement to discipline means to regulate and instruct  we chastise a child in order to correct his manners officers are frequently obliged to punish a soldier with death to keep up good discipline in the regiment  it is necessary for good correction that the chastisement be not the effect of anger justice demands that the punishment be rigorous when the crime is enormous otherwise there can be no good discipline in the state  god like a tender father chastises us in this life that we may not be punished in the life to come  as the words chastise and punish are thought to have the nearest affinity to each other it may not be unnecessary to show a yet further difference between them  chastise then carries always with it an idea of subordination denoting an authority or superiority in him who chastises over the person chastised but the word punishment carries no such idea in its signification for we are sometimes punished by our equals by ourselves by our inferiors by the mere event of things or by the effects of the fault we have committed  parents who through tenderness to their children forbear to chastise them are often punished for their folly by their future ingratitude and ill conduct     prudence discretion care caution prudence is here the mother virtue and signifies wisdom applied to practice discretion is the effect of prudence and means a knowledge to govern or direct ones self by care we understand heed in order to preservation caution implies a greater degree of wariness  a proper attention to prudence would make us so discreet as to be careful in every thing we do and cause us to act with the greatest caution  a hasty conduct can never be called prudent want of attention in affairs of moment is the greatest height of indiscretion for without that necessary qualification it is impossible any thing we do can be attended with success he who expects to do any thing well must act with care and he who is desirous of avoiding difficulties with caution  to weigh matters well before we put them into execution is a mark of prudence  a discreet man in the company of dangerous persons such as would take advantage of his words would be careful how he opened his mouth and would utter nothing but with the greatest caution     circumspection consideration regard a proper attention to the manner of acting and conducting ourselves in our commerce with the world with respect to others contributing rather to their satisfaction than our own is the common and general idea which these three words present at first sight notwithstanding which it appears to me that their application should be different  circumspection principally takes place in discourse it prevents our letting any thing escape us that may do hurt or give offense and is the effect of prudence which risks nothing consideration is more personal and relates particularly to our manner of treating other people making a proper distinction as different opportunities may offer and is the consequence of esteem and duty regard relates more to the state or situation of persons being particularly careful to omit nothing which good sense and politeness requires and is the fruit of a good education  to be well with the world requires circumspection when we are speaking before those with whom we are not acquainted consideration for people of rank and quality and regard toward those with whom we are interested  we ought to have a great deal of circumspection in conversations of religion and government because they are public matters and subjects on which particulars are not at liberty to say what they think especially if their thoughts are in opposition to those established in the country where they are it is not advisable for our interests to omit showing marks of consideration to such persons whose assistance we may stand in need of and from whom we hope to receive any service we cannot have too great a regard for the ladies it is what they expect and are displeased if we neglect   0 cunning finesse device artifice trick stratagem cunning is the art of conducting designs in a manner proper to succeed finesse is a french word lately adopted by the english and means an acting secretly and under cover device is rather a pretty thought or contrivance artifice is unnatural and a farfetched mean of executing designs trick which eludes the senses implies a juggle and stratagem denotes a disguised way of obtaining our ends  the first three of these words are oftener understood in a good sense than the other  cunning is employed in using means finesse insinuates insensibly and must be accompanied by penetration device surprises and gives satisfaction artifice generally makes use of studied dissimulation a trick is commonly looked on as a fraud and a stratagem is oftener illicit than otherwise  without some degree of cunning it will be impossible to deal with or guard against the generality of mankind  finesse is so essential to the courtier that without it he is seen through presently  pretty devices declare the authors of them persons of ingenuity  we ought particularly to guard against a man who makes use of a great deal of artifice  jugglers perform tricks to divert and consequently if clever deserve applause but he who tricks his neighbor in order to serve himself is a rogue  all stratagems in war are lawful but in other cases they are ever considered as derogatory to the character of an honest man     moment instant a moment is not long but an instant is still shorter the word moment has a signification more extended it is taken sometimes for time in general and is used in a figurative sense that of instant is more contracted it marks the shortest duration or time and is never used but in the literal sense  all depends upon knowing the favorable moment sometimes an instant too soon or too late is all that makes the difference between success and misfortune  let us banish thought as much as in our power still now and then a reflective moment will intrude the face of things which we have thought established have been frequently changed in an instant  every moment is dear to one who knows the value of time every instant of our life is a step nearer the grave     customs manners fashions customs relate to the general practice of the people manners to their way of life and fashions to their dress  there cannot be a more ridiculous custom than that of persons complimenting each other in time of divine service it being supposed they have there more material things to engross their attention  an increase or decrease of luxury has been found to have more or less influence on the manners of the people  it has been observed that there is a continual round of fashions when the new are worn out they then have recourse to the old and those old ones become new     to be exist subsist be agrees with all sorts of subjects substances or modes with all manner of beings real or ideal exist is used only with respect to substances and those real subsist is applied equally to substances or modes but with reference to the duration of their being which is not expressed by the other two words  we say of qualities forms actions motions and of all their different relations that they are we say of matter spirit bodies and all real beings that they exist we say of states works affairs laws and all establishments which are neither destroyed or changed that they subsist  the verb be is commonly used to mark the event of any modification or quality in the subject that of exist is in use only to express the end of simple existence and we employ subsist to point out the duration of that existence or modification thus we say that man is inconstant that the phoenix exists not that all human establishments subsist but for a time     famous illustrious celebrated renowned each of these qualities distinguishes the reputation but that which the word famous expresses means no more than a simple distinction of one country or age above another let that distinction be taken either in good part or bad that which the word illustrious expresses is founded upon a merit supported by dignity and glory which makes the object not only known but admired and ranked among the great that which we understand by the word celebrated expresses a superior degree of talents with respect either to abilities or knowledge though it raises not the object to an equal degree of grandeur with the illustrious it is nevertheless honorable that which the word renowned denotes is founded only upon fashion or public taste which without casting much honor on the subject draws it simply from oblivion and makes its name known to the world  the maid of orleans cried down by the english but esteemed by the french was equally famous in both nations princes shine during their life but they are only illustrious in future ages by the monuments of grandeur wisdom and greatness which they leave behind them there are celebrated authors whose works we cannot find fault with and those which we cannot even commend without risking our own reputation a mans fortune is half made when once he becomes renowned in his profession  famous celebrated and renowned are equally applicable to persons or things but illustrious to persons only at least when we would be nice in our choice of words  erostratus among the greeks set sire to the temple of diana to make himself famous he was rendered more so by an order of the state that his name should never after be mentioned on pain of punishment the greatest part of our libels are of the same kind they raise a dust and become famous by being burnt by the hangman the duke of marlborough became illustrious by the many victories he obtained his glorious actions are celebrated in history so are the many courtintrigues of the duchess the gobelins were so renowned that their names live in the place were they worked and in those works in which others imitate them it is a question whether the phalernian wine was more renowned than those are of champaigne and burgundy     excuse pardon forgiveness we make excuse for an apparent fault or slight offense we ask pardon for a real fault or when the offense is greater we implore forgiveness of our sins the first is an apology in order to justify ourselves and is founded on politeness the second is the mark of a good disposition and is done in hopes of extenuation the last to avert the vengeance and declares repentance  the good mind excuses easily the good heart pardons readily god delights more in forgiveness than in revenge  excuse is more used when we address ourselves to equals pardon to superiors and forgiveness to heaven  good manners demand an excuse for that which turns out wrong let the intention be never so good it can never be a degradation to ask pardon of that person whom we have offended besides the superior rank of some persons makes it an absolute duty in the offender how great is the presumption of that wretch who fancies himself not in need of the forgiveness of the almighty     duty obligation duty means something conscientious and springs from a law obligation something absolute in practice and springs from custom  we are said to fail in our duty and to dispense with an obligation  it is the duty of a clergyman to carry himself modestly and he is obliged to wear dark colored clothes  policy finds less disadvantage in neglecting her duty than in forgetting the least of her obligations     to live dwell these two words are synonymous in that sense in which they signify residence but live relates to the particular place where we inhabit dwell to the building in which we reside  we live in london in middlesex in the country we dwell in a large house a cottage or a furnished lodging  when persons of distinction live in london they dwell in hovels comparatively speaking with their houses in the country  we say with great propriety i live all the summer in the country and have one of the prettiest dwellings imaginable     to stay remain the common idea of these two words is a cessation of progression and their difference consists in this that to stay seems to have less duration than to remain  a good servant when sent on a message stays as short a time as possible  when we have given offense we should endeavor to make such an atonement that the offended party may not remain dissatisfied  the duration of time expressed by the word stay seems less determinate than that by the word remain  thus we say he remained at his country house a month he stayed longer than we expected     event incident event is a word most agreeable to states and governments incident to casualties in private life  the revolutions of the state are events that determine the happiness of the people  our life is full of incidents which the eye of prudence cannot foresee   0 to awake awaken the first of these words is more frequently used in a literal sense the last in a figurative  the least noise awakes those who sleep indifferently it requires but little to awaken a passion which is not entirely rooted out from the heart   0 heavy weighty the word heavy is more applicable to that which loads the body weighty to that which burdens the mind it requires strength to carry the one parts to support the other  a weak man finds that heavy which the strong find light the administration of state affairs is too weighty a concern for one person to undertake     to conquer subdue overcome each of these words implies resistance but that of conquer refers to victory over enemies and is generally used in the literal sense that of subdue is more applicable to our passions being oftener used in a figurative and means a bringing under subjection that of overcome supposes efforts against any obstacle that opposes meaning rather to surmount  we have conquered our enemies when we have beat them in such a manner as to put it out of their power to do us any further hurt we may be said to have subdued our lusts when we are able to withstand every temptation we overcome our adversaries when we obtain our end in spite of every opposition  it requires courage and valor to conquer endeavor and resolution to subdue patience and perseverance to overcome  alexander gloried more in his conquests than in any other thing upon earth of all passions avarice is the most difficult to subdue as neither age or weakness of constitution is able to rebate its edge we should strive to overcome evil with good     to no purpose ineffectually in vain we work to no purpose when we meet not with the reward we expected to receive ineffectually when that which we have done answers not the end proposed in vain when our work is of no kind of use whatever  i shall have worked to no purpose if these sheets meet not with the approbation of the public ineffectually if after all my trouble i have not been able to show the true difference between words reputed synonymous and in vain if the book is found to be neither amusing or instructive     wave surge billow waves are the natural effect of the fluidity of a running water they are as applicable to rivers as the sea and leave the idea of a calm surges are applied properly to the sea only imply swoln waves and mark a small degree of agitation billows proceed from a more violent motion consequently denote a greater agitation they break into white foam and are attended with no little roar  we cut through the waves are lifted by the surges tossed and dashed by the billows  the life of some men may be aptly compared to the sharpkeeled vessel cutting through the waves leaving no noise or track behind it while that of others may be represented as tossed up and down on the windswoln surges of a boisterous fortune or dashed in pieces by the foaming billows of adversity     uproar tumult riot uproar conveys an idea of some great noise tumult and riot of some great disorder  the diference between the words tumult and riot is that tumult implies the rising of many people riot the disturbance of a few whereas an uproar may be occasioned by one single person  tumults and riots are always attended with such uproars as give umbrage to a peaceable neighborhood  houses of debauchery are subject to riots a tumult often happens in illpoliced cities     inclination propension bias these three words rise gradually inclination implying some thing less strong than propension propension than bias the first leads us to an object the second draws us the third drags us  inclination is greatly owing to education propension to custom bias to constitution  choice of company is essential to the education of youth because at that age they imbibe easily the inclinations of those whose company they keep it is a dangerous thing to give a loose to any one vice as frequent commission is apt to create strong propension persons of warm constitutions have a natural bias to venery  inclination is generally applied to good objects propension to bad thus we say the charitable man is ever inclined to assist his neighbor so deprayed is human nature that we have always a propension to vice  of two persons to be served a foreigner and a countryman we are generally biassed in favor of the last     should ought is necessary the first of these expressions implys more precisely an obligation of complaisance custom or personal interest thus we should not offend the company we are in we should follow the fashion we should know a man before we trust him the second denotes more particularly an obligation of reason and good sense thus we ought in every thing to give up to those who know better than ourselves we ought to serve them who have served us the third is more used to express an essential and indispensable obligation thus it is necessary to love god in order to be saved it is necessary to be complaisant to please     furthermore moreover besides furthermore is properly used when there is need only to add one more reason to those beforementioned its intent is to multiply and it has no relation but to number moreover is in its right place when used to add a reason of a different kind to those that went before its chief office is to add with a particular respect to diversity besides is used with propriety when we would strengthen by a new reason the force of those that were sufficient of themselves its principal office is to enhance by abundance  for a state to support itself those who govern should be moderate those who ought to obey governable furthermore the laws should be judicious there will always be war among men because they are naturally ambitious and are governed by interest moreover zeal for religion makes them rigid holy scripture teaches us the unity of the godhead and reason points it out to us besides all nature makes us perceive it     to manifest publish proclaim these three words imply open declaration but that of manifest seems to convey a proof of what is made known meaning to show incontestably publish denotes only a simple declaration but general to proclaim is to make known by a formal and legal publication  when once a man has lost his name let him manifest his good character as much as possible he will find it difficult to recover the good opinion of mankind for prejudice is blind even to the most visible truths he who publishes to the world the failings of another betrays in himself a want of humanity and is sure to meet with the contempt of every thinking man a famous sultan of egypt left to posterity a most remarkable testimony of the vanity of earthly grandeur for on his deathbed he commanded that his winding sheet should be carried at the end of a lance by a herald who was to proclaim here is all that this great prince will carry out of the world with him of his wealth dignity and dominion that he enjoyed upon earth  manifestos of a state are usually published by formal proclamation   0 to tell disclose reveal to divulge discover to make known that which is unknown is the common signification of those words but to tell is to declare things purposely with a design to inform those we would not have remain ignorant to disclose is to show either by design or inadvertency that which was before concealed to reveal is to lay open a secret to divulge is to do the same abroad to discover is the declaring a person to have done a thing which he would not have been thought the author of  so great an itch have some persons for prattling that they tell every individual thing they hear confidents too often disclose the intrigues they are entrusted with confessors reveal sometimes by their imprudence the confession of penitents the divulging of a secret has often done more harm than any other one thing whatever as it is impossible to smother what once has been blazed abroad if we would not be discovered we should be careful to have no witness of our actions     equivocation ambiguity doubleentendre equivocation has two senses the one natural in which we would have what we say understood and in which the hearer does absolutely understand us the other perverted understood only by the person speaking ambiguity has one general sense susceptible of different interpretations it always creates a difficulty in getting at the true sense of the author and sometimes an impossibility the doubleentendre a french word lately naturalized has two natural and apt significations one of which presents itself to the common understanding of all the world and by the other is made a fine allusion understood but by certain persons  these three ways of speaking are upon occasion ingenious methods of concealing ones true meaning but we make use of an equivocation to deceive of an ambiguity to keep in the dark from all and of a doubleentendre to conceal from some  it is beneath the character of an honest man to make frequent use of equivocations he that does being sure to meet with the contempt of mankind ambiguities are perhaps oftener the effect of a confusion of ideas than a studied design of keeping people in the dark we ought never to use them but when an elucidation would be dangerous malice and politeness have introduced the doubleentendre but it should never be used at the expense of our neighbors reputation     great big large the word great is a general term signifying any thing considerable either in bulk extent quality number etc thus we say a great house a great road a great weight a great many a great famine a great happiness the words big and large are more circumscribed big implies greatness of bulk large greatness of extent thus we say a big man a big stone but a large room a large field  a large man is as great an impropriety as a big field and we need only mention a big or large pleasure to show the absurdity     grave serious staid we are staid through discretion and custom grave through humor and constitution serious through taste and affectation  levity is the reverse of being staid vivacity of gravity wantonness of seriousness  aconstant round of business and continual transaction of affairs make us staid reflections on our latter end give gravity the desire of being thought grave seriousness     genius talent these are both born with us and are a happy disposition of nature by which we are qualified for some peculiar employment but genius seems to be more internal and possessed of the powers of invention talent more external and capable of execution  thus we have a genius for poetry and painting but a talent for speaking and writing  such as have a genius for mechanics may have no talent for watchmaking     people persons the word people is so very general that it cannot be connected with a determinate number as for instance four five or six people but that of persons may  to be pleasant at table none should be admitted but people of good humor neither should there be more than seven or eight persons  in order to describe a company we should know the quality of the people and the number of persons present  in all governments we find illaffected people and there are always among a number some discontented persons     to regard concern touch we say very indifferently without much choice that a thing regards us concerns us or touches us to mark the part we bear in it there nevertheless appears to me to be a delicate distinction between these three expressions each rising gradually above the other according to the rank in which i have placed them though we have the least part imaginable in a thing it may be said to regard us to concern us we must have a greater but when we are sensibly affected by it it may be said to touch us it seems also that the word regard is more applicable when our interest is in question that of concern when speaking of things committed to our care and conduct that of touch when it respects our honor of fortune  the illbehaviour of a servant to a customer regards the master as it affects his interest the least disturbance in europe in some measure regards every state it being difficult for any of them to keep a perfect neutrality for any length of time while the others are at war all the operations of government concern the first minister it concerns a man to be punctual in the discharge of his duty the conduct of a wife touches the husband so close that he ought to have an eye over all she does the behavior of an ambassador touches always more or less the honor of the prince the represents  many people make themselves uneasy at that which does not in the least regard them meddle with what no ways concerns them and at the same time are indifferent to those things which touch them nearly     tranquillity peace quiet these words let them be applied either to the soul to a republic or any particular society express equally a situation exempt from trouble and molestation but tranquillity relates to that within oneself and in the time present independent of any other relation peace to the situation with regard to enemies in whose power it is to make an alteration quiet with respect to time past or future as succeeding or preceding a situation troubled  uneasy people have no tranquillity in their families litigious persons are hardly ever at peace with their neighbors after a troublesome time we enjoy a quiet state with greater satisfaction  what a state of tranquillity does the religious man enjoy no outward things having the power to rufflle or discompose him to preserve peace we should keep ourselves always in a state of defense it is indulgence only that will establish quiet in a mutinous people     temple church both these words signify an edifice set apart for the public service of religion but that of temple is a more pompous expression and less in use than church with respect to the pagan religion we frequently use the word temple as the temple of apollo the temple of janus but with relation to our own seldom st pauls church st saviors church  temple seems to express something more august and signifies properly and edifice dedicated to the deity church something more common signifying particularly an edifice erected for the congregation of the faithful  the grandeur of solomons temple was beyond description nothing profane ought to enter the temple of the lord the present thinness of our churches is a manifest sign of a decrease in religion nothing ought to be permitted in church that does not contributed to the edification of christians     huge vast enormous immense the common idea of these words is something greatly beyond the usual measure but those of huge and vast relate more to such things as are material those of enormous and immense to such as are ideal with this difference between them that huge implies greatness in bulk vast greatness in extent enormous greatness in size even to deformity and dreadfulness immense unlimited extent even beyond expression thus we say a huge giant a vast tract of land an enormous crime the immense expanse  there are some promontories so huge as to shock the eye that views them the deserts of arabia are so vast that unless travelers carried their lodging and provision with them they would perish before they reached their journeys end the sins of the presumptuous wretch are so enormous that he can have little hopes of salvation but in the infinite mercies of an allgracious god so great is the immensity of the godhead as to exceed the utmost stretch of human thought   0 way road way is much more extensive and general than road and implies the passage from place to place whether through the high road or not road is much more limited and particular and means the beaten way of travelers from one town or city to another which says the traveller is our best way to hampton the hounslow road or kingston either road says his guide is good but when we come to twittenham the shortest way is across the fields though the pleasantest way would be to go by water  as the word way is often used to signify means which when considered as the intermediate step to attainment is not widely different from that of road when we would adopt the figure of traveling not to confuse our ideas we generally make use of the word road thus diligence with perseverance is the high road to preferment yet notwithstanding way is a much more elegant expression a strict adherence to the principles of christianity is the direct way to heaven     ways means we go the ways we use the means  ways are the methods we take means what we put in execution to succeed the first word enfolds in its idea honor and probity the last pays little or no regard but to the end aimed at thus good ways are those which are just good means those which are sure  simoniacal practices are very bad ways but very good means of obtaining benefices  i cannot avoid here taking notice of the ingrammatical impropriety of annexing the singular number to the word means the fault almost of every speaker and writer liberality say they is a sure means of becoming popular there is no better means of keeping in with the world than that of passing by affronts with composure  glaring absurdity since the word means is evidently plural and it would be much more elegant was the false concord avoided     often frequently one relates to the repetition of the same acts the other to a plurality of objects we often disguise our thoughts by doing the same thing often it becomes habitual we frequently meet with traitors we frequently do those things which we repent of afterward  there are two other words bearing an equal signification with often viz often and oftentimes but they being no more than the same word abbreviated and lengthened it is needless to take any further notice of them     cannot impossible one of these words more properly relates to inability the other to impossibility  we cannot serve two masters it is impossible to execute two opposite orders at the same time  we cannot love one by whom we have been injured it is impossible to love one to whom we have a natural aversion     glory honor glory expresses something more singular than honor the one makes us undertake voluntarily the most difficult things the other leads us willingly to the execution of the most rigorous exactions  quest of glory sometimes stimulates the soldiers courage even to rashness and notions of honor in spite of fear keep him often to his duty  an indifference to glory may pass unnoticed but not so with respect to honor  it is customary in conversation to place interest in opposition to glory and inclination to honor thus we say an author who labors after glory takes more pains in the completion of his piece than he who works merely for interest and when an avaritious man lays out his money it is more through honor than inclination     world universe world conveys only an idea of one single being though general that which exists universe an idea of many beings or rather that of all parts of the world all that exists the first of these words is sometimes used in the literal sense as when we say the old and new world and sometimes in a figurative as when we say in this world and in the other the wicked world the polite world the second is always used according to the letter and in a sense that excepts no one thing it is for this reason when we would express the universe by the term world that we are obliged to put the word all before it which we have no occasion to do by universe for example we should say the sun warms all the world and is the heat of the universe     answer reply the answer is made to a demand or a question asked the reply to an answer or a remonstrance  academics are taught first to start difficulties and then to answer them it is nobler to hear a wise remonstrance and profit by it than make any reply  the word answer is more extensive in its signification than reply we answer the questions of those who ask us the demands of such as expect our services the examination of counsel the arguments of disputants the letters we receive and for all our conduct the word reply is far more limited it supposes a dispute commenced from difference of sentiment we reply to the answer of an author whose works we have criticized to the reprimands of those whose correction we are unwilling to submit to to pleaders to an answer in chancery  an answer should be clear true and dictated by reason and good sense a reply strong and convincing armed by truth and strengthened by experience  we should teach children as much as possible to give nice and judicious answers and convince them that there is more honor in listening than in making replies to those who have the goodness to instruct them     danger hazard risk venture all these words imply chance of harm but that of danger relates to the evil that may happen those of hazard risk and venture to the good we may lose with this difference that hazard expresses something near risk something at a distance venture something farther off relating only to the possibility of events hence those expressions in danger of death in hazard of our life by giving a loose to debauchery we risk our health nothing venture nothing have  danger creates fear hazard alarm risk caution but we often venture with the greatest satisfaction  the avaritious man spurred on by interest fears no danger hazards his health and happiness runs every risk that attends his profession and gladly ventures his all in search of that which if obtained he would not have the spirit to enjoy     against in spite of both these denote opposition but the expression in spite of implies more resolution and greater force than the word against against supposing little or no resistance in the object opposed but in spite of a considerable struggle  we act against the will or against rule and in spite of oppositions  the good man does nothing against the dictates of his conscience the wicked man commits sin in spite of the punishment annexed to it  rashness will attempt things against all appearance of success and resolution will pursue the attempt in spite of all the obstacles it meets with     boldness audaciousness impudence effrontery there is a commendable holdness that proceeds from a selfconsciousness of worth but the holdness which is here meant springs from ignorance is brazen and presuming audaciousness is a greater degree of boldness such as is steeled against reproof is rude and noisy impudence consists in being an utter stranger to all kind of modesty is scurrilous and abusive effrontery proceeds from pride and selfsufficiency is overbearing and insolent  the bold are unawed by diffidence they speak with great assurance neither the quality or rank of those they address being able to disconcert them the more you reprove the audacious man the more it hardens him he wilfully forgets the respect due to his superiors and idly imagines his boisterous behavior a distinguishing mark of manhood the weapons of the impudent are sauciness and abuse which they take up at every turn and with which they lay about them in a most unmerciful manner as great a cause of effrontery as any is the want of education he whom it possesses is arrogant and insolent a stranger to goodsense and unacquainted with the rules of goodbreeding   0 profitable advantageous beneficial profitable is more applicable to gain advantageous to honor or any kind of convenience beneficial to health  some kinds of merchandise are far more profitable than others a good name is very advantageous as it serves to push us forward in the world loss of blood to a feverish person is very beneficial  light profits make a heavy purse a seasonable word spoke in favor is freuently of more advantage than the greatest services the greatest benefit to the soul is a sincere repentance     to see look at to behold view we see whatever strikes the sight we look at an object when we designedly cast our eye upon it we behold it when we look with attention we view it when we survey it  we see all objects before our eyes we look at those which excite our curiosity we behold such as cause our admiration we view those we are desirous to examine  we see distinctly or confusedly we look at near or at a distance we behold with wonder and attention we view with care and exactness  the eyes open to see turn to look at fix themselves to behold and move all ways to view  the connoisseur in painting looks at the first picture he sees if it be the work of a celebrated artist he beholds it with pleasure and views every part of it with the greatest minuteness     to stare gaze though the common meaning of these words is to fix both the eyes upon an object and look at it with wonder intently and earnestly yet there is a great difference between them staring implies looking with wonder and impudence gazing with wonder and respect  the impudence of some fellows is so great that they will stare a modest woman out of countenance  a man in love will sometimes gaze upon the object of his affections till he almost loses his sight  when our savior first appeared to his disciples after his resurrection they gazed on him with astonishment and rapture  to stare another in the face has always been considered as a breach of good manners     useful serviceable as nearly synonymous as these words may appear to be there is yet a manifest difference between them but the distinction is so delicate as to require some attention to discover it useful in my opinion is more applicable to things in use to those we have often recourse to and what cannot be well done without serviceable to things of service such as we oftener do without than with and such as we little expect to have thus furniture is useful memorandum books to persons engaged in a multiplicity of business are useful friends and good connections are serviceable  the plummet is so useful to the carpenter that to fix a perpendicular without it would give him a great deal of trouble of all animals a horse is the most serviceable  to those who take snuff a box is extremely useful but its contents very far from serviceable     gulf abyss what these words should express is rather imaginary than real they are generally used therefore in a figurative sense we are supposed to be swallowed up by a gulf and lost in an abyss the first carries with it an idea of insatiable voracity which drags in and consumes all that approaches the second of an unmeasurable depth to whose bottom we can never get and in which we lose at the same time the sight of the place from whence we came and of that where we are going  a gulf is supposed to have many turns and windings of which when we have once set a step in we cannot possibly get out but are carried on in spite of all our endeavors to the contrary an abyss is supposed to have many uncertain and obscure roads without end in which though we may sometimes stoop in hopes of finding a way out yet being deceived we become disheartened bewildered with doubts and overwhelmed with despair  a loose woman is a gulf of woe all perishes there virtue riches and health philosophy teaches us that man is continually wandering in an abyss of darkness     determination resolution determination is an act of judgment and supposes examination resolution an act of the will and supposes deliberation the first shuts out suspense the last wavering  our determinations should be just to avoid repentance our resolutions fixed to exclude variation  nothing is more disagreeable both to ourselves and others than to be always undetermined in our affairs and irresolute in our proceedings  it is more difficult to determine on points of precedence than on solid and real interests there are no weaker resolutions than those made at confession or on a sickbed the first return of health carrying us again into the same course of life  we may be determined and yet not resolved that is we may come to some decision and still not be so far resolved as to put that decision into execution fear timidity or some other motive may prevent us  the determinations of women are seldom better grounded than on whimsey or caprice men are so often led by taste and custom that their resolutions are generally vain  in science we say the determination of a point the resolution of a difficulty  the more we determine the less we prove though in the schools we answer every difficulty we resolve but few     old ancient antique these words rise one upon the other antique upon ancient and that of ancient upon old  a fashion is old when it ceases to be in use ancient when its use has been sometime past antique when it has been a long time ancient  that which is recent is not old that which is new is not ancient that which is modern is not antique  oldness agrees best with age ancientness with the origin of families antiquity with what existed in former times  as we grow old we decrease in strength but gain more experience  ancientness makes fashions disagreeable but adds splendor to nobility  antiquity destroys the proofs of history and weakens credit but renders monuments of greater value     general universal general implies a great number of particulars universal every particular  the government of princes has no object in view but the general good the providence of god is universal  an orator speaks in general when he makes no particular application knowledge is universal when it knows every thing  christianity is generally known and believed but not universally     word term expression nothing is more common than an indiscriminate use of these words and yet none differ more among themselves a word is a single part of speech is general and determined by use term is a particular cast of language owes its formation to the subject and its excellence to its suitableness expression is a certain mode of speech rises from thought and is more or less beautiful according to its particular turn  the purity of language depends upon its words the precision upon its terms and brilliancy upon its expressions  elaborate discourses require the words to be truly english the terms proper and the expressions noble  a word which has escaped us undesignedly sometimes has been attended with fatal consequences terms of art are now pretty generally known however they appear with little grace except in the mouths of the professors of those arts starched or farfetched expressions carry with them an air of pedantry     pile heap these words equally signify a quantity of things together one upon another with this difference that pile rather means things put up regularly whereas heap implies no other order in the arrangement than what rises from chance as a pile of wood a heap of rubbish  we say a pile of bricks when they are the materials prepared for building and a heap of bricks when they are the remains of a fallen edifice   0 departure death decease departure is a style more refined and carries with it an idea of the passage from one life to another death more common and signifies precisely extinction of life decease more studied is a term somewhat bordering upon the law and implies the refuge of mortality the second of these words is made use of with respect to all sorts of animals the other two to man only  a glorious departure is preferable to a shameful life death is the common lot of all things living succession does not take place till the moment of decease  departure presents nothing horrid to the imagination it indicates something agreeable in eternity decease conveys only an idea of trouble in being separated from things we are much attached to but death presents something dreadful and affrighting     value worth value rises from the intrinsic goodness of things worth from the estimation of them  of two things the best is the most valuable and that worth most that bears the greatest price     valley bottom vale dale of these four words valley implies a narrow space situated between two hills bottom a like space but quaggy and disagreeable vale signifies a space more extended whereas dale means rather low lands  the words dale and vale are oftener found in poetry valley and bottom in prose  valleys are for the most part winding and as they receive water from the hills on each side are generally converted into meads he whose house stands in a bottom cannot live on a more unhealthy spot a fine vale with beautiful enclosures bounded by rising woods is a delightful prospect dales are much easier to be ploughed than hilly lands     head chief the word head is reckoned synonymous only to chief when used in a figurative sense but even then it requires a different application head agrees best with respect to arrangement chief with regard to subordination thus we say the head of a batallion or a ship the chief of a party or an undertaking  a commander in chief is generally at the head of his troops     impediment obstacle obstruction there seems to be a gradation in these words the impediment stays the obstacle resists the obstruction puts an entire stop to  we say remove the impediment surmount the obstacle take away or vanquish the obstruction  even small impediments sometimes prove such obstacles as obstruct our best endeavors  the word impediment seems to express something rising from the nature and proper circumstances of what we are about that of obstacle something from a foreign cause that of obstruction something proceeding from a superior force  every temptation may be said to impede our resolutions to virtue the eloquence of demosthenes was the greatest obstacle that philip of macedon found in all his political undertakings and which he could never surmount but by force of arms nearness of kin is an obstruction to marriage which the laws have made and which those laws only can take away     learning literature erudition of all order of words there does not appear a more regular climax than in the above three which seems to be completed by the word knowledge but as that has never been accounted synonymous with these i shall take no notice of it here  learning implies simply that knowledge which we acquire by our common study at school literature denotes polite learning or an acquaintance with the belles lettres and is rather practical but erudition signifies great depth of knowledge with a particular relation to that which is speculative  without some degree of learning it is impossible to pass well through the world there was a time when the nobility piqued themselves on being men of literature a taste for erudition will furnish infinite amusement for a tranquil and retired life     to inquire interrogate ask we inquire we interrogate we ask in order to know but the verb inquire implies curiosity that of interrogate authority that of ask something more civil and respectful  the words inquire and interrogate make sense by themselves but to use the word ask with propriety we must add the matter to it that is to make the sense perfect we must mention the thing we ask  it is the business of a spy to make enquiries criminals are interrogated by the judge the soldier asks orders from the commanding officer     to shun avoid fly we shun those persons whom we would not see or by whom we would not be seen we avoid doing things that are disagreeable to us we fly both persons and things which we fear and dread  in the words shun and avoid which seem to have the nearest affinity to each other there is this standing difference that the word shun is generally applied to persons that of avoid to things  in order to fly we turn to the opposite side and get quick away to prevent being taken in order to shun we take another road getting slily away to avoid being seen or to escape a trap in order to avoid we use some extraordinary means  we shun troublesome company we avoid running into excess we fly those who pursue us  knowledge of the world makes us shun prudence makes us avoid fear makes us fly  the best remedy against the plague is to fly far from the place where it is the surest method of preserving our innocence is to shun bad company it is an act of the greatest weakness not to avoid doing those things which are detrimental to our interest     severity rigor severity shows itself chiefly in the manner of thinking and judging it condemns readily and admits of no excuse rigor is seen particularly in the manner of punishing it pardons nothing nor lightens the stroke  falsedevotees are severe only to others whom they are ever eager to condemn and are always applauding their own actions rigor can never be justifiable but at those times when example is of the utmost consequence yet even then some sort of allowance should be made for human frailty     to succor help to assist relieve we make use of the word succor in danger help in labor assist in want relieve in distress the first springs from a motive of generosity the second from good nature the third from humanity the fourth from compassion  we give succor in battle we help when we carry part of anothers burden we assist the poor and relieve the afflicted  the policy of states has found it necessary to succor each other when the power of any one of them is gaining too great a head very extraordinary things have been done by the joint help of numbers many a parent has beggared himself in advancing the fortune of his child it is therefore the indispensable duty of that child to assist his father to the utmost of his power the truly compassionate man receives as much inward satisfaction in relieving the distressed as he communicates   00 always continually perpetually that which we do always we do at all times and on all occasions that which is done continually is done without interruption or intermission but for a time limited whereas what is done perpetually is done also without intermission and without any regard to time  we should always prefer our duty to our pleasure it is impossible to be continually at work the heavenly bodies are perpetually in motion  to please in company we should always talk well but not continually the longitude may be discovered by perpetual motion   0  diversity variety diversity supposes a change which taste is always in search of in order to discover some novelty that may enliven and delight it variety supposes a plurality of things differing from each other in likeness which cheers the imagination apt to be cloyed with too great a uniformity  without some diversity life would be altogether insipid nature has thrown infinite variety among the smallest objects which if we cannot perceive is owing to a defect of light  an agreeable diversity of colors will give as much pleasure to the eye as harmonious sounds to the ear variety of amusements insensibly lead us into a dissipation   0  difference dispute quarrel opposition of interests causes differences contrariety of opinions produces disputes harshness of dispositions is the source of quarrels  we make up the difference we end the dispute we appease the quarrel  envy and covetousness make sometimes great differences for trifles prejudice and want of attention to what is said commonly prolong disputes quarrels for the most part proceed more from disposition than animosity   0  ill sick these two words are considered only as synonymous when they imply afflicted with disease but as indiscriminately as they may be used even in that sense still they convey different ideas marking different degrees of illness the word ill in my opinion is used with most propriety when health is the least impaired that of sick when the body is greatly diseased thus we say when we find a heaviness upon the spirits or a want of appetite that we are ill but when the whole frame of any one is disordered we naturally say he is sick  when we apply either of these words to ourselves they carry very different meanings thus i am ill is general and implies disordered in any part of the body whereas i am sick is particular and means disordered in the stomach  there is yet a further distinction between them ill is most applicable when in pain only sick when diseased thus we say he is ill of the gout but sick of a fever   0  disease distemper sickness disease and distemper imply particular disorders with this difference that disease is more applicable to man distemper to brutes whereas sickness is more general and may be applied to either  diseases such as the plague fevers etc are sometimes so epidemical as to lay waste more than the sword distempers among cattle are generally infectious divine displeasure has often shown itself by a general sickness among men and beasts  both diseases and distempers when become universal are sicknesses so severe as draw the joint prayers of a people in hopes to avert them   0  weary tired fatigued it is the continuation of the same thing that either wearies or tires with this difference that weary implies a less degree tired a greater but it is labor that fatigues we grow weary or tired with standing we are fatigued with work  when we are weary of a thing to complete it we lack spirits when tired we are totally unable when fatigued we want strength to go through it as we would  weariness proceeds sometimes from an unwillingness in what we undertake we are frequently tired through disposition of body and slow circulation of blood but fatigue is always the consequence of much action it supposes excess of work with respect either to difficulty or length of time  in a figurative sense a petitioner grows weary through his impatience tired through his perseverance and fatigued through his importunities  we are weary with waiting tired with illsuccess and fatigued with pursuing  thus may we be weary and not tired tired yet not fatigued   0  light brightness splendour light is the origin or commencement of brightness splendour is brightness in perfection  the intention of light is only to make objects visible that of brightness to make them clearly distinguishable and known splendour shows them to the greatest degree of perfection  it is light at daybreak bright in the morning splendid at noon  we attribute light to the stars brightness to the moon and splendour to the sun   0  luster brilliancy radiancy these three words as the last rise gradually one upon another and mark the different degrees of the effect of light  luster seems to be possessed of polish only brilliancy of light but radiancy of fire  luster shines only brilliancy dazzles but radiancy glares  we seldom make use of the word luster but in the literal sense whereas we frequently use that of radiancy and much more often that of brilliancy in the figurative considered then in this sense it appears to me that it is the force of truth the energy of language and the newness of the thoughts that give radiancy to a discourse whereas brilliancy rises from the beautiful turns and lively touches of expression and that it is the choice of words the agreement of terms and the arrangement of phrases that give a luster to what is said   0  wisdom prudence wisdom makes us act and speak properly prudence prevents our speaking or acting improperly the first in order to attain its ends searches out the best paths to follow the second that it may not miss its aim tries to discover the bad ways in order to avoid them  wisdom is more knowing prudence more wary  the wise man makes use of those means that are most proper for his purpose he conducts himself by the light of reason the prudent man takes those ways he thinks most sure he does not venture into places unknown  an ancient writer has said that it is a mark of wisdom not to talk on any subject but what we are thorough masters of especially if we would be esteemed we may add to this maxim that it is a piece of prudence not to bring a disagreeable subject on the tapis particularly if we are desirous of being beloved   0  to find meet with we find things unknown or which we sought after we meet with things that are in our way or which present themselves to us unsought for  the unfortunate find always some resource in their misfortunes people who readily unite themselves with all the world are liable to meet with bad company    0 union joining union relates particularly to two different things which agree together joining respects properly two distant things which draw near together one after the other  the word union carrys with it an idea of agreement and fitness that of joining seems to suppose some kind of motion  we say the union of colors and the joining of armies the union of two neighbors and the joining of two rivers  that which is not united is divided that which is not joined is separated  we unite in order to form a society we join for the sake of company  union is often used in a figurative sense but joining only in the literal  union is the support of families and the power of states the joining of many streams forms great rivers      situation condition state the words situation and condition imply something accidental and transitory with this difference that situation respects outward circumstances condition those within the matter referred to whereas that of state implies something more habitual and lasting  we generally use the word situation as relative to affairs rank or fortune condition with respect to the nature quality or property of a thing and that of state applying it to health or our well or illbeing  we say our situation is bad when we are surrounded with difficulties that a building is in bad condition when out of repair and that some persons enjoy but an indifferent state of health  an ill state of health added to a bad situation of affairs is a condition into which every man must naturally dread the falling  such is the condition and vicissitude of human life that the most prudent men have often found themselves in perplexing situations and from a state of happiness have as it were through the perverseness of fortune fallen into one most wretched and deplorable      of fashion of quality as synonymous as these expressions may be in the mouths of those who use them they still imply particular characters in their right signification when we are obliged on certain occasions to express ourselves properly the last of these expressions rises upon the first and signifies the nobility whereas by the other is only understood the gentry  the pride and folly of the world is grown to so great a pitch that persons in trade are continually apeing people of offashion and those offashion people ofquality      notes remarks observations notes imply a shortness and precision remarks a choice and distinction observations something critical and farfetched  notes are often necessary remarks are sometimes useful observations should be always learned  change of manners and customs for the most part render authors in want of notes there are as good remarks perhaps to be made upon the moderns as upon the ancients historical observations make antiquity more known      to take receive accept we take what is given us we receive what is sent us we accept what is offered us  we take money we receive favors we accept services  to accept implys always consent and approbation to receive does not to take excludes only refusal  no man should ever take more than his due we should always acknowledge those civilities we have received what we have once accepted should never afterward be rejected      sentiment opinion thought these words are all in use when the bare expression only of ideas is in question in this fense sentiment is more certain it is a belief raised by solid or apparent reasons opinion is more doubtful it is a judgment built on some foundation thought is still less certain springing only from conjecture  the word sentiment is used with more propriety when the subject is on taste that homer is an excellent poet is the sentiment of every man of learning the word opinion agrees best when talking of science it is the general opinion that the sun is the center of the world the word thought is more particularly in use when we are judging of the event of things or the actions of men politicians have long thought that the moscovians would find a greater advantage from asia than from europe  sentiments are in some measure guided by the influence of the heart we often find them in favor of those persons we love opinions are frequently owing to prejudice it is common for scholars to have good ones for their masters thoughts rise greatly from imagination they are often chimerical      resolution courage valor bravery intrepidity resolution either banishes fear or surmounts it it will not admit a falling back but is staunch on all occasions courage is impatient to attack it undertakes boldly and is not lessened by difficulty valor acts with vigor it gives no way to resistance but pursues its enterprise in spite of opposition bravery knows no fear it runs nobly into danger and prefers honor to life itself intrepidity encounters the greatest perils with the utmost coolness and dares even present death  the three first of these words seem more relative to action than the two last and the two last seem to imply a greater fearfulness of danger than the three first  resolution supports us in action courage makes us advance valor makes us execute through bravery we expose ourselves to danger we would sacrifice ourselves through intrepidity  resolution should never desert us courage should always determine us to do right valor would never make us despise the enemy bravery should not pride itself in opposition nor should intrepidity show itself but in cases of duty or necessity      angry in a passion passionate an impatient agitation or rising of the blood against any one who has offended us is the common import of the two first of these terms the word angry implies a passion more internal and lasting whereas the expression in a passion carries in its idea a sudden external gust of anger short but violent  anger shall sometimes brood in the breast for years till at last it becomes as it were fixed and settled sometimes it will dissemble for a long while together but often finds it extremely difficult to pardon on the contrary it is the general characteristic of those who are in a passion to forgive as soon as it subsides which may perhaps be the next quarter of an hour besides the man in a passion cannot dissemble his violence of anger must have vent when that is obtained he is as cool as before indeed his passion will now and then settle into confirmed anger but when that is the case it is generally owing to repeated offenses  with respect to the word passionate there is a wide difference between the man in a passion and the passionate man the one being extraordinary the other ordinary  few men for example can avoid being in a passion when they are greatly offended but passionate people are heated on the most trifling occasions      hasty passionate according to my conception it appears that hasty relates more to action or blows and that passionate goes seldom farther than words  a hasty man is apt to lift his hand it is generally with him a word and a blow a passionate man will vent his anger in words only  we should be upon our guard when with hasty people and have patience with the passionate      strong robust stout sturdy strength is chiefly owing to the construction of the muscles a little man is often stronger than a greater robustness carries with it an idea of lustiness is less subject to infirmities and much owing to constitution a short man may be robust by stout we understand tall and strongmade a little man though never so strong cannot be called stout by sturdy we mean stout with a degree of hardiness  strength gives a man an advantage over his enemies robustness lends him an air of dignity and authority stoutness makes him admired sturdiness is accompanied with an air of meanness    0 complaisant polite wellbred complaisance rises from the respect we show those whom we meet is sometimes sincere sometimes not politeness from the flattering methods we make use of in our behavior and conversation and is generally insincere but to be wellbred is to show the same honors always with sincerity  complaisance is the characteristic of the lover politeness of the courtier but to be wellbred denotes the gentleman  we should be complaisant without importunity and polite without insipidity the distinguishing mark of a wellbred man is the constant care he takes never to disgust or offend      humpbacked crocked deformed the true meaning of the word humpbacked is having a rising upon the back owing either to crookedness or some other cause and may be either natural or accidental though the words crooked and deformed convey other ideas still nothing is more common than to find them frequently in use to express the same as humpbacked by crookedness is understood any deviation from natural straitness deformity implies any part of the body being imperfect or unnatural thus a man is crooked if any ways twisted or bent from the natural shape and deformed if he has an eye a finger or a toe too little or too much we may be humpbacked or crooked by a fall or some other accident but deformed we cannot be otherwise than by a defect or exuberance in nature  a man may be deformed and not crooked crooked yet not hump backed      perfect finished complete perfection regards properly the beauty which rises from the design and construction of the work finishing from the workmanship and hand of the workman completion depends upon the want of nothing but on the works having every thing it should have the first excludes all sorts of defect the second shows a particular care and attention to the minutest article the third respects more the totality of parts  we may easily make a thing complete and with much pains finish it but after all it may not be perfect      misfortune disaster calamity each of these words denotes a sad event but that of misfortune is applied to casualties and outward circumstances things detached from us disaster respects properly personal accidents calamity implies something more general  it is a misfortune to lose our money or our friend it is a disaster to fall or be wounded it is a calamity to find ourselves suddenly disgraced and ruined in the world  we say a great misfortune a shocking disaster and a dreadful calamity  misfortunes will happen to the best of men we bring disasters frequently upon ourselves through want of proper care calamities are often sent by heaven upon the wicked to rouse them from their sinful lethargy      to consent acquiesce agree we consent to the will of others by permitting we acquiesce in what is proposed by conforming we agree to what is said by approving  we naturally oppose what we do not consent to discourage what we will not acquiesce in and dispute what we cannot agree to  it appears to me that the word consent supposes some authority in the person consenting that of acquiesce some submission in the person acquiescing and that the word agree denotes some aversion to dispute  parents consent to the marriage of their children parties acquiesce in the decree of a judge wellbred persons agree almost to every thing      management direction administration conduct government management respects only private things trusted to the care of some one to employ for the profit of another and to whom he is to render an account as that of a clerk to his master direction relates to certain affairs where there is a distribution either of money office or whatever else is committed to the care of another to preserve necessary order administration refers to objects of greater consequence such as those of justice or the finances of a state it supposes a preeminence of employ which gives power credit and a kind of liberty in the department the person is engaged in conduct points out some knowledge and ability with respect to things and a subordination with regard to persons government results from authority and dependence it indicates a superiority of office with a particular relation to policy  whosoever has the management of any ones concerns in trust should be as attentive and as careful as if they were his own he who undertakes the direction of public charities should divest himself of all prejudice and partiality a judge ought to be wisely circumspect in the administration of justice and a prime minister intently wary in the administration of public affairs no one thing should be committed to the conduct of another unless we are well persuaded he has abilities adequate to the task and will act in conformity to the intentions of him whose business he undertakes the man who through favor of his prince is offered the helm of government should seriously reflect on the arduous office and not suffer his ambition to get the better of his discretion      affront insult abuse affront is an arrow of reproach and contempt shot in public it piques and mortifies those who have any sense of honor insult is an attack made with insolence it is usually repelled with spirit both affronts and insults may be given without words but abuse results chiefly from scurrilous language  affronts are often given through the childish itch of revenge insults are too frequently the offspring of pride we seldom if ever hear abuse in the mouth of a wellbred man  happy is that person that can put up affronts with composure bear insults with calmness and turn a deaf ear to abuse      to in order to these terms are synonymous in that sense where they signify doing one thing in view of another but the word to denotes a nearer view the expression in order to one farther off  we get introduced to a prince to make our court we make our court to him in order to obtain his favors  the word to seems to agree best when what we do in view of some other thing is almost certain to take effect the expression in order to appears to be used with most propriety when the thing we have in view may not be the immediate consequence  we fire cannon against a besieged place to make a breach and in order to take it by assault or oblige the enemy to surrender  to respects more particularly an effect which ought to be produced in order to regards properly an aim which we would obtain  young women at a certain age do all they can to please in order to procure themselves husbands      outside appearance in the literal sense it is the walls the ditches the courts the gardens the avenues that forms the outside of a castle but it is the figures the grandeur the situation and the architecture that determines the appearance the outside being the external part of a thing the appearance the effect which a view of that thing produces or the idea we form of it by that view  in the figurative sense outside is oftener applied to our manners and our way of living appearance seems to be more in use with respect to our actions and our conduct  a brilliant outside is no certain proof of a good fortune going frequently to church is an appearance that can determine little with regard to virtue      vision apparition a vision passes inwardly in the mind and is supposed to be only an action of the imagination an apparition strikes the senses outwardly and is supposed to be an object from without  joseph was warned by a vision to fly into egypt with his family mary magdelen was informed of the resurrection of our savior by an apparition  feverish persons often think they see visions timid and credulous people sometimes take trees or posts for apparitions and frequently objects of their own imagination    0 to see perceive objects that have some duration or that show themselves are seen those that pass by quickly or are hid in some measure from the eye are only perceived  we see the face and by that perceive the disposition of the heart  in a crowded court those who stand forward are seen by the prince while others behind are scarcely perceived      to fear be apprehensive to dread be afraid we fear an ill through a natural aversion to it and from a sense that it may happen to us we are apprehensive of losing a benefit through an eager desire to obtain it and from a conviction that we never may we dread our adversary through sentiments of esteem when we know him our superior we are afraid of danger through a timid disposition  want of courage makes us fear doubt of success makes us apprehensive distrust of strength makes us dread imagination itself will often make us afraid  common people fear death more than any thing the epicureans were much more in fear of pain but gentlemen are of opinion they ought to fear nothing so much as infamy the more ardently we wish for a thing the more we apprehend the losing of it whatever merit an author may flatter himself that he has he should always dread the judgment of the public women who are afraid of nothing but losing their reputation do honor to their sex      to teach learn instruct to teach is only to give lessons to learn is to give lessons with success both which words relate more to those things that are proper to cultivate the mind and form a good education for which reason we use them with propriety when the arts and sciences are in question to instruct has a greater relation to that which is useful in the conduct of life and success of affairs it is therefore in its proper place when speaking of any thing that concerns either our duty or our interest  professors teach in public schools those who come to hear them the historian learns posterity the events of his times a father instructs his children how they ought to live in the world  it requires great knowledge to teach method and plainness to learn others experience and abilities to instruct  many persons attempt to teach what they have occasion to study themselves some will undertake to learn others what they themselves are almost ignorant of very few are capable of instructing      gentle tame gentle animals are naturally so tame ones are so partly by the art and industry of man  the dog the ox and the horse are gentle animals the bear and the lion are sometimes tame      to bind tie we bind to prevent the limbs moving or the parts of a thing separating we tie to stop a thing or prevent its going any farther  we bind the feet and hands of a criminal and we tie him to a stake  in the figurative sense a man is bound when he is not at liberty to act and he is tied when he cannot change his party or quit it  authority and power bind interest and love tie  we do not think ourselves bound when we see not our bonds and we do not imagine ourselves tied when we have no occasion to use our liberty      to hope expect the first of these words has for its object success in itself and denotes a trust born up by some encouragement the second regards particularly the happy moment of event and intimates a certainty of its arriving we hope to obtain things we expect their coming  we should always hope for the indulgence of heaven and expect without murmuring the hour of providence  what we hope for seems to be more a favor or a kindness what we expect more a duty or obligation thus we hope for favorable answers to our demands and we expect such as are agreeable to our propositions  i hope my work will meet with the taste of the public and i expect an equitable sentence      weight influence sway taking these words in the sense of having power over the minds of others weight implies prevalence though small influence seems to have more force sway is more absolute  superiority of rank and reason gives weight it is commonly by persuasion that it acts attachment to persons contributes much to the influence they have over us it is by solicitation it prevails the art of finding out and taking advantage of the weakness of men forms the sway we bear over them it is by watching their motion that we succeed  the weight we have with others proceeds always from some worth in ourselves either of mind birth or fortune influence is owing to some tie either of heart or interest sway rises from an ascendency arrogated by art or ceded to us through weakness  a person of weight has succeeded sometimes when arguments would have no force influence on some occasions has wrought almost miracles effecting that which money could not bring to bear sway is a wonderful operator on weak minds procuring that through art which no other thing can possibly obtain  what perverseness then can possibly withstand a man of some weight in himself whose influence is great and who knows how to bear a proper sway      authority power dominion we find in the word authority sufficient energy to make us perceive a right either of civil or politic administration there is in the word power a particular relation to the subordinate execution of superior orders the word dominion carries with it an idea of empire  it is the law which gives authority it deriving all its might from thence power is invested in delegates those to whom the execution of the laws is entrusted and is consequently in subordination to authority dominion springs from the joint consent of the people or from the force of arms and is either lawful or tyrannical  we are happy in living under the authority of a prince who prides himself in justice whose ministers assume no power beyond what is legal and who makes the welfare of his subjects the basis of his dominion  authority if weak is exposed to contempt it is equally as dangerous not to make use of it on proper occasions as even to abuse it a blind power which acts in opposition to justice becomes odious and paves the way to its own ruin a jealous dominion that admits of no sharer makes itself formidable awakens on that aocount the ardor of its enemies and thus ushers in its own fall  there appears to me particularly in the idea of authority something just and respectable in the idea of power something strong and active and in the idea of domiuion something great and elevated  as there is none but god that has an unlimited authority so there is none else who has infinite power neither is there any absolute sovereign and independent dominion than his  nature has established no authority among men but that of fathers over their children all other proceeds from positive right the power of the passions is the true spring of action and determines us with respect either to good or evil it is not only by the disposition of human laws that marriage places the woman under the dominion of the man but it is also so settled by the divine      volume book a volume may contain many books a book may make many volumes the binding properly distinguishes the volumes and the division of the work the books  we must not always judge of the knowledge of an author by the largeness of the volume works are sometimes spread out into many books which would be more valuable were they reduced to one      to have a mind for long for wish for to hanker after lust after the last of these expressions is more used in theology and supposes always an illicit object forbid by the laws of god thus we lust after a woman or the goods of another the others are all in common use and express our inclination to a thing be it what it will with the following difference between them we have a mind for or long for a present object but have a mind seems attended with more knowledge and reflection long for more opinion and more taste we wish for things farther distant we hanker after things that more affect us  princes sometimes have a mind to gratify their ambition at the expense of their future welfare women with child frequently long for most things they see lazy people often sit down and content themselves with wishing for those things they would presently obtain if diligent and assiduous some children will hanker a long time after their nurses and it is with the greatest difficulty they can be brought to forget them    0 gain profit lucre emolument gain seems to arise from something very casual and implies risk and hazard it is for this reason the word is in great use among gamesters and tradesmen profit appears to be more sure proceeding either from lands or industry thus we say the profits of the earth or the profits of our labor the characteristic of lucre consists in a simple relation to the passion of interest it is on this account we say with the greatest propriety that man is fond of lucre emolument relates to commissions and employments intimating not only the salaries but all other perquisites  some persons are so particularly rigid as to condemn all gain arising from play many will idly call that profit which has accrued by illicit means it is low and sordid to be ever led by lucre we do not always find the greatest honor in offices where there is the greatest emolument      very extremely we are apt to use these words indifferently one as well as the other to express a great degree of any thing thus for example we say in the same sense very wise extremely wise notwithstanding this there appears to me some difference between them the word very marks an extraordinary degree but extremely a degree to admiration thus we say men are very wicked providence is extremely kind  besides this distinction there is one more delicate which is that very does not suit well but in the literal and natural sense for when we say a man is very wise we would be understod as saying truly wise whereas extremely may be used with elegance in an ironical sense we say then in raillery he is extremely wise in ceasing to pursue that he knows not how to get at and extremely patient in taking a blow calmly he has not the spirit to return      fantastical whimsical maggotty fanciful of these words that of fantistical implies a rambling from true taste through excess of delicacy or an unseasonable search after something better that of whimsical means an affectation of singularity by maggotty is understood a great inconstancy or sudden change of taste fanciful implies a certain revolution of humor or a particular way of thinking  there cannot be a more despicable creature than the fantastical fop he tricks out his charming self in hopes of attracting the respect of mankind but on the contrary meets only with scorn and contempt the whimsical man if his invention be fertile is sometimes an object of present admiration but on serious reflection is too frequently the subject of ridicule a maggotty person is equally tireforne to himself and to others as what pleases him one minute shall often displease him the next he who is fanciful is far more troublesome to himself than to others for being led away by his wild imagination he fondly believes many things to be real which in fact are only ideal      capacity ability capacity has more relation to the knowledge of things ability to their application the one is acquired by study the other by practice  he who has capacity for a thing is proper to undertake he who has ability to execute      little small the word little sometimes signifies only want of bigness and at other times want of greatness in every sense whereas that of small is the opposite only to bigness and supposes some kind of length thus we say a little house a little man a little cup a little globe but a small thread a small line a small twig      to remark observe to remark implies taking notice with attention in order to remember to observe means rather to watch with examination by way of passing our judgment  the traveller remarks that which strikes him most the spy observes those proceedings which he thinks of consequence  it is the part of a general to remark those of his men who distinguish themselves in battle and observe the motions of the enemy  we may observe in order to remark but custom will not admit of an inversion of the phrase  those who observe the conduct of others in order to remark their faults do it rather through a delight in censuring than a desire of correcting their own errors      to go back return we go back from a place where we have some considerable time been we return to a place we had just before left thus we say he is gone back into his own country he is returned home we say also he is gone back from virtue he has returned to his fault      idea thought imagination notion the idea represents the object thought considers it imagination forms it thus worked up it becomes a notion the first only points the second examines the third seduces but the last draws  when in conversation our ideas are just our thoughts fine and our imaginations brilliant we shall be sure to please and our notions though singular will always be respectable      business affairs business implies an object of industry affairs an object of concern the first employs the hands the second the mind the word business by its having no plural number intimates a particular employ by the singular of affairs being seldom in use in the sense before us that word is understood to mean a variety of transactions  the man of much business ought to have a strong constitution he who has many affairs to settle though he may have a clear head will find it difficult to adjust them all to his satisfaction  he who continually interferes with the business of others neglecting his own affairs makes himself an object of ridicule and merits the contempt of mankind      to take choose when we would take a thing we determine upon one because we cannot have all we choose by comparing things because we would have the best the one supposes a simple determination of the will the other a discernment of the mind  between two things exactly alike we may determine which to take when at the same time there is no choice  we are sometimes constrained to take one thing out of many when we are not obliged to choose  we cannot use the word take but with respect to ourselves but we choose sometimes for others  it is a point of goodmanners when offered fruit or any other thing where there is choice to take that which comes first to hand but when we would present any thing of the like sort to a stranger it is a mark of politeness to choose for him the best  when things are at our option that is when we may take which we please we should try to make a good choice  between a good course of life and a bad there is no medium we must either take the one or the other nothing appears more difficult to me than the choice of a friend  if in a journey there were only two roads to take the one short but bad the other long but good i should certainly choose the last    0 to choose make choice of the word choose is most in its place with respect to things we would make use of the expression make choice of is more proper when it relates to persons we would appoint to any dignity or employ  george the third chose the queens palace as his place of residence in town and made choice of caesar hawkins to inoculate his children  to choose indicates more particularly a comparison made between things in order to know which is best to take to make choice of marks with greater precision the simple determination of one person preferable to another  princes do not always choose their ministers neither do they always make choice of a talbot for a chancellor nor a marlborough for a general      to choose prefer we do not always choose what we prefer but we ever prefer that which we choose  to choose is to determine in favor of a thing either on account of its merit or its value to prefer is to determine in its favor by any motive whatsoever whether it be merit affection goodmanners policy or what not  it is the judgment that makes the choice the heart that gives the preference it is for this reason that we commonly choose what we are acquainted with and prefer what we love  prudence sometimes forbids our choosing that which strikes the eye most justice will not often permit us to prefer our friends to other people  in choosing a state of life i think there can be no harm in preferring that which is most agreeable to our inclinations as in so doing we should naturally find more satisfaction in our duty  choice is either good or bad according to our taste or the knowledge we have in things preference is either just or unjust as reason dictates or passion inspires  partial preference is sometimes allowed to princes in the distribution of their honors but they should always make choice of the ablest men in their appointments to public offices      meat flesh by the word meat is understood any kind of food but flesh signifies only the natural composition of an animal thus we say that fish and vegetables are proper meats for lent and that the flesh of a partridge is very white and tender  grain is the meat of birds flesh the food of beasts      reformation reform reformation signifies often the action of reforming reform seldom any other than the effect  a general reformation of manners among the people will ever be found a very difficult and laborious task when we have not been able to complete a thing to our satisfaction by any sort of amendment we have often brought it to bear by a thorough reform      smooth level that which is not rough is smooth that which is free from either hollows or risings is level  the smoothest marble is the best a country where there is neither hills nor valleys is level      to fade wither of these two words wither rises upthat of fade a flower which is faded may recover but that whichis withered can not  beauty like a flower fades through length of time and may wither suddenly by an accident      prerogative privilege prerogative relates to honor and personal preference it rises principally from subordination or from the relation persons bear among themselves whereas privilege implies some advantage from interest or office proceeding from the grant of a prince or the laws of a society  birth gives prerogatives offices give privileges      knowing discerning the knowing man acts surely he seldom deceives himself yet knowledge of life only is his fort the discerning man is clearsighted and judicious sees through the artifices of mankind with half an eye and will not suffer himself to be deceived his great abilities consist in distinguishing  the study of man will make a person knowing but it requires great experience and a long attention both to men and books to render him discerning  an artful ingenious rogue will sometimes take in the knowing by a novel deceit through the fallacy of which the discerning man shall readily penetrate      order regularity each of these words implies a prudent disposition of things but that of order relates more to the effect which results from such a disposition that of regularity more to the power and to the model that conducts that disposition  we observe order in conformance to regularity the first is the effect of the second      traffic trade commerce traffic relates more to the exchange of merchandise trade and commerce to that of buying and selling with this difference that trade seems to imply the manufacturing and vending of merchandise within ourselves commerce negociating with other countries  we traffic with nations that have not the use of money by bartering one kind of merchandise for another trade is looked upon by the wisest of men to be the support of every state as the prosperity of a kingdom depends in a great measure upon its riches and riches is the immediate effect of trade the great and extensive commerce that england holds with other nations makes us the glory and admiration of the world    0 exchange truck barter the word exchange means simply in a general sense the act of exchanging one thing for another be it what it may the other two are in use to denominate the particular kinds or methods of exchange of which this is the difference that the word truck is used with most propriety when speaking of serviceable things such as are moveable as the trucking of horses trinkets utensils etc whereas barter is a more mercantile expression and intimates the exchange of different commodities by way of traffic thus so little are the natives of guinea acquainted with the value of gold that they hold commerce with other nations by bartering it away for glass and other trifling ornaments      regard esteem veneration respect when we entertain a good opinion of a man we are said to regard him when that regard increases we call it esteem we testify that esteem by veneration and prove it by submission through respect  we have a natural regard for a quiet neighbor we esteem him if he studies the good of the neighborhood if we perceive in him any eminent qualities we hold him in veneration and in proportion to the rank he is in above us either by birth or fortune we treat him with less or greater respect  being born in the same country claims regard civility creates esteem age and merit render venerable rank and dignity respectable      retinue train retinue implies a number of followers train the same with order thus his coach was attended with so great a retinue that there was no seeing the carriage for dust it was customary in a roman triumph to have always a number of captive slaves in the train      occasion occurrence conjuncture case circumstance occasion is used for the arrival of something new whether it be that which presents itself or what we seek and in a sense as indeterminate with respect to time as the object occurrence is only in use to express that which happens unexpectedly and with relation to the time present we make use of the word conjuncture to mark a situation proceeding from a concurrence of events whether of business or interest case is employed to signify the main point with a special reference to the sort and singularity of the thing in question circumstance carries with it no other idea than that of something additional accompanying another which is principal  we know people on particular occasions we should demean ourselves according to the occurrence of the times it is commonly the conjunctures that determines us which side to take it has been pretended that there are cases in which reason would condemn even an attention to virtue diversity of circumstances will make the same man think differently upon the same subject      uncertainty doubt suspense in that sense in which these words are accounted synonymous they all three imply indetermination but uncertainty rises when the event of things is unknown doubt when the mind knows not how to choose by suspense is understood an indetermined state when the mind is held in expectation  we are in uncertainty with respect to the success of our proceedings in doubt what step to take in suspense when we are held from acting by a delay of certainty  uncertainty requires caution doubt consideration suspense patience  a wise man is seldom uncertain as to what shall happen he foresees future events and prepares himself for them when we are in doubt and at a loss to determine we should leave the matter to the decision of others of all states of indetermination that of suspense is the most vexatious and the only remedy is a quiet resignation      right justice right is the object of justice and that which is due to every one justice is the conformity of our actions with right it is to render and secure to every one that which is his due the first is dictated by nature or established by authority either divine or human and is according to circumstances sometimes liable to change the second is the rule we should always follow and is ever invariable  it is consistent with the laws of justice to use the same means in support and defense of our rights as are often employed to attack them      dejected melancholy lowspirited dull dejection is commonly caused by great affliction and is too often a mark of despair melancholy is generally the effect of constitution its cloudy ideas overpower and banish all that are cheerful lowspiritedness is involuntary and often proceeds from a weakness of nerves excess of joy fatigue bad digestion will occasion it dullness on the contrary is voluntary it arises frequently from discontent disappointment and from any other circumstance that may displease the mind  the mind in dejection is unhappy not having sufficient strength and reason to get the better of it melancholy will sometimes wear away by frequent diversion and dissipation a person subject to lowspirits should pursue a regular course of life and a uniform method of living dullness is increased by giving way to it it is in our power to banish it whenever we please and the damp it throws on every company one would imagine should be our greatest inducement to do it  the reverse of dejection is joy the reverse of melancholy cheerfulness gaiety is the opposite to lowspiritedness and sprightliness to dullness      piercing penetrating the word piercing implies great strength of light and a stroke of the eye that of penetrating great force of attention and reflection  a piercing mind sees things even through the veils that cover them it is difficult to conceal truth from it it will not suffer itself to be deceived a mind that penetrates reaches to the bottom of things without stopping at the surface it is not easy to deceive it neither will it suffer itself to be amused  besides the above distinction piercing seems to be executed by a sudden glance penetrating by making way gradually      to put place put seems to have a general sense place one more limited meaning to put orderly and in a proper place  we put columns to support an edifice we place them with symmetry      discernment judgment discernment relates not only to a thing itself but also to its appearances and is a distinguishing knowledge that prevents the confounding of one thing with another judgment relates to a thing considered in itself only in order to investigate the truth and is a knowledge that determines the first is limited to things present its office is to discern truth from falsehood perfections from defects motives from pretexts the second prys even into futurity discovers the relation and consequence of things foreseeing their effects in short we may say of discernmeut that it is knowing that it renders our ideas just and of judgment that it is wise that it makes our conduct discreet  when choice or determination with respect to the goodness or beauty of objects is in question we should have recourse to those who have discernment when we would take any step of consequence we should take the advice of such persons as have judgment  arts and sciences require discernment which is more or less nice according to the delicacy of the understanding or the extent of knowledge government and the policy of states demand judgment which is more or less sure according to the force of reason and the length of experience    0 satisfied contented we are satisfied when we have obtained what we wished for we are contented when we wish not for any more  it happens often that when well satisfied we are not the more content  possession will always prove satisfactory but it is the true enjoyment only of what we possess that can make us content      tale novel romance story each of these words implies a small history or an entertaining relation of adventures the three first are supposed to be fabulous and made public whereas the last may be either true or feigned and told either in print or by word of mouth but as they carry ideas peculiar to themselves it is my business to point them out by the word tale then is meant a short but dressedup narrative of some single adventure that of novel signifies an amusing history made up of many adventures and carried on through one or more volumes by romance is understood a collection of wild adventures in love and war  tales ought to be well related novels well invented romances well carried on stories well told  tales if attended with good morals are not only amusing but instructive novels are of no other use than to entertain they waste the time without making the least improvement romances spoil the taste of young people who by an attention to them are apt to prefer the mavelous to the natural and simple truth a droll story told with humor is a great enlivener of company      continuance continuation continuance relates to duration continuation to extent  we should study a conscientious discharge of our duty during our continuance in any office the several books contained in the volume of paradise lost are continuations of the same subject      continual continued there may be an interruption in that which is continual but that which is continued will not admit of it so that the first of these words denotes properly the length of duration although there may be intervals and different renewals and the second marks simply the unity of that duration independent either of length or shortness of the time it is for this reason we say a continual noise continual rains but a continued stream and in music a continued base  continual interruptions will make us weary of the best undertakings in countries situated near the poles there is for the space of five or six months together one continued darkness insomuch that the inhabitants during that time are obliged to leave the place      to bid order the first of these is extremely general the other more limited to bid intimates direction to perform whether the person directing has any authority for so doing or not to order implies the exercise of authority  some people are so very officious that they are always ready to do what they are bid whether the thing be right or wrong or the person bidding be empowered to order them or not      yet in the mean while however nevertheless yet seems to have more force and energy it assures with firmness in spite of every opposition in the mean while is less absolute it affirms only against contrary appearances however distinguishes two things which seem opposite supporting one without hurting the other nevertheless affirms a thing by exception giving us to understand that it does not occur but at the time we are speaking  though the whole earth is in arms against truth yet it does not prevent its triumphing some parents are very strict with respect to the morals of their children in the mean while will indulge themselves in every thing their own heart can wish addison was a wretched speaker however he was an excellent author churchill every one knows was a bad liver nevertheless he was of some service to his country by ridiculing vice and lashing venality      excellency excellence notwithstanding these words are evidently the same excellence being no other than excellency contracted or the redundant syllable general in old writing taken away yet custom seems to have applied excellency to express the title of a govenour or that of an ambassador from one prince to another whereas by excellence is understood the state of abounding in any good quality      pride arrogance vanity presumption haughtiness pride is unreasonable or inordinate selfesteem arrogance implies taking much upon ourselves and is pride attended with insolence and contempt vanity is accompanied with affectation and means pride exerted on slight grounds by presumption is understood a blind and adventurous confidence with respect to haughtiness it is a mixture of softness and insolence the immediate effect of pride  the haughtiness of the proud man is insufferable pride makes us value ourselves arrogance despise others through vanity we covet the attention of our acquaintance presumption flatters us with having a vain power  the proud consider themselves in their own mind full and selfswoln they are taken up with their own person the arrogant claim to themselves what they have not the least pretentions to are ready to insult those who will not allow them what they claim and look down on the rest of the world with contempt the vain value themselves upon the opinion of others greedy of esteem they are eager to engross the attention of all mankind the presumptious carry their audacious hopes even to chimeras bold to undertake they fondly imagine they have power to do every thing  the greatest pain we can possibly give the proud man is by laying his defects before his eyes we cannot hurt the arrogant so much as by silent contempt we cannot mortify a vain man more than by paying no attention to those qualifications or qualities he prides himself in in order to confound the presumptuous we need only desire him to put his vain designs in execution      cure remedy we perform a cure we procure a remedy the first relates more to the malady and to the action of him who heals it the second has more relation to health and the state of the malady we heal we say of a cure that it is fine when its success does honor to the person who formed it and we say of a remedy that it is certain or sure when its operations are efficacious that is when it produces those consequences we intended and we say of both that they are either easy or difficult  cure seems to have no other object than stubborn disorders and those which proceed from constitution whereas remedy has a view to slight complaints and such as are of short duration  the more inveterate the disorder the more difficult the cure in many cases regular living is the best remedy  the word cure is often considered as the effect of remedy some remedies will complete a cure much sooner than others  incurable disorders are not only those where the cure is absolutely impossible bu such as for which no remedy can be found      haughtiness disdain both these words denote a disposition that prevents affability and keeps us at a distance from those whom we think beneath us either in birth fortune or abilities with this difference that haughtiness is founded upon the esteem a man has for himself and disdain upon the disesteem he has for others  haughtiness is seldom met with but in persons of weak understanding and those who have had a bad education there are a sort of vain people who look upon disdain as a personal accomplishment and who use it on all occasions as a test of the merit they pretend to    0 sloth laziness sluggishness sloth and laziness are voluntary with this difference that sloth implies utter inactivity an absolute aversion to work laziness an inclination but a fear of trouble and fatigue whereas sluggishness is often involuntary proceeding sometimes from constitution and is discovered by its dull heavy method of acting  the slothful man will not work at all the lazy man is drawn to it with difficulty the sluggish man is slow through the whole operation  industry is the reverse of sloth activity of laziness expedition of sluggishness  he who is slothful is a murderer of time laziness is its own punishment a sluggish person is fit for no kind of employment seldom doing any thing well he undertakes      harm hurt injury detriment mischief these words imply some kind of ill happening to a mans person character or property those of harm and hurt relate more to the person or character with this difference that harm seems to denote a small degree of hurt hurt a great degree of harm mischief implies ill to the person or property and appears ever to be done with an evil intent injury intimates a degree of hurt without justice and relates to the character or property detriment carries an idea of loss and is seldom used but with regard to property  by wounding a man more or less we harm or hurt his person by speaking ill of him deservedly or not we harm or hurt his character by breaking his head or setting fire to his house we are said to do him a mischief by taking away his good name we injure his character by defrauding him of his goods we injure him in his property by breaking a hedge or treading down of corn we do a great deal of detriment      quickly soon speedily the word quickly seems more proper to express the motion with which we act its reverse is slowly the word soon respects the time when the action is performed its reverse is late the word speedily has a greater relation to the time we employ about a thing its reverse is longtime  we advance the more by going quick but we go surely by going slowly wickedness is always punished either sooner or later it is necessary to be a longtime deliberating but we should execute speedily  he who begins soon and works quick will speedily have done      assiduous expeditious quick when we are assiduous at work we lose no time when expeditious we defer not but finish immediately when quick we work with activity idleness delay and slowness are the three defects opposite to these three good qualities  an assiduous man thinks nothing of the trouble of what he takes in hand an expeditious man will not quit his work one that is quick will presently have done  we should be assiduous in what we undertake expeditious in affairs that require to be soon ended and quick in the execution of orders      now instantly immediately presently the doing a thing now expresses the taking it in hand at that very instant the other three words as they are here placed express a time farther and farther off instantly implies without any perceptible intervention of time immediately means without delay by presently is understood soon after      fashion custom these two words like many others i have taken notice of though they may not strike the reader at first sight as words reputed synonymous have nevertheless been used as such by some of our best writers and are at present it is therefore necessary to point out the difference between them fashion then seems more universal custom more ancient that which the greater part of the people practice is a fashion that which has been practiced a long time is a custom  fasion introduces itself and extends daily custom establishes itself and gains authority the first forms the mode the second a usage each is a kind of law independent on reason with respect to that which relates to our outward actions  there is sometimes more policy in conforming to a bad fashion than being singular in some good things many persons follow custom even in their way of thinking imbibing the notions of their mothers and nurses      variation change variation consists in being as much of one sort as another change consists only in ceasing to be the same  we vary in our sentiments when we give them up and embrace them again we change our opinions when we reject one in order to embrace another  he who has no certain principles is liable to vary he who is more attached to fortune than truth will find no difficulty in changing his doctrine      variation variety successive changes in the same subject make variation a multitude of different objects forms variety thus we say the the variation of time variety of colors  there is no government but is subject to variation there is no species in nature in which we may not observe great variety      track footstep track is more general meaning any mark left on the way of whatever passed footstep is more limited implying the print of the feet thus we say the track of a horse or a carriage but the footsteps of a man      fickle inconstancy unsteady changeable the attachments of the fickle man are slight those of the inconstant of short duration as to the words unsteady and changeable they imply an aversion in adhering to the same thing with this difference that the unsteady man is eager to enjoy many things the changeable man is in constant search of different ones  men are commonly more sickle and inconstant than women but women more unsteady and changeable than men the first err through indifference the second through a love of novelty consequently it is a merit in men to persevere and in women to resist    0 rogue sharper thief these are all persons who steal what does not belong to them with this difference that the rogue steals in secret he pilfers the sharper steals by finesse he overreaches the thief steals by all manner of means robbing by force and violence  the rogue fears to be discovered the sharper to be known again and the thief to be taken      intention design intention is a disposition or inclination of the mind to something at a distance its characteristic is to aim design seems to suppose something studied and methodical it is employed in searching out the means of execution  intentions are more secret and vague designs more extensive and more rational  intention is the soul of action and the spring of true worth design is the effect of reflection  as no one cares to be balked in his intentions or crossed in his designs we should have no other intention than to do our duty nor any other design than to conform to the will of providence  nothing is less followed than the original intention of charitable foundations nothing has been found more difficult to accomplish than the design of bringing about a thorough reformation of manners  that man is truly great who is right in his intentions and reasonable in his designs      unpolite clownish it is a much greater defect to be clownnish than to be barely unpolite  unpoliteness is a want of goodmanners it does not please clownishness is a mixture of illmanners it displeases  clownishness proceeds from an entire want of education unpoliteness is owing to a bad one      to tolerate suffer permit we tolerate a thing when knowing it and having sufficient power we do not hinder it we suffer it by making no opposition but seeming either not to know it or not to have the power of preventing it we permit it when we authorize it by formal consent  the words tolerate and suffer are never used but with respect to bad things or such as we believe so whereas the word permit relates either to good or bad  the legislative power is sometimes obliged to tolerate certain evils in order to prevent worse it is sometimes prudence to suffer even abuse in the discipline of the church rather than destroy its unity human laws never will permit what the divine law forbids but sometimes forbids what the other will permit      gay merry diverting we are gay by disposition merry through turn of mind diverting by our way of acting sad serious and tiresome are exactly their opposites  our gaiety turns almost entirely to our own advantage our merriment at the same time that it is agreeable to others it is no less so to ourselves but our being diverting is enjoyed only by the company  a gay man will laugh himself a merry man is good company a diverting man will make us laugh  we should if possible suppress our gaiety when in the house of affliction we should cease to be merry when others are sad we should take care not to be diverting at the expense of our character or goodsense      enmity rancour enmity is more declared it seems always open rancour is more concealed it generally dissembles  bad services and rude language create enmity which never ceases till tired out with punishing or a reconciliation is brought about by the intercession of friends remembrance of injuries or affronts received keeps rancour alive in the breast which never subsides while there is the least thirst of vengeance or till we pardon sincerely  enmity does not always destroy our esteem for an enemy nor prevent our doing him the justice he is entitled to but it will not admit of our caressing him or doing him any good otherwise than through a sense of honor or greatness of soul to which we sometimes sacrifice our vengeance rancour makes us embrace with pleasure every opportunity of revenging ourselves but can hide itself with the cloak of friendship till the very moment it begins to act  enmity is sometimes noble and it would be mean not to conceive it against certain persons but rancour is always low  a settled enmity in families sometimes runs through many generations and will not cease till time shall obliterate it perfect reconciliations are very rare there remaining often a great deal of rancour in the breasts of those who seem most sincere  a philosopher should have no object of enmity but the disturbers of public tranquillity if rancour can in any case be excusable it must be with respect to traitors their crime being too black to be thought of without indignation      to insinuate suggest we insinuate by cunning and address we suggest by credit and artifice  in order to insinuate we must consult both time and opportunity in order to suggest it is necessary to have ascendancy over the minds of persons  insinuate implies something delicate suggest frequently something fraudulent  we cover artfully what we would insinuate and what we would suggest we make of some consequence  we often imagine that what others insinuate was first thought of by ourselves he who suggests evil to another is much more culpable than he who commits it      ordinary common these words have been reputed synonymous in two senses as implying frequent use and meaning of little or no value but they are different in both in the first sense the word ordinary seems to me to be best applied when the repetition of actions is in question common when a multitude of objects thus nothing is more ordinary at court than dissimulation monsters are common in africa  in the second that which is ordinary has nothing to distinguish it that which is common has nothing to make it sought after      to hear hearken to hear implies having the ear struck with any sound to hearken means to lend an ear in order to hear sometimes we hear without hearkening and we often hearken without hearing      to understand comprehend conceive to have just and proper ideas of every thing that occurs is the common signification of these words but to understand implies a conformity of ideas which has a peculiar relation to the value of the terms we use to comprehend denotes such a conformity as answers directly to the nature of the things we explain and that which is expressed by the word conceive relates more especially to the order and design of what we propose the first is used with propriety when applied to the particulars of what we say the tone with which we speak the turn of our phrases and the delicacy of our expressions the second seems to agree best with a relation to principles lessons precepts and speculative knowledge the third appears with greater elegance when it relates to forms arrangement projects and plans in short all that depends on the imagination  we understand languages we comprehend sciences we conceive whatever has relation to arts  it is difficult to understand that which is enigmatical to comprehend that which is abstruse and to conceive that which is confused  readiness of understanding is a mark of acuteness that of comprehension is a proof of penetration that of conception denotes a clear head  a lover understands the language of the passions a learned man comprehends the metaphysical questions of the schools an architect conceives the plan and economy of buildings   00 fashion figure form fashion rises from labor and results from the workmanship the workman enriching it more or less according to his taste figure springs from design and results from the outlines of the thing the author of the plan making it either more or less regular according to his abilities form rises from construction and results from the arrangement of parts the conductor of the work making it more or less natural as his imagination directs him  the fashion of a work frequently exceeds in value the price of the materials we seldom give in architecture a round figure to any thing except to single pieces and such as stand by themselves paganism pictures the deity under all kinds of forms whereas christianity confines it to those of a man and of a dove  we say of fashion that it is either pretty or ugly of figure that it is either agreeable or disagreeable of form that it is either common or uncommon   0  fault defect imperfection fault includes in its idea a relation to the maker so that while it implies some real want in the finishing of the work it denotes also that it was owing to the workman defect expresses something imperfect in the thing without any relation to the maker of it imperfection intimates something of less consequence than is understood by the preceding words and is used with more propriety in morality than either in physics or mechanics  the smoking of chimneys is a great fault in houses as a little attention in the builder may easily prevent it when the beauty of a building is spoiled for want of room or proper materials it is a defect which the builder could not prevent imperfections are considered by the bigoted religionist as real sins but reasonable christians look upon them only as the natural consequents of frail humanity   0  fault crime faults result from human weakness being transgressions of the rules of duty crimes proceed from the wickedness of the heart being actions against the rules of nature  the effects of anger and the intrigues of gallantry are faults calumnies and assassinations are crimes  it is our indispensable duty to pardon faults but punish crimes   0  to oblige constrain to compel force the last of these words rises upon the third as the third does upon the second and the second upon the first each of them implying an opposition to liberty the word oblige relates more to duty or necessity intimating a power acting on us in conformity to our inclinations constrain refers to those troublesome oppositions that make us determine against our inclinations compel alludes to power and authority which makes us act in express contrariety to our will which we lament the not being master of the word force implies contrary efforts of a vigorous action which we try to resist but in vain  the duty of a child to its parents obliges it to assist him in his old age the weaker and softer sex is that which can least brook constraint there are some occasions on which we should not be sorry to be compelled even to that we are most unwilling to do ancient politeness of the table went so far as to force guests to eat and drink   0  heaviness weight in the figurative sense the difference of these words is so extremely great as to need no pointing out in the literal indeed they are often confounded considered then in this last sense heaviness is that quality in a body which we feel and distinguish by itself weight is the measure and degree of that quality which we cannot ascertain but by comparison  we say absolutely and in an undetermined sense that a thing is heavy but relatively and in a manner determined that it is of such a weight for example of two three or four pounds  a thousand circumstances prove the heaviness of the air and the mercury determines its exact weight   0  to return surrender restore we are said to return what has been lent or given us to surrender what we have in pledge or charge to restore what we have taken or stolen  we ought to return punctually to surrender faithfully and to restore wholly  we borrow with an intent to return we take a thing in charge with a view of surrendering it again but we seldom take with a design to restore  custom makes use of these words on the following occasions the first with respect to civility favors presents or testimonies of kindness the second with respect to what we are entrusted with honors employs or offices with which we are invested the third with relation to things taken away that have been our due thus we return money that has been lent us presents we have received and letters to a deserted sweetheart we surrender a child to its parents the ribbon of an order the staff of command seals and dignities to a prince we restore an accused person when found innocent to his estates and honors and a minor to the possession of his effects which have been held from him   0  sincerity frankness plainness ingenuousness sincerity prevents our speaking otherwise than we think and is a virtue frankness makes us speak as we think and is a natural effect plainness is speaking freely what we think and springs sometimes from want of reflection ingenuousness makes us declare what we know and is often a folly  a sincere man will not deceive a frank man will not dissemble a plain man is not apt to flatter an ingenuous man knows not how to conceal any thing  sincerity is of great value in the intercourse of the heart frankness facilitates the commerce of the world plainness is often considered as a want of politeness ingenuousness is frequently found to err against prudence  the sincere are always esteemed the frank please all the world the plain sometimes offend the ingenuous often betray themselves   0  experiment trial proof experiment relates properly to the truth of things it determines whether a thing is or is not clearing up of doubt and dissipating ignorance trial concerns particularly the use of things judging whether they are proper or not it settles the matter and determines the will proof has a greater relation to the quality of things teaching us whether they are good or bad distinguishing the best and taking away any fear of being deceived  we make experiments in order to know trials to choose and proofs to be thoroughly acquainted with  experiments confirm our opinions being the root of knowledge trial conducts our taste being the road to satisfaction proof removes our fears and is a remedy against error and imposture  end of the first volume
