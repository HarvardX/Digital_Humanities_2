the dukedom of that name but also the territories of the archbishop of saltzburg and the bishoprics of passau ratisbon and friesengen it is divided into upper and lower bavaria bounded by franconia voitland and bohemia on the n by bohemia and austria e carinthia brixen and tyrol to the s and by swabia on the w extending about  00 miles from n to s and   0 from e to w  the elector of bavaria and the archbishop of saltzburg are the joint summoning princes ratisbon or wasserburg are the two places where the diet of the circle is usually held though sometimes it is convened at landshut or muldorf the elector is hereditary commander in chief and has the direction of all military affairs with respect to religion this circle is one of the mixed  upper bavaria is partly mountainous and woody and partly marshy abounding in large and small lakes and having a good deal of level ground is fitter for pasturage than tillage lower bavaria is more level and more fruitful but bavaria in general abounds in grain pastures forests and plenty of cattle game and wild fowl it produces also in different parts salt copper silver lead and marble and here are medicinal springs and baths the danube which has its scource in swabia waters the electorate from east to west receiving other rivers in its course out of the danube and two other rivers a small quantity of sand is collected there are sixteen large inland lakes and   0 small ones all which afford a number of fish  in all bavaria are reckoned thirtyfive cities and ninetyfive open and enclosed market towns  000 castles and seats or estates invested with lower town jurisdiction over the vassals and    0  villages hamlets and deserts which last alone are computed at  000 in the upper palatinate are thirteen cities and twentyeight market towns the computation of vassals or families in the electorate which estimates them at four millions and those in bavaria alone at near   00000 exceeds the truth as this would make the number of people   000000 they do not amount to more than one million and a half and the income of the duke is  000000l sterling  in bavaria no other religious doctrine is tolerated than the romancatholic the parishes in the electorate are about   00 the vicarages and chapels near  000 and the number of churches it is said amount to    0  the remarkable convents are eightysix and the collegiate foundations twelve  solid knowledge and good learning must be owned to the honor of this electorate to be on a better footing and to receive more countenance here now than ever the benedictines distinguish themselves in both and ingoldstadt boasts a university  manufactures are also encouraged and improved here particularly coarse cloths woollen stuffs and stockings silk stuffs velvets tapestry good clocks watches and other necessaries though its chief exports consist of cattle grain wood salt and iron at munich from spring to june is brewed a kind of white beer called ambock very strong and something like fine english ale but will not keep the monopoly of this liquor brings in yearly above a million of guilders  agriculture here is at a very low ebb not more than half the country is in tenure or occupancy and fallows are kept open three four or five years to strengthen the soil ere they sow the land for a crop  the title of the elector is by the grace of god duke of upper and lower bavaria as also the upper palatinate pfalsgrave of the rhine archsteward of the holy roman empire and landgrave of leuchtenberg the arms are quarterly an escutcheon of pretense in one a topaz in a field ruby in another a lion ruby crowned topaz and in the other two lozenges sapphire and pearl  there are five hereditary stateofficers in this electorate that of the master of

and the capital and residence of the elector  ratisbon and munich are the principal cities but the latter is considered as the capital it is pleasantly situated on the river isar which divided into several channels waters all parts of the town so that little streams run through many of the streets confined in stone channels which have a most clean and agreeable effect the streets squares and courts are spacious and airy which make all the buildings appear more magnificent than those in other cities which have been built with much more cost and expense the streets in particular are so straight that many of them intersect each other at right angles and are very broad and extremely well built the splendor and beauty of its buildings both public and private especially the electoral palace may compare with any in europe the magnificence of the churches and convents are such that they are equal if not superior to any in germany  the electoral palace is not so noble an edifice outwardly as its internal beauty demands this vast structure being built at various periods by successive princes several fancies were indulged in the taste of it and it has many valuable paintings and the duke of marlborough after the battle of hochstet brought away a great many to england  it is seated at the extremity of the town and contains  0 0 windows twenty large halls eleven courts nine galleries sixteen kitchens and twelve cellars it is thought to be one of the most magnificent large and commodious palaces in europe and of the four principal courts one is adorned with several brass statues another the emperors is so constructed that combats of wild beasts may be exhibited in it in the kitchencourt which is the argest at the nuptials of an elector a very magnificent tournament was held the ascent from the emperors court to the hall is a flight of wide and beautiful red marblesteps the hall is     feet long and fiftytwo wide in it stands a statue of virtue made of one single piece of porphyry here is also a bath consisting of a grotto and three rooms a museum a chamber of curiosities and a noble library  in the museum are some hundred statues and busts of the old roman emperors with  00 other antiques as lamps inscriptions basso relievos etc most of which were brought from italy among other things to exercise curiosity is a small statue of brass weighing seventy odd pounds and yet hardly to be lifted by the strongest man unless he places himself so as to give it a certain equilibrium but by advancing the left foot before the statue it is so easily managed as to be lifted up without any effect by a single finger put into the hole in the electors treasury shown by his first gentlemen of the bedchamber are a number of valuable articles that have but few equals in all europe as   a hill with a castle on it all of oriental pearls   several vessels of green jasper   a cabinet of many large pieces of crystal work among the rest a ship some spans long the pilot and all the tackling of the purest gold   a large lagule bowl   patterns of a gold service of the finest gold for three large tables and in mortgage at ausburg   a ruby as large as a walnut   st

buttons and loops of diamonds with rubies set between    a like set of diamonds only the buttons of exceeding beauty and in size not inferior to those which were worn by lewis xiv when he gave public audience to the persian ambassador and of a superior luster to the french having been twenty years in collecting and at an incredible expense    the images of the bavarian family in blue chalcedony    an ivory closet of uncommon curious workmanship containing      gold roman medals  near a wall in one of the palace courts is a large black stone with the following inscription on it in   0  the illustrious duke christopher the renowned hero of bavaria lifted this large stone weighing   0 lb and threw it to some distance a bavarian country girl some few years since raised this stone a hand high from the ground near the same place are also three iron nails driven into the wall with this inscription let every leaper behold with wonder these three nails the first of which is twelve feet from the ground and indicates a leap of the noble duke christopher the second nail which is ten feet and a half was reached by zundritt the third though but nine feet and a half shows the activity of philip springer he who can outdo these leaps let him try  count preising master of the horse has built opposite to the palace a hotel the four sides of which answer to so many streets and is a great ornament to the city the pillars of his stable are red marble and every horse feeds out of a particular marble of twentyfive guilders value  the cathedral church of our lady has two large towers contains twentyfive chapels thirty altars and twentyfour large columns not far from one of the doors is a stone with a mark on it and to him who stands there the multitude of pillars takes away the sight of every window of the church of course the church is rather dark it has a large organ of box wood and a stately black marble monument of the emperor lewis of bavaria with six large and several lesser statues of brass  the palace and other electoral buildings together with the brewhouses    monasteries churches and other religious structures take up near half of the city the precinct of the augustines alone consists of several streets which bring them in an annual rent of  000 guilders  the electors court is very numerous and splendid the late elector had thirtysix lords of the bedchamber i am speaking now from keysler who was there about sixty years ago the same elector kept   00 or   00 horses his successor was contented with  00 but sixtyfive footmen are kept in constant pay at the court of bavaria from its numerous family and alliances with the imperial house there are no less than thirtythree state festivals and these are increasing but at the festival of corpus christi there is a procession of several thousand persons deputies of all trades and handicrafts assist at it with costly flags carried before them the same is done also by the religious orders every member of which joins the procession all manner of religious histories are exhibited on a great number of triumphal cars by children richly dressed at the head of their respective fraternities ride st george and st maurice in roman habits st maurice is represented by a young lady in the attire of a roman vestal leading after her a large dragon in which two men are enclosed to give it the necessary movements the four mendicant orders precede the venerable host carried under a splendid canopy immediately after rides the elector in person and his consort on his left both holding a lighted taper next to the electress comes her master of the household followed by some court ladies and after these the whole court dressed after the spanish fashion the streets are boarded strewed with flowers and herbs and the procession lasts an hour and a half  the late elector was immoderately fond of hunting and the electress was so fond of him that she entered into the spirit of his amusement she shot very well and at hunting made nothing of trampling up to her knees in a morass her dress was a green coat and a little fair wig she was extremely fond of dogs particularly the english greyhounds they were always with her in her best apartment and surrounded her in bed and at table at their hunting seat the electresss bedchamber was under the electors had a kennel in one corner and a much larger one in a fine closet adjoining the complexion of the court ladies visibly suffered from their attendance on her in all weathers there goes a story that lewis xiv said jesting to baron freybzerg the electors great huntsman which is a state officer in bavaria concerning a bitch which the elector particularly valued i am told your bitch often loses scent of the game to which the baron piqued at a reflection on the flower of his pack warmly replied how  she is as true as the gospel  they have here a remedy for the bite of a mad dog which the late elector himself often made use of with success for his officers and once for one of the chief princesses of the court viz to make the patient eat the raw liver of the dog that did the mischief  the chapel of the virgin mary is finished with every species of riches such as gold silver and precious stones nor does it want for its share of relics for the religious pretend to have a good part of the skirt of the mohair gown which the virgin mary wore when christ was crucified  be this at it may yet it is certain the most profound veneration is paid to this choice piece of an old garment  in the largest marketplace stands a marble pillar with a brass statue of the virgin mary upon it and two large fountains on each side fronting of which is the townhouse a very elegant building with a great number of hieroglific paintings on the front  this city is said to contain  0000 inhabitants most of which are romancatholics and although very polite in manners and address yet very superstitious and are led into many errors by the art of the friars who are too numerous for the size of this place  of the general maxims or leading principles of the people of this court we can say but little immediate selfinterest is apparently the pursuit of every one or if they do profess any principles they are certainly the most pliant and versatile in the world indeed if we may judge by the way of thinking of inferiors many of the principal people have adopted the most execrable theory in politics for instance that religion serves only for the purpose of keeping the crowd of mankind slaves to them that a courtier must put on the externals of religion but leave the practice to the vulgar that men are by nature wicked seditious turbulent and only to be governed by being kept in perpetual servitude and not being permitted to use their faculties finally that too much knowledge is dangerous and that the great hold their rights over their people from god and are no ways accountable for their conduct nor under any obligation to their subjects every thing here is venal  a few years ago a certain minister of this court would have sold half bavaria to the house of austria if the prussian and russian courts and the minister of the court of deuxponts had not prevented the purchase  in every project proposed a small part only is intended for any good purpose the greater part has the interest of the projector in view  every thing here is calculated for show and as a specimen the court keeps a great admiral for two or three vessels on the rhine the army consists of thirty regiments although not above   000 strong and the fourth of these are officers amongst which are several general fieldmarshals  the titles and embroidered clothes of the inhabitants says reisbec by no means secure a stranger from their begging from him the following anecdote from that author we shall lay before our readers  one day says he i went to see the handsome jesuit church where that i might not appear an idle spectator i knelt down by some people in a pew immediately a man whom by his dress i supposed to be a person of consequence moved nearer to me and presenting me with a pinch of snuff and prefacing his intentions with a few remarks on the beauty of the building then entered into a detail of his necessities and requested charity the same thing happened to me at another church where the beggar was a well dressed woman  here there are no pains taken to correct the people from their inclination to theft and robbery by good education improved morals and encouragement to industry sumptuous places of public amusements expensive collections of curiosities palaces gardens and innumerable swarms of glittering servants are the only fashionable errors to be acquired priests and the frail sisterhood lead the higher classes into all the slavish shackles of vice folly and excess or in the words of reisbec since the time that a capuchined demon has had sufficient influence in the direction of the bavarian politics to mislead the government little else than anarchy and confusion have pervaded the political system of this state  a picture of the bavarian character and manners by hogarth was he now living would be extremely interesting great singularity of character is often to be met with in england but what bavaria offers exceeds any thing to be seen elsewhere  the bavarian men in general are stout bodied muscular and fleshy the women extremely handsome well shaped and lively in conversation  the characteristic says reisbec of a bavarian man is a very thick round head a little peaked chin a large belly and a pale complexion many of them look like caricatures of man they have great fat bellies short clubbed feet narrow shoulders and short necks they are heavy and awkward in their carriage and their small eyes betray a great deal of roguery the women are some of the most beautiful creatures in the world rather gross but their skin surpasses all the carnation ever used by painters the purest lily white is softly tinged with purple as if by the hands of the graces some of the peasant girls have such clear complexions as to appear quite transparent they are well shaped and more lively and graceful in their gestures than the men the peasants wives of weild eight leagues from munich wear broad felt hats or bonnets with a small knob behind toward the neck no bigger than a walnut on holidays the maids of the principal inns and publichouses at munich wear about their necks a silver chain of three rows and their breasts are also laced with two such other chains a piece of finery that costs them fifty guilders  in the capital they dress in the french style or at least they imagine that they do so for the men are still too fond of gold and mixed colors the country gentry dress without any taste at all the chief ornament of the men is a long broad waistcoat strangely embroidered from which their breeches hang very low and loose probably to give free play to their bellies which is the chief part of a bavarian the women disguise themselves with a sort of stays in the shape of a funnel which cover the breast and shoulders so as to hide the whole neck this stiff dress is covered with silver beads and thickly overlaid with silver chains in many places the housewife has a bunch of keys and a knife appendant to a girdle which reach almost to the ground  as to the characters and manners of the bavarians the inhabitants of the capital naturally differ very much from the country people the manners of the people of munich are corrupt as must be the case with  0000 men depending entirely upon a courts growing generally idle at its expense  among the great nobles here met with as well as elsewhere there are some very wellbred and polite persons but the people in general taking the words in their full extent are in a high degree destitute of every sense of honor without education without any attachment to the constitution or generous feeling whatever the fortunes of this place are from   00 to three or four thousand pounds a year but the possessors know no other use for their money than to spend it in sensual gratifications many good houses have been ruined by play the fashionable game at court was formerly called zwicken or perich but since hambesch the minister of finance has pinched their salaries so much they call it hambesch many of the court ladies know no other employ than playing with their parrots their dogs or their cats one of the principal ladies whom i was acquainted with says baron reisbec kept a hall full of cats and two or three maids to attend them she conversed half the day long with them often served them herself with coffee and sugar and dressed them according to her fancy differently every day  the little noblesse and servants of the court have such a passion for titles as is to be pitied before the present elector came here the place swarmed with excellencies honorable and right honorable the emperor made an order to ascertain the different ranks of noblesse all those whom it deprived of titles and particularly the women sunk into despair and for the first time complaints were made of tyranny of which none before seemed to have any conception  the remainder of the inhabitants are immersed in the most scandalous debauch every night the streets reecho with the noise of drunkards issuing from the numerous taverns where they have open revelling and dancing whoever is at all noble here must keep his mistress and the rest indulge in promiscuous love in this respect things are not much better in the country so that bavaria well deserves the character given of it by an officer of gascony of being the greatest brothel in the world  the country people are extremely dirty a few miles distant from the capital one would hardly take the hovels of the peasants for the habitations of men many of them have large puddles before their doors and are obliged to step over planks into them the thatched roofs of the country in many parts of france have a much better appearance than the wretched huts of the bavarian peasants the roofs of which are covered with stones in order that the slates may not be carried away by the wind mean as this looks cheap as nails are here and often as half the roof are torn away by strong winds yet cannot the rich farmer be persuaded to nail his shingles properly together in short from the court to the smallest cottage indolence is the most predominant part of the character of the bavarian  as i strolled continues the same author through the country i shuddered at the sight of the ravages which war had made there is no town of any importance throughout all bavaria but the capital you would never imagine what pitiful little holes landsberg wasserberg landshut and many other places are which make a great figure in the map to al appearance neither ingoldstadt nor shaubingen or any of the greater towns except munich contains above  000 people excepting the brewer baker and innkeeper you may seek in vain for a rich tradesman there is not a vestige of industry either in town or country but every body seems to consider idleness and beggary as the happiest state of man  the country people and farmers are divided into four classes into whole half and quarterfarmers and into those called hausler the whole farmers plough with eight horses and are termed einliedler that is hermits because their farmhouses are at a distance from any cottage many of these farmhouses command a territory of three miles in length and breadth and the owners employ from ten to fifteen horses in their tillage reckoning two horses to every plough of such farmers there may be about  0000 a halffarmer ploughs with four and a quarterfarmer with two horses the hausler are day laborers to the rest and till their bit of property with cattle belonging to others having no idea of meadow land or stallfood for cattle the farmers excuse their ignorance and inattention to it by pleading the want of manure in a word both court and people seem blind to their own interest and a slothful indolence pervades the whole nation  this great indolence is contrasted in an extraordinary manner with a still higher degree of bigotry as was before observed and a story of the facetious baron will exemplify the appellation i happened says he to stroll into a dark filthy beer house in the outlets of munich where on my entrance i beheld a cloud of smoke but as soon as the vapor was a little cleared i could discern a loud company of the lower order of the people headed by a drunken priest his black coat was bedaubed with grease and filth having many appertures in its fabric and in either hand emblems of his devotion that is to say cards in the one and a jug of ale in the other after the assembly were tolerably plied with strong drink the sunshine of conviviality gave way to the storms of inebriety and pots bottles and glasses flew thick at each others heads presently the evening bell rang for prayers when off went their bonnets and down fell the company on their knees repeating ave maria pater noster etc after prayers they arose with determined resolution to end the dispute by the aid of mugs and glasses upon which i thought it high time to decamp as i foresaw there might be danger to be within reach of the things in motion and perceiving the priest took a lower seat as he thrust in his weighty carcass under the table for shelter least one of the bottles should come in contact with his noddle  the same scenes occur in the inland towns among the citizens officers clergymen and students they all salute each other with abusive language all vie in hard drinking and close to every church there is regularly a brew house and a brothel a student of the university of ingoldstadt must carry a thick cudgel and wear a neat cut hat he must be able to drink from eight to ten quarts of beer at a sitting and be always ready to fight right or wrong with the officers of the garrison no pen continues reisbec can describe the ridiculous mixtures of debauchery and devotion which every day happen the most notorious is that which took place in the church of st mary oettingen a few years since when a priest actually deflowered a girl whom he had long pursued and could only make a prize of there before the altar of the virgin  the country people join to their indolence and devotion a certain ferocity of temper which often gives rise to bloody scenes when they mean to praise a church holiday or some public festival which has lately been kept they say  it was a charming day there were six or eight persons killed and many broken legs and arms if no accident happened they call it a fiddlefaddle business a mere nothing in the beginning of this century the bavarian troops maintained the first reputation among the german forces at the battle of hochstadt they kept their ground and conceived themselves victors till the elector who ed them was informed that the french had given way on the other wing under tilly and mercy they did wonders but since the time of those generals military discipline has so far relaxed amongst them that they are no longer soldiers no people can show more abhorrence to every th that is called discipline and order than the bavians do they might however still be useful as fre booters where robberies and disorders are more paonable than those of regular troops there are band of robbers about one thousand men strong and would undoubtedly make good scouting parties in time of war there have been instances of opposing the military under bold leaders to the very last man but the poorest peasants consider it as a hardship to be drafted into the regular troops of his prince  the inhabitants of the capital are very timid and subservient but the unadulterated bavarian peasant is gross fat dirty lazy drunken and undisciplined economical and patriotic yet he is brave and such a slave to his word that when he has once given it it is never to be broken the imitative zeal is singularly strong in these people for whatever character the elector assumes from the highest to the lowest they are religiously devoted to its observance  it is the religious contagion only that unfits the natives of this circle from those proper exercises in life that could tend to the advancement both of their credit and fortune monks are the directors of temporal concerns as well as spiritual discipline they alone are to be thanked for that wildness of manners usual among the bavarians their cowls contain the essence of christianity and all morality they preach nothing but masses which are profitable to them and the rosary the scapulaire and ridiculous mortification of the body are the means by which many blockheads have got the name of saints  thus the deceived layman believes that confession and a mass which only costs fifteen pence will wipe away the foulest sins and considers the telling of his beads as the most essential duty of this life  the secular priests are as few in number as the monks are many these ought naturally to form the manners of the country but they are held in much less veneration than the others because their dress and appearance is not so extraordinary in bavaria however they do not deserve more respect than the monks for though their parishes are four miles in compass and producing from four to  00l a year the greater part of them differ only from the peasants by wearing a black coat keeping a more expensive table and a handsomer and better dressed housekeeper in other things they are equally lazy unlearned and ignorant  the air of this electorate is considered as very salubrious for notwithstanding the inconsiderate mode of living pursued by the generality of people here few die of epidemical distempers health and longevity being the distinguished characteristics of this favored country  near munich is a town called reichenhall remarkable for its curious salt spring the water of which worked by a mill has a wheel thirtysix feet in diameter which by means of a chainpump raises the fluid into a reservoir and thence into pipes for the distance of fifteen english miles over a lofty mountain to a salthouse where fuel is convenient and there it is boiled on the mountains over which it passes there are little houses at proper distances in order to throw the water higher for the conveyance also of a strong fresh spring used in turning the wheels and other engines and likewise for carrying off any superfluous salt water there is a most astonishing and durable aqueduct of square flints three english miles in length and five feet broad with an arched roof being made upwards of  00 years at a vast expense it is in many places overlaid with hard rosin after running to a depth of twelve fathoms under the town and from thence under the gardens and fields it at last ejects the water in a strong torrent  this aqueduct is in general between three and four feet in depth and runs so swiftly that in a boat with torches one may sail from one end to the other in about a quarter of an hour in order to proceed on this subterraneous voyage there is a descent by means of a sunk tower there are five apertures in the form of towers through each of which a person may speak from the ramparts of the tower with those who sail on the canal  the bishopric of ratisbon has some territory round the city it comprehends under two collegiate churches twentyeight abbeys and prelacies and twenty nine rural deaneries to which belong      parishes chapels of ease and chaplaincies it likewise extends over the bavarian districts of holnberg in the upper palatinate as also over the romancatholic parishes in the principality of sulzbach the landgravate of leuthtenberg and the county of hernstein the bishop is a prince of the empire and ratisbon is the capital of the bishopric  ratisbon is situated in fortynine degrees n lat at the confluence of the rivers danube and regen about sixty miles n of munich and the like distance w of passau it is the only free imperial city within the limits of the electors dominions and is large populous and well fortified there is here a very antique bridge of freestone thrown over the danube begun in      and finished in eleven years and fabulously said to have been built by the devil it has    arches supported by square pillars and is  0   feet in length and   0 broad it is commonly said of the three principal bridges in germany that dresden bridge is the most elegant that of prague the longest and that of ratisbon the strongest  the city is governed by its own magistrates which are all lutherans and not subject to the elector here the diet of the empire meets the city having the rank of the first place among the imperial towns the councilhouse in which they meet is a large gothic structure of no particular elegance  the bishop although a prince of the empire and taking his title from the town is only privileged by magistracy to say mass here  the church of the abbey dedicated to st emmeran is a very stately as well as ancient building erected a d     this building is said to contain many adored relics but the most material is that of the whole body and limbs of dionysius the areopagite except the middle finger of his right hand which the palace chapel of the virgin mary at munich carefully retains rolled up in a piece of the virgin marys mohair gown already mentioned  the authenticity of this relick has been confirmed by pope leo xi but notwithstanding this the monks of st denis near paris insist that the body of this saint is actually in their possession and his head is shown in the third shrine of their treasury his head is also devoutly worshipped in the cathedral of bamberg and at prague another head is kept in the church of st vitus in the castle the monks of st emmeran say this relick was purloined from the abbey of st denis in france  this free imperial city contains five different states within its circuit namely the cathedral of ratisbon the imperial abbey of st emmeran the lower minster the upper minster and the city itself the ladies in the upper and lower minster live in a free manner and are under little or no restraint in these two abbeys they go abroad when they please receive visits from gentlemen appear at balls in the city and generally stay till the last dance and that no liberty may be wanting to indulge their desires they have always the privilege of quitting the abbey by marrying the abbesses avoid public assemblies as if they were princesses because the envoys ladies will not allow them the honor of precedence  there is a convent here in which romancatholics only are admitted that are natives of scotland and those of the greatest abilities are selected from the rest and sent as missionaries to their native country there is also such a seminary at wurtsburg and another at erfurt in the hospital of st catherine the protestants have a chapel where a lutheran minister preaches every monday which is not tolerated in any other part of bavaria the persons received into this hospital are half protestants and half romancatholics  as ratisbon is where the diet of the empire meets one would suppose that the number of envoys from the different princes who constantly reside here would give life to the place no  every thing is dull and dead if it was not for the prince of thurn who is the emperors principal commissary one would not believe the town to be the seat of the diet but this gentleman whose income is about  0000l a year gives operas comedies wild beast bailings balls and fireworks the rest of the ambassadors on account of the smallness of their incomes are obliged to live very economically and many of them go about in hackney coaches as every thing for their use comes into the city duty free the people of the place make heavy complaints of their servants for carrying on a large contraband trade indeed they conceive that what they lose by this is more than an equivalent for what they gain by the diet in other respects the fact is that the ambassadors from the greatest powers who have large incomes and seem to be paid for holding great state hold none and as the other ministers regulate themselves by their example one may be several weeks in town without knowing that the diet is assembled  the business of the diet is very tedious owing to the prevalence of party on all great occasions the diet as has been observed consists of three colleges the electoral the princes and the states all assemble in a hall to receive the emperors propositions thence they retire to separate apartments to discuss the business the majority decides in each chamber and so does the majority of the three colleges as to the determination of the whole when they are determined it is laid before the emperor or his principal commissary the first college has nine voices the second one hundred and that of the states fiftyone  the imperial court has great influence in all the three colleges the three ecclesiastical electors have been almost constantly creatures of the emperor who spares neither gold threats nor promises to inspire the canons of mentz treves and cologne in the choice of a new archbishop the emperor has the same weight in the college of princes almost all the ecclesiastical princes are his true sons besides it has always been the maxim of the imperial court to raise the members of the hereditary dominion who possessed the smallest fief in the empire to the dignity of princes in order to give them a seat in the diet in the college of towns or states he rules almost without control for as these are almost all encompassed by most powerful princes they require the particular protection of the court of vienna to prevent their being totally crushed but it being enacted that the majority in the imperial colleges shall not be decisive either in religion or those matters in which the states could not be considered as one body or where the catholics are of one and the protestants of another opinion in such cases the colleges divide into parties and however small in number one party may be its decree is held equal to the other more numerous one thus the emperor is sometimes opposed by the protestants and the romancatholics have found a benefit in it though saxony has the apparent government of the protestant party the king of prussias power is got to that pitch as to be at the head of the party and he often protests vehemently against things in which religion is not the least concerned  the principal imperial commissioner who is at the head of the diet by virtue of his office takes place of all the emperors ambassadors and others except only the envoy from the court of rome being here the representation of the head of the german empire he returns no visits nor does he give the title of excellence to any of the envoys not even to those of the electors when an envoy from an electoral prince pays him a visit he orders him to be received at his coachdoor by four gentlemen two pages and a harbinger and meets him at the door of the second antichamber walking back a little before on the right hand of the envoy the same superiority he assumes in reconducting him his audience chair is under a canopy on which is the emperors picture his annual income is   000 guilders paid out of the imperial treasury and   000 out of the emperors privy purse that is about   00l sterling  the envoys of ratisbon as representatives of electors etc have very lofty ideas of their office and assume such state that when the widow of duke frederick henry of saxe zeitz a princess of the house of holstein wiesenburg came to pay a visit to the cardinal saxe zeitz her brotherinlaw her highness could appear but very seldom in public company because the ladies of the electoral envoys claimed the precedence of her if sovereign german princes attend the diet themselves they sit above all the envoys of other princes except those of austria burgundy and saltzburg who have maintained the precedence by prescription it is on account of these disputes about precedence that the holstein envoys never attend any of the sessions  all the envoys receive presents of wine fish etc from the city on their first arrival and the imperial commissary a much larger one in the college the envoys sit with their hats on but uncover themselves when they speak  i have already observed that the envoys having every article for their consumption duty free is a disadvantage to the city these envoys are numerous and they each give a great number of protections some will have in general forty or fifty persons in their retinue none of whom either pay duty contributions imports or any of the common citytaxes though some at the same time will keep shops and carry on trade under this sanction coachmen and lacqueys set up publichouses and draw yearly some hundreds of hogsheads of beer which as they pretend are all of his excellencys household it is the same with regard to wine which these privileged publicans import clear of all duty so that they may easily undersell the fair trader the quantity of provisions brought over the bridge on the danube in seven days with permits for the use of the envoys frequently amounts to   00 or  000 guilders  as the danube directs its course from ratisbon to vienna it gains this city an advantageous opportunity of sending there wheat wood and several kinds of provisions the distance between these two cities is about  00 miles and yet the common people pay no more for their passing down the river than a creutz or a farthing a mile so that the whole fare at this rate does not exceed four or five shillings keysler says two shillings and fourpence this cheap way of traveling induces great numbers of young artificers and handicraftsmen to go and try their fortune at vienna but they do not find it so easy to return home as they generally spend what they earn by their trades and are often obliged to enlist for soldiers  archbishopric of saltzburg on the east this bishopric is bounded by austria and stiria by corinthia and the tyrol on the south and by bavaria on the west and on the north its extent from east to west is about five and twenty german miles and from north to south in some parts sixteen and in others five and twenty  the country is defended on all sides by mountains and narrow passes or rather consists entirely of mountains and valleys no manner of grain being sown here it is supplied with all its corn from bavaria but every part of it produces hay of a peculiar goodness and this proves a fund for breeds of excellent cattle the horses in particular are esteemed for their beauty hardiness and vigor being able to travel full speed up the highest mountains and that supported by no other food than hay and grass without any oats  in this archbishopric are six cities and twentyfive towns all the peasants are allowed the use of firearms and are from their earliest youth trained up to shooting at a mark and practicing military exercises the nobility were formerly very numerous but the policy of the princes set so many springs at work to oppress and exterminate them that at present there is not one remaining and their estates are in the hands of the church with respect to the few nobles at court or belonging to the cathedral they are all foreigners some austrians some bohemians and others from bavaria though the roman catholic worship is the only one tolerated yet at the time of the reformation lutheranism was embraced by great numbers so late as the year      permission was granted to the lutheran saltzburgers to leave the country and take their property with them accordingly above  0000 persons accepted this indulgence and dispersed themselves in the other protestant countries of germany prussia and even in the english colonies in america in all which places they were received with that benevolence and encouragement which their magnanimity deserved and ever since that time these emigrations have continued  his revenues are estimated by keysler at  00000 rixdollars busching affirms they are not less than between three and four millions of guilders reisbec on the contrary says they are not above   0000l which is less than keysler makes them as eight hundred thousand rixdollars at three shillings and sixpence each makes above  00000l but according to busching reckoning the guilder at two shillings and fourpence which is the average of the german guilder the income then would be near  00000l  the extent of the country is estimated at two hundred and forty german square miles there are only seven or eight towns says reisbec some of which are not to be compared with a suabian village the total number of inhabitants is computed at two hundred and fifty thousand there is only one manufacture in the whole country which is a small one at hallein for cotton stockings and nightcaps  the inhabitants live chiefly by breeding cattle in many places you may find very rich farmers who own from sixty to fourscore head of great cattle they export some cheese and butter but not so much as they might do if the inhabitants were as industrious frugal and disposed for trade as the swiss besides horned cattle they also breed great numbers of horses which are very strong and are exported to great distances for the purpose of heavy draught and burden  the saltworks at hallein are without comparison the most considerable the internal parts of the mountain which is about four miles distant from this place consist of crystals of salt mixed with a great deal of earth in order to clean it they dig large hollow chambers within side and fill them with water which washes the salt and lets the earth sink to the bottom the water thus impregnated is conveyed into pens and boiled off in course of time the chambers fill of themselves with salt and the treasure is inexhaustible one of these chambers when lighted makes the prettiest sight in the world conceive to yourself a hall about a hundred feet square the walls and ground of which are composed of crystal of every earthly color and which reflect the light so wonderfully that you would think yourself in some enchanted palace in order to carry on this work the woods of the forests along the saltza and other rivers is floated down them  from the unfavourable situation of this country it cannot use the whole of this treasure for itself but is obliged to give the most part to foreigners all the country round about belongs either to austria or to bavaria in austria they have salt sufficient for their own use and have prohibited the importation of foreign salt bavaria on the other hand has so productive a salt work at ratisbon that it not only provides sufficient for that country but also can afford a considerable quantity to foreigners the archbishop of bavaria have consequently found themselves obliged to enter into an agreement with the dukes of bavaria by virtue of which these take a certain quantity of salt every year at a very moderate price with which they furnish switzerland and suabia by this means the salt trade of saltzburg is properly in the hands of bavaria which gains full three times as much by it as the princes of saltzburg the value of the salt which bavaria stipulates to take yearly amounts to about  0000l what is disposed of in the country itself or carried clandestinely into austria makes in the whole about   000l of which two thirds may be clear gain  the gold and silver mines of this principality make a great figure in the geography of germany but compared with the saltworks are not worth mentioning the roads through this mountainous country are not in general very good notwithstanding the passage is now and then on wooden bridges hung by chains over some dreadful abysses the heaviest carriages have nothing to fear except perhaps the being overset by a violent blast of wind or being covered by a fall of snow in the spring  about six miles from saltzburg there is a long narrow valley bounded by high mountains which stretches itself some miles southward and then westward at the entrance of this valley is the pass of lueg or luhk a word which in english means look or watchtower this pass is a deep narrow hollow between naked and perpendicular rocks of granate which hang over the road on each side to an amazing height and between which the river saltza runs like a torrent above the river a path has been cut along the side of a rock and there is a gate with scarce room for a carriage to pass which is protected by a battery so that a few people here could withstand a whole army the other approaches to this valley which constitute the greatest part of the principality of saltzburg are equally well guarded and defended  the country about saltzburg forms a striking contrast with the barren desolate wilds of munich for seventeen long miles the distance between these two cities there is no place of note but the dark wasserburg which stands on one of the barren sandhills round which the river inn winds near the frontiers of saltzburg the prospects become varied the habitations of the peasants appear nearer and the cultivation of the country improves  saltzburg is a fine city the houses are high and built with stone the roofs are in the italian taste and you may walk out upon them before the palace is a fountain which passes for the finest in all germany the figures are all of white marble the reservoir is an hundred and seven feet in circumference four large horses spout the water out of their mouths and nostrils the height of the whole work exceeds fifty feet and is surmounted by a column of water some inches in diameter and eighteen feet high  the palace is magnificent abounding with fine pictures tables of inlaid marble and superb stones of all colors and ornamented with statues the furniture has nothing remarkable and though the tapestries are valuable on account of the gold and silver yet age has deprived them of the greatest part of their beauty the meuse is in three very long and high arched divisions the horses whose number amounts to a hundred and fifty eat out of white marble mangers and twice a week a running water is turned in through both sides of the stalls and carries away any filth which may have gathered there the number of the archbishops horses in the city and at his country palaces are said to be two hundred and fifty over this stable is the fencing school and before it a pond for watering the horses ninetythree feet in length within it stands a very large horse made of one piece of marble with water gushing out of his mouth  the winter ridingschool is very lofty placed with seats on both sides of the walls between the windows for the accommodation of spectators of distinction that the riders may not be incommoded in their exercises the summer ridingschool which also serves for baiting wild beasts is in the open air it has three distinct galleries one side of which are cut out of the rock  in the cathedral all the altars are of beautiful marble of different kinds under the cupola are four altars with an organ over each the fifth and finest organ is over the chief entrance and consists of three thousand two hundred and sixty pipes of which the longest is thirtythree feet to this organ belong four keys and fortytwo registers of which seventeen are of clockwork the roof of this church is covered with copper the gallery between the cathedral and the palace is of white marble and nothing of the kind can make finer music than the chimes of this cathedral  in st sebastians church lies the famous switzer theophrastus bompast surnamed paracelsus of the greatest puffers that ever lived with the following ostentatious epitaph  conditur hic philippus theophrastus insignis medicinae doctor qui dira illa vulnera lepram podagram hydropisin aliaque insanabilia corporis contagia mirifica art sustulit ac bona sua in pauperes distribuenda collocandaque honoravit anno mdxli die    septembris vitam cum morte mutavit  here lies interred philip theophrastus a celebrated doctor of physic who with wonderful skill removed those dreadful plagues the leprosy gout and dropsy with every other incurable malady his wealth he liberally distributed and afterward bequeathed to the poor on the   th september      he departed this life  a little above the city springs the gastein bath whose waters are very hot and have a very strong taste of different minerals they are said to be a remedy for the stone the venereal disorder and for the cholic and this too only by bathing in them without drinking them  the city of saltzburg is remarked for having the best accommodations for travelers of any city in germany  the inhabitants in general appear very social open and lively and uncommonly attached to strangers every thing in this city breathes the air of pleasure and joy they eat drink laugh dance sing and gamble in the extreme nor is there any place when you can enjoy so many pleasures for a little money the people converse upon religion and politics with a freedom that does honor to the place and with respect to books all german publications may be had without the least restraint  the upper nobility of the place is made up chiefly of austrian families who distinguish themselves by their affability their knowledge of the world and their manners on the other hand the swarm of little court gentry render themselves ridiculous by their pitiful lusts after titles and their pride you must visit about a hundred of there gnadige herren which title in german means gracious sir who live upon three or four hundred florins a year which they receive from court but whom you cannot offend more than by calling them plain sir and their wives plain madam a man who lives here must accustom himself to put in gnadige herren at every third word unless he chooses to pass for being illbred most of them have neither estates nor money the court is therefore compelled to make their appointments as slender as possible to keep them from starving though above twothirds of them are superfluous servants many of them amuse themselves with french and german literature particularly with all that relates to the stage the rage for the theater here is very great and they look for the coming of a company of strolling players with as much eagerness as the inhabitants of siberia look for the return of the spring give this class of people their right titles and you will find them the best kind of creatures living  the country people are uncommonly lively and gay the young women of these sequestered vales fresh as roses and lively as a roe understand the art of coquetry as well as any parisian lady except that the allurements they display are more natural they know how to employ the ornamental part of dress to the best advantage if they are disposed to make their lover happy neither the shame of an illegitimate birth nor the fear of being obliged to maintain it is of any consideration custom sets them above the first and the ease of maintaining a child above the latter murder of infants here is extremely uncommon they all yield without restraint or reserve to the impulse of nature the young girls kiss and shake hands in the open church on sundays with those they love on a nightly visit however the lover is rather in a hard situation for let the weather be ever so unfriendly he is not admitted until a certain watchword is given which in general consists of long rhimes that in a mysterious manner express his sufferings and his smart this custom is very old and in many of the remote parts of the mountains sacred and inviolable  the inhabitants of these mountains are so contented that they consider their country as a kind of paradise those who lived in dintner valley a frightful gap between naked rocks through which the river dintner runs have a saying that when any one falls from heaven he must fall into dintner valley which is as much to say that this valley is a second heaven  many of the peasants still wear long beards and go with their heads uncovered and their breasts open at all seasons of the year as they are extremely hairy and very much sunburned this gives them a very formidable look but when you come near them their friendly air and appearance of integrity speak very strongly in their favor they are courageous and strong and would no doubt make a brave defense in their own country but out of it they are said not to make good soldiers like all the inhabitants of mountains they cannot stand a change of climate besides the peculiarity of their diet and which they must renounce in the field their not being able to bear fatigue makes them unfit for service man resembles his soil unless education and society change him the peasant of this country bears the stamp of nature upon him his movements are quick like the stream in the wood he is boisterous in his passions like the atmosphere he breathes strong as the oak which shades him and is faithful firm and true as the rock which bears his hut the life and variety of the scenes which nature offers him here render his head richer in conceptions and his heart warmer than it would be if he dwelt upon an uniform plain and gave himself up to nature as he does here his distance from populous cities and the scattered situation of the huts preserve his manners pure and make him more attentive to his own concerns  mountainous situations have unquestionably in many respects a preference over the plains the pulse of nature beats stronger every thing discovers more life and energy every thing more loudly and emphatically speaks an almighty power at work the stream which meanders through the plain makes through the mountains and grows impetuous in its course the motion of the clouds the revolutions of the sky and the peals of thunder are all more strongly animated the valleys in the fair season of the year are filled with finer perfumes of flowers and herbs than those of the plains whose soil is not so fit to preserve their radical moisture and where their exhalations are dissipated more widely in the air nature here is more varied and infinitely more picturesque of her different shades an inhabitant of the plain can form no conception here at once nature presents the peculiarities of every season and the most distant climes whilst the summer lasts in the bottom of the valley is felt the heat of africa the middle of the mountain has the temperature of spring and the top reminds you of siberia  this country is singularly interesting to a botanist or mineralogist but having the misfortune to be very little known the discovery of its treasures is reserved for futurity till either some man of genius shall addict himself to these pursuits or the swarm of idle travelers who hover like cockchafers about the apennines alps aetna and the pyreneans shall take their flight to these parts and excite some foreign genius to the task the zillerthal is particularly rich in different sorts of variegated stones and in many parts of the hills you meet with very scarce european plants in fine there is room for weaving many an hypothesis on the plants of the hills on the work and production of the waters in them and on the revolutions of nature that may still be expected in them  it was with great pleasure says reisbec i wandered over this romantic country and sometimes standing on some immense peak i viewed under me the clouds towered on clouds boundless plains innumerable lakes rivers and brooks valleys of tremendous depth and the bare summits of huge granate rocks with sensations peculiar to their heavenly regions sometimes says he i took my abode in the deep hanging brow of a mountain in a shepherdesss hut who dwelt the whole summer through with her flock in this subterestrial region and is visited only by her lover who clambers up two or three miles of the mountains to her or by some wildgoat hunter or strayed knight like myself there i live a day like an ancient patriarch on milk and cheese count the flock which in the evening assembles round the hut at the sound of a flute and which for the moment i can think my own sleep upon a heap of hay far more tranquil than upon the most luxurious downbed and enjoy the beauties of the rising sun with a luxury and delight which at operas comedies balls and such like entertainments are looked for in vain  the saltzburg peasant clothes himself from head to foot every family weaves a sort of coarse dark gray cloth from wool which they grow and prepare themselves they also make their own shoes and stockings their dress is by these means clean simple and graceful the face of the peasants of this country is better than that in most others the saltzburger cannot content himself with cheese and potatoes like the swiss but must always have his meat which however fat it may be he constantly dips in hogs lard he must likewise have bread beer and brandy good of the kind and in plenty if this extravagance was not counterbalanced by their admirable economy in other respects they would be the poorest people in europe  the military force of this archbishopric consists only of one regiment of foot containing  000 men every bailiwick has its rendezvous to which on signals given by means of cannon planted on the mountains they repair completely armed the number of peasants who can hit a mark of an handsbreadth are computed at   000  the university is kept up by the congregation of benedictines who supply it with professors as the having studied here is a kind of requisite for ecclesiastical preferment in the circle of suabia it is a place of some resort for students from that quarter but those excepted and a few of the natives there are no others though the chairs of the professors are filled with very able men the funds of the university are too small they do not in the whole exceed  00l per annum  the civil and military officers of saltzburg have a very great advantage over those of other countries which is that half their salaries are continued to their widows during their life or till they change their condition  from the top of the unterberge a mountain near saltzburg there is a prospect over all bavaria nine lakes may be reckoned up in one view the most charming part of this prospect however is the principality of berchtolsgaden which lies to the south of the mountain it consists of a small narrow vale encompassed around with vast heights of the most picturesque granate and hardly contains  000 inhabitants the nature of this country being favorable neither to agriculture nor pasture the inhabitants have given themselves to works of art which fail mankind in no part of the earth and are mighty and powerful enough to turn the hardest stones into bread it is in these remote valleys that they make the greatest part of the toys with which nuremberg and augsburg carry on so considerable a trade the horses with spurs little rasps cukows wooden mannakins rats and mice and all the playthings for little children also the crucifixes straw quadrille boxes powder and pomatum boxes and all the playthings for great children in a word the greater part of the articles which go amongst us under the name of german toys it is a pretty sight to behold two or three families in a hut and to see the great plump hands of the farmers occupied in giving a finish to the smallest articles here is occupation for the old as well as the young the small price these commodities sell for makes it impossible for them to accumulate riches but they have enough and are happy these good people little think their productions are dispersed all over europe and that the spaniards drive a very profitable trade with them in both indies  hellbrunn is a palace of the archbishop near the city the building of which has nothing in it remarkable but the gardens are very pleasant they are laid out in the manner of a wilderness and abound with the finest waterworks reservoirs ponds and basins so clear that trouts and other fish may be seen sporting in them and nibbling the calves and ox livers with which they are fed by these waters all kinds of little figures of mills scissargrinders etc are thrown about the garden and in the grotto you are sure of being sprinkled by the artificial playing of the water over one of the many springs in this garden is the statue of a monster which might be taken for a savage or wildman were it not for its cockscomb and eagles feet under it is this inscription anno       the original of this monstrous figure called a forest devil was caught a hunting near stavenburg his skin was yellowish he had all the marks of savageness and never looked at any one but hid himself in corners he had the face of a man with a beard eagles feet with lions claws the tail of a dog and on his head grew a large cockscomb he soon died with hunger as no alurements nor violence could make him eat or drink  the bishopric of passau this city is situated sixty miles southeast of ratisbon at the confluence of the three rivers danube inn and iltsz it is divided into four parts the town of passau innstadt iltszstadt and the quarter in which the bishops palace is seated the first three are fortified but the last which is only a suburb has nothing but an old castle in which the bishop generally resides it was in this city that peace was concluded between charles v and the protestant princes in      by which the lutherans were to enjoy the free exercise of their religion passau is but a very miserable illbuilt town those parts excepted which lie near the danube and the princes palace it is well situated for trade but its chief subsistence comes from the court the income of which is about l  000 a year and on the canons whose benefices are the richest in germany a stall here being supposed to be worth about  000 florins a year and what with the income of other benefices there are few of them who have not nearly double that income  the inhabitants of these several holy cities are all much alike as drinking and intriguing constitute their principal occupation and the poverty and good humor which seldom forsake those who are thus addicted render them affable obsequious and humble the cathedral is a fine gothic building which merits well to be viewed there are fine china manufactories and potteries in this country the produce of the former is carried as far as the rhine  many attempts have been made to plant vines on the iser and danube below ratisbon but hitherto they have produced grapes only for eating this whole tract of country being too full of wood and water for the vine to ripen in but what was suabia in the times of tacitus little did the romans think the vine would grow in germany when they doubted whether even fruit would grow there and yet suabia produces some noble vines now which may rival the falernian and roman wines for their excellence  the reason to be assigned is that the air of a country changes with its cultivation the drying up of marshes renders it warmer the evaporation too occasioned by numbers who live together may work upon the air the slopes of the hills on the left side of the danube between this place and ratisbon promise a good place to plant vines in as they are well guarded from the noxious winds and the wine made near passau truly merits the name of wine  this large vale of the danube produces likewise the best kind of corn and would very easily nourish twice the number of inhabitants it does at present  corn is often so cheap in bavaria as hardly to pay the farmer for the trouble of raising it one hundred and seventy pounds of rye are frequently sold for about two slorins  navigation is by no means so well understood in this country as it is upon the upper rhine they do not yet understand how to sail by the direction of the river most of the vessels which come down the danube from ratisbon and ulm are without decks or masts they are built only of firboards and are sold again either at vienna or elsewhere the emperor has promised great encouragement to those persons who will build their vessels like those on the rhine but in this as in every thing else it is difficult to make the mechanical part of the public tread the track to which they have not been accustomed  though bavaria is a rich plentiful country and lies well situated for trade from the danube and several other navigable rivers passing through it yet the inhabitants in general are not rich which is supposed to proceed from the electors monopolizing the most considerable articles of commerce particularly that of salt which he prohibits his subjects either from importing or from purchasing of any person except himself a second monopoly is that of corn the farmer is obliged to sell all his corn to the electors agents who retail it out again to the people this prince like the czar of muscovy is premiergeneral for his dominions none may brew or sell strong beer but the electors factors there is only an indifferent small beer which the peasants and citizens are allowed to brew in their own houses the bishop of passau whose territories lie within this circle likewise imitates the elector in this tyranny the chief subsistence of the peasants of this circle is their herds of swine which are fed in their woods and the wild beasts and game which they meet with there though it is penal to meddle with the game but in most parts of bavaria corn beer and salt are so excessive dear that a peasant can scarce afford to purchase them after what has been remarked respecting these monopolies it is needless to observe that the elector is absolute in his dominions there are some general laws in the empire that all princes and states are governed by but they are often disobeyed where there is not a force to compel the observance of them the elector and the archbishop of saltzburg are joint directors of the circle the elector of bavaria styles himself duke of the upper and lower bavaria and of the upper palatinate duke and count palatine of the rhine elector and vicar of the empire and grand master of the household  in the lower part of bavaria there are many more nobility who reside constantly on their estates than in any parts of germany and to this may be attributed the advantage of their superior cultivation for as the nobles are farmers it is no wonder that estates are managed better under the masters eye than in his absence though there are not many of them who are great proficients in agriculture yet a life passed in the midst of it must yield a greater insight into the means of its improvement than one spent in the parade of a court besides the nobles themselves will naturally treat their peasants better than the race of bailiffs agents etc who oppress and squeeze them for their own emolument and it is an indisputable fact that those landlords are richest and their estates best cultivated where the peasants are allowed some degree of liberty and property  though the peasants in this country are in a state of villenage they are treated in a kinder manner and have more property and better houses than in other parts of germany and many of them are also farmers who by industry and frugality have saved many much of this country is enclosed than which there cannot be any improvement of so great consequence sheep seems to be a principal article in their husbandry every farm of any size has a large sheephouse with a roof but open on one side to the south in this house they fold their sheep every night the year round and depend on it principally for manuring their lands when they begin to fold they spread over the floor light virgin soil turf sand or peatearth and fold upon it till it is very moist and dirty then they make a fresh layer and so go on but to every eighteen inches of depth they litter with straw for they remove the heap but once a year and in extreme wet or snowy weather they do the same this is an excellent system for raising manure but it might be imagined that the sheep lying on a dunghill would be prejudicial to their health this the bavarians deny and on the contrary assert that not only the health of the animal is the better for it but likewise that the wool is much finer than if the sheep were exposed to the weather    map of the circle of swabia map of swabia  chap xiv of the circle of swabia swabia is bounded by franconia on the north bavaria on the east switzerland on the south and alsace on the west it contains the duchies of wurtemberg the margravate of baden the principality of hohenzollern that of oetringen and that of mindelheim the bishoprics of augsburg constance and coire with several baronies abbeys and free towns it derives its name from the sueir who were so called from their long hair which tacitus mentions as a peculiarity belonging to them by which a swabian was known  this country prides itself not a little in the source of that famous river the danube its course is not less than four hundred german miles it flows by fifty large cities and takes in twelve great rivers besides above eighty lesser streams so that few rivers can be brought into competition with it not even the nile itself this celebrated river rises near doneschingen in the territories of fustemberg and by the conflux of several rivers soon becomes considerable keysler notices a singular circumstance which he observed at a chapel built on an eminence near burlatingen a hunting seat of the prince of hohenzollern its being situated so that the rain which fell on one side of the chapel went into the danube and that which fell on the other into the rhine on the chapel is a very suitable inscription taken from the psalms  sit nomen domini laudabile ab orient ad occidentem blessed be the name of the lord from the rising to the setting of the sun or from the east to the west  the rhine the principal source of which took its rise on one side of the chapel emptying itself in the german ocean and the danube running in a quite contrary direction and losing itself in the black sea  in fertility of soil the territories of the circle of swabia vary very much which is a constant source of complaint to the assemblies of the circle from districts which imagine themselves aggrieved in their assessments the highest parts in swabia are the alps and the schwarzwald or black forest the former of which are still somewhat higher than the latter the schwarzwald has probably been so called from the thick forests of fir with which it is covered and according to the description given us by julius caesar of the sylva hyrcinia this was the beginning of it this wood is by much the largest in germany being sixty days journey in length and nine in breadth the inhabitants subsist chiefly by graziery wood and pitch which they trade in for exportation in many parts of it there are two kinds of land one like the common ploughed fields and the other rendered fertile by the following method the peasants lay billets of fir about six feet long at a proper distance and between them vine branches covered with sods pared off the same field one of these heaps is called a ross or horse and the number of them is proportioned to the dimensions of the field these they kindle leaving them to consume slowly and the ashes and earth are then scattered over the ground to which they communicate an extraordinary fertility but this lasts only for three or four years it is then left for some years fallow and yields good grass till it becomes again fit to undergo the above operation  this circle contains   0 square german miles under the emperor frederic iii the circle of swabia was divided into four quarters which division still continues and on many occasions has been found to be very beneficial the duke of wurtemberg is head of the first the margrave of baden the second the bishop of constance and the abbot of kempten heads of the third and the bishop of augusburg head of the fourth  of the territories of the duke of wurtemburg the greatest part of this dukedom consists in an extensive valley which is bounded on the east by a chain of hills called the alps on the west by the black forest on the north by a part of the mountain of oden wald and an arm of the black forest on the whole it inclines to the northward and is watered in the middle by the river neckar several smaller arms run off from the surrounding chain of hills toward the center cross each other in various directions and form little valleys which are watered by an infinity of rivers the land is rendered exceedingly fruitful by these lesser hills which shelter the valleys from the cold hills and collect the heat of the sun between them  the southern sides of these mountains and hills are planted with vines very high up and above them there is excellent dyers and brushwood and at the bottom is a gray colored light mould which yields all kind of corn but particularly barley in astonishing plenty upon the whole this country resembles the middle part of lorrain but the soil is much better and there are not so many stones in it excepting salt which it is obliged to have recourse to bavaria for it abounds in all the necessaries of life what corn is not consumed in the country is sent to switzerland and the wine goes as far as england the whole extent of the country does not contain more than two hundred german square miles in this circuit there are about five hundred and sixty thousand inhabitants that is about two thousand eight hundred to every german square mile those parts of germany excepted which are in the neighborhood of some capital cities and some districts of italy and the netherlands there is certainly no country in europe so populous in proportion to its extent as this it is however so fruitful as to be able to support as many more inhabitants  the income of the duke amounts to about three hundred thousand pounds a year some calculations make the sum smaller but as there are few parts of germany in which the taxes are not estimated at five florins per head and in some they pay much more why should it not be so in wurtemberg which is one of the largest territories in germany and in which the subject is not more spared  after the electors the duke is beyond comparison the greatest prince in germany though the landgrave of hesse cassel who has not above two thirds of the subjects or yearly income is of more consequence in the empire on account of his connection with england  the government of this dukedom is not so simple and unmixed as that of the territory of baden here are swarms of counselors secretaries proctors and advocates of which more than half might be spared but the nature of the government allows them to enjoy their appointments in idleness many of them it is true belong to the state whose duty it is to limit the authority of the prince but notwithstanding the many reductions in the household itself it is still much too large for the dukes circumstances  in all the cities towns and large villages in this duchy there are certain officers called private overseers who inspect into the offenses and misdemeanors of their fellowcitizens and make a report of them to the magistracy of the place in order that they may be further enquired into if the magistrates shall think fit these inquisitors are private and swear to the faithful execution of their office instead of a salary they are generally rewarded with a counsellors place or some other office in the government no one knows his accuser as keysler observes from whom this peculiar circumstance in the police of wurtemberg is taken which may be an inlet to many abuses if their information alone passes for sufficient proofs and they are considered in any other light than as premonitions for the judge or as incentives to greater cautions for the future this custom is similar to the denuncie secret at venice but is practiced in no other part of germany  though the country throughout is protestant and the duke alone a catholic there still prevails a great deal of superstition and bigotry the clergy are members of the state these have a jurisdiction of their own and are very wealthy  after the repeal of the edict of nantz the duke of wurtemberg might have reaped very considerable advantages by affording shelter and encouragement to the french refugees there being among them many rich people and those profitable manufactures would have been introduced here which enriched brandenburgh and other countries but a blind zeal for orthodoxy and the clamours of the clergy that it would be setting up altar against altar and that even mahometanism was preferable to calvinism filled the assembly of the states with such jealousies and apprehensions that the court was disappointed in its good intentions an afterreflection opened peoples eyes when it was seen what a valuable opportunity they had rejected  the dukes army consisted formerly of fourteen thousand men and if his debts were paid and his other expenses moderated such an establishment might always be supported as the population and revenues of the country appear to allow it at the time of the change however they were reduced to about five thousand men and those seem to be none of the best troops the late duke of wurtemberg some few years since made himself the topic of conversation all over europe for his sumptuous feasts his magnificent balls the splendour of his illuminations in which immense forests were lighted up his superb hunting parties and his brilliant operas where all the firstrate dancers from paris were procured with noverre at their head when his fame was at the highest together with all the principal italian singers at a most enormous expense the consequences were such as might naturally have been foreseen debt oppressive taxes resistance on the part of the states of the country and finally a commission of enquiry issued from the imperial court the debts upon examination were found to amount to twelve hundred thousand pounds the evil counselors as it may easily be imagined were removed but this would have done but little had not an alteration about this time taken place in most of the lesser courts of the empire the princes of which from being oppressive and extravagant tyrants suddenly contracted a taste for political economy and philosophical pursuits the duke of wurtemberg is now quite a philosopher he founds schools farms cultivates arts and sciences and establishes manufactures in short he has endeavored in every way possible to make up for what has been wrong this change has taken place ever since the year      the prince took the opportunity of his birthday to publish a manifesto of which the following is the substance that being a man and from the condition of human nature far removed from the standard of perfection it could not but fall out that partly from human frailty ever prone to err and partly from the want of sagacity and from other causes many events had taken place which had they not happened things would have been very different from what they now are or are likely to be hereafter this i acknowledge freely and i assure my loving subjects that every successive year of my life which it shall please the divine providence to bestow shall be dedicated to the promotion of their happiness henceforwards the prosperity of wurtemberg shall be established on the joint and firm basis of the sovereigns love for his people and of the peoples confidence in the affection of their sovereign and we trust that every man will for the future live in confidence that he has a provident and anxious father in his prince and that the only contest that shall arise hereafter shall be which shall do most to make his native country happy and flourishing  the affection of the people toward their prince was very remarkable even when the duke seemed to have no other care than how he should load them with new taxes he did not forfeit their attachment the curses of the people fell on his servants and the crew of projectors who led him astray but as soon as they were banished he became the idol of his subjects and very deservedly so  all the princes of the house of wurtemberg stutgard are brave and as it were born for military achievements prince maximilian especially gave the greatest hopes of himself when scarce fourteen years of age he entered into the service of charles xii of sweden and continued to attend that prince in all his campaigns at the surprise of the town of pultawa in   0  though so young he attacked sword in hand an old saxon trooper who turning about in some astonishment said to him thou little son of a whore what art thou already for cracking a stout fellows skull and was going to dispatch the prince had not charles xii came to his assistance and afterward in a dark night the prince riding full speed before the king suddenly stopped at a deep pit the king supposing it was from fear of the enemy called out forward forward upon which the prince regardless of the danger clapped spurs to his horse and fell into a pit the king being close behind had the same fate and with his horse fell upon the prince who was half dead this so endeared him to charles that he set up a whole night with him at the unfortunate battle of pultawa he was taken prisoner the czar offering him a commission his answer was that whilst he had a drop of blood it should be employed in the service of his swedish majesty as his benefactor this so charmed the generous czar that on certain conditions he gave him his liberty and presented him with the sword he then wore whether from a mistaken gratitude he drank too freely at taking leave of the russians or whether his activity in the former fatiguing campaign had hurt his constitution this heroic prince on his return to his native country was seized with a fever which proved fatal to him in the twentyfirst year of his age dying in the bloom of his youth and in the certain hopes that by his marriage with the kings sister ulrica he should come one day to fit on the throne of sweden  stutgard the capital of the duchy is not a large city but contains two well built suburbs and has been the residence of the dukes since      the new ducal palace was built in      in a delightful country full of gardens and vineyards in the misenbach which at about one league distance runs into the neckar and contains about  0000 inhabitants they are a handsome people the women are tall and slender with fair and ruddy complexions the natural riches and the ease with which a maintenance is acquired either in town or country cause them to live exceedingly well the stutgarder is so attached to his home that remove him but thirty miles from it and he is seized with the malady du pais at present little notice is taken of the noble palace of stutgard and this is more particularly felt in the pleasurehouse where formerly the ridottos were held this edifice were it only on account of its hall which has few equals in all europe very well deserves notice it is two hundred and twenty feet in length eighty broad and ninety high without a single pillar its roof which is arched being fastened in a masterly manner with wooden screws in the year   0  marshal villars coming into this hall mistook it for a place of worship and said with some admiration voici un beau temple i e this is a fine church on the roof are painted several scriptural histories but on the sides are views of all the forests of the duchy of wurtemberg and some merry scenes which happened at different times in the hunting parties near it is the orangery which is composed of very large and high trees but not well contrived want of height occasioning many of the trees to bend at the top the new building as it is called is of fine freestone with a grand staircase of the same and a spacious hall whose galleries rest on twelve pillars of a great height on these are painted the twelve months the roof shows the most ancient transactions of the family of wurtemberg and the sides are filled with masquerades and public entries  in the museum are several portraits of the ducal family with petrifactions mechanical and mathematical inventions curious specimens of penmanship gems costly vessels mummies old medals etc among other curiosities you see the picture of a woman with a large beard apparently in her twentyfifth year and she is again painted in her old age this seeming contradiction of a bearded woman is accounted an error of nature which commonly proceeds from an excess of humidity in this case it is possible for bearded women to enjoy a lasting health an instance of which we have in margaret formerly governess of the low countries whose great beard was a very singular ornament to her robust strength few traits in history are more known than the bearded amazon who served as a grenadier in all the campaigns of charles xii of sweden and gave more than masculine proofs of courage till she was taken prisoner in the battle of pultawa she was brought from siberia to petersburg and introduced to the czarina with a beard an ell and an half long there is also the picture of a swiss countrywoman which is drawn with a very venerable beard to be seen in the breflaw collection  the ducal palace offers nothing interesting but the grand staircase which ascends gradually without steps so that any one may ride up and down it  the palace of ludwigsburg two leagues from stutgard was formerly but a farmhouse for breeding cattle but is now acknowledged to be one of the finest edifices in all germany the lookingglass and lackered closet are very curious and so is the great staircase for the ambassadors with its magnificent cieling and the gallery of pictures among these are some admirable nightpieces and a great many pictures of horses and dogs and likewise the picture of a black wolf which was kept for a long time at court he was called melac and followed the duke wherever he went and even slept at the foot of his bed the chapel belonging to the palace is very elegant but something rather too small here is also a curious menagery of foreign fowl the dukes band of music may be said to equal that of any court in europe  the greenhouse is one of the finest to be met with any where the duke likewise employs considerable sums of money for his studs and his hunters he has at present three sets of horses of eight in each set which one coachman can manage without a postilion so that in traveling they perform all the paces and curvettings of the manage and sometimes the duke himself has been the coachman  in the beginning of this century an order of hunting was instituted in this duchy the ensign of this knighthood is a huntinghorn one privilege of the companions is that they are preferred in the nomination to commanderies each of which is worth five hundred guilders the knights of this order may be present at all the public entertainments besides an unlimited number of princes and persons of high birth this order has also twelve ancient imperial counts thirty knights and a secretary the device of the order is a gold maltese cross set with rubies four golden eagles at its four angles and between the middle and lower point a huntinghorn in the center is a round green enamelled shield on one side of which is a golden w with a ducal coronet and on the other three golden huntinghorns slung together this cross is fastened to a crimson watered ribband of a hands breadth and is worn over the left shoulder down to the right side on the left breast of the coat is also a silver star with the device of the order together with it is motto amicitiae virtutisque foedus i e the band of virtue and friendship embroidered with gold in a green circle all the knights are obliged to wear these ensigns of the order those only excepted who are of higher orders and have already a star in that place these nevertheless are observed to wear the wurtemberg star on their waistcoat and a little cross of the order hanging on a narrow red ribband round their neck every knight is to put the cross and collar of the order under the coat of arms of his family this collar consists of green enamelled little shields on which are alternately the golden w with the ducal coronet and three golden huntinghorns between each shield stands a golden eagle with its wings extended and its talons on each shield the festival for a general chapter of the order is held annually on st huberts day at whatever place the sovereign happens to be when there is always a great hunting match the companions who are prevented from making their appearance are obliged if it be any ways possible and they are not disabled by sickness or prevented by affairs of very great concern to celebrate the day in honor of the order wherever they are with a hunt and other entertainments if a knight is seen in public without the cross of the order he forfeits a handsome pair of pistols to the informer and twenty dollars to the poor but he who neglects to wear the order for a year and a day is degraded  the duke of wurtemburg has several hunting seats which he visits alternately in the deer or boar seasons so that every five years he sees his principal forests the multitude of deer in this country may be estimated by considering that above seven thousand of them perished in one single hard winter  it is a custom over all the country of wurtemburg to adorn chambers and galleries with large branches of deers horns at waldenburg over most of the remarkable branches is inscribed the name of the person who shot the deer and the dexterity of a late duke has filled some rooms with them at the hunting seat of einsidel are two remarkable branches which in rutting time the deer to whom they belonged thrust into each other and twisted together with such force that they cannot be disengaged and the creatures died on the spot the like is also shown in the royal chamber of curiosities at copenhagen at einsidel is also a large hawthorn grown from a twig which was brought above two hundred years ago from the holyland by everhardus barbatus on his hat and afterward planted here with his own hands in crusiuss time this shrub had spread to a circumference of fiftytwo else its branches were supported by fortythree pillars and no single person could grasp its stock  in the year   00 were found above sixty different frusta of large teeth shoulderblades ribs and joints of backbones the most remarkable of which are still kept in the museum at stutgard some of them appear to have belonged to fishes of prey others to bears tigers lions horses etc and some particularly the largest teeth to elephants near boll in wurtemberg is found an abundance of skeletons which are petrified and changed to a perfect stone whose spine not being tubulous and consequently without marrow shows them to have belonged to fishes a specimen of these is in the hands of d mauchart of tubingen but a larger piece may be seen in the gallery of natural curiosities at dresden and for which an apothecary of tubingen received fifty rixdollars  tubingen the second city in wurtemberg about twenty miles from stutgard is of such antiquity that its era is unkown this place was once the seat of the emperor caracalla who entertained the germans with public games in this city the high court of justice is held here besides the university which is in great repute there is a collegium illustre for the education of princes and young noblemen in the townhouse is a very curious clock which deserves the attention of travelers  keysler relates a very singular adventure which happened to a tame stork that was kept some years ago in the collegio illustri as an instance of rationality in animals this bird had lived very quietly in the courtyard till count gravenitz a student shot at a storks nest near the college and most probably wounded the stork that was in it as for some weeks after he was not seen to stir from his nest this happened in autumn when the foreign storks set out on their periodical emigration the following spring a stork was observed upon the roof of the college and by its continual chattering gave the tame stork which was walking in the college court to understand that it was desirous the battle of the storks of its company but this being impracticable by reason of its wings being clipped the stranger with the greatest caution came down to the upper gallery the next day somewhat lower and lastly after abundance of ceremonies alighted in the court the tame stork not conscious of any crime went and met him with a soft cheerful note a sincere indication of courtesy and friendship when to his astonishment the other fell furiously upon him some spectators of this interview for that time immediately put the foreign stork to flight yet was it so little discouraged that the very next day it returned to the charge and during the whole summer frequent skirmishes passed between these birds orders being given that the tame stork having only one antagonist should not be assisted being thus put to its shifts it began to stand better upon its guard and made such a vigorous resistance that at the end of the campaign the stranger had little to boast of but the spring ensuing instead of a single stork came four which without any of the foregoing ceremonies lighted at once in the collegecourt and made at the tame stork this peaceable fowl in presence of many spectators from the galleries performed exploits if the expression may be permitted above the valor of man defending itself and assaulting its enemies with the most vigorous intrepidity till at length overpowered and its strength being spent it was falling under the redoubled strokes of the enemy when some very unexpected auxiliaries appeared all the turkeycocks ducks geese and the whole posse of fowls which were brought up in the court and to whom this gallant stork had unquestionably endeared itself by its mild and friendly carriage braving the danger formed as it were a rampart by means of which it might make an honorable retreat from so an unequal a fight even a peacock which before would never be upon good terms with it on this occasion sided with oppressed innocence and was if not a staunch friend at least a favorable judge on the storks side this occasioned a stricter watch to be kept against all such treacherous incursions and a stop was put to any further bloodshed till in the beginning of the third spring above twenty storks made a stoop into the court and before the poor storks lifeguards could form themselves or any people come to its assistance murdered it however under such disparity it exerted all its former heroism and made the storks pay dear for their base assassination the rancour of these strangers against this innocent creature could proceed only from the gun fired by count gravenitz and falsely construed by them to have been done at the instigation of the tame stork  whoever may be inclined to read a judicious abridgment of all that has been advanced in favor of the souls and understanding of brutes will be gratified in mr ribouss treatise de anima brutorum in addition to this story of the stork i shall here offer to the readers consideration the adventure of d gahrlieps tame fox as a further instance of their combination and reflection every evening d gahrliep had his tame fox carefully chained up a confinement which this beast used to liberty could not well digest and it was not long before he found by frequent trials that he could slip his collar over his head in the night he was not wanting to take advantage of such a fine opportunity and made a terrible havoc among the neighboring fowls and geese but always took care to be at home before daybreak and immediately slipped his neck into the collar again imagining he should thus avoid the suspicion of being thought the author of these depredations amidst all the heavy complaints of the neighbors the innocence of the fox seemed the more certain as gahrlieps poultry had enjoyed an uninterrupted repose at last the spoiler being caught in the fact by a vigilant neighbor the doctor was condemned in costs and damages and he in revenge made a skeleton of the perpretator of this mischief  there is another celebrated town in this duchy called hailbron or the fountain of health from the virtues of the medicinal waters it is a free imperial city under the dukes protection situated in a plain twelve miles southeast of tubingen this water at present is not used medicinally as formerly but continues in great repute for its extraordinary clearness and salubrity to the use of this spring the emperor charles v attributed his recovery from a dangerous fit of sickness in      keysler gives a remarkable instance of its numerous and fertile vineyards by observing last year this was in      that such plenty of wine was made in this country and further up the banks of the neckar that the inhabitants had not a sufficient number of casks to put it in and such wine of the growth of      as could be spared was sold for half a creutzer or a farthing a quart when at the same time a quart of seltzer mineral water cost eighteen creutzers or thirtysix times as much  in the district of urach is a curiosity worth notice in an high and steep mountain near the town of urach is the famous woodslider which consists of one thick iron pipe about three feet broad two high and about nine hundred long this pipe begins at the top of the mountain and reaches almost down the valley near the town of urach and the river erms into its upper opening the wood which has been felled on the mountain and cut into hillets is put and being carried down the pipe is thrown into the river erms which forwards it into the neckar and by this means furnishes stutgard with fuel at a small expense notwithstanding the great impetuosity with which it must naturally move in coming from an eminence above two hundred paces in the air yet near an hundred may be told before a billet reaches the other end of this extraordinay conduit  the description which reisbec gives of the inhabitants in the black forest forms a very different contrast to the rest of the dukes subjects the men says he are clumsy and the women yellow ill shaped and wrinkled at the age of thirty they distinguish themselves from their neighbors by a most frightful taste in dress and a shocking want of cleanliness i am not able he adds to account for the ugliness of this people need labor and little food may contribute to it but cannot be the only reason for in the country of furstemberg and particularly in the austrian parts of this great chain of hills are very handsome people who do not seem to live better than the wirtembergers possibly the ugliness of the latter may be owing to the situation and depth of the valleys to the air and perhaps to the water these journies says reisbec over the mountains had particular charms for me i fancied myself in a new world one enchanting prospect succeeded another in variety and beauty mountains and chains of mountains of the most extraordinary forms cataracts woods small lakes in the deep hollows precipices in short every thing i saw was in so grand a style as to exceed all description the duke of wirtemberg enjoys one very great privilege that there lies no appeal from his courts of judicature to the aulic or any other foreign tribunal he sits and votes in the college of princes by virtue of the duchy of wirtemberg and has demanded the same privilege as duke of teck this is an old castle now in ruins with a town adjoining the first duke of teck known with any certainty lived toward the end of the twelfth century the dukes title is duke of wirtemberg and teck count of mompelgard lord of heydenheim and justinjen he is joint director of the circle of swabia with the bishop of constance  his office in the empire is to carry the imperial standard this office of standard bearer of the holy roman empire was conferred on the counts of wirtemberg in      the dukes of wirtemberg are also grand huntsmen of the empire and in allusion to this honor duke eberhard lewis in   0  founded the order of hunting of which we have already treated and in the year      renewed and increased its statutes the reigning duke of wirtemberg being always grandmaster  the margravate of baden is about ninety miles in length but not above twenty in breadth it lies near the banks of the rhine and extends from bale almost to philipsburg and from thence through part of alsace to the moselle it produces corn hemp flax turnips pease and other vegetables and the villages along the rhine abound in hay and breed great quantities of cattle besides which they enjoy the convenience of good fisheries in the rhine venison and wild fowl are so plentiful in the forests that it is the ordinary food of the peasants and they have woods of chestnuts where there are very excellent baconhogs here are also quarries of marble of all colors and freestone with which materials the inhabitants build magnificent houses at a trifling expense they carry on a large trade in cattle wood and wine which last is extremely good in the environs of bale the mildness of the government secures to the people the quiet enjoyment of the rewards of their industry there are not indeed opportunities of making great fortunes as the court is very economical but the same cause prevents the pressure of extreme poverty the felicity of exporting merchandise by the navigation on the rhine is a great incitement to industry the manufactures in consequence increase every year and some of them particularly that of earthen ware at durloch are in high estimation they have likewise made some successful experiments in manufacturing of silk  the prince in short endeavors by every possible means to introduce industry and manufactories among his subjects there are a considerable number of english tradesmen here says moore who make birmingham work and instruct the inhabitants in that business he has also engaged many watchmakers from geneva to settle here by granting them encouragment and privileges of every kind and allows no opportunity to slip by which he can promote the comfort and happiness of his people a prince of such a character is certainly a public blessing and the people are fortunate who are born under his government but far more fortunate they who are born under a government which can protect them independent of the virtues and in spite of their sovereign  baden the capital of the marquisate takes it name from the multitude of hot baths about it which are said to amount to near three hundred the town is situated in the midst of vineyards upon a mountainous rocky ground which renders the streets very uneven the baths are scalding hot and as they issue from rocks of salt alum and brimstone taste strongly of those minerals one of them boils and bubbles up as if it stood over a hot furnace among other distempers these waters are famous for curing the cramp and gout which brings a great resort of company to this place during the summer months the only public buildings are the castle built on an adjoining hill and a palace belonging to the margrave which however is uninhabited the residence of the court being principally at carlsrube  the town of carlsrube is well built on a regular plan it consists of one principal street of about an english mile in length this street is at a considerable distance in front of the palace and in a parallel direction with it all the other streets go off at different angles from the principal one in such a manner as that which ever of them you enter walking from it the view is terminated by the front of the palace the length of their smaller streets is ascertained none of them being allowed to encroach on the spacious area which is kept clear before the palace  the principal street may be extended to any length and as many additional streets as they please may be built from it all of which will have according to this plan the palace for termination  the houses of this town are as uniform as the streets being all of an equal size and height so as to give the appearance that none of the inhabitants are in any considerable degree richer or poorer than their neighbors there are indeed a few new houses more elegant than the rest which belong to some of the officers of the court and are built on one side of the palace but they are not properly speaking in the town  it stands in the middle of a large forest the remnant of that which in the time of tacitus covered all germany through this forest there are thirtytwo regular avenues extending to a great distance and the town which is built in the shape of a fan stands upon nine of these the first stone of the palace was laid in      half of the right wing is wanting the building having for some years been discontinued the first object of attention here and for which no expense has been thought too great is the turret on the body of the building from whence we have not only a view of all the principal streets but also of five and twenty walks some set with trees and others cut through the woods which no other princes seat can rival and still heightened by a prospect of other variegated walks in the same woods some of these walks bear the names of those ministers who served his highness at the time of these improvements and the streets in the town are called by the names of different german princes the garden though small is very elegant and contains above four thousand orange lemon bay and other such kind of trees  in some of the lower parts of the garden are espaliers of young lemon trees here is also an aviary for three hundred canarybirds which in summertime used to fly about the gardens all day and at night repair to their habitation behind the palace is a decoy where above two thousand wild fowl are daily fed the chief defect in carlsrube is want of water the neighboring country is a sandy level which in summer makes traveling very disagreeable all the water for the garden is conveyed by handpumps but what is most singular is that the whole town consists entirely of wooden buildings  a traveller who passed through it expressing his surprise one day to the margrave to see a palace entirely of wood true sir said the prince you may think it ought at least to have been built of brick but i could not have been more magnificently lodged without laying expensive taxes on my subjects and i wanted only a roof to lay my head under this court has been much reflected upon for its economy the fact is the debts of the family were numerous and great those in the hereditary dominions have arisen from frequent wars and the necessary provision for the younger branches of the family and in the last administration every thing had been suffered to go to ruin because the successor was a protestant under these circumstances the princes mother carried her economy so far as to cause the flowers which grew in the gardens of the palace to be sold instead of permitting her daughters to wear them in their bosoms for this though without the strictest economy the family must have been ruined she was laughed at perhaps in some degree not undeservedly  from carlsrube it is two stages and a quarter to radstadt but it is worth while to turn off a little on the left hand to the favorita built by the widow of a late margrave of badenbaden in the newest taste of architecture here is a chamber of very beautiful porcelain and a cabinet lined with lookingglass with many curiosities of art and nature particularly above forty very good pictures of the said countess in different masquerade dresses which in her juvenile years she had at various times appeared in amidst the gradual alterations of the complexion and features in such a long succession of time the same look is every where discernable i know not says keysler a better set of portraits they will even bear a comparison with the admirable performances of rubens in the luxemburg gallery where queen mary of medicis is represented under a variety of changes  the height of the lower hall reaches through all the stories and its cupola round which is a balustrade leading into the different apartments is very light and the top beautifully painted some of the apartments are hung with a chinese manufacture of paper and silk others with lacework and bed curtains of the same the cieling of one or two is enriched with gems as agate jasper cornelians amethists etc imitating fishes birds and flowers the excellent order of the kitchen larder hall medicinal wareroom washhouse cannot but please an economist and the countess used to take great pleasure to show her guests these subterraneous offices on the left at the end of the little orangery is a pleasant garden and on the right a wild thicket leading to the hermitage in the center of it stands the house the outward walls of which are covered with large pieces of bark the door seems to rest upon the trunks of old trees and all that is to be seen within are the coarse images of jesus joseph and mary a mean bed without curtains an altar without decorations and at the angles of the narrow walks in the garden stand wooden images of old hermits as big as life some of them in an hairy habit the niches like the door are supported by old decayed trunks of trees  a league from the favorita lies radstadt a place regularly built with a stately palace from the center of which there is a view of all the streets the middle of which terminates in a long walk  the reigning family and the country in general profess lutheranism but with the toleration of calvinists catholics and jews  after the electors and the houses of wurtemburg and hesse cassel the margrave of baden is one of the greatest potentates in germany his revenues are about one hundred and twenty thousand pounds a year i reckon says reisbec the few days i spent at carlsrube among the happiest of my life i saw a prince who truly lives only for his people and seeks for his happiness in theirs one whose active and enlightened mind pervades the whole country and by its influence makes all those who have a share in the administration patriots like himself education police encouragement to industry and agriculture every thing in short here breathes a spirit of philosophy and the warm love of mankind o that i could make says he many millions as happy as the margrave of baden makes two hundred thousand men he adds the margrave is as amiable in private life as he is respectable in public and the margravine is possessed of every polite accomplishment so that the court to which strangers easily get admission is the best society in carlsrube  the german princes are minute observers of form the same establishment for their household and the like number of officers in their palaces are to be found among them as in the court of the most powerful monarch of europe the difference lies more in the salaries than in the talents requisite for these places one paymaster of the forces in england has greater emoluments than a grand marechal a grand chamberlain two secretaries of state and half a dozen more of the chief officers of a german court  the margrave of baden like every other sovereign prince in germany has bodyguards who do duty in the palace footguards who parade before it also horseguards and hussars all of whom are perfectly well equipped and exactly disciplined a piece of magnificence which seems to be adopted by this prince merely in conformity with the custom long established in this country  he keeps on foot no other troops besides the few which are necessary for this duty at the palace though his revenue is more considerable and his finances are in much better order than those of some princes in germany who have little standing armies in constant pay he has too just an understanding not to perceive that the greatest army he could possibly maintain could be no defense to his dominions situated as they are between the powerful states of france and austria and probably his principles and disposition prevent him from thinking of filling his coffers by letting out his subjects to foreign powers  if he was so inclined there is no doubt that he might sell the persons of his subjects as soldiers or employ them in any other way he might think proper for he as well as other sovereign princes in germany has an unlimited power over his people if you ask the question in direct terms of a german he will answer in the negative and will talk of certain rights which the subjects enjoy and that they can appeal to the great council or general diet of the empire for relief but after all his ingenuity and distinctions you find that the barriers which protect the peasant from the power of the prince are so very weak that they are hardly worth keeping up and that the only security the peasant has for his person or property must proceed from the moderation good sense and justice of his sovereign  happy adds moore with reisbec would it be for mankind if this unlimited power were always placed in as equitable hands as those of the present margrave of baden who employs it entirely for the good of his subjects by whom he is adored  among his other establishments a late margrave had the following singular one and this was a notorious seminary of young women where by an unnatural whim of his above thirty female creatures were maintained some of whom were always walking by his coach in the garb of hey dukes and others at night keeping guard in the palace the general provision for them on their discharge was to be married to some petty officer of the household  selflove has ever shown great address in reconciling licentious inclinations with religion and in making a compact as it were with god by which favorite vices are retained and all due homage paid to the deity in other respects the voluptuous comfort themselves with the numerous concubines of david and solomon and imagine god will not be so strict but that a punctual observance of many external duties will compensate for giving way to some one frailty but this too must be such as suits their natural disposition if the revealed truths of our holy religion were liable to such perversions it is visible how sensuality would prevail under no other restraint than natural religion we readily believe what we wish and in such a case under the most flagitious profligacy any weak palliatives would be embraced for quieting the clamours of conscience what evils would not this bring upon society  the bishopric of constance the lands and estates of the bishopric of constance lie on both sides of the lake meadowgrounds and ploughedlands turn to very little account here the soil being clayey sandy or marshy and subject to inundations in the towns and villages the only traffic carried on is in wine but this amounts to nothing considerable this bishopric has ever been an immediate state of the empire and as such the bishop votes in the imperial diet among the princes he belongs particularly to the third quarter of which in conjunction with the abbot of kempton he is the head he is also a joint summoning prince of the circle but whether he be equal to the duke of wurtemburg or that the latter has some small preference is not decided the jurisdiction of the cathedral extends over great parts of switzerland the bishop is suffragan to the archbishop of mentz  the bodensee or lake of constance is in length about eighteen leagues it is divided into two parts that part from bregentz to constance being called the upper lake and that from constance to zell the lower lake the latter is between twenty and thirty fathoms deep and reckons along its banks near forty cities towns and villages yet the upper lake surpasses it having no less than fifty and the depth of it in some places is said to be three hundred and fifty fathoms its greatest breadth is between buchorn and rosback which lie at the distance of five leagues from each other this is by much the largest lake in germany the rhine which runs through this lake has so strong a current that it is said it does not mix with the waters of the lake near lindau and brugentz besides the fish usually caught in these parts there is also a kind of salmontrouts which being taken and pickled when full grown are exported as a great rarity they are generally an ell and an half or two else long weighing between thirty and forty pounds as the fishermen cannot always make a market of such large fish they tie a bit of wood to a line which having passed through the fishs gills or the hinder part of the head close up to the wood they fasten the other end of the line to a stake on the shore near their huts thus without any danger of losing it they can allow the fish a range of thirty or forty paces to swim in and keep it alive and sound till they meet with a company of purchasers or have an opportunity of selling it for some marriage or other great entertainment where a fish of that size is required  the city of constance is well built populous and finely situated it lies on the other side of the rhine over which there is a large wooden bridge and near it the river turns several mills the fortification of the city are sufficient to defend it well here are two markets every week to which the people of the towns and villages near the lake resort with their goods the town is not very large but it has a tolerable trade from the convenience of watercarriage along the lake and the rhine  the emperor sigismund called a council here in the year      for preventing a schism in the church from three popes pretending to the holy see at the same time but they were all deposed and martin v elected in his room in the eighth session of this council dr john wickliffe of oxford and his doctrines were condemned as heretical and his bones ordered to be dug up and burnt forty years after his death in the fifteenth session huss was condemned and delivered over to the secular power to be burnt though he had the emperors letters of safe conduct and the same sentence passed upon jerome of prague who was likewise burnt in this city and the natives still show the place to strangers this council lasted few years during which time there were in the city of constance four patriarchs twentynine cardinals three hundred and fortysix archbishops and bishops five hundred and sixty four abbots and doctors ten thousand secular princes and noblemen four hundred and fifty common whores and three hundred and twenty fiddlers the inhabitants are protestants constance was formerly a free imperial city but the religious commotions and the interim in      brought it under the power of the house of austria so that the bishop has little or no authority there and accordingly resides at merspurg on the other side of the lake of constance the pulpit of the cathedral is supported by a statue of john huss making a representation of him to serve as a pedestal to the pulpit was intended as a mark of further disgrace though it more naturally admits of a very honorable construction  in the dominican convent is the famous emanuel chrysolara a knight of constantinople descended from a noble family among the romans who had removed thither with the emperor constantine he died at the time of the general council of constance and in such reputation that all orders of men agreed in judging him worthy of the highest ecclesiastical dignity the ingenious conclusion of a fine epitaph composed for him by eneas sylviaus deserves particular notice my extraction is from ancient rome to me imperial constantinople gave birth my remains lie at constance but what imports it when we die the fort of felicity and the place of torment being every where equally distant reisbec makes the number of inhabitants in constance to be about six thousand and the revenues of the bishop seven thousand pounds a year the swiss side of this lake he adds is more pleasant than the opposite or german side the beautiful mixture of hills planted with vines the straggling appearance of farm houses with orchards round them with the small and varied patches of different kinds of agriculture make it more agreeable to the eye than the suabian villages the houses of which stand together as in the towns and are often encompassed by a great corn field or a wide meadow upon the whole both sides of the lake are equally well inhabited the swiss soil is more stony and heavy than the german and though the thurzan is one of the best ports of switzerland it is indebted to suabia for a part of the prime necessary of life which it repays in wine and fruits  it was on this stage that the celebrated gesner began his career who in a short time expelled so many millions of devils as is pretended and cured so many hundred bigots an order of the bishop of constance having prohibited such miracles in his diocese found him taking refuge under the prelate of salmansweiler who by the strength of hard gold always purchases of the pope an exemption from the bishops power in opposition to the bishop the prelate espoused the part of the refugee with much warmth and his fortune was made by the persecution he underwent the prelates steward supplied him with barrels of stinking oil and other commodities which he used for the purpose of his cures and in the furnishing of which the other found his account  they little think in holland how much they owe to the lake of constance as matters are at present they can hardly guard against the sand which being washed down from the alps by the aar and other rivers threatens to stop up the mouth of the rhine and already leaves room to conjecture some violent revolution by the sandbanks it has raised and if the reservoir we speak of did not interrupt by far the greatest quantity of sand which the rapid stream of the rhine washes from the high buntmerland holland must have been before this time buried under a new sand and the course of the rhine being altered would have totally changed the figure of that country it is true these changes must necessarily happen as however considerable the depth of this lake be it must at last be filled up and the sooner because the stream as it flows from constance through the upper parts of germany is always deepening its bed and the lake loses exactly as much water as it gains in sand on the other hand if we reflect how much so great a basin as this lake may contain and calculate its contents as de la torre did those of vesuvius we shall think the dutch are secure for many generations  uberlingen a city on the lake ten miles northeast of constance situate on the top of a rock and surrounded with vineyards was thought so pleasant by the ancient dukes of suabia that they made it their usual residence it has a very good trade and is famous for its mineral waters which cure the stone and other distempers and in twice or thrice washing take away all warts the hospital in this town is the best endowed in all suabia and the people so rich that they constitute as much to the general charges of the empire as many of the princes  near zell is the abbey of reichnau particularly famous for the large emerald presented to it by charles the great it is about two inches thick something larger than a common folio and weighs twenty eight pounds three quarters several jewellers have offered fifty thousand guilders a pound for it in the church of this abbey lies the abovementioned liberal emperor once so powerful and glorious but afterward forsaken by every one so that he died in extreme indigence in the year      the convent boasts likewise of being possessed of the body of st mark the evangelist but this is disputed with them by the venetians  in the cloisters of this abbey is the picture of a nobleman who died in      in the  0th year of his age with a beard reaching to his knees this puts me in mind says keysler of a flemish painter named john meyo whose beard was of such a length that when he stooped he could tread upon it and this peculiarity occasioned him to be nicknamed johannes barbatus  in this neighborhood is the forest of bregentz in the villages of which there has been hitherto says keysler a strange custom that the unmarried sons or servants of the peasants are allowed to intrigue with a girl till she proves with child and then indeed but not before are obliged under severe penalties to marry her this kind of gallantry they look upon as very innocent and are so strongly attached to it that when a few years ago government was for suppressing such a scandalous practice it was nearly occasioning an insurrection and the dispute is not yet terminated  augsburg is a free imperial city lies in a delightful country between the rivers lock and wertach which unite not far from this place it is a large populous well built city esteemed the capital of suabia furnished with many noble fountains adorned with brazen statues of ancient heroes and emperors and likewise with some valuable monuments of antiquity the burghers are reckoned to be  000 the council is mixed and consists of an equal number of reformed and papists the professors of both religions are easily distinguishable by their dress augsburg was formerly the most considerable city in all germany for commerce but the declension of the trade of venice was a severe stroke to it  the town house is accounted the finest in all germany the entrance is of polished red marble supported by two pillars of white the chambers contain abundance of historical and political paintings with well chosen apothegms exhorting the judges to impartial justice to prudence peace and the fear of god the whole breadth of it is one hundred and forty seven feet its length is one hundred and ten and its height one hundred and seventy five feet it was completed in    0 after having been six years in building its principal ornament is considered to be a saloon of fine pictures in the third story which is fifty two feet high fifty eight broad and one hundred and ten in length without any pillars to it and surrounded on both sides by the four princes rooms as they are called which are also exquisitely painted near the town house stands the lofty tower of perlachthurm this tower is three hundred steps high and the woman which stands above the weather cock is as big as life in an area adjoining to the tower is a very fine fountain with the four seasons in brass and in the center the emperor augustus with apposite inscriptions the palaces of the count de fugger are very magnificent the fuggery as it is called consists of  0  small houses erected in      by the family of the fuggers lords of the adjacent country for the reception of poor burgers who have annual pensions settled on them on the fine and well contrived aqueducts for the conveyance of water here from the loch are several corn sawing flatting and melting mills but the waterworks in particular are remarkable here which from five towers convey the water in such a manner through the city that not only five large and beautiful fountains with other public reservoirs but also the greatest part of the houses are supplied by means of these works with that element in plenty it is surrounded with very fine pasture land beautiful and fertile plains and with large forests full of all sorts of game there are more lutherans than catholics in this city who live together in tolerable harmony their poor are provided for in the same hospital and to avoid giving offense the lutherans stand with their hats off when the host goes by there is no place where the citizens have their dresses so varied which is so regulated by the magistrates that every person of quality and religion may be known by it  in the bishops palace which is otherwise an insignificant building is the hall in which the protestant princes presented their confession of faith to the emperor charles v in the diet held here anno    0 and from thence called the augsburg confession which occasioned a civil war in the empire that lasted some years but it was at last agreed in a subsequent diet held in the year      that the protestants should enjoy the free exercise of their religion throughout the empire the magistrates have since been composed of an equal number of protestants and catholics their senate consists of twentythree roman catholics and twentytwo lutherans and their common council of an hundred and fifty of each the executive power is in the senate and the legislative authority in both bodies  the fortifications of this town are not very strong the duke of bavaria took this city in   0  after a siege of thirteen days and after the loss of the battle of hochstadt the same year he withdrew his garrison not thinking it any longer tenable  on the brass door of the cathedral among other scriptural stones is represented the virgin mary taking eve out of adams hip the revenues of this see are so considerable that it is generally filled by the younger princes of the electoral house of bavaria and palatine the canonries are worth from  000 to   00 guilders a year according to the price of corn those of ratisbon and euhitadt are about the same value those of constance smaller those of passau better and these again greatly surpassed by the canonries of saltzburg the church of st maurice belongs to the catholics and is a fine building  the monks of st ulrich dispose of a dust or powder called st ulrichs earth recommending it by the name of that holy man who is said to have banished all the rats out of the city and neighborhood into a hole which is to this day shown in the church and dedicated to this saint the dust is dug up from the place where he was buried if it were true that no rats were to be found in augsburg and that any brought there alive immediately die it is a wonder that physicians and naturalists have not examined whether such effect proceeds from the soil water air herbage or other natural cause as in other places and countries where some species of animals cannot live in the islands of malta and candia and in macedonia there are no venomous serpents or vipers the islands of gorzo ivica and ireland are immediately fatal to all venomous creatures at einsidel a hunting seat belonging to the duke of wirtemburg not a rat is to be seen and being brought there by way of experiment they soon die that the bones of dead bodies are a real safeguard against some species of vermin is beyond dispute and possibly the earth of a churchyard where a great number of bodies are mouldered away may be effectual against rats this however i knew says keysler that st ulrichs earth though so highly extolled fails of its power over the rats in other places  the evangelical college called gymnasium annaeum has a library worth visiting  in mr eunos museum in this city is to be seen a collection of about twenty sorts of birds nests there is a similar collection among the king of polands curiosities at dresden here is also a chain so small that a flea may be fastened to it likewise some ivory cups with a ring round the middle which are so diminutive that they must be viewed with microscopes one hundred of them being contained in a hollowed peppercorn augsburg like nuremberg has always been famous for ingenious artists an incredible quantity of turkish as it is called and other sorts of gold and silver paper is made here the finest silver work is imitated in pewter but if in a hundred weight there be but so much as half an ounce of lead the design fails this incomparable pewter is at the same time so solid and hard that snips of common pewter may be melted in it over the fire  among the public buildings the einleass ie admittance as it is called is a very ingenious work it saves the trouble and danger they had formerly of opening the city gates at night for travelers or couriers and may be made so that many persons can come into the city at once either horse or foot to this end a bridge goes up and down and as often as a gate shuts another opens with a great noise and nothing can be better contrived for security and convenience  another curious thing is the engine which by means of twentyeight springs one of which is brass the water is raised up to three towers the city also is not without its fine gardens in the gulman gardens are some waterworks and fine shady walks which render it an agreeable retreat in the summer heats but in waterworks it is surpassed by the schaver gardens which have also a pretty aviary its owner is famous for his excellent balsam of which prince eugene used to order a large quantity against the opening of every campaign  the bishop is one of the ecclesiastical princes of the empire but has no share in the government of the town his residence is at dillingen  reisbec remarks that augsburg is one of the oldest towns in germany and one of the most remarkable as it is there and at nuremberg we meet with the oldest marks of german art and industry in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries the commerce of this town was the most extensive of any part of south germany and contributed much to the civilization of the country by the works of art and variety of necessaries to the comfort and convenience of life which it was the means of introducing many things originated in this town which have had great influence on the happiness of mankind not to mention the many important diets of the empire held here it was in this city that in     a council confirmed the order for the celibacy of priests in    0 as we have already mentioned was the confession of faith of the protestants laid before the emperor and other states of germany in      the famous treaty of peace was signed by which religious liberty was secured to germany  many of the houses according to reisbec are old and ugly and are built with so little attention to the rules of modern taste that winkleman renounced living in germany after he had seen them the houses in augsburg must not be considered as roman and greek temples but as monuments of the architecture of the times in which they were built whoever considers them in that light and compares them with the houses built at lubec and nuremberg in the same century will see to how much greater magnificence augsburg had arrived in those early times he will see too a great deal of real beauty of proportion and correspondence of parts etc etc  the looks of the inhabitants of augsburg have something very striking in them they are a compound of the suabian and bavarian features the protestants are most like the suabians and the catholics like the bavarians it is an observation which has been frequently made and undoubtedly a true one that we may distinguish a protestant of augsburg from a catholic by his looks and manner any person who goes into their respective churches will see striking characteristic differences in their countenance as the catholics are more rigid at augsburg than elsewhere and the followers of the different sects seldom intermarrying this difference may the more easily be accounted for  the police of the place continues reisbec is very good and though the town has no territory it has no debts the waterworks at augsburg are more admired than those of marly their mechanicism is much more simple and the utility of them much more conspicuous  augsburg however is no longer what it was it has no longer a fugger and a welser to lend millions to the emperor in this large and handsome town though formerly one of the greatest trading towns in germany there are no merchants at present whose capitals exceed  0000l the others most of whom must have their coaches go creeping on with small capitals of   or  000l and do the business of bankers and commissioners some houses however carry on a little banking trade and the way through tyrol and graubundten occasions some little exchange between this place and germany  after these brokers and doers of business by commission the engravers statuaries and painters are the most respectable of the laboring part of the city their productions like the toys of nuremberg go every where they have always some people of genius amongst them but the small demand for their labors affords them so little encouragement that to prevent starving they are mostly confined to the small religious works which are done elsewhere by the capuchin monks they furnish all germany with little pictures for prayerbooks and to hang in citizens houses indeed the arts meet with little support in this country in other provinces of germany matters appear to be no better ordered mengs winckelman gluck hasse handel haydon and many others were obliged to acquire reputation abroad before their merits were acknowledged at home  there is an academy of arts instituted here under the protection of the magistrates it seems however like its patrons to have no other aim than to produce good mechanics and preserve the manufacturers of the city the senate for some time past has been deliberating on similar projects for the encouragement of industry as i take part in any improvement for social happiness i was extremely mortified says reisbec to see that three good intentions were thwarted by the very governors of the town themselves  the grounds of this opposition arise chiefly from the form of government the patricians who with a very small addition of the mercantile part govern the town aristocratically cannot bear to see the plebiean enabled by his industry to carry his head above them this despicable policy takes its origin in the general corruption of the country ninetenths of the inhabitants are the most infamous rascals imaginable fellows who on the least signal are ready to cut each others throats on account of religion who spend their weekly wages every sunday in alehouses and never reflect on the greatness of their predecessors but when the liquor is fermenting in their heads it is impossible to give any idea of all the ridiculous incidents occasioned by religious disputes every day produces some occurrence which makes one both laugh and complain they never brush a cobweb from a public building without mingling religion in the business the catholics who are more zealous than the protestants support a controversial preacher here as they do in all the towns where the religion is of a mixed kind this man at certain times sets one half of augsburg a laughing the other a raving he who filled this part when reisbec was there was an exjesuit who was one of the best comedians of the kind he had seen the excessive poverty and indolence of the people makes them regardless of their rights the aristocracy would not be so powerful if the people had more attachment to their constitution but liberty says riesbec is no dearer to them than the chastity of their daughters whom their canons whose incomes are about  00l per annum purchase every year by dozens  the other tenth of the inhabitants consist of some patrician families among whom there are some very polite people merchants artists and clergy the town which is   miles and half round contains hardly  0000 people and their collective capital scarely exceeds   00000l so that their yearly decrease becomes more apparent should some fortunate circumstances not arise another century will see them reduced to beggary m nicolai makes the number of habitants    or   000 and says there are   000 houses  the more modern part of this town is truly beautiful we are led to believe that in proportion as the internal resources diminished the magistracy became more attentive to external decoration but it is as with the false bloom on a courtezans cheek it may beguile the passing stranger but whoever sees her at her toilet will soon be undeceived  the city has its water for the table from the river loch which runs at some distance from the town the aqueducts conveying it are much to be admired as the court of bavaria has it in its power to cut off this indispensible necessary of life by threatening the town with so doing it often lays it under contribution but having besides this other means of keeping the highcouncil in a state of dependence to secure itself from this oppression it so seeks the emperors protection as to become wholly dependent on him and is there as it were banded about by both courts the emperors minister to the circle of suabia generally resides in this town which secures to his court a perpetual influence with the magistracy there are austrian and prussian recruiting parties quartered here and the partiality of the government to the former is very remarkable in the war of      the citizens were divided into equal parties for the two courts the catholics considered the emperor as their god and the protestants did the same by the king of prussia the flame of religion consequently had very much kindled a civil war amongst them  ulm is the most considerable city in suabia it lies on an uneven spot of ground on the danube where that river unites with the iler and first becomes navigable for vessels of considerable burden this city is situated forty miles west of augsburg but the road for the most part is so sandy and the second stage so tedious by means of the sloughs that it takes up nine hours to perform the journey  compared to the neighboring cities it is well fortified they have here a very particular custom which is not to suffer strangers to go on the ramparts without paying a guilder all the burgers are under the same restraint the privilege of walking free being allowed only to the patricians and their friends this does not proceed so much from an apprehension of any clandestine correspondence as from avarice for these patricians share the hay and fruit growing on the ramparts among themselves which makes them cautious against whatever may occasion any diminution of their profit that which engages the attention of travelers in this city is the cathedral not to be equalled by any in germany that of strasburg excepted the steeple is four hundred and one steps high nothing can be finer than the prospects from the top of it the whole country round it being entirely level in case of fire especially from lightning sixtythree large copper kettles always filled with water are hung up in different parts of the tower and on the roof of the church with a machine for drawing up provisions for the watchmen in the tower there is a very handsome stone bridge here over the danube which greatly favors the trade of the inhabitants in linen fustians hardware and wool it is one of the largest and best built places in germany and the townhouse is a very handsome edifice large quantities of wine are brought here from the rhine the neckar and from constance to be transported down the danube the reformation prevailed here about the year      and the magistrates as well as the inhabitants are mostly lutherans the city of ulm says keysler is however very far from being what it formerly was when it used to be a common saying the lords of ulm the merchants of nuremberg and the burgers of augsburg and this saying also was equally current the power of venice the ingenuity of nuremberg and the firearms of strasburg let the world show the like but this declension is not the peculiar misfortune of ulm many other imperial freetowns join in the like complaint  of all the circles of the empire suabia is the most divided it contains four ecclesiastic and thirteen layprincipalities nineteen independent prelacies and abbeys twentysix earldoms and lordships and thirtyone free cities the prime directors of the circle are the bishop of constance and the duke of wirtemberg which last has the sole direction of all that relates to military concerns  the mixture of the various forms of government and religious sects the oppression exercised by the greater over the lesser the game constantly played by the emperor who possesses many pieces of detached country in suabia which depend not on the circle and can in consequence of his privileges as archduke of austria extend his possessions in it by various ways are circumstances which give the cultivation of the country and the character of the inhabitants a most extraordinary cast  in several of the porttowns the highest degree of cultivation may be seen in the midst of the most savage wildness a great degree of knowledge and polish of manners mixed with the grossest ignorance and superstition traces of liberty under the deepest oppression national pride together with a contempt and neglect of the native country in short all the social qualities in striking contrast and opposition to each other  those parts of suabia which belong to the greater potentates such as wirtemberg austria and baden are certainly the most improved the whole of suabia may comprehend about  00 german square miles and two millions of people more than half of these are subjects of the three abovementioned houses though they do not own by a great deal one half of the land  if the small german lords would keep themselves within due bounds if they were not desirous to appear greater than they really are if they were more affectionate to their subjects if they were not insensible to the softer feelings of humanity and so hostile to the muses and the graces the very smallness of these states would essentially contribute to their happiness for although a small country must necessarily part with some money to procure what it wants from abroad yet if the governor does not require many luxuries a prudent economy and management will keep them within due bounds besides as most of the sovereigns in this part of the world are catholic and the rich foundations in the neighborhood lies open to their younger children they are not incumbered with the burden of making any other provision for them many of them also belong to the church and their preferments in that line might prevent their laying any burdens on their subjects but the happiness of their people is never their study from the want of family ties they consider themselves as unconnected with the country and think their only business is to act like generals in an enemys land and plunder where they can were this not the case their exemption from supporting any military establishments the ease with which a small country may be governed the distance from the political distractions of greater states the security that other powers of germany cannot play the great conqueror over them and many other circumstances might be improved into blessings in these small societies  the courts of stutgard and carlsrube are the only ones which seem to have any sense of making the subject happy the rest appear vain enough to suppose the people created for them and not they for the people the treasurers of these petty lords with some of whom says reisbec i was well acquainted make a very essential difference between the interests of the prince and those of the people and though the subject is under no apprehension of gross tyranny yet he is by no means safe from having his pocket picked by the nicer operations of the finance  the education of these lords is so thoroughly neglected as hardly to admit better hopes it is almost universally in the hands of priests part of these are monks whose knowledge is in a manner wrapped up in their cowls and part are young abbes just come from school and who only seek to make their fortune by the connections of their pupils the monk teaches that a reverence to saint francis benedict or ignatius a regular attendance on mass telling beads and giving alms to monasteries are objects which will make amends for many transgressions of another kind  my excursions he adds in the different states of the circle of suabia have not produced the rich entertainment i promised myself i visited a dozen free imperial towns in which notwithstanding the republican form of government not a spark of liberty or patriotism was to be seen the inhabitants have through the oppression of more powerful neighbors long since lost all sense of the value of independence but though ashamed to mention the name of their native country out of their own walls within them they mimick the forms of old rome and after the manner of those governors of the world inscribe their public buildings of state with senatus populusque hallensis bopsingensis nordlingensis etc  in the fifteenth century the imperial cities of suabia acted a very different part they were then united in league not only with each other but with the cities of franconia and the rhine even the emperor had cause sometimes to be alarmed at their increasing power which made charles v disunite them from the time of the association of the hansetowns the gold flowed from all the country into the cities these were the exclusive seats of industry and their wealth drew into their dependence the neighboring princes who at that time lived by robberies if the spirit of trade which then prevailed had suffered them to place more value on the possession of landed property they would to this day have preserved somewhat of their former splendor as with their power they might have made many conquests and with their wealth many purchases  all hopes are now vanished of their ever again becoming conspicuous as soon as the prince discovered the value of industry and gave it free encouragement in their dominions it fled into their protection and abandoned the dark walls of cities in which a system of monopolies little policy and narrowminded envy of the successful laid it under such manifold restraints the consequence of which is the towns are so reduced as to be obliged to sell the little landed property they are possessed of to discharge their debts this has lately been the case with ulm the largest town in suabia next to augsburg  the great population which prevails in the circle is wonderful when the untoward circumstances of the country are considered by untoward circumstances is meant the extortion of petty masters who all keep their mistresses their staghounds their frenchcooks and english horses the perpetual quarrels among neighbors which arise from the various people and governments of the empire the small profits attendant on industry within such a confined spot and lastly the constant decrease of coin owing to the sums of money expended by the governors of the country in search of foreign luxuries  there is however an integrity still adherent to the german character and a kind of jovial humor about it that makes the princes of the country shudder at any acts of wanton oppression and cruelty which with the same powers would no doubt be exercised in spain italy and even in france give a german prince but room for his dogs and horses for about the welfare of these he is uncommonly solicitous and you have little to fear from him in other respects  there is one object however in which there is great need of reformation that is in the administration of criminal justice the torture is not yet abolished in these countries and they still behead hang break upon the wheel and impale it is not very long since they burned a woman for being a witch the civil law too is not yet reduced to that perfect state which might be desirable not that all forms should be abolished and every thing left to the wisdom of the judge under the pretense that forms map of the circle of westphalia map of westphalia consume too much time and money give me a socrates for a judge and i will be content to abide by his decisions but whilst judges are what they are whilst philosophy comes out of the mouth and expires on the lips it is better to trust to a mode of process in which it affords little scope for the unruly passions to range  chap ix of the circle of westphalia this circle is surrounded by the united provinces the northern or german sea the upper and the electoral rhenish circles and the circle of burgundy its extent amounts to    0 square german miles the air toward the north is cold and the soil almost one continued morass or barren sand the horses are large and the hogs in high esteem especially the hams known by the name of westphalia hams the southern part has a warmer atmosphere and a much better soil which produces pastures and some corn  the principal rivers are the weser the ems the lip and the roer it contains several sovereignties as the bishoprics of osnaburg munster paderborn and liege the abbeys of corvey stablo etc the duchy of cleve with the county of mark the duchies of juliers and  nassausiegan and nassau dillenburg the principalities of east friesland and mors with several counties seignories and the imperial cities of cologne aixla chapelle and dortmund it has no capital but munster is its most considerable town this circle reaches in length from north to south about two hundred miles and nearly the same distance from east to west  the summoning princes and directors of the circle are the bishop of munster and with him alternately the electors of brandenburgh and palatine as dukes of cleve and juliers both of whom in this directory enjoy together but one voice the diets of the circle are usually appointed at cologne but ever since the year      none have been held the archives belonging to it are kept at dusseldorf  with respect to religion this circle is one of the mixed  the bishopric of paderborn is bounded by the country of lip toward the north by the duchy of brunswick on the east by the county of waldeck on the south and by the duchy of westphalia on the west its greatest extent from west to east amounts to eleven and from north to south to about nine german miles it contains twenty castles sixteen monasteries and ninetyfive parish churches the romancatholic is the established religion this country is remarkable for the variety of its saltsprings and other fountains in the transactions of the royal society december      mention is made of a spring in this country which loses itself twice in twentyfour hours and returns with a great noise and force sufficient to turn three mills not far from its source the inhabitants call it bolderborn or the boistrous spring and in the transactions of january following there is an account of another remarkable fountain in this diocese called metborn which is a treble spring two springs of which though not a foot and a half distant from each other have very different qualities the one being limpid bluish and lukewarm the other cold as ice turbid and whitish of which water all fowls that drink die soon after in strong convulsions but giving them a little common salt will keep them alive longer and vinegar will quite recover them the third spring which issues about twenty paces from the others is of a greenish color very clear tastes both sour and sweet but very pleasant and from its weight supposed to be a mixture of the other two  it is probable that it is the water from this spring which is served up at the tables of the principal auberges in paderborn and perhaps all germany does not produce a lighter or more pleasant water to drink it mostly resembles the seltzer but is even lighter and more pleasant to the taste but to those who drink freely of it though with ever so small a portion of wine it is apt to occasion a slight fever on the brain which however goes off soon if the quantity of water drank has not been immoderate this water like some of the delicate wines in the south of france and in italy loses all its fine qualities and becomes insipid if transported to any distance if like the seltzer water it would bear carriage the revenue it would produce must be immense  the bishopric of paderborn was founded by charlemagne and the cathedral church consecrated by pope leo iii in      paderborn the capital city takes its name from the head of the river pada which springs in a torrent near the cathedral of this city and afterward runs into the lip at this fountain according to the magdeburg chronicle most of the inhabitants of saxony and westphalia were baptized about the year   0 by order of charlemagne the natives being heathens before he conquered this country a great part of the adjacent country is very barren and has little to boast of besides hogsflesh deer and other venison in the middle of it however are high mountains which contain iron mines  the town formerly enjoyed the immunities of a city of the empire and carried on a great trade but at present its commerce is inconsiderable and the inhabitants subsist chiefly by agriculture and breeding of cattle the emperor charlemagne and several other emperors and german kings resided and held their diets here formerly  the bisphopric of munster is bounded on the east by the bishopric of osnaburg and paderborn on the south by the county of mark on the west by the duchy of cleve and zutphen and on the north by the counties of bentheim and steinfurth it is the largest of all the westphalian bishoprics being an hundred miles in length and eighty in breadth  this country is generally level it has however some agreeable heights but no great or lofty mountains the extensive heaths which are seen in it serve for breeding of cattle there are also some fruitful plains large woods and turf together with good quarries of stone and rivers abounding in fish no part of westphalia produces better bacon which is exported all over europe and so much admired that it produces double the price of any other  at the time of the reformation the lutheran doctrine found many adherents in this part of the world but it was afterward suppressed there are several nobles here who are still of the protestant persuasion but the established religion of the country is catholic  the bishop is a prince of the empire and at the diet ranks with the bishop of liege but in such a manner that the bishop of osnaburg always sits between both in the circle of westphalia he is the first summoning prince and director of the circle the chapter consists of forty members who are all nobles and must prove their nobility and once a year the shield and helm of the youngest canon are carried in procession with beat of drum through the city that every one may enquire into his pedigree  munster the capital of the bishopric lies in a very fruitful and pleasant spot on the rivulet aa or alpha the city is large rich and populous it is defended by a strong citadel built to keep the inhabitants in awe after the insurrection made by john of leyden in      who pretending divine inspiration drove the bishop and magistrates out of the city caused himself to be proclaimed king and held out a fourteen months siege against them he made one of his concubines queen but afterward cut off her head because she would not approve of all his mad projects the bishop having got a reinforcement of troops at last seized the city by stratagem and took the anabaptist king prisoner who having been carried in derision to most of the countries in germany was the year following put to death with redhot pincers and his bones hung up in an ironcage on the top of a steeple  at munster in      was concluded the treaty which established the protestant religion and put an end to the thirty years war this treaty has been made the basis of almost every subsequent treaty especially as to religion it is sometimes called the treaty of westphalia at others the treaty of osnaburg because the protestant princes held their conferrences at osnaburg as the catholic princes did theirs at munster the swedes had been engaged eighteen years in this war and got possession of an hundred strong towns in the empire and by this treaty they secured the duchies of bremen and verden western pomerania the island of rugen and the city of weismer and might have made still better terms if they had not adhered to the part of the protestants  the bishopric of liege lies in the netherlands and is bounded on the north by brabant and guelderland on the east by the duchies of limburg and juliers on the south by luxemburgh and the ardennes and on the west by brabant and the country of namur it is in length from north to south about twenty german miles and about half as much in breadth but the breadth varies being twice as much in some places as it is in others some small districts lie within the jurisdiction of the duchies of brabant and luxemburg  the soil is fertile in corn and pasturage and yields wine which resembles the middling wines of burgundy and champagne together with very considerable forests and mines of copper lead iron and stonecoal as also many good stonequarries and among them likewise some marble this bishopric is also celebrated for its mineralwaters namely those of spa and chaudefontaine  the principal rivers by which it is watered are the meuse and sambre which unite in the county of namur  the chief exports of this country and particularly of the town of liege consist of beer firearms nails serge leather and stonecoal all which are exported from hence in prodigious large quantities more particularly firearms such as guns pistols and swords with which in time of war they serve almost all europe the low prices for which they will sell their guns and swords is almost incredible no nation can come in incompetition with them in point of cheapness for these articles  in the circle of westphalia this bishop is third in rank he is one of the most considerable ecclesiastical princes in germany his annual revenue is about three hundred thousand ducats the chapter of liege consists of sixty majorcanons who are most of them of noble extraction and have the power of electing their bishop there are twentyfour other canons who have no share in this election it is computed there are in this diocese or rather principality fiftytwo baronies eighteen walled towns and four hundred villages well peopled the bishop can lay no taxes on his subjects without the consent of the clergy nobility and commons who are called the three states of the country  liege is supposed to derive its name from a little rivulet which runs through this country and falls into the meuse it is a very large and a very populous city of a triangular form there are several hills and valleys within the walls and some islands made by the meuse which is here divided into three branches which after having passed through the streets under several bridges unite again a little below the town the town is seated in a vale between two mountains the highest of which lies to the north and the other to the east in the valley between these mountains runs the river meuse and it is here very broad  this town has ten large suburbs in which are a great number of religious houses and churches which last with those in the city make an hundred in all in the city and suburbs are likewise several public places or squares as also a cathedral church dedicated to st lambert in which there are many relics the bishops palace and the cathedral are large and spacious buildings the latter is built with red stone and has a quadrangle within this city is about four miles in circumference and contains about an hundred and fifty streets according to the opinion of some travelers no city in germany or france can equal it in fine churches convents and other religious foundations the fortifications of the city are but mean and being commanded by hills which surround them are incapable of resisting a large army but the citadel which is situated on a very high hill is a place of some strength yet it may be a question whether it is not of more disservice than real service as it is by no means strong and from its elevated situation if the enemy once got possession of it they could demolish the town in a few hours the duke of marlborough took this city in the year   0   liege is styled an imperial city under the protection of its bishop but this prelate is sovereign of the city and diocese and the citizens have suffered more than once very severely for disputing his authority most of the streets are very narrow but there are many of a good breadth there are also some very spacious and handsome private edifices but in general the buildings are mean and shabby on the banks of the river there are some very pleasant walks which are much resorted to in summer the environs are so extremely pleasant that it has obtained the name of the paradise of ecclesiastics it is a common saying likewise that it is the hell of women because they are obliged to live a very laborious life the women doing all the laborious offices both at home and abroad the purgatory of men because they are almost all governed by their wives and the paradise of monks on account of their rich benefices the english jesuits have a college here delightfully situated on the summit of a high hill with a very fine garden this college is now appropriated to the education of youth in the catholic persuasion of which there are in general from sixty to seventy scholars mostly the sons of our nobility and gentry it is wonderfully well fitted up for the purpose and the discipline and care that is taken of the young gentlemen is equalled in no place great pains are taken with their education there is scarce an art science or language which is not taught in this seminary the proficiency in classical learning therefore cannot be expected to be very great in short the method of study generally pursued in this college resembles the plans of our most considerable modern academies in the vicinity of the metropolis which are certainly very different from the mode of education in our great schools such as westminster eton winchester and one or two more  at the opposite extremity of the city is a convent of english nuns whose chief subsistence is obtained by the education of young ladies of their own religious persuasion they have generally the same number of young persons under their tuition with the college of english jesuits who are likewise chiefly the daughters of our catholic nobility and gentry the pension as it is called or the terms for board and education are very moderate about   l a year every thing included and are kept in sickness and in health they also profess to teach a multiplicity of things the nuns as well as the jesuits are almost all either from this country or from ireland and many of them related to the most considerable catholic families in one or other of them  in the convent there is likewise a pension for such ladies as choose to come and board there this pension is kept in a building adjoining to the convent but not within the inner walls of the convent it is upon a very frugal plan the pension is very reasonable the dinners sumptuous they all dine in one eatingroom and have separate chambers to retire to for tea and to sit in the only inconvenience is that being within the outer gate of the convent they are obliged to dismiss their friends and return home themselves by nine in the evening in other respects this is a very agreeable and cheap place for those persons to come to who wish to live comfortably and agreeably on a slender income it may not be amiss to remark that separate dinners are not allowed except in illness  in the monastery of st william just without the walls lie the remains of that famous english traveller sir john mandeville who having visited almost all the great cities of europe preferred liege to any of them and accordingly passed the latter part of his days in this city the university was so considerable that meibonus relates there were twentyone kings sons resident here in      at present it is in no esteem there is also a public library in this city belonging to the councilhouse but it is by no means considerable and is not frequented the environs of this city are highly picturesque and beautiful but the internal parts carry a very dingy hue owing to the clouds of smoke continually issuing from such an immense number of little forges as are to be found in its precincts  about three english miles from liege at the extremity of a beautiful valley and on the banks of a very pleasing stream which descends with considerable rapidity from the mountains stands the little village of chau defontaine this village is famous for its baths the waters of which are of a sulphurous nature and always hot the inn where the baths are is not much frequented the house is very old fashioned but the accommodations as to the wines and diet are far from bad and the charges not extravagant there are many families who make this house their residence for weeks together tempted to it solely from the retiredness of the situation the beauty of the scenery and the occasional luxury of the baths which are made use of more for pleasure than health they are of a very agreeable temperature as to heat and the expenses attending the care of them very inconsiderable  near liege in the road however from spa to aixlachapelle stands the town of verviers a place formerly of not near so much import as at present this town owes all its consequence to its woollen manufactures which are now carried on to very great extent and of late years they have even rivalled us very successfully in several of the northern parts of europe in this branch of commerce  about seventeen miles southeast of liege is the village of spa which has been long famous all over europe for its mineral waters it is seated in a spacicious valley surrounded by hills part of which are covered with woods and on the northside more particularly with very steep and craggy mountains which immediately overlook the town  the town of spa according to thickness is situated in a stony mountainous country on the banks of which in summer is a murmuring stream but which in winter is sometimes a rapid river the air is good and the environs in general are pleasant though rude and uncultivated having much the appearance of a part of the globe which has been broken up by earthquakes or some violent convulsions of nature so that all the luxuries of life are brought daily on womens backs from liege in the winter the place is deserted  the account given by pliny of the waters of this place is that they tasted of iron were purgative and a sovereign cure for tertian agues and the stone the three principal springs are the pouhon the geronstere and the savoniere the pouhon is in the middle of the town or rather village for spa strictly speaking is no more than a village though from the numerous and splendid buildings erected within these few years for the accommodation of strangers many of which are of the first distinction it is more considerable than many towns it is from this spring that most of the water is supplied which is sent into foreign countries over the spring is a stone building on which there is an inscription recounting the virtues of these waters that they remove obstructions dissolve hard swellings dry up a superfluity of moisture and strengthen weak limbs if drank in proper quantities and under the direction of the faculty  health is now become but a secondary object that attracts such a splendid assembly of both sexes which now resort to this delightful spot numbers resort here for the sake of gaming high and by their dexterity and address bid fair to amend or improve their shattered fortunes a crowd of another sort attend only as parasites and dependant on such illustrious personages as keep public tables and make a splendid appearance others come there to make the best market they can of the commodities they import some aim at procuring new acquaintance and correspondents others resort here purely to enjoy themselves and the wholesome air of the climate some again have diversion and amusement principally in view and spend their time here more for the sake of the good and grand company that comes here than out of any regard to the virtue of the waters in a word this most delightful spot is the center and seat of all joy and pleasure which contribute toward the countless miracles that are wrought here beyond the power of words to express  he who takes into his consideration only the numberless amusements of this delicious spot the various games the balls the plays the walks and other entertainments that are carried on here and succeed each other without intermission must doubtless imagine that a life so led in the daily gratification of every scene is able to remove a variety of little inconveniences without the least aid or assistance from these salutary springs such for instance as the yellow jaundice which is principally owing to some light and trivial obstruction the hyp or vapors which are often the result only of an unpolite deportment from a too peevish and morose husband and more particularly that petty disorder called the green sickness a maidendistemper for the immediate cure of which the young lover is the infallible physician  there are three different ways of lodging as well as living at spa  those persons who come there alone or in small parties with a slender retinue and little baggage lodge in general at public inns  in all these there is attendance sufficient and a more plentiful larder than is reasonably requisite considering that their tables or ordinaries are principally intended for the reception of such persons as are suppose to frequent these houses for the recovery of their health  the second method of living at spa is by hiring furnished houses as in bath or london of this sort there are abundance to be met with of all sizes and prices princes and persons of high rank who propose keeping a public table there generally adopt this mode  the third method is to hire furnished apartments and this is more calculated for small families or single persons who do not like the hurry and bustle of an inn these persons generally send for their provisions from the adjacent inn at so much per head or if single gentlemen they will find it much the cheapest method to dine at the public ordinaries where they will meet with very good company pick up fresh acquaintance and indulge themselves in a variety of different conversations  the custom of paying visits except among persons of some rank is now almost wholly laid aside the established etiquette however is that the inferior pays the first visit whether he arrives first or last and the return is conducted according to the rank and character they respectively bear if the disproportion is very great no return at all is expected princes however generally testify their regard for any person of distinction by a personal visit the countervisits are in general little more than bare ceremony they are reduced to a formal tour in a chariot or perhaps on foot to leave a card at some persons house who never fails to be out of the way or at least denied  most people however pay no visits at all but to such persons as are manifestly their superiors they content themselves with testifying their respects to their bottlecompanions or such others as they are personally acquainted with who on the other hand frequently circumvent them by waiting on them first  those who delight in tranquillity and repose may reside there in as retired and solitary a manner as they please and there are rural objects enough to engage their attention  amongst the multitude of persons of both sexes who resort to the spa there are a variety of characters and among them many very amiable ones and besides the friends usually to be met with there it is impossible to fail of finding some strangers whose company and conversation prove exceedingly engaging these ties of friendship thus suddenly contracted and grounded on a sympathy of tempers and conformity of characters establish an openness of heart which is the life and soul of society and renders it inexpressibly delightful  time at the spa flies away with an amazing swiftness though it must be allowed two parts in three of it are spent in nothing but amusements yet the whole body of its visitors is in perpetual motion all seemingly at least as busy as bees and not a drone to be met with in the whole hive the amusements follow so close at the heels of each other in that most agreeable recess that there are some people who have been there for six weeks successively and sometimes longer who have never dreamt of taking any survey of the country or in short any of the parts adjacent  the season for resorting to the spa does not properly commence till the end of june but appears in its utmost beauty and perfection about the latter end of july and the whole month of august  most of the company are at the pouhon well by five oclock in the morning which gives the town the appearance of a fair at that hour it being then likewise crowded with a multiplicity of horses and carriages waiting to carry the company to the geronstere and savoniere springs this latter spring is situated on an eminence at the east side of spa and is much about half a league from the town the road however is rugged and in some measure troublesome and unpleasant especially in the going there it being upon an ascent all the way insomuch that though the distance is so inconsiderable most of its visitors go there in carriages or on horseback lest the walk should be apt to throw them into too great a perspiration or put them out of breath in either of which cases as the water is very cold it might prove of dangerous consequence as is well known by too fatal experience  this spring or well is contained in a very small basin round which the drinkers stand in order to be served and is covered with a dome or cupola composed of freestone and the whole surrounded with a low wall  at one of the springs there is a large building with a fire in it when the mornings are chilly to which the company retire after having drank a glass or two of the waters here you meet with a mixed concourse of people of all ranks and degrees citizens monks nuns lords and ladies and sometimes kings or princes who divesting themselves of their high dignity converse there with the same familiarity as if they were all upon a level  there are horses and carriages to be let here either for the morning only or for the whole day the price of the horse to go to either of the distant wells is about two schellings each schelling sevenpence english those who engage them for the whole day in order to enjoy the pleasure of an evenings ride pay about three schellings in the very height of the season probably something more the carriages let out for hire which are low phaetons very shabby old fashioned and clumsy are cheap in proportion  with regard to the general expenses attending a residence at spa they are not even in the height of the season more than those of the little wateringplace on the western coast of england according to the style in which a person lives the wines and diet on the other hand are much more sumptuous than they are to be met with in england on almost any terms there are likewise several circulating libraries in this place tolerably well stocked not only with novels but with all modern publications even of works of literature  this frequently induces strangers to make considerable purchases from these libraries and french books may be met with here on as reasonable terms as in any town of europe and in as great variety in point of assortment  as the latter part of the forenoon in the month of july and august is frequently too sultry to ride out in the morning it is generally filled up between these libraries and the assembly rooms where the pharobank is held and to which all strangers are admitted gratis the principal assembly room is seated on an eminence about half a mile from the town commanding a most delightful view it is called the vauxhall here a great number of parties and single gentlemen breakfast on their return from the wells a band of music playing the whole time when this repast is over the pharobank opens and continues dealing for about a couple of hours the capital stock is about a  000 louis dors no person is allowed to punt less than a guinea except the ladies who are indulged with the liberty of playing for silver a hazard table is then introduced for about half an hour or a little more just before dinner when the ladies for the most part retire and this closes the mornings amusement in the publicrooms there are cardtables for those who choose to make parties of whist and piquet the evening till dusk is generally dedicated to excursions on horseback or in carriages the square being full of carriages and horses standing for hire about five oclock every evening there are also two or three very fine public walks where the company meet as the sun gets nearer the horizon and at which the band of music belonging to the rooms occasionally play the mountains overhanging spa present a number of very agreeable walks which have been cut through the woods at a great expense in zigzag paths all up the sides of them the beautiful views that present themselves in climbing up these mountains the prospects of which vary every instant amply recompense the toil no sooner does night close in but all the company repair instantly to the rooms of these there are two both very elegant and superb the one in the town and the other about half a mile distant called the vauxhall as has been already observed at one or other of these rooms there are balls three or four times a week the intervening nights there are only cardparties a promenade and the pharobank it is this latter which seems to keep every thing alive in these regions of dissipation the large heaps of gold displayed on the cloth which covers the pharotable the number of people of fashion who are playing at it the attempts which are made by many of them to break the bank by doubling the stakes from time to time is sufficient to interest the attention of a number of spectators unconnected with the play and it sometimes happens that a spirited player is successful enough to break it a singular instance of which i will relate from thickness some years since a stranger of plain but decent appearance took his seat at the pharotable at aixlachapelle the bank was at that time rich and the stranger after having lost some money threw down his pocketbook full of notes to a high amount and declared he was at the whole bank the stranger won the banker trembled and the company stared at the cool dispassionate manner in which the stranger received his good fortune who ordered a person that stood near him to take the money and retired but not before a reduced halfpay captain who had been looking on exclaimed aloud good god if i had won but a twentiethpart of that sum what a happy man it would have made me  would it said the stranger then you shall be happy and in a short time a servant was sent who put into the officers hands a purse containing the twentieth part of the money won a few days afterward it was known that the king of prussia had been incog at aixlachapelle and that he was the stranger the gambler and the generous donor  the prince bishop of liege is supposed to receive several thousands a year from the bankers belonging to this pharobank for giving them his license to hold it at the end of the assemblyroom in the town of spa is a very neat little french theater where there are plays three times a week the actors in general are tolerable the parterre of this theater by being boarded over on ballnights serves as an apartment for the pharobank for persons of rank and fashion there is a club where the members dine together every day it was instituted by the english every person must be balloted for and one blackball is sufficient to exclude the candidate dress and suppers are never thought of at spa every one dresses a langloise and the heat of the weather the early rising and late dinners make people wholly unsolicitous about eating or retiring from the rooms  with respect to those who come there only for the waters there are diverse cases where they do not agree with the constitution of those invalids who drink them and it is certain there will always be visitors who will never receive the least benefit from them some drink them out of caprice or else follow such instructions as are whimsical and injudicious some swallow down too large a quantity and others drink them too sparingly sometimes without any proper preparation and sometimes by altering the qualities of the waters with an intermixture of drugs prescribed by physicians unacquainted with the practice peculiar to the wells or incapable of foreseeing in what manner they will operate in short there are abundance of errors committed by invalids either through the nonobservance of a proper regimen or the imprudent choice of a spring unfit for their service as well as a mistake in the quantity or manner of drinking the waters on which the cure of their particular disorder in a great measure depends  it is universally known the geronstere spring is most suitable in those cases where there is a weakness of the fibers or a contraction proceeding from a too lively or quick sensibility it is fit likewise for weak stomachs and such as have tender constitutions whose fibers are too inactive such as are in a languishing condition or are afflicted with catarrhs and other pectoral disorders  the impetuous rains and violent hurricanes that frequently happen in this country make the ground and stones shrink and give way so that the roads are almost impassible in winter except on the new chausse from spa to liege  however if the roads are somewhat rough the mountains through which those passages are cut afford a very pleasing prospect  these roughhewn unpolished rocks intermixed with a great variety of stately oaks and humble shrubs strike the eye of every curious traveller who has any adequate idea of a beauteous landscape for my own part says the author of a tour to spa the first time i traveled that road i ordered my coachman to halt at several places that i might look about me and make my observations on the agreeable prospects which the narrow passages cut through the mountains presented themselves from time to time to my view i was agreeably surprised says he to find that an uncultivated spot of ground with no other covering than a worthless pitiful stock of broom or heath should so delightfully delude me as to appear afar off like a charming verdant grassplat the enamel of which and its odd fantastic knots or compartments were amusing beyond measure and this variety of charming delusions occur frequently in excursions round spa  the other two springs are at a small distance from the town  the bispopric of osnaberg is bounded on the north by lower munster on the south by upper munster on the east by the principality of minden and on the west by munster and lingen it is about ten german miles in length from north to south and from east to west between four and six german miles  this was the first bishopric founded by charlemagne who granted extraordinary privileges to this see exempting it from all manner of service and homage even to the emperor himself at the peace of osnaberg in      it was settled that this bishopric should alternately have a roman catholic and a lutheran bishop and that the chapter might choose and select the former either from among themselves or elsewhere but that the latter should always be a prince of the house of brunswick and of that branch of the house of brunswick from which his present majesty is descended when they have a popish bishop he is suffragan to the archbishop of cologne but the protestant bishop who at present is his majestys second son his royal highness the duke of york has no ecclesiastical jurisdiction over the catholics the bishop is a prince of the empire and sits at the diets of the empire in the council of princes between the bishops of munster and liege among the several states of the circle of westphalia this bishopric is fourth in rank and his principality produces him yearly   0000 rhenish florins which is    00l a year this according to reisbec but we have reason to believe it produces twice the sum  this country is partly romancatholic and partly protestant neither the protestant nor the romancatholic bishops have the right of reformation but every thing must remain as it stood in      no jews are tolerated in this country  the cathedral is in the hands of the romancatholics the chapter consists of twentyfive canons not above four of which are protestant and these have no vote in the election of a popish bishop some of the other churches are protestant there are not above four towns in the whole country and about  0000 fireplaces or hearths  about one half of this bishopric consists of heathlands which yield above ten sorts of turf as also pasturage this country likewise produces as much rye as supplies the inhabitants and above five hundred stills considerable quantities of corn are imported here from the principality of minden the breed of cattle likewise is but small and they are mostly supplied from frizeland  the inhabitants are diligent and laborious the country people seldom sit by stoves as they do in other parts of germany but by firehearths where they perform their principal work which is spinning above six thousand of them go every year to holland where they now till cut turf and do other work for hire the meanest of them notwithstanding carry home twenty and the best workmen full seventy florins so that the ready money which they by this means bring into the country may be reckoned at  00000 florins  the greatest and most beneficial occupation of the inhabitants consists in spinning yarn and manufacturing a coarse kind of linen which is conveyed by the english dutch and spaniards to guinea and america and brings annually into the country above a million of rixdollars  osnaberg the capital is situated in a fine plain and beautified with several noble public buildings it derives its name from a bridge over the river haze the manner of building here is antique and the number of houses exclusive of the public and byebuildings amounts to   00 the town is not populous not above five hundred children being baptized in a year its magistracy is lutheran and rechosen annually the bishops palace is fortified like a castle they are said to have the best bread and beer here which is to be met with in westphalia and they carry on a considerable traffic in linen cloth and hams its principal subsistence depends on its linen trade manufactured in the country and in the foreign manufacturies vended here in retail there are three well built hospitals here exclusive of some smaller ones this city was also formerly one of the hanse towns the episcopal palace belongs to the electoral house of luneburg who usually resigns it to the catholic bishop for his residence this town is possessed of the right of making copper which it exercised for the first time in    0 in the hall of the councilhouse where the celebrated peace of      was concluded are seen pictures of the ambassadors who assisted at it  the duchies of oldenburg and delmenhurtst which the king of denmark at the desire of the russian court exchanged for a part of holstein with the prince of gottorp now make a very good principality containing   000 people and yielding every year about  0000l english it is from this part of germany many but particularly from friesland that they procure the strong fine coachhorses that trot so proudly over the pavement of many italian cities and are sometimes though more seldom met with in france the court of petersburg brought up many of these horses to mount its heavy cavalry who look very formidable on these terrible cattle the dutch cuirassiers are supplied from holstein and in fact the horses of that country are preferable to those of friesland and oldenburgh for this service and with the same strength they connect more alacrity and life  the dutch call them vasttrotters  they are too heavy to gallop but will trot at an amazing pace with a heavy drag behind them for a whole day together they are coalblack seventeen hands high and very nobly crested the price of a pair of handsome ones about fifteen years ago was   0 pounds english  the duchy of cleve lies on both sides the rhine and is bounded by part of holland toward the north by munster on the east juliers on the south and brabant toward the west it is sixteen german miles in length and between four and five in breadth  the air is sound and the weather moderate this duchy has high lands and low bottoms the former of these are furnished as well with arablelands as with bushes the latter particularly toward the rhine are on both sides fenced with stout dams exclusive of which there are also summerdams which screen the rich meadows and pastures lying near the river against the summerwater to the heights of between eleven and sixteen feet this country abounds also in corn fruits and all manner of plants the breed of horned cattle and horses is considerable in general the country is well cultivated and contains many delightful spots particularly near the town of cleve all kinds of game are in great plenty here in particular on the west side of the rhine the river divides the country into the eastern and western parts and receives in its course the rivers roer ems and lip the meuse also touches on a part of the duchy all these rivers abound in fish and the salmon pike and carp of the rhine are in great request  in this duchy are twentyfour towns and three immunities or municipia the inhabitants are chiefly catholics but all religions are tolerated in this duchy the country in many parts is mountainous and woody the commerce of this country is very much facilitated by the navigation on the rhine and on the meuse the sovereignty belongs to the king of prussia as elector of brandenburgh whose ancestors laid claim to it in the beginning of the last century by virtue of a marriage with one of the coheiresses of the last prince of the male line in this duchy this claim was confirmed by the emperor leopold in       the yearly revenues arising to the king of prussia from this duchy are estimated at    000 rixdollars and the sum which goes to the warchest at   0000  cleves the capital of the country in latin clivia derives its name from the town and citadel being built on the declivity of a hill between the rhine and the meuse it is large and well built but surrounded by cliffs and craggy rocks about twelve miles from nimeguen the town is well peopled but neither the city nor the citadel are of any great strength a silk manufactory was established here in      the environs are pleasant and in front of the gates are some very fine walks from this place there is a canal runs into the rhine which is about three english miles distant on the west side of the town lies the park of prince maurice of nassau very much admired for its grottos canals and fine waterworks and over these on a high hill called the sternberg may be discovered at the distance of fifty miles the city of utrecht with forty other cities and great towns twelve of which are seen through vistos and at the end of each appears a fine city  the private houses in cleves are very shabby and the only public buildings of any note are the great church a monastery of capuchins and another of franciscans as the king of prussia is sovereign of the country the religion countenanced by government is calvinism but most of the churches are in possession of the catholics in the great hall of the citadel is an inscription by which it appears that caius julius caesar dictator in the year     from the building of rome having first conquered the adjacent country founded the citadel of cleve  the principality of east friezland is bounded by the german ocean on the north by oldenburg on the east by groningen on the west and by munster on the south it is about ten german miles from north to south and as many from east to west  this principality is situated in a moist and thick air but much purified by the seabreezes spring and summer appear here somewhat later than in other parts of germany hence also their cornharvest happens later the country is throughout level and low whence also it is secured by expensive dikes against the inroads of seafloods along the sea lies a marsh uncommonly fertile which has a clay bottom and is more used for meadow and pastureland than for agriculture  the remarkably rich pastures of this country yield an important breed of cattle producing horned cattle horses and sheep in great numbers and also of an extraordinary size in these parts one cow will yield near twentyfour cans of milk and from this very rich milk is made most excellent butter and cheese on the contrary in the heart of the country the bottom is for the most part sandy as also fenny and moorish but yields turf for burning which in the great scarcity of fuel here is very advantageous and indispensably necessary to the country the greatest part of the produce of the earth as also culinary herbs grow to a large size but are seldom so good as they are in other countries fowl and venison are also to be had and there are geese whose weight exceeds twentyfour pounds in harvest a great number of fieldfares and snipes generally appear the sea here yields all sorts of fish as oysters muscles seacrabs etc  the principal river is the ems which comes from the bishopric of munster and runs through the dollart into the north sea the dollart is a bay between east friezland and groningen which arose out of a considerable tract of country and was swallowed up by the sea for in the year      the water first broke into this tract of land with a violent flood and no proper opposition being made to to it the present bay gradually arose on whose circuit there stood formerly above fifty great and small towns  trade and navigation are carried on here very briskly the produce of the country and the commodities exported hence are large horses numbers of which are sent to rome and sold by the pair in proportion to their strength and beauty for three or four hundred dollars and more and used for coach horses horned cattle butter cheese rapeseed and fine cloth on the other hand every thing the country is in want of is conveyed hither by shipping  the landstates consist of the nobility and the states as also of the villagers between these and the reigning house certain articles of agreement have been gradually entered into ever since the time of count edward the second which with the peculiar imperial ordinances issued at the same time are considered as provincial laws in the government of the country east friezland has also many other privileges  the ancient counts were created princes of the empire in      this princely house became extinct in      upon which frederic ii king of prussia in consequence of an expectancy granted to the house of brandenburg by the emperor leopold in   0  took possession of east friezland a protest to which was made by the house of brunswic  luneburg before the regency of east friezland and the aulic council of the empire who claims this principality by virtue of an alliance entered into in   0  with prince christian eberhard a formerprince of friezland  aurich the ancient residence of the prince and which is even to this day the seat of the provincial college stands almost in the center of the country the ancient residentiary castle is surrounded with ramparts and ditches in the garrison church the calvinists perform their religious worship in the town itself we see the lutheran church the provincial house the latin schools and a public almshouse so early as the year      aurich received the lutheran doctrine  emden the chief city of the principality lies near the river ems it is a strong seaport town and a place of great trade the houses are high and well built and the town hall is a magnificent structure this place contains a harbor an old fort and a citadel belonging to the prince and lying on the ems to which the ships arrive by means of a broad canal drawn from that river called the dolf from this city there is a fine prospect of the german ocean and likewise of the adjacent country  the things principally worthy of notice here are the town hall and councilhouse the library and the great church most of the inhabitants are protestants or calvinists and there are some lutherans catholics and jews in    0 an asiatic company was established here by the king of prussia  emden says reisbec is by no means so fine a city as bremen the king of prussia has taken an everlasting dislike to the inhabitants who to say the truth when taken in the lump are not the most amiable people they are very remarkable for their laziness and insensibility it was a great while before the good endeavors of the king of prussia its sovereign to turn this people to commerce and shipbuilding were attended with any success the east india company which he had established at a great expense was ruined within a few years of its erection and certain republican prejudices which the burgers of this city affected rendered all the kings other efforts for a time ineffectual at length the activity and wisdom of the government attended with some fortunate circumstances got the better of the impediments to that extension of commerce for which the city is particularly well situated the herringfishery which the king took every step in his power to encourage brings in large sums of money every year the american war assisted the kings designs very much and the trade of the place now begins to be very flourishing emden exports many westphalian linens to the south countries and provides a part of westphalia with spices and wines they have also a considerable trade in cheese  the revenues arising from this principality are very considerable they many years ago greatly exceeded  00000 rixdollars and since it came under the prussian regency have been very considerably increased  the principality consists at this time of three towns and nine prefecturates which were formerly lordships but are now in like manner with the towns hereditary and proper estates of the sovereign prince as also of lordships which have their own hereditary lords but are subject to the sovereign supreme jurisdiction of the prince  pyrmont this country lies between the bishopric of paderborn and the electorate of hanover the lower part of it contains an uncommonly beautiful and pleasant vale which extends four miles in length and as many in breadth all around is environed by lofty green mountains in this vale are the celebrated mineralsprings and steelwaters this country is now subject to the prince of waldeck his annual revenues as sovereign of this country are estimated at near  0000 rixdollars to which the mineral springs contribute a very great proportion  these waters are often frequented by persons of the highest rank the king of prussia has been known to drink them they are exceedingly palatable and come nearest to the seltzerwaters in their taste and their qualities pyrmont is about a days journey from hanover to which place there is a very fine road most part of the way with very large and well engraved stones every quarter of a german mile mentioning the exact distance from hanover a circumstance very unusual on the continent after spa every place of this kind appears insipid yet in the season there is a great deal of very good company from hanover and the other large cities in the north of germany a very magnificent hotel or inn for the accommodation of strangers has been lately built where the apartments are fitted up in the most modern taste and the charges not so extravagant as the appearance of the outside of the building is magnificent this hotel is much superior to any even at spa there is as in most inns of germany an exceeding good table dhote of two or three courses  with variety of good wines for very moderate prices were not the approach to this place on the side of holland and france so exceedingly disagreeable owing to the heavy sands of westphalia it would be much more frequented than it is at present they have their public rooms every night and their assemblies and their pharobanks as in other wateringplaces but every thing here is on a small scale to what it is at aixlachappelle and at spa neither is the country round about it so diversified and picturesque the country is more open and more level nor are the mountains so finely wooded on the contrary the rooms where the company meet lie as it were in a hole near the springhead and not only carry with them the appearance of great antiquity but they are also very gloomy and seem situated as it were in a swamp surrounded with wood for those however to whom the drinking of the waters is any inducement for repairing hither there are but few wateringplaces where they will meet with such excellent accommodations more resources of amusement or a greater variety of good and respectable company  aixlachapelle is a free imperial city and has its name probably from its warmbaths which have been celebrated from times of old it is supposed to have taken its ancient name from serenius granus lieutenant general of gallia belgica in the reign of the emperor adrian who having discovered the hotsprings here about the year    was the first person who erected some beautiful buildings over them after the manner of the roman baths and then built a palace for himself in this city in the confirmation of which the inhabitants show a piece of ancient architecture which they call turris grani and assert that it is a part of that generals palace this town is situated in a fruitful valley encompassed with woods and mountains and yet the air is esteemed exceeding wholesome  the emperor charlemagne was so delighted with the beauty of this place that he chose it for his residence he is interred in the church of notredame where they keep his sword his belt and the four evangelists written in letters of gold which are used at the coronation of the emperors part of the jewels of the empire are also kept in this city all which are shown only once in seven years except at the request of some great personage and then they are taken out and put in again in presence of the chiefmagistrates and such ecclesiastics as are on the foundation in this city ought properly to be the coronation of a roman king or emperor  the stadthouse is a stately building built in      and adorned with the statues of all the emperors since charlemagne in this hall are several fine pieces of painting particularly one of the resurrection and another of charlemagne giving the charter to the city of aix in the middle of the marketplace is a noble fountain admired for the largeness of its dimensions and its curious workmanship on the top of the fountain is a large brass statue of charlemagne in gilt armor with his face toward germany on the edge of the cistern is an inscription which mentions that granus a roman prince was the first person who discovered and built the hotbaths in this city on the inside of the cathedral where charlemagne was first interred hangs a very large crown made of silver and brass gilt surrounded with fortyeight statues a foot high and thirtytwo lesser ones all of solid silver the emperor frederic removed the body of charlemagne buried part of it in the choir under the altar in a silver coffin and covered it with a tombstone of white marble with the bust of proserpine upon it supposed to have covered julius caesars tomb  the principal relics which pilgrims resort hither to adore are   the virgin marys gown that she was dressed in at the incarnation made of wool   the cloth girt about our savior when he was crucified   a piece of the cord with which he was bound when he was delivered to pilate   some of the blood of st stephen the martyr enchased in gold and precious stones on which the emperors are sworn at their inauguration   the picture of the virgin mary with our savior in her arms said to be done by st luke   a manuscript of the gospels by the patriarchs of jerusalem and constantinople in the upper part of the church is a throne of white marble where the emperors used to sit and which is supposed to be the same which charlemagne placed there nine hundred years ago  the territory of the city is called the kingdom of aixla chapella and lies quite round it in it are to the number of three thousand subjects this city is governed by a mayor two burgomasters fourteen aldermen and   0 common council men the mayor is appointed by the duke of juliers the rest of the corporation by the city companies of which there are fourteen or fifteen  the hotbaths occasion it to be much resorted to of which there are three within the walls one of them is the same in which charlemagne used to bathe with his nobility and great officers of state these baths rise so hot that they let them cool twelve hours before they are used there is also a fountain of warmwater which is drank in summer for many chronical disorders  those who have described the virtues of these waters relate that they are good against all affections of the nerves such as convulsions palsies numbness tremblings gout sciaticas contractions swellings distempers of the bowels stomach and spleen inveterate headachs vertigos barrenness abortion and scabs of all sorts  the city of aix professed the protestant religion soon after the reformation on which account the people were very much harrassed by the imperialists during the civil wars of germany till at last popery was established again and is now the only religion publicly professed by the inhabitants but protestants are permitted to reside here and go to a church without the walls under the dominion of the dutch  the emperors were usually crowned in this city for five hundred years after charlemagne and by the goldenbull made in the reign of charles iv the emperor was to receive his first crown here but the custom of crowning him with three crowns as was formerly the way has been long since discontinued and at every coronation the magistrates who have the custody of charlemagnes sword shoulderbelt and the gospel in golden letters which are used in that ceremony deliver them to the elector of mentz and the emperor declares that his being crowned elsewhere shall not prejudice the privileges of the city of aix  among other holy relics the greatest curiosity which that city has produced is the latin testament abovementioned really found in the sepulcher of charlemagne and consequently it must be at least nine hundred years old it is written on fine thin paper or vellum something like goldbeaters skin twentytimes doubled the characters are in large capitals well preserved and quite clean except at the beginning of st johns gospel but there it is much soiled because all the emperors were sworn on this book at their coronation and there it was said t  they laid their dirty hands  the degree of cultivation and riches of westphalia says reisbec far exceeded all ideas i had formed of them and quite astonished me all the cities and villages abound in tradespeople muhlheim elberfeld solingen sorst ham duisburg meurs wesel cleve and some other cities have capital manufactures in them they make a great quantity of linen and woollen and supply almost all the country of the upper rhine suabia and franconia with white threads they have besides manufactures of handkerchiefs silks and cottons they prepare steel and iron at solingen better than in any other part of europe england alone excepted their commerce extends all over the netherlands part of franconia and the whole empire  this wonderful industry united to the natural fertility of the country renders this one of the richest and most remarkable parts of germany a gentle administration and a security against despotism derived from the states of the country contribute not a little to the happiness of this circle the inhabitants are cheerful hospitable and wellmannered they may be quoted as a new instance to be added to the numberless ones already given of the little influence which religion has over the civil condition of men when not attended with other local circumstances though the protestants in this circle are far from being so enlightened or so tolerant as those of their persuasion in other countries and though they are much more addicted to sensual enjoyments than their brethren of other places they are the most industrious people and the best subjects that can be found nor does the bigotry of the catholics hurt the manufactures and agriculture of the country their education only direcing it to such objects as have no connection with manners or civil society every thing therefore depends upon the habits amidst which men grow up  when once industry is habitual to a people the most object superstition will have no influence on their temporal felicity the priests themselves will render their sermons conformable to the manners of the country nor will the monkish theorists be able to overturn them  there are as many legends in this country as in cologne nor are the people less fond of procession and pilgrimage and yet they are infinitely more industrious more frugal and more wealthy than at cologne it is not therefore the fault of the religion or superstition but of the government alone that the people of cologne are so debauched and that the priests of the place openly recommend debauchery a loose education having made their religion prejudicial to them the corporationsystem which with more activity and cleverness would have been a blessing to the country is become the curse of it in a word police government and executive justice are subject under a weak administration to the same abuses as government nor is it religion itself but the abuses of it which make it prejudicial to the state  the upper part of westphalia which lies at a greater distance from the rhine is not so well cultivated and by nature is much less productive than the lower part it is occupied by many heaths and morasses which for the most part produce only turf and in the better places dyerswood some parts of the country such as part of the duchy of minden and marquisate of tecklenburg are remarkably well peopled but this is compensated by the striking depopulation of some others as for instance of the bishoprics of munster osnaburg and paderborn the marquisate of bentheim and some domains in the electorate of hanover  this part of westphalia however is the proper country for hemp and flax which are some of the richest products of this country the greatest part of the hemp and flax manufactured in these parts of westphalia about the rhine holland the austrian netherlands and the french netherlands comes from this part of the country besides there is a great part exported raw to england spain portugal and america though these productions are found in great plenty in other parts of germany particularly in the electorate of hanover the circle of lower saxony hesse waldeck and fulde it is a question whether all the flax and hemp of the other parts of germany taken together are equivalent to the quantity found here according to a very accurate estimate the annual exports of raw and spun flax and hemp out of the single circle of westphalia amounts to five millions sterling which with what is exported worked up amounts to  00000l more  to enter holland from the side of westphalia appears to be going out of a pigsty into a fine garden the country round nimeguen especially is a striking contrast to what is seen in westphalia the magnificence and regularity of the dutch cities however soon becomes tiresome in the extreme all the cities villages roads and canals are so similar that they appear copies of the selfsame individual picture a map comprehending the circle of burgundy or the austrian possessions in the netherlands etc nb the circle of burgundy is enclosed by a strong dotted line map of burgundy with respect to real value it is only a flogged out beggar parading about in a rich gown which he has stolen the palatinate which is not more than one fifth of holland is of infinitely more natural value  the inhabitants likewise taken in general are only well dressed beggars their riches do not belong to them for they enjoy them not they are only guardians of their money when you are invited to dinner by a man of middling rank the magnificence of the dishes the cleanliness of the room you dine in and the expensiveness of the furniture make you expect a princely meal but when the dishes are set on you find no more than you would have at the table of a good westphalian peasant  chap x of the circle of burgundy this circle is one of those that are wholly catholic the greatest part of its territories have been torn from it france has gradually brought under her dominion the duchy of lorrain which was reckoned in the circle of burgundy and a part of the duchy of luxemburg with a part of the counties of flanders artois burgundy hennegau and namur the provinces of gelderland holland zealand utrecht friezland overyssel and groningen have united and are become independent nay they have even reduced under their subjection a part of the duchies of brabant and limburg and part of the country of flanders with the town of maestricht and its territory  thus the circle of burgundy consists now only of the principal part of the duchies of brabant limburg luxemburg part of the counties of flanders hennegau and namur and part of the upper quarter of gelderland  these territories now belong to one single lord the archduke of austria who represents the whole circle and is soledirector and circlesummoning prince of it  the people of this country have in them a natural spirit of revolt like their neighbors the french they covet to be free and indeed the unlimited power of their sovereigns and the oppression they have constantly labored under from an arbitrary government in some measure justifies their opposition it was the tyranny of the duke of alva their governor in the reign of philip ii of spain who was then sovereign of brabant that occasioned their revolt in his time and it was their dislike to the emperor joseph ii their late sovereign that brought on the last rebellion quelled by the emperor leopold indeed so powerful were the princes of the empire in early ages that they were lords of life and death and could take away life without trial merely by their mandate in the history of brabant we have the following interesting story  sifroi count palatine having married a beautiful young woman but of no great family or connexions was called to the holy wars soon after his marriage the spirit of the times led him to this enterprise without much reluctance except that of leaving his young wife behind him whom he feared might be induced to dishonor him in his absence he left her however in the care of a friend one of the principal officers of his establishment and desired he might be made acquainted from time to time with her conduct and the state of her health the beauty of this lady attracted the love of her guardian and in his sovereigns absence he endeavored to corrupt her principles and rob his lord of that fidelity she owed him finding her averse to his solicitations and unconquerable his love was converted into hatred and when he next wrote to his sovereign he traduced her character and represented her as having defiled his bed with a menial servant of his household and thus dishonored his name sifroi on the receipt of this intelligence was thunderstruck and the more so as no former letter had given him the least intimation of her attempting to deviate from the line of virtue the possibility of a false report and his love for his lady operated in her favor but then his pride took the alarm and as of two passions in contest the evil one is generally predominant so it was here without consideration in the impetuosity of temper he returned an immediate answer to this false friend saying if the proofs were glaring he desired to be rid of her but the mode of putting her to death he left to this officer on the arrival of this mandate he made a fresh attempt upon her virtue armed with the power of taking away her life on her noncompliance still she was firm and invincible and the consequence was that her death was pronounced unwilling to bring her to a public execution lest his treachery should be discovered he hired an assassin to take her into a neighboring wood and there dispatch and bury her  this being settled the man left her cut her name upon a rock and told his savage employer that he had executed his commission and buried her in the forest near the place where her name was engraved  it happened at this time that she was pregnant she soon however found a retreat in a cave and here she took up her abode nature in due time performing her own office and she was delivered of a fine girl which the story says was suckled by a do which providence had sent to be its nurse for her distress and anguish of mind had rendered her unable to perform that endearing task herself she lived seven years with her infant in this solitary desert feeding on wild herbs and roots and associating with the tamer animals of the forest her clothes were worn out and she was obliged to go naked without any other covering than her long hair which reached below her waist  the officer who supposed her dead being informed of the unexpected return of his sovereign fearing a discovery of his treachery and not able to bear the reproaches of his own mind put an end to his existence and when sifroi came back and the whole matter was unravelled he too soon for his peace learned the innocence of his wife and the treachery and end of him to whom he had entrusted her and would have given the world not to have sent his cruel mandate hastily dispatched in a moment of phrenzy but it was then too late the deed as he supposed was done  hunting some time afterward in this forest and straying from his party chance led him to the rock where her name was cut startled at the sight he became motionless upon his horse in a moment or two his senses returned but returned with bitterness stung with remorse and overpowered with distress he could only sigh and weep genevieve whose fears were always awake for herself and her little one dreading a discovery that she was still in being had been wandering in search of food and returning to her cave at the time sifrois eyes were fixed upon the rock little expecting to meet any thing in so sequestered a part fled to her abode and screamed as she fled sifroi at the noise turned instantly round and just obtained the glimpse of her as she entered approaching the caves mouth he cried out what is that voice is it a human voice it is she answered then come forth he cried throw me your coat returned she and i will for i am naked he accordingly did so and to his great astonishment and joy discovered both his wife and his child the inclemency of the weather and her hard fare throwing a brown hue over her had made some alteration in her features but her beauty had not left her she became more amiable in his eyes from the calamity she had experienced though destitute of dress she was clothed with innocence and returned unsullied to his arms  the austrian part of the duchy of brabant the length of which is rated at twentytwo and its breadth twenty german miles was formerly the first in rank of all the seventeen provinces in the netherlands the air of this country is good and its soil very fertile its greatest riches consist in flax near brussels a canal has been carried from the river senna to the village of willebroech where it discharges itself into the river rapel which unites itself with the schelde so that a person may sail from brussels to the north sea this canal was begun in the year    0 and finished in      at an expense of  00000 florins  in the austrian part of brabant are reckoned nineteen walled towns and a considerable number of immunities enjoying the rights of burghers and towns  the whole country professes the romish church in the year      an archbishopric was erected at mecklin and to it was assigned the primacy of belgium to this see belongs eleven collegiate churches and  0  cloisters a number of the last of which are now suppressed within these three years subject to the archbishopric are the bishops of antwerp ghent boisleduc bruges ypres and ruremond the number and opulence of the ecclesiastics in this country are very considerable  for the promotion of learning here are several schools and gymnasia and likewise the university of louvain  the duchy of brabant belonged formerly to the frankish monarchy afterward it became part of the lotharingian kingdom and a fief of the german empire in course of time it descended to philip ii of spain  the republic of the united netherlands in the   th century made itself master of the northern part of the duchy of brabant which it retained at the peace of westphalia the emperor charles vi in the year   0  after the battle of ramilies took possession of the present austrian part of this duchy that part of the duchy of brabant which belongs to the house of austria contains the cities of louvain brussels antwerp and mecklin of each of which we shall speak  louvain is a very large and pleasant town with an old castle and a celebrated university the walls of this place are near seven miles in circumference but within them are a great many gardens and vineyards the public buildings are magnificent and the university consists of a great number of colleges the town was formerly in a flourishing state owing to the noble manufactures of linen and woollen cloth established here which in the beginning of the   th century maintained upwards of   0000 workmen but the clothweavers making an insurrection in      and being punished on that account some of them withdrew to england and with its manufactures the town likewise decayed the place at present is chiefly remarkable for its good beer with which it serves the neighboring towns the fortifications are not very strong and yet it boasts of never having been taken except by the french in      it is said there are no fewer than forty one colleges belonging to this university  brussels is the finest and richest city of the netherlands the capital of brabant and seat of the governor of the austrian low countries where the court is held and to whom the people pay almost the same honors as to their sovereign the ducal palace where the governor resides the townhouse and the arsenal are superb structures the camblets lace and fine tapestry which are exported from this town are famous it was furiously bombarded by the french for fortysix hours in      by which fourteen churches and above  000 houses were reduced to ashes but in four years all were rebuilt again far more beautiful in   0  the allies made themselves masters of this place and in      the french it lies on the senna partly in the plain and partly on an eminence being large well built populous and fortified the public buildings the palaces and courts of the several princes counts and other persons of condition here together with the churches and cloisters are some of them considerable and some magnificent the magistracy is elected yearly from seven patrician families  brussels says reisbec is one of the most beautiful and most brilliant cities in europe there is not to be seen any where a finer place than the large marketplace of this city all the houses in it are built in a style and with a degree of magnificence that you scarcely see any where out of italy we meet here with excellent company who to a stranger are not difficult of access there are several clubs after the manner of the english where we find the greatest freedom and good humor  brussels is far more beautiful for the bombardment it suffered from marshal villeroy for since that time the mischief he did has been entirely made good by many new streets and public buildings in a much better style than they were before many of the streets are also well paved some very spacious and all the new houses large and well built  among the churches of brussels there are some that well deserve notice st gudula is a very remarkable gothic pile highly ornamented with monuments chapels pictures etc the jesuits church has also several objects to attract the attention of strangers one whole side of the great market square is taken up with the townhouse which is a most stupendous quadrangular building with a fine cupola and a pretty gothic front the apartment in which the states of brabant meet is very magnificent the history of charles v is worked in tapestry with a brilliancy of coloring that is almost inconceivable the manufacture of the place and covers one of the apartments there are likewise other apartments which contain many original paintings by the greatest flemish masters another great advantage the marketplace enjoys is being surrounded with the corporationhalls of different trades the fronts of which being uniform and adorned make a fine circumference  the archdukes palace though an old irregular building erected at different times should not be passed over unnoticed it is a very large edifice and the apartments are extremely spacious and well furnished behind it is a large park well stocked with deer there are also many very pleasant walks in it and a summer house built by the emperor charles v  among other edifices usually viewed are the palaces of orange de ligne epinoy rubengue egmont aremberg arschot and bournonville in the gardens of the latter you have a fine view of brussels and the adjacent country the only objects of much consideration in these palaces are the paintings among which particularly in the palace of the duke of aremberg are many very capital pieces not only by flemish but also by italian masters  as to the diversions of brussels there is a very large operahouse and two theaters in which french comedies are played the operahouse is very spacious but ill lighted instead of boxes it has large closets like the italian theaters which contain tables chairs a fire place etc so that parties are formed for cards and conversation during the performance but the prices are too low to admit of any splendid entertainment their performers are but very moderate and bad music is an entertainment that will not be relished by those who are in the least acquainted with the luxury of an english or an italian opera  the court gives an air of liveliness to brussels which is not to be met with in the other cities of flanders what with the officers about the person of the governorgeneral the residence of a considerable military force the chief courts of justice with no slight portion of trade and manufacture this place is the most pleasing and cheerful residence in flanders  the english resident here says thickness consist chiefly of persons of small fortune who come to brussels in order to give their children a good education of young men on traveling excursions and of the unfortunate and indigent  now and then a family of good fortune ventures upon a winter here but i never heard of one says he who did not quit the place with more than common dissatisfaction  there are few capitals in europe in which provisions and almost all other expenses incidental to a family are so reasonable as in this city it is even said that a family may live here upon two hundred pounds a year as well as upon six hundred in england but this we apprehend is rather exaggerated there are two articles of expense in this city which exceeds most other places houserent and firing there is no hiring a small decent house under thirty or forty pounds a year and in the article of firing which is wood where there are no stoves two or three shillings a day in cold weather may be soon expended without economy on a single fire provisions particularly vegetables of which there are no finer any where and all the articles of dress and likewise carriages servants and public diversions are cheaper here than in most places the education of children likewise which thickness justly observes many people believe to consist in french dancing and a tincture of foreign manners may be obtained upon much more moderate terms in brussels than in any part of england  the number of suspicious characters who resort hither from england makes the natives as well as the english of any respectability remarkably shy toward strangers of our own country these suspicious characters consist of two sorts either of such as have had some stigma affixed upon them in england so that no person of any character could associate with them without considering himself as reflected upon in so doing or they are composed of persons who having nothing morally bad about them yet confiding in their riches which they blazon forth assuming a consequence to which neither their manners nor their connections give them the least pretensions  these latter characters thickness has drawn in rather too glowing colors as for the women says he there are some of them who attend the winter balls of the brussels court that never advanced farther at st jamess than to see beneath the armpit of a beefeater the sunday procession of our royal family to and from the chapelroyal some of these poor people are driven almost to starvation in order to furnish the necessary decorations of a court appearance though for the comfort of their purse and the consolation of their stomachs it requires nothing more than the common dress of genteel life of this number are instanced two antiquated ladies whom he styles late of the pump room at bath without a fortune to bear it or a word of the language to support it were presented at this court it was very bleak that day and as the weather is generally a subject for strangers to begin with the archduchess observed it was very cold and repeated the words bien froid two or three times lest they might not understand her at length one of the ladies believing the archduchess asked them to stay dinner and that it was a nice fry they were to participate of curtsied and replied that whether it was fried or broiled so they had the honor of dining at court it was equal to them to avoid such things happening in future it is now the etiquette at the court of brussels that no british subject shall be presented there by our minister who has not previously been presented at st jamess  we take the liberty here to present to our readers thicknessess hints to a person of fashion who proposes to make brussels his winterresidence if a young man of fortune and rank is fond of play there is no society so respectable in any quarter of the globe in which there are not some characters who would take advantage of this foible to his utter ruin and destruction if he was silly enough to suffer himself to be ensnared brussels therefore ought not to be exempt from such characters at the same time we believe the noblesse of that capital to be as highly reputable in general as at any of our own court  were you to make this city as you propose your next winters abode you would of course be presented to the little but elegant court held here the consequence of which is a round of visits must be made to all the noblesse who attend it and who form that brilliant assembly these visits will all be punctually returned for those strangers who are young and rich will find a prince a duke a count or a baron who will intimate to them that by a little address they may be admitted into the grand society professions of regard due to strangers good breeding artful flattery fine women sumptuous tables are all thrown in the way of a young man of fortune to cover the real cause of so much attention see him seated between a duchess and a countess both possessing the charms of beauty graced with the most easy and captivating french manners a noble repast before him and the most delicious wines at his elbow thus placed and being a stranger the attention of the whole table appears to be employed to make him happy and if in such a situation a young man of fashion in a strange country does not feel himself so where is happiness to be found almost every passion of man is gratified nor does he go to sleep without flattering himself he is in a fair way of being admitted teteatete with one or more of the charming women with whom he enjoyed such a happy evening the next night he meets the same agreeable society and finds himself as much at home and at his ease as if he was at his own manor house in this situation the stranger who knows he is a very handsome young man no doubt forms some plan of further happiness without suspecting that many of the party who are not so rich as he is would not dislike a draught on his banker or even a mortgage on his estate and as both sexes constantly play in this country it may be presumed both understand it very well my lord anglois of course is one of the party and if he wins of a lady it gives him an opportunity of showing his good breeding if of a prince or a duke why it is honor enough to have such great personages his debtors but if he loses and it is ten to one but he does he must pay directly for every body here knows that an englishman has so much money that if it were not for continental excursions they could not tell what to do with it now says thickness lest it should be supposed this is an imaginary picture sketched out without an original to copy from i will come to a matter of fact i found here a young gentleman of ireland of genteel appearance of good address and of easy fortune a member of this grand society and living in a degree of intimacy with the first people on his first arrival he lost as most first comers do a considerable sum of money to a native of high birth and of course paid it at some distance of time they played again and the stranger became the winner of a sum even greater than that which he lost a year or two before but instead of being paid he was informed by his antagonist that he was not to receive his fortune as a younger brother till he was thirty and therefore desired to be permitted to pay the debt by installments and engaged the winner to give his word he would not let his brother know what had passed the paisbas peer however never made good his engagements went to paris would neither answer letter nor pay drafts made upon him and therefore having cancelled all former obligations the stranger determined to lay the matter open to his brother but what was the consequence  he was asked if they did not know that they were the first people of the country and was told that his brother wore a sword but finding that such paisbas hauteur would not do and that the young stranger wore a sword too some mode of moderating matters was to be employed another great man related to the former then steps forward censures the conduct of the two brothers opens his doors wider than ever to the stranger and softens him into more patience it may now be imagined he is paid no says thickness nor ever will is it not enough to have the honor of dining with a prince supping with a duke and dancing with a duchess without being paid a thousand pounds or two  the wine that is generally met with in brussels is bad the wine merchants it is said have a method of brewing several sorts of wine and particularly what they call burgundy with pigeons dung and an artificial sweet wine palatable enough in which a quantity of brimstone is infused called moselle the wines made from the hills adjacent to the rhine with which this country is plentifully supplied is perhaps of all fermented liquors the best this wine in my opinion says thickness and he was a judge when procured genuine is superior to all others it improves both in strength and flavor in proportion to a certain age for it is a great mistake to imagine wine cannot be too old there is a time when wine as well as men arrive at maturity after which wines as well as men lose some part of their original vigor for though they give travelers wines to taste of an hundred years or more it must be observed that as they sell great quantities every year from their large reservoir tons so they as constantly fill them up annually with new wines if therefore a person sends to frankfort for the best rhenish wine not for hock he will in a few years have hock in his cellar at half price it is inconceivable what a variety of excellent wines this country and hungary produces the latter very little known all of which are superior to french or spanish wines except perhaps burgundy and champagne of the first growth in good wines  it is a great mistake to imagine that the wines in germany are apt to create the gout they may it is true be unfit for those who have the gout or the seeds of that disorder in their constitution but in sound bodies it is more likely to prevent than to promote a gouty habit in champagne where the wine of the country is constantly drank there are few or no gouty people and real champagne is a very wholesome wine  no part of the continent can long continue agreeable to an englishman who has been accustomed to live even with that decency which the english of middling fortunes live in their own country for this reason it is that the english nation alone are the least satisfied with the fare they meet with abroad the neatness of our houses the cleanliness of our butchers bakers etc render the houses shops and manufacturers of what we eat and drink on the continent highly disgustful the servants and boys of the bakers in the low countries and in france are the dirtiest miserable looking people on earth no part of their persons being clean but their legs and feet for they are always visible and though the tables of all orders of people are covered with a variety of dishes which may catch the eye or provoke the appetite an englishman whose stomach is not depraved will soon wish to see a plain wholesome dish or two of meat a la mode dangleterre set before him  knaves of many nations says thickness have fled to this city under the idea they were beyond the reach of those they meant to defraud not knowing that in brabant and in all the low countries a person may be arrested for debts contracted in any other and that not only men but women and children are subject to imprisonment for the debts of a fugitive husband or parent the marquis de sanna the count de ribaderia and duke of brunswick were arrested here by their distant creditors but a stranger who takes a house after a year and a days residence in it is not liable to personal confinement for debt until a tedious process has been carried on against him  an english gentleman of fortune having chastised his servant too severely absconded but his wife was hurried to the common gaol to be responsible for his towndebts till he returned and this business is done in so brutal a manner that our london bailiffs are quite polished when compared to a pais bas officer of justice  i visited says thickness their maison de force or prison the men and women are separated each prisoner has his bed and cabin which must be made and cleaned by an early hour and a certain quantity of work done before they eat in this house says he i saw five or six hundred of the worst people on earth living in a cleaner and more orderly manner than the same number can live any where at large neither relations nor friends are admitted to see the offenders no improper conversation is heard prayers work and penitence are the lot of all such houses being erected in every county in our kingdom would do more to prevent housebreaking than all the county gallowss in england  it seems to have been a mistaken notion in several courts of europe that the house of austria received so little benefit from these provinces that they were scarce worth the keeping the expenses running away with all the profit but admitting that no money is received into the treasury of vienna still the advantage of having a considerable body of troops paid and maintained is of itself very important the provinces pay the troops in garrison and forces of all kinds that are quartered here which amount at different times from six to twenty thousand men besides the opportunity of advancing a number of subjects to posts of honor and profit is valuable to any court  these provinces likewise are very populous and are found highly serviceable in recruiting regiments and as they possess much trade and numerous thriving manufacturies they are a body of subjects of undoubted importance however these advantages are not all for it is very well known that large remittances are made to vienna notwithstanding the expense of keeping a court here  the upper town says peckham in his description of this city is magnificent and has lately been much improved by new buildings and by enclosing a piece of waterground planting it and laying it out in walks  it is well supplied with fountains some of which are rather whimsical for instance the three virgins from whose breasts slow continual streams of water and to show that the male sex is no less charitably inclined there is the statue of a boy who spouts out water with the most immodest assurances it is called in the flemish tongue mannykipis  nothing will strike the eye of an observing stranger with more surprise in this city than to see on a navigable river more than a hundred miles from the ocean such a number of large highmasted vessels of various constructions lying before the town the navigable canals and rivers throughout all the low countries are indeed wonderful some progress of inland navigation says thickness has been successfully made in england but yet the nation at large does not seem to know the astonishing advantages which would arise to the kingdom if it were more general m de la lands treatise sur le canaux de la navigation remarks that a wagon with six horses and two drivers carries between two and three thousand pounds weight whereas a single boat navigated by two men will carry two hundred thousand pounds weight this therefore is a saving of two hundred men and six hundred horses besides the extra number of men and horses which are required to repair the damages they do to the roads  the public walks are elegant the ramparts extremely pleasant and the country round brussels is most delightful to the eye and extremely profitable to the possessors for the land within ten miles of the city sells at forty years purchase and lets in general for three pounds sterling an acre  in the arsenal is some old armor of neither curiosity or use except an iron shirt which no sword can pierce and a steel shield so finely engraved that the figures seem reflected from the polish not to be etched in the steel the nicest touch cannot perceive the least scratch though the figures appear to be strongly marked when the shield is held obliquely  just below the arsenal is the palace of the governor of the austrian netherlands the staircase is very magnificent the steps are of marble and the balustrades of iron gilt adorned with compartments of birds and beasts nicely executed in polished steel by triefle the cieling is painted in fresco  the apartments of the princess are hung with brussels tapestry the floors are all inlaid with mahogany and box the princesss cabinet is much admired being covered throughout with the finest japan the late prince was a great mechanic and had a cabinet of curiosities trifling enough among which were two boxes containing all the common trades in miniature  in the menagerie there are some fowls which are the produce of a very unnatural amor between a rabbit and a hen they are of various sizes their breasts and bellies clothed with white fur their wings and backs covered with feathers without the plume which rise from the skin and have the appearance of wet feathers they are all milkwhite as their parents their shape in every respect the same as other fowls the rabbit in an amorous mood like many other husbands strips his wife of her clothing by biting half the feathers from her back  having been at brussels myself more than once i can take upon me to say that the city is by no means the fine place it is in general represented the streets are narrow and not well paved having no footway the houses are built in the gothic taste with pediment tops and the windows are chiefly casements was it not from the fountains continually running the place would be exceedingly dirty and there is no appearance of shops or trade part of the town stands upon the top of a high hill where there is a small park cut in walks the resort of genteel people on sundays from this park runs several new streets with elegant houses erected in the modern style of building commanding a fine prospect the palace is small but very grand and neat and stands just below the hill being the residence of the viceroy and where the court is held it is the rendezvous of all the brilliant part of brabant and living here is not very expensive a man may make as genteel an appearance in this country for his hundred a year as he can in london for three times the sum  the roads from city to city are continued pavements in a straight line for thirty or forty miles together planted with trees on both sides and the country every where open and uninclosed and there is a canal from brussels to antwerp on which a floatingbarge with good accommodation passes to and from it every day  of antwerp this town and district is called the margravate of the holy roman empire its origin is somewhat obscure godfrey of bouillon enjoyed it under this title after which it descended to the dukes of brabant but yet it was reckoned one of the seventeen provinces at present it is strictly united with brabant  the approach to the city of antwerp is noble by a straight paved road bordered with oaks  this city is seven miles in circumference built in the form of a crescent and surrounded with a good wall and many bastions faced with stone these fortifications however are of no other consequence than to defend the town against any sudden incursisions but they look very beautiful for the top of the wall is an hundred feet broad and planted with double rows of trees its strength is in a large regular and very strong citadel in form of a pentagon which the duke of alva caused to be erected there in      it stands close to the river scheld on the south side of the city and commands all the town and the adjacent country for some distance there are five principal bastions to it which command each other defended by two very deep ditches here stood the statue which the duke of alva had erected representing himself in a military attitude and trampling the nobility and people under his feet which so roused the spirit of the populace that they broke into the citadel on a holiday and entirely demolished the statue  the river at antwerp is twenty feet deep and at high water rises twenty feet more which makes it an excellent harbor so that large vessels may come up from the sea and unload their cargoes at the eight principal canals in the town these are the advantages which carried their trade to such a height but the dutch building fort lillo which commands the approach and makes all the ships that pass pay toll was a fatal stroke to their trade and drove the chief of it to amsterdam  antwerp has many remains of its former magnificence particularly in the length breadth and regularity of the principal streets and many of the publicbuildings and churches it has twentytwo squares two hundred and twelve streets and seventy gates from each of which runs a street terminating at the cathedralsquare the street called la mere is the finest in the city it is very well paved and is so wide that twenty coaches may pass in it a breast with great ease it is also very well built and in general of free stone many of the other streets also make a very good appearance being broad straight and handsome the better sort of houses throughout the city are in general large lofty and contain good apartments from the decay of trade several of them are let at very low rates most of them have courtyards and gardens which make them very agreeable to live in and many are in the ancient style of building which does not make so graceful an appearance  the markets here are numerous and most of them well supplied that for fish is near the river and abounds with great plenty and that for fruit and gardenstuff is well supplied by numerous countrycarts in which the peasants bring the produce of their little farms one square is called the friday marketplace in which on a market day is to be seen many sales by auction of furniture and some of pictures where are to be picked up sometimes valuable pieces by flemish masters  nothing can be more melancholy than to view the house of the hansetowns built in      a time in which this city was so flourishing for the use of the merchants trading to the baltic it is a square edifice of   0 feet and all of stone the upper floors were ample magazines for all sorts of dry merchandise with vast cellars for the wet goods which are now converted into stabling for troopers horses and the magazines to haylofts a sad spectacle of the building which once was the residence of wealth and industry and shows how miserable a fall any place undergoes that loses a once established trade  antwerp contains now about seventy thousand souls of which about ten thousand are on the poorlist the police of the city with regard to the poor is as bad as it is singular there is an ample fund for their maintenance which is distributed not among those persons who are really indigent but among the families of such persons as happened to be enrolled among the poor many generations back when it first became an object of general police to provide for those who were unable to provide for themselves  very near the street la mere is the exchange said to be the first building of the kind raised in europe and from which sir thomas gresham is said to have taken his idea of that in london this building is now resorted to only by half a dozen bankers and as many brokers four streets meet there and it has four gates answerable to them the parades are supported by above forty marble pillars the length of it is   0 feet and the breadth   0 beneath are vaults and magazines for goods and over it are the apartments of an academy for painting sculpture and architecture the expense of this building is said to have amounted to  00000 crowns at a time when money was much dearer than it is at present  this city was once the grand emporium of almost all the commerce in europe which was owing to three principal causes first to the liberty which reigned here secondly to the advantages of its situation and port for above four thousand sail of ships could lay in perfect safety in the canals at a time and thirdly to the near neighborhood of the most flourishing manufactures then in europe which were carried on in all the flemish towns bruges possessed the greatest share of trade before antwerp rose to such a height but the wars which broke out in flanders in the beginning of the   th century drove most of the merchants from the former place to the latter they reckoned the trade of this city at its height about the year      when they computed the inhabitants at  00000 their harbor at that time contained very often   00 ships at a time and  00 were commonly seen to go out or come in in a day the annals of the city inform us that in the year    0 the trade amounted to one hundred and thirtythree millions of gold exclusive of the bank the antwerpers to this day are fond of telling the story of john daen their famous merchant who lent the emperor charles v a million of gold and afterward entertained him most magnificently made a fire of cinnamonwood and in the emperors presence threw the bond into it  but all their prosperity was no security against the tyranny of their sovereign philip ii and his arbitrary agent the duke of alva presently drove all trade from antwerp so that the fall of the city was much quicker than its rise after being twice sacked there was much of it burnt down in      and brought into sucha condition as was utterly incompatible with trade the merchants therefore fled in whole troops and the dutch received them having formed their infant republic amsterdam began to be a place of trade they removed thither and carried with them their correspondence and industry  upon the loss of their trade the inhabitants gave their attention principally to banking jewelling and painting in the first they have always been proficients and carried it to a great extent even in the present times during the duke of marlboroughs war two brothers the de konnings paid one of them the army of france and the other that of the allies some of their painters were of note in the flemish school before the time of rubens but that great master laid the principal foundation for their fame he established their school and painting flourished here for a long while under the influence of his genius so that antwerp has produced more good artists this way than any other town in the netherlands antwerp has likewise been famous for printing the plantin editions being much esteemed in the learned world plantins printing house remains though imperfect at this time and is said by the antwerps to be the best in europe having been supplied with near an hundred different sorts of founts of letters two of which were syriac fortyseven roman nine greek and ten hebrew  but antwerp though so much reduced from its ancient splendour is yet a place of consequence here is some trade carried on for which it is yet well situated and has numerous cities in flanders etc to supply with foreign commodities they have also several flourishing manufactures a considerable lacetrade and a share of the linen fabrics etc it is also an agreeable place to reside in from the number of nobility and people of large fortune who live in it through their patronage a theater has been rebuilt and also an apartment for the performance of concerts the first is a very beautiful and well contrived edifice well furnished with scenery and machinery it is richly ornamented too with paintings a company of french comedians exhibit here three times a week in winter some good masters have ornamented the concertroom with their paintings where a concert is performed once a week in winter  in the churches there are numerous pictures of most capital merit by the first painters of the flemishschool such as rubens vandyke and others the great fault of the painters of the flemishschool says marshall is that they are entirely destitute of a chain of great ideas an action complex in its nature but rendered one by the genius of the artist is sought for in vain in their works good coloring and a masterly imitation of stilllife are their great excellencies minute finishing is carried by them to the highest perfection  the cathedral of antwerp is a vast building and full of ornaments of painting statuary and rich carving the taking down from the cross by rubens is one of the finest pictures of the kind to be met with in the whole world it is very large with a number of figures all executed in the highest style of this painter so that it cannot fail of being highly admired by all lovers of painting they are always kept masked or covered  the fall of the angles by floris is supposed to rank next in merit on the thigh of one of the fallen angels is a large hornet painted by quintin matzys the noted blacksmith of antwerp who fell in love with the daughter of floris and demanded her in marriage the painter refused him because he was not of his own profession matzys therefore changed his hammer for the pallet and studied under the italian masters for two years on his return he painted this hornet unknown to floris who by mistake was going to brush it off thinking it alive he was so pleased with the execution of it that he immediately gave him his daughter in marriage matzys was buried on the outside of the western door of the church where there is a plain stone with this epitaph  conunbialis amor de mulcibre fecit apellum love transformed vulcan into an apelles this building is very nobly ornamented and its architecture in the gothic style is not inferior to any edifice in the low countries it is five hundred feet long and two hundred and forty feet broad it was erected in the   th century the first stone of the choir was laid by the emperor charles v nothing can well be finer than the view seen from the top of this fine steeple not only a vast tract of country for many miles round but of several very considerable cities such as malines brussels ghent liege louvain etc here is a musicalclock which chimes every hour halfhour quarter and halfquarter consisting of near eighty bells the largest bell was erected in    0 and weighs sixteen thousand pounds  the abbey of st michael is the grandest in the city the refectory is covered with pictures by quellin most admirably executed there is a deception of a staircase with a fish lying on one of the steps which must attract every eye in the church is a grand piece by rubens the adoration of the magi which he finished in thirteen days the apartments of the abbot are well worthy of a prince such a profusion of capital pictures by the best flemish and italian masters with paintings to imitate basso relievo executed in a style so as to deceive an artist  the jesuits church is one of the most beautiful edifices to be seen in all flanders the facade is enriched with statues and other ornaments of a great master the architecture has uncommon merit the workmanship is very masterly and it is full of fine paintings the finest marble intermixed with jasper porphyry and gold nor can any thing be more magnificent than the chapel adjoining  in the library is seen a portrait of rubens drawn in pen and ink by himself and executed in the most inimitable manner with a minute expression so mixed with freedom that it is beyond the power of the graver to equal it  the chapel of the virgin is remarkably beautiful it is composed entirely of white marble designed and executed by scheemaeckers and surrounded with bassreliefs the altar is all of marble with various decorations of silver and a statue of the virgin in that metal six feet and an half high the door of the chapel is likewise very neatly executed and over it are three bronzes of very fine workmanship  in the church of the friars of st augustine are a holy family a very large picture by rubens one of his finest pieces st augustine in a transport of devotion by vandyke he is lifting up his eyes to heaven where he is supposed to see jesus christ this their catalogue says is the very best performance of that great painter it has certainly a wonderful merit their is a strength and majesty of expression with an elegance and freedom of design that is seldom seen the colors are chaste and agreeable etc in a word the whole piece is strikingly fine here is also a crucifix by vandyke this picture is likewise most capitally fine upon painting the above mentioned fine picture of st augustine he demanded sixhundred florins as his price but the monks disputing with him he insisted on his terms but let them have this crucifix very cheap it could now be sold for thirteen thousand guineas such is the fate of the most ingenious part of mankind they can scarcely live by the sale of their productions but when they are dead and buried the world begins to find out their merit and value single efforts of their genius at ten times more than their whole fortune  in the first church nothing is more worthy of attention than the monument of the marquis del pico one of the governors of the citadel he is represented as starting out of his sleep and in amazement at the sight of two skeletons standing before him over his head are two cherubs weeping one of which holds a shield and the other a helmet between them stands fame with the arms of the marquis in one hand and her trumpet in the other the whole decorated with great number of military insignia it is the work of scheemaeckers and one of his best performances in the year      at the siege a bomb damaged it conconsiderably but it is since repaired and very well the altar by the same artist is also a magnificent piece of sculpture  in the church of st andre there is also a curious monument erected by two english ladies to the memory of that unfortunate princess mary queen of scots who fell a sacrifice says thickness to the jealousy and hatred of our queen bess this monument is of marble with a bust of the queen  rubens who died in the year    0 was buried in a little chapel which still belongs to his family in the great church his monument is of marble and well executed over the altar is a picture by his own hand representing the infant jesus on the knee of the virgin which is perhaps the best conceived the best executed and the best preserved of all his works st george and st jerome attended by two fine women are near the virgin and these are the portraits of his two beautiful wives this picture was engraved after his death by p pontius and rubenss intimate friend gervates composed his epitaph which however is too contemptible to copy nor was it placed over his remains till the year       at brussels says thickness all is french at antwerp all is dutch which of the two is best with respect to the people says he i will not pretend to determine but with respect to the laws antwerp bears all the credit and honor due to humanity that barbarous and tyrannic custom of secretly trying criminals destroying their bodies and confiscating their property in all the other provinces of the austrian netherlands and france does not prevail in this city perhaps this is the reason why antwerp he adds has produced more men of genius than any other city in this country here they had liberty to think and it appears a kind of perpetual motion was first made at antwerp and in    0 gemma fusius found out a method of determining the longitude at sea by means of clocks and watches and this very soon after gave rise to the invention of clockwork  when a person is to be tried for any offense in this country he is brought face to face with his accuser in open court in the presence of the magistrates and criminals are even allowed two council to plead for them if the question be put the punishment must be in the presence of two echevins or aldermen and if the prisoner be acquitted he is instantly discharged if guilty he is executed or punished the next day but only a moiety of his property is forfeited the other goes to his wife and children or nearest relations  the best account i can give you says thickness of what is meant by the question being put to a prisoner before it is known whether he be innocent or guilty is that the supposed offender is fixed on a frame to which there are certain stretchers applied to his limbs to draw them gradually beyond their natural extension and at the same time drops of water are let to fall on the breast or some particular part of the body which by repetition became almost intolerable  the situation of antwerp remarks reisbec would have been much more advantageous for the advancement of commerce but the dutch have locked up the mouth of the scheld their forts not only govern the mouth of the river as they should do according to treaty it having been agreed by the peace concluded at munster in      between spain and the united provinces that no large ships should sail directly to antwerp that they should unload their merchandise in holland which should be conveyed thence in smaller vessels but they have literally stopped up the mouth of it sunken ships filled with stones immense dykes of stone pallisadoes and other things of the kind barely leave room enough for small boats to go by twenty millions of guilders would not be sufficient in twenty years to remove the impediments which the dutch have laid in the way of the trade of antwerp on the contrary other writers aver that the scheld is navigable now for ships of the largest burden up to antwerp did not two forts on opposite sides of that river oppose the passage of vessels above a limited burden which is very small a report propagated by the cunning of the dutch that there are five large vessels sunk in the scheld between their forts has strangely gained credit not only in countries at a distance from the river but in brabant itself and even in antwerp it is amusing to reflect on the easy credulity of the world how much people are imposed on by vague reports and the authority of universally received opinions we are well assured by persons of the first rank and character in brabant that there is not one vessel sunk in the scheld nor any other obstruction than the treaties and forts already mentioned to the passage of a seventyfour gun ship up to the walls of antwerp  there is no want of gold in brabant and flanders antwerp brussels ghent and bruges are still filled with the treasures which were amassed when these towns were what england and holland are now the burgesses of these cities have a share in all the great undertakings and loans of the neighboring nations their commerce of exchange is immense probably insurance is not so safe among the dutch themselves as it is here antwerp is one of the most famous places in the world for insurance in the last bavarian war the court of vienna being determined to raise a loan in these countries was astonished at the quickness with which the money was raised but the inhabitants of ghent and antwerp gave the regency to understand that if there was occasion for three or four times as much it would be as easily procured  the inhabitants are religious to excess says reisbec they are also remarkably gay in their dress and equipage the women who are of a small stature are delicate neat and beautiful but being almost excluded from society and taught only the internal management of their houses and their children they are not so social as the ladies of france and england they are generally of a pale complexion a circumstance which is perhaps owing to their constant confinement in their houses for they never walk abroad or take any exercise except upon sunday evenings and public days when they take the air in their carriages upon the grand street called the rue la mer or in the environs of the city  mechlin is a considerable city very well situated for traffic with antwerp brussels and louvain by means of the rivers dyle and demer which join before they arrive at this place and run through it there are besides several canals and a great many bridges thrown over them it is the capital of a district of the same name and a see of an archbishop whose title is primate of the low countries the town is large and well built and the streets broad clean and well paved the marketplace is spacious and the cathedral is a superb structure with a high steeple and some very harmonious chimes mechlin is famous for the manufacture of the lace that goes by its name it is chiefly made in the nunnery of the beguines a kind of nuns without those vows which bend the common ones to a monastic life being at liberty at any time to quit the confinement and marry there are generally seven or eight hundred young women in it employed on lace which brings a good price all over europe they are also famous in this place for foundries of bells and great guns and in an inferior for brewing good beer which they export in considerable quantities it is an agreeable place to reside at from the diversions which are continually going on in it principally owing to the number of nobility who make it their residence this town was taken by the duke of marlborough in   0  and retaken by the french in       at a village called aigle seated at the foot of a mountain on the moselle there is a remarkakle square solid pyramid    feet high and adorned with many images it is a heathenish tomb which appears from the inscription to have been founded by two brothers named secundini in honor of their parents in all probability this mausoleum was created between the times of dioclesian and constantine the great part of the territory of luxemburg likewise belongs to the french  austrian part of the county of flanders flanders a province of the netherlands which may be divided into dutch austrian and french flanders is bounded by the german ocean and the united provinces on the north by the province of brabant on the east by hainault and artois on the south and by another part of artois and the german ocean on the west it is about twenty german miles from north to south and nearly the same distance from east to west  this country enjoys a temperate and wholesome air being partly level and partly mountainous its soil is in general fertile and fit for agriculture and in some parts particularly toward the sea its fertility is very great the land here bears almost all kinds of corn and gardenstuff flax is the riches of the country the pasture grounds in many parts are so excellent that there are no better in all the netherlands for this reason the breeding of cattle is an important article and it yields also fine butter and cheese flanders also produces fruits of various sorts together with fowl and venison such as deer wildboars and hares and likewise sea and river fish in it also are forests and woods its chief river is the scheld some useful canals have also been dug here among which that between bruges and ghent is the principal one  in the whole country are computed    walled and open towns many hundred villages and above   0 seignories the states here are the prelates nobles and four members from the principal towns  the flemings may boast the invention of some important arts they were the first in europe who began to support themselves by weaving and learned to dye cloths and stuffs in this respect the towns of ypres and courtray have the oldest and greatest reputation in the latter was invented the art of weaving all sorts of figures in linen in the   th century viervliet found out the method of curing herrings john van eyck in the   th invented oil colors  at present the manufactures of flanders are far from being in the flourishing condition they were formerly however we have still from lisle brocades cottons camlets lace and other wares from ghent menin and courtray linen from tournay tapestries curtains bed coverlets and other worked stuffs from bruges cotton and fine woolen stuffs linen and laces the chief towns of austrian flanders besides those described are louvain ghent bruges and ostend  louvain is a large and pleasant town situated on the river dyle it is one of the principal cities of the netherlands and the capital of one of the four quarters into which brabant is usually divided the country round it is very fertile and the distance from brussels not more than twelve miles to the northeast of that city the air likewise is esteemed exceedingly healthful its circumference within the walls is at least ten english miles but it is a place of no great strength being of too large an extent to be easily defended the castle stands on the top of a hill surrounded with vineyards and fine gardens and has an extensive prospect over the neighboring country  this city before the cruel administration of the duke of alva was very considerable for its manufactures it being computed there were no less than  000 masterweavers in it at one time and it has still a trade in fine linen but not comparable to what it was formerly at present its only glory is its university which resembles those of england more than any other in europe it consists of    colleges and some make the number greater of which there are not more than four for the education of youth where strict discipline is observed the others are for those of riper years who come and go when they please many of these colleges are handsome buildings and nobly endowed but in both these respects they bear no comparison with those of oxford and cambridge the students in divinity constantly wear gowns and caps but the rest only at public exercises in every one of the four colleges abovementioned philosophy is taught by two professors each of whom reads two hours in a day the young students writing after them the governor of the university is styled rector and is chosen every half year by the senatus academicus which consists of the superior graduates in the several faculties he has plenary jurisdiction over the scholars and is attended by eight beadles who go before him with silver maces on holidays and in solemn processions there is another officer called the promoter who by the authority of the rector inflicts punishment on the offenders and sometimes passes sentence of death but generally lays a pecuniary mulct on them in proportion to their crime they have also a chancellor whose only business it is to confer degrees and who in all public assemblies takes place next to the rector  the townhouse of louvain is a magnificent building of great antiquity adorned on the outside with statues and very curious sculpture as to the churches of the city they are many of them beautiful and stately buildings especially the cathedral church of st peter which is governed by a provost a dean a chanter    honorary prebends and ten canons who are all professors of the several sciences in the university the jesuits church is also a very handsome edifice not unworthy of rome itself and its pulpit of oak is reckoned the finest piece of carved work in europe their library contains a great number of valuable manuscripts in which respect it is said to be the best in the austrian netherlands  in this place says thickness resided a few years since a man no less extraordinary in his way than the famous mountain doctor in switzerland named bogen and called the god of legs he was an illiterate underbred man who had a nostrum to cure ulcers in the legs and with so much success that patients came to him from every part of the continent but that which established his fame and fortune too beyond contradiction was the extraordinary cure he performed on the late prince charles of lorraines leg after he had tried all the surgeons of paris and the low countries without benefit and had been for many years a perfect cripple though he had given in pictures and snuffboxes to various surgeons to the value of five thousand pounds being sent for and on examining the ulcer he in a very rough unpolished language said to the prince zounds what is this all why we will walk tomorrow his rude manner and seeming ignorance had almost determined the prince to have dismissed him instantly for he thought it impossible that a man who had not set his foot to the ground for some years should be able to walk the next day yet he did walk the next day and in a very short time after was perfectly cured and enjoyed eighteen years of life and health afterward mr bogen is now dead but his son whom the prince made his valetdechambre is still living and is equally qualified to perform the same cures neither father nor son pretend to any chirurgical skill farther than rolling the bandage which is done in a most excellent and extraordinary manner the whole secret says thickness i have good reason to believe is nothing more than scraped carrot or a poultice made from that root as what he applies is of a reddish color and scraped carrot alone will perform wonders in healing ulcers  ghent is one of the largest cities in europe being near fifteen miles in circumference some say twenty it is built on a great number of little islands formed by four rivers and many canals over which there are an hundred bridges but large and pompous as this account is the reality bears no proportion to the description more than half the ground within the walls being occupied by gardens and there are some fields the fortifications are contemptible being little more than lines for an army to encamp within some of the streets are large well paved and tolerably built among the public buildings there are none worthy of any attention but a few churches except the house in which charles v was born which is still to be seen this place gave birth to that monarch in the year   00 he was the son of philip the handsome archduke of austria whose parents were the emperor maximilian and mary the only child of charles the bold the last prince of the house of burgundy his mother was the daughter of ferdinand and isabella king and queen of castile and arragon  the abbey of st pierre ranks far beyond any others in ghent it is situated on a rising ground at the extremity of the town and consists of an abbot and thirtyseven benedictine monks the refectory is superb and fitter for a palace than a convent it is paved with black and white marble and painted throughout in a masterly manner the library is very magnificent and the number of books such as they are very considerable from the windows you have a most delightful as well as an extensive view of the country in the church is some tapestry held in great estimation which has been there upwards of two centuries it contains the histories of sts peter and paul in diverse compartments most admirably finished and was the work of croyer of brussels  the horse in the conversion of st paul is the finest animal it is possible to behold our savior standing tiptoe on a wave is the true sublime and is most happily executed elymas struck with blindness has much merit and a marble floor is as nicely imitated in the tapestry as was ever seen in any picture  the abbots house is most sumptuous the governor of the low countries always resides in it when at ghent the apartments are crowded with good pictures but three by rubens are most excellent the one is joseph with the infant christ in his arms the two others are the heads of old men  the cathedral is a noble old building dedicated to st buvon of whom there is a good statue over the grand altar standing on the clouds which are supported by angels against the pillars of the church are some tolerable statues and where there are vacancies they have painted figures in the imitation of statues so happily that it is difficult to find out the deception the pulpit is said to be the grandest of the kind it is of marble enriched with statues and has two angels to support the sounding board there is a capital picture of st buvon by rubens in which he has introduced himself his wife and family  the monument of bishop trieste by fiamingo is most admirably executed the boys do not yield even to those of cardinal richlieus monument at the sorbonne fiamingos principal excellence was in boys and the delicate in this respect he was superior to michael angelo who attained the antique only in strong muscular figures not in those of youth nor women who under his bold hand became amazons  the maisondeville has two fronts the one in the gothic the other in the grecian style of three stories adorned with attic ionic and corinthian columns  there are some few pictures as the day of judgment by rubens and the coronation of charles vi in which picture are five hundred figures most of them taken from the life but the most capital picture is hercules between virtue and pleasure taken from the fable of cebes  before i came into this country says thickness i thought the discipline of the british and french troops were tolerably strict but as every thing is by comparison so i was soon convinced that neither the british or french discipline can bear that name when put in competition with the discipline of the german troops and yet i am told i should find a still greater difference between these troops and those of the king of prussia the soldier here wears his white coat three years and it must be always perfectly clean at the expiration of which time he has a new one and his old one is made into a waistcoat and breeches and must serve three years more in that capacity and is then dyed black to make gaiters the soldier is found in every article he can want for dress even to his hairstring and powder but his net pay is only twopence halfpenny a day five farthings of which is put into the common mess eight men in each and the other five farthings are for the luxuries of life sheeps head broth and horsebeans boiled in grease are with them great delicacies it fares better with the officers for a captain of foot in the imperial service has an hundred guineas a year a servant allowed him and his livery furnished by the emperor but when an officer neglects his duty and repeats it two or three times after the commandant has hinted to him to be more attentive he may be dismissed by the same authority having asked says thickness what punishments were used to maintain so strict a discipline the answer was none the punishments are so severe that no man risks the experiment  in the castle of ghent there are clothing arms accoutrements etc for ten thousand horse and foot all in the most perfect order and all of it made within the castle walls by the hands of the soldiers the german troops are in general sturdy welllooking men but they are illlimbed and certainly have not much more understanding among ten thousand of them than may be found among a flock of ten thousand sheep led about by a bellwether  they have very flourishing linen manufactures throughout all this country but these are not confined to ghent though there are many in that town but all the villages and almost every farm is a flaxmanufactory flax is a principal crop upon all the sundry parts of this country and the farmers and laborers do not only grow it but also dress and weave it and the women and children spin it every little farmer has one or two looms many of them five or six and some seven or eight according to the number of hands in the family this makes the whole race of country people remarkably active and industrious the servants and the farmer and his sons will weave linen in the night and in wet days when they have not employment in the farm and in this manner greatly contribute to earning a better maintenance for their families than in other countries where such time is appropriated to idleness  the accommodations in the bark on the canal of austrian flanders are infinitely superior to those of the trackskuits in holland being considerably larger with excellent apartments below for three several classes of passengers and a shaded quarter deck with benches for them to fit on when they choose to take the air there is a good dinner provided for each apartment and the company may be accommodated with wines of different kinds tea coffee and flemish beer the price of traveling as well as the fare is remarkably cheap and the best apartments are always filled with good company in fine weather nothing can be more delightful than an excursion from ghent to bruges by the bark which passes from place to place in one day distance about  0 miles price  s  d english dinner included the variety of fine prospects the charming verdure every where to be seen the number of little chatteaus on the banks of the canal the enlivening company that is generally to be met with and the still pleasing manner in which die bark keeps moving forward without any molestation from the sun or dust in a hot sultry day all together conspire to give very pleasing sensations to the mind they tell you an english gentleman was so delighted with the passage the entertainment and the company he met that he lived on board this bark for seven years sleeping one night at ghent the next at bruges and so on and that being a facetious man the better sort of people of these two towns particularly the young ladies would frequently for an excursion go and dine as they used to call it with the english gentleman  there are a kind of stagecoaches that travel all through brabant heavy lumbering things that on their paved roads almost shake a man to death the fare is cheaper than in england and the accommodations passable but four persons may hire a coach and pair which will travel as fast as the stage and cost no more than the stage price and are far more easy to travel in a person may go from london to spa and travel  00 miles through all austrian brabant for four guineas and live well upon the road the passage in the packet from dover to ostend included which is one guinea of the money those who travel in flanders by the canals pay as much for the carriage of a trunk as for themselves the natives of the country take a few necessary things in a kind of satchel made of carpeting called a sac du nuit which they carry in their hands when they are obliged to change boats as is often the case the canals not joining each other and by this they avoid the impositions of those who attend the boats to remove the luggage the price of traveling in these boats or barks is not more then one halfpenny english per mile they set out at stated hours as stagecoaches do are drawn by horses at the rate of four or five miles an hour and will travel thirty or forty miles a day stopping at certain places to dine  for fifteenpence the treckschuyt an elegant yatch conducts the traveller from ostend to this city which in the   th century was the principal mart in europe and where the merchants of all parts of the world had houses and commerical connexions but the frequent revolts of the inhabitants against their sovereigns the manufacturers against their masters and the masters against the magistrates first drove the strangers to antwerp and the natives to different parts of the world the sad effects of which are still felt and still visible for antwerp was raised on the ruins of bruges as amsterdam is at this day on those of antwerp but since ostend has become a free port bruges begins to revive in her trade it is said there are two hundred and fifty streets in bruges and  0000 inhabitants but more than  0000 of them are supported by public charity  the police is good the magistrates being just but severe and there is no part of the continent where strangers or natives can travel more securely at bruges an advocate is paid twentyeight pence an hour for attendance but the physician has only sevenpence for each visit when a consultation is held each physician has twentysix pence and the surgeons half that sum  in one of the churches at ghent there is a ring of bells the largest of which weighs   0 quintals each quintal a hundred pounds there are two or three fine open places in this city and a good theater but the houses as at brussels and bruges are all oldfashioned and built in the gothic style  bruges is an ancient and extensive city walled in the circumference being near five miles it has near three hundred streets in it and a vast number of canals and rivers but notwithstanding all this spaciousness it is not an agreeable place the houses are in general very old and extremely ugly and the whole place shows evident signs of decay and a loss of that trade and manufacture for which it was once famous they reckon six squares seven gates eight churches and no less than sixty monasteries a woeful sort of population instead of the industrious manufacturers which once filled the city among the rest there is a nunnery of english which several roman catholic families in england have contributed to fill  the churches of bruges have not any thing in them remarkable the best is the jesuits which is an elegant edifice in the church of our lady there are two fine monuments of charles the bold duke of burgundy and his daughter and heiress mary of burgundy they are of brass with much enamelling the workmanship good her dress is likewise shown that she wore three hundred years ago and which is highly enriched with jewels  what gives this place a very melancholy air are the vast houses standing empty in every part of the town which once were the residence of wealth and splendor among others they have seventeen palaces which in the times of their prosperity were formerly the residence of consuls from various kingdoms and states in europe this town was famous for trade before antwerp arose being then the greatest mart in europe england made it the staple for her wool and its cloth manufactories were much more considerable than those of any other place or country bruges however at present is not without some trade the ostend canal admits ships of from   to  00 tons burden up to the heart of the city which excites more trade here than in any other town in flanders  the merchandise imported by the shipping on this canal is sent to many places from bruges particularly by the scheld to the city of ghent and from thence by other canals to various cities and that river with the scarpe and the lys reaches to tournay menin lisle and douay they have likewise a communication with antwerp louvain mechlin and brussels it is an episcopal town in the great square there is a house founded in      where they provide for   0 orphans and bring them up some to learning and others to trades according to their abilities this city has often been taken and retaken in the late wars particularly in      by the french  ostend is the only seaport of austrian flanders it is small but well built and clean nor does it exhibit so much decay of ancient greatness as bruges it is situated in the midst of a saltmarsh with ditches into which the sea is let this situation makes it strong but the improvements in the modern art of attacking places will not allow it the same of such another siege as that which it stood against the spaniards which lasted three years and in which above  00000 men on both sides fell the french in      took it in eight days in the furious siege abovementioned which lasted from   0  to   0  and in which the dutch lost  0000 men and the spaniards  0000 isabella eugenia governante of the netherlands made a vow she would not change her linen till ostend surrendered but before the town was taken the color of it was quite changed however the ladies of the court to keep her in countenance had theirs dyed so as to be in color like that of their mistress by the late emperors having made it a free port the trade of it has been very much increased the establishment of an east india company here by the emperor has also contributed not a little to render it famous the maritime powers endeavored to frighten him out of this establishment and it is somewhat extraordinary how these powers could have had the modesty to push this matter in the manner they did for why the emperor should not have the liberty to form what establishments he pleased in a seaport in his own dominions is much more than any of the english or dutch memorials could give a satisfactory reply to  it is estimated that the english smugglers alone bring to the amount of  00000 livres monthly into this town they bring too ready money and therefore the ostenders are content with small profits for their brandy tobacco tea gauzes laces wine etc  this town is now inhabited by men of all nations where as much english is heard as french or flemish surrounded with the sea they have no good water the harbor however is crowded with shipping which shows it to be a place of great trade  the county of namur is nearly surrounded by the bishopric of liege and the duchy of brabant its extent from north to south is about six german miles and nearly as much from east to west this country is very mountainous and woody its principal riches consists in iron which is here prepared into steel and worked up in great quantities in the level country is a great deal of corn land the meuse which runs through the country and receives into it the sambre at namur tends much to the fertility of the soil and to the advantage of the country in general from its navigation  namur the capital of the country is a large and rich town seated between two mountains with a strong castle several forts and a bishops see this city was besieged by king william in      who took it in the sight of an army of  00000 french though there was  0000 men in garrison  the flemings says reisbec are the most extraordinary compound of slothfulness and industry stupidity and acuteness activity and cowardliness goodness of heart and treachery that can be well conceived an englishman once said of them they have the impudence of the french without their pleasantry the pride and bigotry of the spaniards without their sense of honor the ferocity and harshness of the dutch without their punctuality the debauchery of the germans without their integrity and as to their bodies they are blocks from which the carver attempted to make englishmen but could not cut them out the picture is in general just as these inhabitants of the netherlands are an assemblage of all these nations but what they are most conspicuous for is want of honor you must have agreements in writing in all the common transactions of life you are in danger of first being overcharged and then carried into a court of justice by every workman of whom you bespeak a piece of work if you do not put down your agreement in black and white  with respect to their bodies they and the saxons are most like the germans described by tacitus their bodies are of a very unwieldy make and ad impetum valida what too tacitus says of the old germans that they can bear neither hunger nor thirst nor heat nor cold nor yet any long work is true of them in the imperial armies they are accounted good partisans but are never put to regular service without extreme necessity they have a great abhorrence of discipline and look upon it as a severe punishment to be subject to the rules of service if their robberies and maraudings are not overlooked they will not last out a campaign in short it is only in action that they show themselves at all as soldiers  except spain italy and portugal there is no country so overloaded with monks as the austrian netherlands there are in many towns forty or fifty convents several prelatures are worth  00000 guilders  000l ayear if you divide the income of the country into four parts one will be found to belong to the priesthood one to the nobility one to the sovereign and one to the people the bigotry and intolerance of the inhabitants are beyond all description and is a mavelous contrast to the corruption of their manners  respecting their manufactures they have not a single one comparable to what they were formerly that of lace is flourishing but not near so considerable as formerly and the same observation is applicable to those of fine linen and tapestry indeed the attention given to manufacturers in every country of europe cannot but have drawn much from the old fabric long established no article of manufacture is found in flanders which is not strongly rivalled by some neighbor or other this with the internal mischiefs resulting from freedoms of corporate towns cramping the workmen is very prejudicial to all industry in these provinces  notwithstanding these impediments the fabrics of austrian provinces are by no means inconsiderable the towns are thick and all of them have some manufacture or other their linens laces stockings caps cloth druggets carpets etc are all considerable employing great numbers of hands and bringing much money into the country  the dress of the peasants of this country is like that of french flanders and what we so often see in the pictures of teniers the women wear a kind of french nightcap with a plaited border gold earrings a gold cross hanging from their neck a jacket and petticoat the petticoat short the jacket laced before and slippers some wear a black bib and short black apron they never wear a hat but when abroad throw over their heads about four yards of black stuff like a veil the better class of women wear camblet hoods abroad and long cloaks of the same  the mans dress is better described by the plate  where a young man has conducted his sweetheart to the house of a villagedoctor for a remedy she having complained of being ill as this man looked into the cause of complaints by the urine of his patients she took a bottle of her urine with her little conceived that on examining it he would have discovered that she was with child and which she would never had her lover the last man in the world to have been made acquainted with  having now gone through the different circles of germany and spoke of every material place as fully as our reader we trust will think necessary we will proceed to a description of the united provinces first recapitulating and making some general remarks on the whole of germany together  flemings   chap xi review of germany the germans are in general tall robust and well made of a fair complexion and regular features their women in particular are very handsome and excel those of most other countries they never use paint or foreign ornaments to embellish their persons their apparel is exceedingly modest but very rich and they are said to be remarkably fond of jewels they are more obsequious to their husbands than those of other nations many of them not even sitting at table with them and none of them taking the upper hand of them they are also for the most part well educated and extremely fond of music but not very talkative  the people of germany have a degree of superstition among them beyond that of other nations that will sometimes lead them into the most desperate acts the following from chisul is one of the many stories that could be brought to evince this truth he was at vienna about forty years since and had the opportunity of seeing the decollation of a woman whose head the executioner struck off at one blow as she sat in a chair levelled against the back part of her neck with a twohanded stroke and a broad twoedged sword at these executions there assist as in italy about twenty persons of an order called the confraternity of the dead habited in black with masks broad hemmed hats and mourning staves they are a fixed society composed of citizens of the middle rank on whom their confession impose it as a piece of penance to assist incognito on these occasions but most remarkable was the fact and behavior of the criminal who was about twentysix years old and in the absence of her husband then three years imprisoned at presburg had admitted the embraces of a young man whom she passionately loved but at last discovered was going to be married to another woman after the most earnest but fruitless endeavors to dissuade him from his purpose she invited him to walk with her one morning beyond the favorita where in a bye place she enticed him to kiss her and at that moment took her opportunity and shot him in the head this done she immediately resigned herself to justice revealed the whole fact and implored her speedy dispatch that so she might have his company in the other world without whom she could not live in this she walked with a fresh and undaunted countenance to the place of sentence which though before designed and notified accordingly is never formally pronounced till the time of execution from thence she returned to the place of her death sat down in the chair and received the stroke without ever moving her body changing her countenance or dreading the blow she was to feel  at these executions they often catch the blood of the criminal as good against the falling sickness it is from similar superstitions that the people so frequently murder infants at hamburg in order to procure a capital punishment tired of their lives and dreading the idea of selfmurder  though the germans in general are of large stature yet it has been observed their spirit is not equal to their bulk they are generally very goodnatured and free from malice and subtlety the peasants are laborious sincere honest and hospitable as are likewise the merchants and tradesmen who are withal very complaisant  hospitality is a peculiar characteristic of the germans and it is a virtue they derive from their ancestors for julius caesar informs us that in his time their houses were open to all men that they thought it an injustice to affront a traveller and even looked upon it as a piece of religion to protect those who came under their roof a single letter of recommendation is sufficient to procure a person an agreeable reception among them which can hardly be said of the inhabitants of any other country their civility extends so far as to introduce a stranger directly into their societies or assemblies they are remarkable also for their bravery and love of military glory in which they rival if not surpass most other nations  the germans are frequently represented as dull and heavy but those who characterize them thus have seldom any knowledge of them but what they borrow from the french who hardly ever allow wit or sense in any other nation than their own to judge of their intellects by their improvements in mechanic arts we should never charge a people with heaviness and stupidity to whom we are indebted for so many useful and valuable discoveries they have not indeed the same vivacity but they surpass the french in application and judgment upon the restoration of learning they distinguished themselves early in the different branches of literature  their first reformers luther melanchthon camerarius and others were most of them men of eminent erudition few other nations surpass either their men of letters or even their mechanics in application this made an italian say by way of joke expressive of their assiduity that the understanding of a german was not in his brain but in his back printing is encouraged here to a fault no person being admitted to any degree in their universities who has not published at least one disputation  in regard to baths and mineral fountains it is a question if there are so many in all europe as in germany they reckon above a thousand springs of acid waters alone some hot some cold and others that are both hot and cold at different times  germany is likewise famous for that sort of earth called terra sigillata it is a kind of hard earth with white yellow and red veins and said to be an antidote against all sorts of poisons  traveling is cheaper in germany than in most parts of europe but the accommodations on the roads between the great towns are very indifferent both with respect to diet and lodging in the houses we seldom see a fire except in their kitchens their rooms being heated by stoves one thing is very peculiar in their bedfurniture they use no blankets nor quilts but lay one featherbed cased in linen like a pillow and another underneath covered with a sheet between these two the germans sleep traveling in many parts of germany particularly where the roads are sandy is very tedious the postilions not going above three english miles an hour it is usual for those persons who travel post through germany and have no carriage of their own to purchase one for that purpose which may generally be met with in any of the frontier towns on very easy terms as the carriages at the post houses in germany and which the postmasters are obliged to furnish if required have frequently no covering to them they are in every respect like an english wagon built on a small scale to hold about six persons the covered carriages occasionally to be found at the posthouses and those purchased by common travelers are like our oldfashioned phaetons the ordinary postwaggon which answers to our stagecoach travels night and day for days together it goes between forty and fifty english miles in fourandtwenty hours and is in appearance like an english narrowwheeled wagon only something lighter formerly none of them had coverings at present most of them have but not all  germany including silesia is something larger than france it contains about twelve thousand square miles the soil varies very much in different parts a great part of it however is very highly cultivated the immense masses of rocks in the southern parts of austria and bavaria and the sands of the north which take in nearly the whole of lower saxony with brandenburg pomerania and the north of westphalia are not capable of such a high degree of cultivation as the upper parts of germany but this would be a great advantage if the interests and welfare of the whole were common the mountains in the south contain metals of all kinds in prodigious quantities and the sands in the northern parts produce hemp flax and wool with excellent timber in abundance for the building of ships  bohemia moravia silesia austria bavaria and the countries about the rhine the austrian netherlands and part of upper saxony furnish corn cattle wine and all the prime necessaries of life in such quantities as are not only sufficient to supply germany but even for exportation  in short germany is the only country that is independent of all the world and supplied with all the necessaries and convenience of life which a large and flourishing state requires for its support or stands in need of for its defense france says reisbec is deficient of wood and cattle particularly horses the most necessary metals and linen and russia is obliged to import wine wood horses and various other articles but germany has every thing which these two very powerful countries produce and a superfluity besides of what they stand in need  it is difficult to estimate the population of germany some countries as for instance upper austria have  000 souls in every square mile magdeburg minden brunswick and many others have   00 on the contrary the hanoverian dominions brandenburg pomerania and mecklenburg with many others have not more than  000 inhabitants on every square mile reckoning therefore   00 inhabitants on an average for every square mile will give twentyfive millions for the whole country which is nearly the number they are estimated by the late king of prussia in his treatise of german literature and which says reisbec seems to come nearest the truth the manifesto which the empress of russia presented to the court of vienna on account of the last disturbances about bavaria contains these remarkable words it is the interest of all the powers of europe to take care that the balance of germany be not disturbed for if it should be its internal strength and situation may enable it to destroy the peace of europe  this extensive country has not as yet acquired the degree of cultivation of which it is capable it is not even so highly cultivated as france the peace of hubertsburger is its era of cultivation since that period agriculture and industry have been universal it at once exerted all its strength to fill up the gaps which had been made by the destructive war of thirty years the very partition of the country into so many different states prejudicial as it is to the exertion of power for the purpose of foreign conquests has been of advantage to its internal cultivation at present the first princes in germany contend with each other who shall make the greatest improvements in the administration of justice in the system of education and in their general police for the promotion of agriculture and commerce with as much eagerness as they formerly contended for a rivalship in pomp and external magnificence in no country is there now so thorough a conviction of a value of men and of their different occupations and how to improve them to the utmost advantage as in germany  with respect to legislation and the true interest of a country there has been a benevolent light spread in most parts of this empire which not only points out their deficiencies but encourages the princes and their servants to fill them up without doubt germany as well as the rest of europe is much indebted to the king of prussia the first practical philosopher in modern times who has been seen on a throne it was this prince who began the glorious revolution which has made such changes in germany during the last twenty years he taught his neighbors that the interests of princes and their subjects were the same he began to take off the veil which was thrown over administration finally he subdued the tyrants among the nobility and priests who fattened on the substance of the citizen and peasant military as his government may appear to superficial observers it is to that alone germany is so indebted for a peace of fiveandtwenty years which she had not known for many centuries before and in the course of which she first began to feel what she really was  the peculiar turn of the germans seems to be philosophy they are distinguished from all the nations of europe for cool and just judgments united with extreme industry they were the first who threw a light on mathematics and general physics they next darted through theology history and finally legislation with the same philosophic spirit the prize of wit they will do well to leave to other nations for which they will ever contend in vain  if germany could make itself one great people if it was united under one governor if the present interests of a single prince were not often in opposition to the general welfare of the whole if all the members of the empire were so well compacted into one body that the superfluous sap of the one could circulate and invigorate all the rest how much greater steps toward cultivation might not the country then make but germany would then give laws to all europe how powerful are the two houses of austria and brandenburg even as things now are the greatness of whose strength consists in their german possessions and yet who do not possess half or even the best parts of this country though the character of the germans be not so brilliant as that of other nations still it is not destitute of its peculiar excellencies the german is a man of the world he lives under every sky and conquers every natural obstacle to his happiness his industry is inexhaustible poland hungary russia the english and dutch colonies are much indebted to german emigrants even the first states in europe owe great part of their knowledge to germany rectitude is also an almost universal characteristic of the people of this country neither are the manners of the inhabitants in the lesser cities by any means so corrupt as those of france and other countries it is owing to this circumstance that the country is so well peopled notwithstanding the great emigrations in short frugality on the part of the protestants and frankness on that of the catholics are grand brilliant and natural characteristics  the seven united provinces map of the dutch republic  a description of the seven united provinces of the low countries from le febure marshal hanway busching sherlock peckham northey brown reisbec etc etc chap i of the country in general the united netherlands are bounded by the german ocean on the north by westphalia on the east by austrian brabant on the south and by the english channel toward the west these provinces are seven in number holland zealand utrecht guelderland overyssel groningen and friezland the name of the netherlands which included the dutch austrian and french in all appearance takes its rise from the sittuation of these countries as considered with respect to germany and implies the nether or lower germany the whole of the seven united provinces includes about     square geographical miles the air is moist and unhealthy the winter sets in about october and even in the month of may there is often scarce any appearance of spring in summer the heats are often more excessive than in the south of france or even in italy sometimes the extremes of heat and cold are even felt in the same day  here are all manner of tame fowl as in england and of the wild sort the stork about the bigness of a heron is the most remarkable this bird builds his nest on the top of their chimnies in most of the towns and villages and through a national superstition is never destroyed they take their flight with their young ones about the middle of august and as is conjectured retire into africa or some other warm country and return in february there are prodigious quantities of wild geese herons ducks and other waterfowl which cover the marshes of the low countries every winter they have likewise plenty of partridges snipes quails pigeons hares and rabbits but none of those wild beasts which abound in the german forest such as bears wild boars and wolves foxes they have in great numbers their seas lakes canals and rivers abound in fish of all kinds except oysters of which there are very few  the whole country is full of morasses which however are not without their advantages yielding good turf for fuel and in some parts they are reckoned so secure a defense for the state on the side of germany that the draining of them is prohibited by law  these morasses however joined with the low situation of the country near the sea occasion fogs and frequent rains which are more particularly brought on by the westerly winds that prevail in these parts with great violence the general distempers of the inhabitants are the gout and scurvy colds and rheumatisms are also very common and in the fenny parts near the sea where the mud during the ebb emits putrid effluvia continual vomitings are very frequent it is the dampness of the climate that accustoms the inhabitants to smoking for both men and women of a certain age are seldom seen without their pipes and spitting pots  the land is for the most part level and in many places lies even lower than the sea for which reason it is not only fenced against its inundations by dykes and dams at a prodigious expense but likewise for draining the water from the fenny parts there have been innumerable ditches cut from which the water so drained is conveyed by windmills into canals and from thence by means of sluices into the rivers these dykes and canals give the country a very singular appearance and being planted with rows of trees willow and others interspersed with gardens and pleasant houses make it very convenient as well as delightful to travelers the barks which are drawn by horses set out every day in summer at certain hours to go from one place to another as a great part of the country consists of heath and sands it does not afford a sufficient subsistence for the inhabitants nor can all the industry of agriculture draw from it as much grain as is necessary for home consumption but this again is amply compensated by its resources of trade and navigation which enable the dutch not only to brew good beer and distill brandy from the corn they import but likewise to export great quantities afterward of both on the other hand the rich meadows and pastures make grazing very profitable by which the inhabitants are supplied with milk butter and cheese and the exports of the two latter amount to very large sums the texel cheeses being famous all over the world in holland too the breeding of sheep is very considerable and admits of further improvements as under proper regulations a million of sheep might be fed in that province the wool of these sheep is also reckoned very fine several places likewise yield tobacco and zealand is famous for its madder culinary plants these provinces have in abundance and in some parts of them there is great plenty of fruit the principal fuel is turf and pitcoal the latter of which comes from england wood being very scarce and dear there is but little of it used every piece of timber worked up in these countries whether for building or for exportation is brought from abroad in many places they boil salt from the sea water the country of zutphen yields iron in short nature affords so little that is valuable here that the inhabitants owe both the necessaries and comforts of life to their extensive commerce with foreign countries  the principal rivers are the rhine the meuse and the scheldt the first of these rises in germany and taking its course through the duchy of cleves enters the netherlands at fort schenk there it divides into two branches the most considerable of which after passing by nimeguen runs into the meuse the other branch after again subdividing into smaller branches loses itself in the canals and in one or two lesser rivers  the maese forms the boundary between geulderland and brabant opposite to dort this river divides into two branches one branch runs by rotterdam and the other takes a different course they afterward meet again and this river which is very wide at its mouth then discharges itself in the ocean at brill on this river which rises in burgundy and runs through the principality of liege there was formerly a very considerable traffic but the several sovereigns through whose dominions it takes its course having laid heavy tolls on all vessels as they passed through their territories this trade is now very much on the decline  the fishery in the several streams rivers and lakes though very considerable serves only for home consumption but that of the northsea is very productive it is divided into the greater and the lesser by the former is to be understood that carried on along the coasts especially on the doggersand or doggersbank between england and jutland on which there are caught cod haddock turbots whitings soles and other sea fish the cod caught here is either carried fresh and alive to market or else is salted up at sea and thus forms a branch both of foreign and domestic commerce the great fishery is that of herrings from which the dutch reap immense profits for if it may not as formerly be termed the golden mine of holland yet it still yields a comfortable subsistence to at least  0000 families the season for catching the herrings along the coast of england and scotland is from the   th of june to the   th of november the vessels employed in this fishery are called busses and carry from twentyfive to thirty lasts each last is  0 bushels which one with another sell for about one hundred and twenty guilders some years back no less than fifteen hundred such vessels have been known to sail from the ports of holland whereas at present the number seldom exceeds two hundred though the estimates of the profits arising from the herringfishery differ as the profits themselves do in different years yet it is computed in a good year that the neat gain to the proprietors of the busses amounts to two millions of guilders each guilder  0d english the salting and curing of herrings which the dutch first learnt about the end of the fourth century from a fisherman of flanders and in which no nation has equalled them ever since has made the dutch herrings universally preferred before all others further the whale fishery at greenland spitzbergen nova zembla etc employs annually about two hundred and fifty sail of dutch ships  the united netherlands are well cultivated and extremely populous they contain no less than     cities and towns with   00 villages some of which are very considerable and about two millions of inhabitants but the most populous and the best cultivated is the province of holland which has not its equal in the universe having six or more large cities within eight or ten miles of each other the neatness of the houses and of the canals which are cut through the streets and planted with trees as also the cleanliness of the streets give the towns of this province a more agreeable appearance than is usually to be met with in other countries and for pretty villages no part of the globe can be put in competition with north holland  these countries according to some writers have been most of them gained from the sea others on the contrary are of opinion that a great part of them have been lost by inundations and both of them are in the right for their seas and rivers appear in many places to be above the land at high water and kept out only by prodigious banks and there have been inundations even in the memory of man which have laid great tracks of land under water the tops of steeples or other high buildings have been seen upon their coasts at low water sir william temple remarks that from the zuidersee never having been mentioned by any roman writers it is reasonable to suppose that it was formed by some great inundation of the sea breaking in between the texel and other islands and this is the more probable from the great shallowness of that sea and the flatness of its sands over the whole extent of it other changes he supposes to have happened in the face of these countries by the sands which have gathered at the mouths of their great rivers abovementioned  these sands are supposed to have been collected from the westerly winds which generally blow on these shores three parts of the year and are more violent than the easterly ones which usually bring calm weather and frosts  the zuidersee is about seventy miles in length and half as much in breadth but so very shallow as has been observed that a passage over it is more dangerous than a voyage in the bay of biscay and such is the violence and rage of the sea when the wind blows a storm at northwest that if it happens to be a spring tide their strongest dykes sometimes give way an inundation happened in    0 by which seventytwo villages were swallowed up and  0000 people destroyed the banks of these rivers are also sometimes broken down by shoals of ice and landfloods from the shallowness of the water at neap tides at the mouth of this sea they are obliged to unload their vessels before they come in and bring in their vessels in cradles  reisbec observes that there is no solid earth in any part of holland and that even on the borders of the duchy of cleves there are evident marks of this countrys having been formed like the egyptian delta with this difference that the soil on the banks of the nile is more fruitful parts of brabant have likewise been formed by the scheld maese and other rivers at a great distance from the coast in flanders under the good earth may be seen dry sand and under this again large layers of good earth as if the rivers and sea had by turns deposited their sand and their mud the whole coast of germany is of the same kind as far as the elbe throughout all this district says reisbec there is no solid ground  the sea forms boundaries to herself which she never passes but in cases of extreme necessity her playful waves have made the downs which reach from calais to the texel and protect the land which is in some places lower than the surface of the sea but when a north or northwest wind puts her into a fit of anger she overthrows in an instant that which with the help of the neighboring rivers she has been building for many centuries they tell you with a degree of confidence that a ship of  00 tons burden was blown over the bank at high water between calais and gravelines on the shore the bank twenty feet higher than the surface of the water  the sea of haerlem grows wider every day threatens to break the dykes between leyden and haerlem and make a perfect island of north holland this sea is sixteen miles long and nearly eight miles broad in the last century the sea demolished a great part of the island in which dordrecht is situated and  0000 people perished by this accident  dreadful as the sea is to the main land she is still a more formidable enemy to the islands which constitute the province of zealand but what she executes on the continent by violent storms she undertakes here by craft and cunning most of these islands are lower than the surface of the sea the inhabitants have in consequence attempted to secure themselves by very expensive dykes or banks  the sea is perpetually undermining them and washing away the earth by degrees in many places they are already quite naked this compels the inhabitants to build other walls behind their dams which expecting the same fate must in time leave the whole to the mercy of the enemy  nor are the inhabitants of the middle of the country in a better situation the territories about nimeguen and arnheim the most beautiful and most fruitful in all holland will in time be subdued by the rhine in many districts about betuve the sand is already so high that at every swell the river is driven violently to the opposite shore this will repeatedly happen till it has finally broke itself a new bed and covered with water all that is now ploughed land or the site of villages and hamlets the many canals which have been made to receive part of the waters of these rivers are by no means sufficient to break their force  these canals and the continual digging of turf entirely divest this country of all security in the direct line between rotterdam and amsterdam there is dyke upon dyke all these hollows have been occasioned by digging away the turf most of them are so deep that it is impossible to draw the waters from them into the canals which are on a level with the surface of the sea what a ruin must then take place if once the waters of the neighboring rivers break in upon them or endeavor to open a way through them  in short no dutchman can promise his children a durable habitation except the inhabitants of guelderland which is nothing but sand and those of overyssel and drenthe  countries which are almost nothing but morasses and heaths and the habitations of fevers colds and catarrhs  though this country is so famous for its trade and its multitude of shipping yet there is scarce a good harbor on the coast the best are flushing helveotsluys and rotterdam as for amsterdam there cannot be any where a more incommodious haven being seated in so shallow a water that very few ships can get into it except at high tide  every one knows that husbandry is not the great national object in holland but trade and manufactures their territory is small in comparison with their population so that an application to trade is necessary to the existence of the inhabitants the quantity of land fit for tillage was originally under such peculiar circumstances that the wealth which flowed in from trade and manufactures could alone render the practice of any husbandry advantageous the soil is of two sorts very good or very bad and so unhappily situated are the dutch that the former is only to be preserved by those vast monuments of their industry  the banks which preserve all the lower and best lands from being overflowed for the higher tracks of friezland guelderland etc contain in general a very great proportion of waste and poor sandy soil this proportion is greater than is commonly imagined and was so when the republic was undoubtedly in a more flourishing situation than at present davenant tells us that in      they had eight millions of english acres which let with houses and tenements at four millions sterling now this being only ten shillings an acre in a country very full of cities must very much reduce that ten shillings per acre probably to six shillings which shows that this country of immense wealth and trade though they secured the soil by banks yet did but little in raising the value of land grass lands indeed let here at very high prices  whatever receives most encouragement from the state is sure most to prosper trade being the great object in holland manufactures are very much attended to these have consequently prospered but as to agriculture and the landed interest they make it totally subservient to every other for the importation of corn and other provisions is ruinous to the farmer but is not regarded here because it is an object of commerce  this conduct however is suitable to the situation and interests of the republic nature and a fortune almost as ragged has crammed them into a neglected marsh which nothing but an industry like theirs could have made the habitation of an independent nation in such a state trade navigation fisheries and manufactures were their principal support in their first naval expeditions against the spaniards these therefore they wisely engaged in with their utmost ardour but as to agriculture of what benefit could it be to a nation that had not land enough to render themselves independent by it  necessity drove the hollanders to trade but had a genius more extensive than that of lycurgus or of montesquieu dictated to them a choice it would have been what necessity compelled industry will ever make the greatest figure in those spots that deny every thing to idleness a numerous people in such situations must either be industrious or starve  the great success of the dutch in trade has made other nations ambitious to imitate them but in this there appears too great a neglect of those essential distinctions which are often found between different countries france england sweden and russia have very considerable territories consequently they ought to pay a much greater attention to agriculture than this republic whose land is contemptible compared a dutch market with theirs but all these powers particularly france and england have sacrificed agriculture to their commerce this has been very bad policy for that conduct which may be very beneficial for a territory of eight millions of acres may be highly improper for one of twelve times the number  in the agriculture of holland the richness of their pastures is to be noticed and the great attention they pay to the management of their cattle they are very fond of the culture of tobacco and of madder of madder in particular they raise enough not only for their own consumption which in their linen and cotton manufactures is very great but also for exportation  chap ii of the province of holland we will now speak of the several provinces the province of holland the most considerable of the seven provinces and in many respects equal to the other six is bounded by the zuider sea on the north by utrecht on the east by brabant on the south and by the british ocean on the west extending about eighty miles in length in some places forty in breadth and in others not above twenty it contains an area of about  00000 acres this province is usually divided into north and south holland south holland contains all that country between zealand and brabant and that arm of the sea which usually goes by the name of the river y and north holland reaches from this river to the ocean  it lies in general very low and in some parts even lower than the sea from which it is secured by dykes and intersected by innumerable ditches and canals through which at the time of the ebb the water is carried off on the coasts of the north seas the sandhills supply the place of dykes the air is foggy and unwholesome the greatest part of the province consists of fine pasture lands the principal occupation of the country people is making butter and cheese and they accordingly keep a great number of milch cows this province stands in need of all the art in the world to embellish and make it habitable the air in winter is almost one continued fog nothing is to be heard on the plains but the cries of sea gulls plovers swallows crows ducks geese and swans those birds which take refuge in the woods are seldom known here of all the provinces none is so much exposed to the fury of the ocean and the inundations which happen from time to time are terrible the first which history mentions formed the gulf called the zuider sea before that time friezland was separated only by a small lake  in several parts of the country the rivers which run through this country are joined by navigable canals which open a cheap communication between the several towns and villages of this populous province as by means of the trechscuyts a passenger goes from place to place on these canals at fixed hours and at very cheap rates goods are likewise sent by the same conveyance which is an unspeakable convenience to the inland trade  this province abounds in the noblest improvements and is populous beyond comparison with any of the other provinces containing    towns eight boroughs and  00 villages and the number of its inhabitants on a careful estimate is computed at above a million of inhabitants which is one half of the population of the whole country the houses in the towns are mostly built of bricks and for cleanliness in them no country in the world comes up to holland in north holland in particular neatness and ornament are carried to an astonishing pitch in that province there are villages in which the rooms and furniture of the houses are clean and bright beyond imagination the houses themselves as also the floors and every wooden utensil both within and without even to the very gates near the roads and the posts in the pastures against which the cows rub themselves as also the trunks of the trees being painted over the chimnies likewise with the cowstalls both on the floor and on the sides are kept in the greatest neatness in these elegant cowstalls families themselves reside in order to spare their dining rooms the streets too are paved with brick and very carefully washed and strewed with a fine white sand  it is in this province more than in any other that the diversion of skaiting is followed from the multiplicity of canals which intersect it the dutch who in other respects are an indolent set of people are passionately fond of this exercise and are the best skaiters in europe some of them will skait fifteen miles in an hour the ladies are drawn along in traineaux a gentleman sitting behind them and guiding the horse there is no year however in which some accident does not happen from these aquatic amusements  the dutch have carried their ingenuity so far as to contrive boats with sails fixed on skaits or sledges to glide along on the ice but these carriages are more for curiosity than real use as being by no means safe they move after the rate of fifteen leagues an hour and without reckoning up the other inconveniences to their being put in practice the resistance of the air alone would be sufficient to take any ones breath away in traveling with such expedition it is asserted that people have gone in this manner from amsterdam to sardam in seven minutes  a distance of seven miles  plan of the city of amsterdam a the se house b the post office c the exchange d the theater e east india house f dowarehouses g dowharf h dodock i

are amsterdam rotterdam leyden haerlem delft dort and the hague of these we shall speak in their turns  amsterdam is the capital of this province and of the united netherlands it is situated on the little river amstel which runs through the city and falls into that arm of the sea called the y that lies on the north side of the town and which forms a large harbor amsterdam is the greatest trading city of europe and though by reason of the shallowness of the passage which leads up to it from the zuider sea it might be thought but badly situated for a seaport as ships of burden must be lightened to pass through it and afterward wait for an easterly or northwest wind to go into the north sea yet it is advantageous in this respect that goods can be easily carried backwards and forwards from all the other towns of this province and with a fair wind it is but a few hours passage to or from all the ports of northholland friesland overyssel and guelderland  the ground is naturally marshy consequently the buildings at amsterdam are founded on oaken piles which made the facetious erasmus say that in his country vast multitudes of people lived on the tops of trees the middle of the town is intersected by a great number of navigable canals which while they conduce to the pleasantness and cleanliness of the place are at the same time a great convenience to trade but in hot weather they emit foetid effluviae which would be still worse were not the water kept continually in motion by two large watermills and a horsemill in dark evenings these canals used to cost many people their lives till these dangers were happily remedied by illuminating the streets and sides of the canals compared however with the streets of london they are at present but miserably lighted up these canals divide the town into a multitude of islands which are joined with each other by means of stone and wooden bridges this town itself forms a semicircle on the y being fortified on the landside with ramparts and regular bastions this side of the town may likewise be laid under water on this river is a most delightful walk commanding a fine prospect  amsterdam says marshall appears to no great advantage to a stranger on his first coming to it except he enters the city through the heeregraft or the keysergraft streets that of haerlem is very long but the sluices in the canal hurt the effect of it the two former have also canals in the middle of them and are very noble streets but like most in holland are planted with trees some of the canals are very broad and make a fine appearance but the houses in general are not erected in a grand style on the contrary very many of them disgrace the areas before them this though an evil is an evil to be found in all the cities of europe and especially in london in squares this great city appears to be very deficient they are few in number and have nothing in them striking that called the dam is the principal but it is very irregular the houses like all those in flanders are in the old gothic style with pediment roofs and being generally out of the perpendicular are prevented from falling by iron cramps in the form of the capital s to a passenger in the street by hanging over on both sides they seem to threaten his life  though amsterdam cannot boast many fine squares like several other capital cities yet it contains some public buildings that strike the spectator with astonishment at their magnificence  the building which is incomparably beyond all others is the stadthouse the dimensions of the front as given by several authors is     feet the depth     and the height     feet besides a small cupola it was begun in      it is built upon wooden piles like masts of ships rammed down as thick as they can stand there are no less than   000 of them which are said to have cost  00000l there being a great quantity of ironwork employed in the foundation to keep the piles together the superstructure is said to have cost twice as much the expense of this edifice however has been variously computed with such an amazing difference as from  00000l to  000000l the latter must certainly be computed according to the different value of money then and now but even so it must very much exceed the truth the former is in all probability much nearer the reality the front of this building has nothing of taste or elegance it is a heavy pile which strikes the spectator with that idea which is raised by the grandeur of its magnitude the inside is finished in a very noble style considering the purpose to which it is applied such as a prison a bank the seat of the courts of justice the sessionsrooms guardrooms etc the three statues of brass representing justice fortitude and plenty at the entrance and the woman in marble in relievo supporting the city arms are most exquisite pieces the tower above with the clock and its admirable chimes the atlas with the globe on his shoulders as also all the other beauties and ornaments of sculpture and painting are scarce to be equalled in europe the floors walls and pillars are in general of marble and the roofs finely carved painted and gilt and many of the apartments are adorned with very fine paintings by the best flemish masters in the second story is a great magazine of arms and over that great reservoirs of water with tubes to conduct it into every apartment and another precaution which has been taken against fire is lining the chimnies with copper the top of the cupola gives a view of the city and neighboring country in great perfection commanding the whole circumference which with the canals and the immense number of ships continually going in and coming out of the harbor altogether form a very noble prospect  the entrance to this building is through seven small doors but the want of a large door suitable to the grandeur of the building is a designed omission the seven doors in number and uniformity representing the seven united provinces  the bank of amsterdam which is the lower apartment is famous all over the world the great treasure said to be locked up in the vaults of this house are the sums received in purchase not of bank stock but of banktransfer this is not like that of london a bank that circulates notes in return for cash on the contrary it is a bank of deposit whoever pays money here has it entered in the bankbooks but can never again demand it when he wants to raise money he offers his bank credit for sale which is transferred in a moment and any sums of money may always be raised upon it  the treasure in the bank in amsterdam is an entire secret to all but those who have the management of it the value has been computed or rather guessed at and supposed to be from  0 to  0 millions sterling but to name any particular sum must at the best be but guessing at random it is however a very astonishing system of accumulation for it is a wellknown fact that money once paid into the bankbooks can never be demanded and further that money is perpetualy paid in here therefore there seems to be a constant ingress but no egress consequently a treasure which seems perpetually increasing  marshal says that though by the regulations of the bank no money can be paid to any person that demands it in consequence of his credit on the bank yet it is certain the bank lends both money and credit to the brokers who make it their business to buy bank credit and give cash for it these people attend every morning between eleven and twelve before the stadthouse either to buy or sell bankcredit as occasion may offer  hanway who gives the best account of this bank does it in the following words as the bank of amsterdam receives only the best and purest coin or bullion the bankmoney bears a commission of   or   per cent if a person is desirous to raelise his bankcredit he disposes of it with greater facility than we sell bankstock here they make payments after the manner of the bank of venice viz by transferring in the books of the bank from the credit of one to the credit of another these transfers are made by the personal appearance of the transferror by his order for which there are printed forms or by virtue of his power of attorney though no money can be claimed again when once paid into the bank yet in cases of deposits the same identical gold and silver may be reclaimed by him who delivered it in for which purpose he has a permit renewable every six months otherwise to become invalid in which latter case the cash so delivered is blended with the common stock and transferable only in the manner already mentioned though this bank pays no interest yet it receives interest for the same loan to the east and west india companies the large sums of money lent to the dutch government are entirely independent of this bank the revenues of each respective province being engaged as a security for such sum  the great hall is a noble room indeed adorned on all sides with the finest marble pillars of the corinthian order but the floor of marble is the most surprising of all which is so laid as to represent without the addition of any other lines than the veins of the marble both the celestial and the terrestrial globes each of these marble maps as they are styled being twentytwo feet in diameter  below stairs are the prisons both for debtors and criminals with a guardchamber where the keys of the city are locked up every night the sovereign power of this city is lodged in    senators who continue members for life and when any of them die the remaining senators elect others in their room the people having no share in the nomination or choice the senate likewise elect the deputies to be sent to the states of holland and appoints the chief magistrates of the city who are said to resemble the lord mayor and aldermen of london the burgomasters are four in number three of which are chosen annually  the police of this city seems worthy of imitation notwithstanding its being the first trading city in the world and a conflux of all sorts of people it seldom happens that there are above one or two executions here in the course of the year what is more singular no person can be put to death without previously signing his own condemnation acknowledging his guilt and the justice of his sentence which is done with great form and ceremony in a room of the stadthouse exposed to the open air at two different times the number of debtors too is very inconsiderable every creditor here as in most parts of the continent is obliged to allow a maintenance to the person he imprisons proportionate to his station in life  the exchange is a large building and well adapted to the purpose but it is unornamented and not equal in architecture to that of london the contrivance of numbering the pillars in order to find a merchant the more readily is very convenient it was very imprudently built on a canal this circumstance set some wicked persons about sixty or seventy years since to endeavor to blow it up while the merchants were assembled for this purpose they procured a large quantity of powder and other combustibles which they placed under the bridge that goes over it a child however blew out the match which prevented the fatal effects that would otherwise have ensued as an acknowledgement for the preservation of such a number of the inhabitants all the children in amsterdam have the privilege of coming and playing in the exchange the first three days of the fair in the afternoon and of making as much noise as they please  the admiralty says marshal is the next public edifice that demands attention the size of it with its environs is very considerable it consists of three sides of a square the front being   0 feet long and the wings the same in the midst is the yard for building the arms and stores belonging to the ships are kept here in very great order the groundfloor is filled with cannon balls and the second contains the arms and cordage the third their sails public flags etc besides these here are many other curiosities of the naval kind which are worth viewing the dock is  0  feet long and contiguous to it are the houses for lodging the carpenters etc the order in which every thing is kept cannot fail of striking every one this building with its contents has been lately destroyed by fire  the east india house and arsenal are great buildings which much deserve viewing in the former the company hold their meetings and have very considerable magazines of all sorts of india goods the arsenal is  000 feet square every way it contains docks for building the ships and warehouses and stores for completely rigging them all in excellent order they have magazines of all sorts of naval stores in one they have many pieces of heavy artillery and in another more than  00 large anchors ready for use the two ropewalks are   000 feet long  these are the principal public buildings in this city but there are others which will attract the attention of travelers such as the works going forward in the harbors the sluices the bastions with each a windmill the bridges etc as to hospitals there are a great number of them but the architecture of the edifices is nothing it is however highly worthy of observation that all the poor of amsterdam and indeed of all the provinces are maintained by charity there being no poortax in any country in europe except england the same fund supports all the hospitals in which there are above twenty thousand people  at all the public inns and taverns and at those houses in which any public business is transacted there are poorboxes into which it is usual to put contributions from all sales auctions etc certain persons are also appointed to go and collect alms from time to time and at all the public festivals which are applied to the same use the theaters and places of amusement of every kind pay a third or a half of their gains for the like purpose and if this is not sufficient government makes good the remainder every person entering the gates of amsterdam after dark pays a penny to the poor but after a certain hour of the night eleven or twelve none can enter the city till the next morning  in all the towns of holland they take excellent precaution to force the idle to work they have a house of correction called a rasphouse in which they shut up the idle poor and vagrants that can work and maintain themselves but will not the employment they give them is to saw and rasp brazil wood in which if they are not expeditious they are severely beaten and for those who are lazy they have an admirable contrivance which is a cellar with a pump into which they let water so proportioned to the strength of the person that he shall be able with infinite labor in pumping it out to save himself from being drowned which fate those who are put there are by law doomed to suffer if they do not escape it by hard working and for such as are incorrigibly idle this labor is admirably adapted in these prisons they also put young men whose debauchery or extravagance threatens the ruin of their health and fortune and this is done at any time on the request of their parents or guardians women are likewise sometimes permitted to confine their husbands in these prisons on a complaint of their being extravagant it does not however appear that this is effected by virtue of any written law but through custom and ancient usage  it is observed of the hospitals in this country as well as of those in england that they resemble the palaces of princes more than the habitations of poor people there are houses also where a person may have his diet and lodging as long as he lives on the payment of a small sum of money in advance  as to churches the only one worthy of being mentioned is the new one dedicated to st catharine the ornamental parts of which are finished in a most capital manner the pulpit is carved in the richest style the chancel is parted off by a railing of corinthian brass the windows are likewise finely painted and the organ is the best in the low countries except that at haerlem and they say at amsterdam the best in the whole world it has a row of pipes designed to counterfeit a chorus of voices which it performs very badly there are fiftytwo whole stops besides the half ones with two rows of keys for the feet and three for the hands here is to be seen a most magnificent tomb of the brave admiral de ruyter his effigy lying at large with all sorts of trophies in marble sculpture and relievo with large inscriptions in one of the aisles of this church is another sumptuous monument erected to the memory of john van galen another of their admirals with a very fine inscription  this church however is not yet finished though it has been begun more than an hundred years ago the steeple was designed to have been much higher more than  000 piles have already been driven into the ground in an area of one hundred feet square as a foundation for it but still they thought the bogginess of the ground not sufficiently remedied for supporting so great a weight as this steeple would be if it were finished  the number of churches of the established religion in this great city does not exceed thirteen but several of them have two galleries one over the other and contain a prodigious number of people there are however upwards of fourscore romancatholic chapels besides a great number of others belonging to different sects of the protestants none of these however are permitted to marry according to their respective rites without the marriages being first solemnized before a magistrate nor any persons admitted to offices in the state but those of the presbyterian or established religion  it is observed that the jews of amsterdam live in more splendor than in any part of the world they reside in a peculiar quarter of the city resembling a little town and have two synagogues one not inferior to the best church in london and the other though not near so sumptuous exceeds any they have at rome or venice besides which they have schools in which they educate their youth in their own religion and language i went once says some writer into their synagogue where were about  000 men and boys with white silk hoods over their shoulders listening to two others who had but little resemblance to priests and who were explaining the laws at the lower end of the church at every period they were repeating their great ala or allalujah to which the rest did not seem very attentive  the manufactures carried on in this city are more numerous and considerable than at any other place in the seven provinces they weave all sorts of cloths woollens stuffs and silk gold and silver silks ribbons tapestry linen in large quantities etc all sorts of fabrics in leather with many in ivory and metals are likewise carried on here they have also a great variety of mills for sawing polishing etc their sailcloth and papermanufactories are likewise very considerable and the printing of books should not be forgotten they print in all languages here are great numbers of booksellers who it is thought employ twice the quantity of presses that work at london these books are exported to england and some to the southern parts of europe but vast numbers to all parts of germany denmark and the north  amsterdam can boast of no great antiquity it owes its origin to a few fishing villages and was first walled in about      its present number of inhabitants is computed by marshal at  00000 busching makes the number only  00000 the foreigners resorting hither from time to time likewise form a very considerable number  the air of this city says marshal is so bad and foggy that i can hardly believe the assertion of those who affirm it to be healthy it is surrounded entirely by the sea and by marshes the canals are very numerous and not always free from noxious exhalations the cleanliness indeed of the inhabitants is carried to as great a height as possible but this by no means remedies the evil for that eternal washing must add to the damps which are otherwise so unwholesome in this country the best part of their cleanliness is that exerted in keeping their canals clean but i must remark says he i saw no small neglect of this most essential object  the most useful of the four elements water with which the dutch are surrounded is not to be procured here fit for drinking without great difficulty what is generally used for this purpose is that which is had from the clouds they have likewise water which they procure from a small river the vecht some miles distant but even this is not very good  the dutch were formerly very attentive to have all their carriages placed on sledges and drawn only by one horse this was certainly a wise precaution considering that the whole city is on a foundation purely artificial on piles but this regulation is now but little attended to for there are at present a great number of coaches on wheels it is true they pay a very considerable tax which as the number of carriages increased has already been raised once or twice and amounts now to about seven pounds ayear but still as luxury increases coaches on wheels increase and the higher they are taxed some sensible people are of opinion the more they would increase  with respect to the sledges as it may be easily conceived if the body of a coach was conveyed through the streets of london on a sledge that the least irregularity in the surface of the pavement would render it liable to be overset it will not appear surprising that the man who guides the horse should walk by the side of the vehicle to prevent any such accident and if from the pavement not being level the carriage should incline toward him he keeps it up with his shoulders if on the other hand it inclines the contrary side there is a rope fastened to the edge of the top of the coach which he pulls toward him with all his might to prevent the carriage from oversetting on the other side this carriage is drawn with ropes by one horse the driver has a bucket of water fastened to the sledge and a mop with which he is continually wetting it but as marshal observes these carriages are getting very much into disuse they are however the only public vehicles to be met with in that city which are to be hired by the hour it may be supposed the prices of such carriages cannot be very extravagant there are carriages on wheels to be hired but their prices are extravagant and the permission of the burgomasters must be previously obtained  the government of this city is vested in about ninety persons who are elected from amongst the burghers of these thirtysix compose the council who represent the whole body of the people and are invested with supreme power  respecting trade this is the grand emporium not only of the united provinces but the center of all the commerce of europe for a general correspondence it much exceeds london but the gross amount of the trade of london far exceeds that of amsterdam two thousand sail of ships annually enter this port which must form a vast commerce the different branches of which shall be treated of hereafter  there are some very good collections of natural history drawings paintings and medals in this city which those who are amateurs generally go to view and which the possessors are always prepared to show there is in particular a very fine collection of pictures by the celebrated mr hope of amsterdam which all strangers of any rank never fail of going to see this gentleman is of scotch extraction a descendant of the hopeton family and supposed to be one of the richest and most extensive merchants in the whole world the compliment paid to him on the change at amsterdam is so great that it is never supposed to begin till he comes  the price of living in amsterdam for a stranger at a middling auberge is nearly as follows a florin or guilder a day that is  0d for the chamber breakfast with tea as in england costs ten stivers or tenpence the dinner with a pint of wine thirty stivers or half a crown supper the same  the beds consist of four or five mattresses with a very broad downbolster instead of pillow generally fitted into the side of a room like the cabinbed of a ship with a rope hanging down from the top to catch hold of in order to lift ones self up when we wish to rise comfort and convenience seem here to be studied but on account of a number of the mattresses they are four or five feet high from the floor and a young couple on their wedding night unless their blood is truly dutch would run the hazard of breaking their necks in truth they are fit only for the most sober sleepers some have sideboards to prevent the clothes falling off and the sleeper falling out  marshal gives a very different account of the expenses incident to a stranger at amsterdam for his diet and lodging but then it should be recollected that he was an englishman and the writer from whom the above extract was made a frenchman i was very fortunate in my quarters at amsterdam says marshal being recommended to a private family in trade for lodgings i dined for some days either at an ordinary where i paid to the amount of ten shillings for my dinner or at some merchants houses to whom i was recommended but afterward i boarded with the family who lived much better than i should have supposed any people would do who let lodgings their dinners were excellent and dressed in the french style but i paid says he twenty florins aweek for my lodgings and seventeen more for my board servant included this would be thought very dear in london he adds but owing to the difference of custom in the two cities board and handsome lodgings is not to be had in amsterdam for any price  coffeehouses are to be met with in this city the same as in london but their internal appearance is very shabby different foreign papers are to be met with in them but not upon that extensive scale as in london in most of them smoking is permitted which renders the smell of them at all times rather offensive they are much frequented by the middling class of germans and frenchmen who are everlastingly discussing the politics of europe with a selfsufficiency and volubility of speech that is almost incredible  the spillhouses must not be omitted which are a very singular establishment of the kind and not to be met with in any other town in europe these are publichouses licensed by the state for the reception of girls of the town both the girls who enter these houses and the persons who are the owners pay a tax to the state to these places people of character resort openly without fear or shame there is as little scandal in being seen in one of them as being seen at a playhouse or any other place of amusement the entertainments of these houses are music and dancing the nymphs of this place who are not engaged in dancing with their paramours are seated round the room and every stranger goes and talks to them if they are not previously engaged as long as be thinks proper and generally offers them wine and other refreshments as he would to persons he mixed with at an assembly they dance minuets and mattelots and every man who takes out a girl to dance pays sixpence to the music if any one chooses to retire with them there are small rooms adjoining furnished with a bed and other conveniences and if a man withdraws with his mistress he returns with her into the room and no more notice is taken of him than if he had only gone out to speak to a friend though the establishment of these houses was well meant they are seldom frequented but by sailors and the lower class of men and women the girls are generally dirty painted and patched the states are of opinion that if they did not indulge the people in this particular they should never be able to keep their wives and daughters chaste and therefore of two evils they choose the least  the houses in general are old fashioned and built as we have observed with pediment tops and those streets through which there is no canal are narrow one very singular circumstance has been remarked by travelers in these narrow streets that most of the houses stand out of the perpendicular and incline forward and this happens not only with many of the houses but even with the churches several of the steeples of which may be observed far from upright there are people in holland who will engage under a heavy penalty on being well compensated to set the steeples as erect as when they were first built the method they take is very simple it is merely to dig under the foundation of the opposite side of the building which never fails to restore it to its perpendicular  from amsterdam to utrecht is a fine broad canal and for the distance of    miles from the former city the banks are covered with countryhouses where the merchants of amsterdam regale themselves every sunday each house has a summer house built on the canal that will hold ten or a dozen people and in fine weather they are generally full of people smoking and drinking each person distinguishes his countryseat by some motto either in latin or dutch allusive to the happiness of a retired life painted on the outer gate their gardens are pretty but in the old taste parterres of flowers long narrow alleys some covered with vines etc with statues at the end their houses are covered with fruit trees but from a care not to injure the building a wooden frame is fixed against the house and the trees nailed against such frames there being no gravel in the country their walks are merely earth kept free from weeds most of the houses are painted white and windowframes and doors green plan of the city of rotterdam map of rotterdam and this contrast is picturesque and pleasing they are generally built close on the bank a sandy road only passing between the river and the canal  rotterdam next to amsterdam is the most considerable town in holland for largeness beauty of its buildings trade and riches it is situated at the confluence of the rivers rotter and maese it has its name from the former of these rivers which runs into it on the northwest side and dam signifying in dutch a fence against the waters this city says marshal is second to amsterdam alone and comes nearer to that famous emporium of trade than any port in england does to london the maese here is a very noble river and canals are cut from it through every part of the city which are so deep and broad that ships of above  00 tons load and unload directly into the quays and warehouses on the banks as smaller vessels do at amsterdam the sides of many of the canals are planted with tall trees which united with the masts and flags of the shipping and the houses form a very pleasing spectacle  rotterdam has greatly the advantage of amsterdam for convenience of commerce ships of large burden cannot go up to amsterdam without unloading but they may here come close to the merchants houses in winter both the maese and the texel are frozen up but in the maese the passage is open much sooner which is a great advantage in trade insomuch that  00 sail of british ships have been seen sailing out of this harbor at once when not a ship in the texel has been able to move add to this that the country about rotterdam is far more pleasant the air more healthy and the water better but the other being the seat of government counterbalances all these advantages and gives it infinitely a greater trade  ninetenths of the british trade with the united provinces center at this place which is owing to the advantage of its situation many shiploads of goods consigned for amsterdam are sent hither and go by canals to that city several hundred sail of british vessels are sometimes in this harbor at a time there is also a considerable share of the east india trade carried on here with very great magazines of their goods and a glass manufactory which works only for the east india ships i saw in it says marshal a vast quantity of toys done in enamel bowls cups saucers plates figures etc many of which were in a grotesque style and well executed these they told me met with a ready sale in the islands depending on the dutch empire in those regions  several of the streets are very spacious and well built heeren street is the finest the houses are built of hewn stones but the boompies is more agreeable lying along the maese the length more than half a mile it seems like a vast quay on one side is a row of lofty elms skirted by the river which is sometimes full of ships and on the other the street is bounded by very large and well built houses the best company in the city come here to walk in an evening there are only four churches in this city of the established religion and none of them worth notice but there is a large english chapel where the service of the church of england is performed by an english clergyman presented to it by the bishop of london the income about  00l a year the exchange is a very large and massive building which gives a good idea of the place  in the houses belonging to the merchants both of this city as well as of amsterdam all the best apartments are on the second floor the ground floors are used for offices on the firstfloors the families live on the second story are the best rooms and the garrets or upper stories serve for warehouses and as there are goods perpetually craning up into some or other of the warehouses it is not a little dangerous to walk along the streets of either of these cities in general they do not crane their goods up as in england by a wheel fixed in the warehouse but draw them by a horse whose harness is fixed to a rope wnich runs through the pulley of the crane and thus running a considerable length along the street draws up the goods  some of the merchants houses are very magnificent both here and at amsterdam for  000l sterling is no price for a good house and they pride themselves in oldfashioned furniture the rooms are lined with oilcloth some painted similar to our paper hangings and some with ordinary landscapes a glass luster generally hangs in their best room and turkey carpets cover them often of such dimensions as to be worth from thirty to a hundred pounds the rooms dado high are lined with wainscot and some with white marble this with the oilskin hangings renders them easy to be washed the maids are cleaning these and the windows of the house every day of the week the curtains and bedfurniture are always taken down and washed when the least soiled and of course though a dutch house may be damp it is remarkably clean and well kept  this city is very famous for having given birth to erosmus little as the dutch affect to admire literature they one and all show the house in which he was born with a kind of ostentation on the great bridge is a tolerable statue of him in brass he is represented with a flowing gown a cap on his head and a large folio book in his hand wide open the pedestal is of marble enclosed with iron rails the expression says marshal is nothing remarkable and in that particular we perfectly agree with him among dutchmen erasmus might be a very learned man but among learned men we apprehend him to have been at the best but a secondrate genius there is nothing elevated or sublime in his writings and those compositions of his which are in most request are eminently characteristic of the genius of the countrybuffoonery and low humor  all sorts of provisions are very dear at this place where fish is far from cheap the dutch are amazingly industrious and the lower class very frugal was that not the case it would be impossible for them to live were the poor at rotterdam to squander away as much money in drink as they do in the great trading towns of england they would starve this may be easily conceived says marshal when i inform my readers that during my stay here bread was never less than twopence halfpenny a pound and that i could not live decently with one servant at the inn for less than twenty florins a day which is one pound thirteen shillings and fourpence this says he is certainly as dear as in england wine he adds is cheaper than in england but they have a great deal that is very bad the red wine that is generally met with on the continent out of france particularly in flanders germany and holland is a thick muddy kind of claret and considerably stronger perhaps from a mixture of brandy with it than genuine claret this wine is to be had on the continent for about two shillings a bottle and has a roughness like port there is only one spillhouse in this town  in the year      the number of taxed houses were estimated at between six and seven thousand and the inhabitants at between fifty and sixty thousand the regency is composed of twentyfour counselors and a court of justice consisting of a chief judge four burgomasters and seven aldermen  dort is an inconsiderable town compared with amsterdam and rotterdam yet its deputies rank first in the assembly of deputies from the different towns in holland whereas the hague being considered only as a village sends no deputies to the states of holland however the hague from its being the residence of the court the place where the states general assemble and the center of attraction to all foreigners we shall proceed to treat of it after having premised one or two particulars respecting the town of dort which is the most ancient in the province of holland as well as the first in dignity this is the only town in the province where they have the privilege of coining money in the year      a famous synod was held in this city for examining the opinion of the arminians and calvinists  in one of the upper rooms of the gunners doel are the benches where this famous synod sat which has given rise to so many divisions in this country the escape of grotius between the arminians and the antiarminians remonstrants and antiremonstrants predestinarians latitudinarians etc who all pretend to give a true interpretation of the articles established in this synod some arminians suffered death for the cause and the celebrated grotius was imprisoned and would have probably shared the same fate had he not escaped by artifice and fled to paris where he was highly caressed by the french king and allowed a pension of a thousand crowns a year his escape was effected by means of his wife in the following manner he had obtained leave for a great trunk of books to be brought him which he sent backwards and forwards several times for near a twelvemonth it was at first diligently searched by the guards but finding nothing but books and linen they did not trouble themselves to look into it as it passed on which his wife persuaded him to lock himself into the trunk and endeavor to make his escape and he was accordingly carried off without any suspicion his lady who was left behind in the apartment lay upon the bed in her husbands nightgown and cap pretending to be ill whereby prevented any enquiry after him for several days for this meditated scheme she was in danger of being condemned to perpetual imprisonment but was at length by a majority of her judges formally discharged and followed her husband to france where many other arminians met with a kind reception and were allowed liberty of conscience  this town likewise gave birth to the famous de wit it carries on a considerable commerce in timber and rhenish wine by means of the rhine which flows by its walls though not so much as formally there are at present in it about   000 inhabitants its situation is naturally so strong that though it has no fortifications it was never yet taken it is an island which was formed in      by a terrible inundation which destroyed seventytwo villages in which says busching there perished not less than  00000 persons it is curious to see the floating rafters come down the rhine to this place from cologne on which there are upwards of three hundred persons  brill is about six miles distant from helvoet which is the town where passengers always land who go over in the packet to holland from harwich in this city may be observed the same neatness as is to be met with in all the other cities of holland this town and helvoetsluys both stand in an island marshal calls it a poor fishing place the fortifications give it the repute of being strong but the finest object is the river maese at high water which is near two miles over and the fight of which though beautiful to view has not proved very pleasing to many an english traveller who perhaps fondly imagined that when he had once got on terra firma in holland he should no more be obliged to trust himself on that element which brought him there except along their canals till he returned back to his native country  the houses are in general uniform built of brick with sharp roofs and pointed fronts what renders this city very famous in holland is that the count de la marc seized upon it with his gueuses or beggars in      and by his brave example drew the other towns of the netherlands into a general revolt  hague is a most beautiful place says busching situated in a very delightful country without either gates or walls it is surrounded however by a moat which is passed over at the entrance of the town by drawbridges  its environs are exceedingly pleasant from being bounded on the east by verdant meadows on the south by splendid seats on the west by the sandhills along the north sea on which side there is a straight avenue paved with clinkers and a twofoot walk for passengers planted with several rows of trees leading to the village of scheveling about two miles distant and northward is a delightful wood in which the stadtholder has a country seat this village the first of its kind in europe is the residence of the states general of the states of holland of the courts of justice and of the foreign ministers the number of inhabitants are computed at  0000  the hague says marshal is a considerable city though called a village from the ridiculous reason of its not being walled it has more of the rus in urbe he adds than any place he had ever seen the streets are broad and regular but few of them without trees the squares like ancient athens are surrounded with groves and the numerous gardens with the surrounding meadows hardly ever broken in upon by those receptacles of filth and brickkilns which surround london render it quite rural and make it delightful to those who admire such views in the midst of a city some writers make the number of gardens in this place and its environs to amount to upwards of  000 a number one would think scarce credible  every city of the united provinces has a house here for its respective deputies the old palace of the counts of holland at present belongs to the stadtholder and though it was built  00 years ago the wood work is still sound in the center of the area between the buildings of this palace is the great hall where the trophies of the republic in their many victories are hung up but in other respects it has nothing to recommend it in this palace the states of the united provinces assemble and here the foreign ministers have their audience on the west it opens to a large plain surrounded with magnificent houses regularly planted with trees which have made some travelers draw a comparison between this spot and st jamess park it is indeed like the mall in st jamess park but not a third so long  the streets of the hague are extremely well paved with clinkers that wear an appearance of bricks the joints are so well closed that they admit of washing like a house and the inhabitants seem to vie with each other in this public cleanliness those of each house keeping that spot clean which is before it which makes walking in them exceeding pleasant this spirit of neatness maybe observed at rotterdam and most other towns in holland but the pavements not being so good the effects are not so very visible as they are here this great attention in the dutch however to the keeping of their houses clean seems rather on the decline there being many houses in england kept to the full as clean as any in holland but this extends only to the better ranks of people for among the lower class there is no comparison between the two nations a dutch cottage or the house of an inferior tradesman is kept as clean as possible though there be ever so many children in it but in england such habitations are too often the residence of filth and nastiness we have a female character says marshal amongst us who is called a daudle but such a being is not known in holland  there is one article which is found great fault with by strangers at the hague and that is the expense of fuel a fire of wood will cost as much as seven fires in london and i saw no coal says marshal turf is the only firing this i do not dislike he adds its making no smoke which from seacoal is offensive to the smell and from wood prejudicial to the eyes an advantage much in its favor besides the most asthmatic person will find no inconvenience to his breath from turf but as to stoves so much used in this and other northern countries they are extremely disagreeable custom might reconcile them but an english fire far exceeds all these contrivances  this place appears very different from any other of the dutch towns business and making money is all that is going forward at rotterdam but at the hague there is nothing of the kind to make amends for which there is as much good company as in any city of europe it is the court of the prince of orange consequently all the foreign ministers make it their place of residence and the meetings of the states general are ever held in this place the number of elegant equipages is great the expensive dresses the quantity of servants and the general air of luxury and pleasure carry a very different appearance from any thing to be met with elsewhere but though there are such a number of idle people here who spend very great incomes yet still the hague is very badly off for public diversions the chief place of public amusement here is a french theater and this is chiefly supported by the subscriptions of foreign ministers operas are indeed occasionally performed when singers are to be had but where comedies are badly performed no very sanguine expectations will be entertained of any great degree of excellence in their operas concerts they have very often but the best are at private houses  the public buildings at the hague make no figure the houses the form of the streets and squares are in general infinitely superior some of these indeed appear very magnificent the palace as they call it has several courts but it is a very antiquated building nor is that which belonged to prince maurice of nassau and where the council of war now assemble in the least remarkable notwithstanding this place is so extremely populous there are but two churches in it one of them is of a circular figure without pillars a mode of building which the dutch seem to admire  the voohout is the dutch mall and is about as broad as that of st jamess it was planted by the emperor charles v there are three alleys for carriages and the buildings opposite to it make a good appearance but what is very singular instead of gravel they have laid it with cockleshells which are very unpleasant to walk upon this says marshal is very strange as gravel might be had from us at no great expense sand is the general substitute in holland which takes off very much from the beauty of their gardens and public walks this mall is however as much deserted as our ring  the prince graft is a very noble street near half a mile long of a a fine breadth and as straight as an arrow a spacious canal planted on both sides runs along the middle of it with several stone bridges having iron ballustrades over it the houses especially those on one side make a very grand appearance and the whole in short is very ornamental to the hague but this street is a strong proof that planting of trees has not an effect equal to a fine range of buildings unaccompanied by them a canal cut through a very wide street and faced with stone agrees extremely well with the regularity of the houses and is an additional beauty to them but trees are no ornament here  when we said there was no commerce carried on in this place we should have excepted one article and that the most liberal of all other articles of commerce namely the commerce of books this is the great mart for literature particularly french of all holland if not of all europe great quantities of books in quires are exported from hence all over germany as well as to england and france the dutch editions of french books are in general in more esteem than the french as being printed better and on a better paper and what is more material than all more carefully revised and therefore freer from the errors of the press than the same works printed in other countries what is it that stamps such a value on the elzevir editions at this present time particularly the editions of the classics but that they are not only very neatly but also very correctly printed so that scarce a single error of the press is to be found by the most discerning eye throughout any of their works  this town considerable as it is never had a voice among the six in the senate nor among the twelve that have been added since though purmerend and schiedam two inconsiderable places have votes for which no other reason can be assigned than that the hague was always considered as a village though the most beautiful and largest in the world tacitus mentions some groves here in which claudius civilis assembled the people and made an harangue to them guicciardini has likewise taken notice of some ancient sculptures and other things relating to adrian antoninus septimus severus and other roman emperors whilst holland was under the spanish jurisdiction the treasury and other public offices were here kept the air of this place is said to be very wholesome sir william temple attributes longer life to the inhabitants of this village than to those of any other place in holland  near the hague are two or three other places which attract the attention of strangers the first is scheveling the road to which through the sandbanks is curious this is a pleasant little village about two miles from the hague on the seacost the road to it is paved as we have already observed and shaded with double rows of lime trees and benches at different distances to sit down upon to this place people go to eat fish fresh caught and admire the beauty of the prospect as people in london occasionally make parties of pleasure to greenwich and blackwall to eat whilebait this coast is likewise very well worth seeing to remark the attention of the dutch in keeping up their banks to prevent the depredations of the sea upon their country  on this beach which is very flat and regular the famous sailing chariot of stevinus was made trial of furnished both with wheels and sails which carried eight and twenty persons the astonishing distance of fortytwo miles in two hours and once by an error of the person who had hold of the rudder was very near sailing into the sea with a full cargo which was rather more than they had bargained for  the great success of this sailing machine has produced many imitators in different parts of europe and a hundred schemes for conducting not only carriages but carts and wagons and even ploughs by the wind have been attempted something useful says marshal might probably be invented but mathematicians wanting money for these experiments none of their visionary schemes have hitherto been carried in practice  in summer people come down here to bathe but what is most singular is that the daughters of the fishermen take care of their clothes while they are bathing and furnish them with clothes help to wipe them dry when they come out of the water without its being thought any scandal on either side such is the power of custom scheveling has already suffered so much from the encroachments of the sea that the church which was once situated in the center of the village is now almost by the seaside  at the small distance of a pleasant walk from the hague is the house in the wood belonging to the prince of orange which in holland is an object of curiosity but there is nothing in it that will strike an englishman accustomed to english gardens in the palace there is a fine saloon with a cupola and it is richly ornamented with some very capital paintings by rubens vanderveldt varelst and schuyr  the family of the bentincks have also some very fine gardens in the dutch taste near this place known by the name of the portland gardens which they keep open at all times for the accommodation of strangers and of the public at large and these are almost the only gardens which are thus publicly open the eye here is agreeably amused by a diversity of objects to take off from the tediousness of the long alleys in the dutch gardens which are here as in other places covered with sand carried on in a straight line and intersected every instant by other similar straight walks for there is a fine orangery a grotto a jet deau a grove terraces mounts parterres a lake and a menagery  ryswich is another village near the hague which most strangers visit not only to view the palace of the prince of orange but as remarkable from its being the spot in which a treaty of peace was concluded in      between england germany holland france and spain the palace is the only building of free stone in the seven united provinces it is strongly envelloped in wood which darkens every room this passion of crouding all their houses with trees and wood is unaccountable in the dutch in a hilly bleak country where wind and plenty of air were evils one would naturally look for this taste but in a dead flat where the air is apt to stagnate as well as the water it is preposterous there is nothing in the palace worthy of observation but a few good pictures in the state chamber is an echo which repeats distinctly at one end of room whatever is said in a whisper at the other without those who are in the middle being able to comprehend a syllable that is said  at honslaerdyck there is another palace belonging to the prince about a mile from the sea in which there is a gallery of fine pictures by the first masters in the flemish school among which are a charles the first by vandyke a madona by him with a venus by rubens this house is considered to be superior to some of the famous palaces in italy from the back part there is a delightful prospect through a pleasant grove and some regular plantations of evergreens which form a square of half a mile from each angle to the center beyond this place is an aviary for exotic birds and a menagery for wild beasts the lower rooms of this place have no peculiar ornament except being neatly paved with marble after the dutch fashion but the room up stairs are magnificent and the two galleries very curious the princesss closet is ornamented all round with exquisite japanwork  to give some idea before we entirely quit the hague of what may be the expenses to a man of fashion during a short stay in this seat of dutch gaiety and splendour we shall extract what marshal says on that subject with respect to an ordinary traveller they may be brought within a compass nearly similar to what we stated as the usual routine of expenses for strangers unincumbered with carriages and servants at amsterdam  i was says he at the parliament dangleterre which was the hotel that all persons of any rank went to i found it fully answerable to the character i had received of it for although i was moderate in my bill of fare yet i could not come off for less than two regular courses and several sorts of excellent wines indeed it was to little purpose to be explicit in giving orders about my meals for i was served with a variety whether i chose it or not the expenses upon an average were about two guineas aday but i entertained says he some persons of character to whom i had letters of recommendation there is no satisfaction he adds in traveling expensively especially in eating and drinking and such money is better expended in purchasing the rarities or peculiar productions of the country than in squandering away large sums at inns these circumstances he mentions as a hint to other travelers that may consider and lay their plan beforehand for by not taking private lodgings and by making a longer stay than he intended his expenses were very heavy  those who make the tour of holland from the hague proceed thither by the way of delft or rotterdam the latter of which cities we have noticed or else take their route by leyden haerlem amsterdam and utrecht and so take rotterdam on their return these are the principal and most populous cities in holland or rather in the dutch netherlands  utrecht not being in the province of holland though all the rest are  delft lies in the road between the hague and rotterdam about six miles from the hague this is an agreeable place pleasantly situated among the meadows the streets are spacious and canals running through them planted with trees it is about half the size of norwich the principal object in it is the manufactory of earthen ware and hence called delft their porcelain employs at present about  000 people men women and children the manufacture was once so flourishing as to employ more than  000 but the setting up of a fabric of white stoneware in england was very prejudicial to it though not near so much as the staffordshire creamcoloured ware this has rivalled the delft manufactory not only in the british consumption but even in their own city to such a degree as to have induced the principal manufacturers to make application more than once for a prohibition of it this has not yet been granted but very high duties have been laid on it and the use of it still continuing they are attempting to rival us in the same manufacture but hitherto without success  brewing is also a trade in which the people of delft are very much engaged and which succeeds very well there was formerly a very considerable clothmanufactory here but rival manufactories in france establisted in the time of louis xiv have brought it to a low ebb  there are but two churches in this city in one of which is the tomb of prince william i of orange the founder of the republic who was treacherously shot in his palace here by an assassin in      the place and hole in the wainscot through which the balls passed are still shown a most noble mausoleum has been erected here to his memory at the expense of the states general there are two statues of him one of marble reposing on his tomb which is supported by twentytwo pillars of black marble and another of brass standing near it on the top is fame sounding her trumpet with this motto te vindice tuta libertas under your auspices shall freedom flourish at his feet lies his little dog which is said to have pined away and died with grief for the loss of his master see the plate  this church is now the burial place of the princes of orange the ashes of the celebrated grotius are likewise reposed here surely this man merited a statue of brass in the great square of rotterdam much more than erasmus possibly his works containing more sound and deep learning with less buffoonry than those of the other were above the comprehension of dutchmen in the other church is a stately marble monument to the famous admiral van tromp this city is likewise said to have given birth to the celebrated heinsius in the hoteldeville a fine gothic building is a machine in the form of a clog which used to be put about the neck of persons convicted of adultery  the commerce of this place as has been already remarked is not so considerable as formerly and it is now the retreat of wealthy merchants who have probably been induced to come here from its centrical situation the salubrity of the air its vicinity to the sea the continued verdure with which it is on every side surrounded and its being a large clean and quiet town unaccompanied with noise and bustle  about as far to the south of the hague as delft is to the north or something more lies the city of leyden esteemed the largest and finest town in holland next to amsterdam it is seated in a country full of gardens and meadows and surrounded with a great number of ditches and canals near the ancient bed of the rhine which now looks like a canal it is about four miles in circumference and its ditches are bordered with rows of trees this town is unquestionably one of the neatest and pleasantest in the low countries and though it may be going too far to say it is the largest town in holland next to amsterdam yet rotterdam is the only town besides that comes in competition with it the buildings are beautiful and magnificent the streets spacious and very clean with canals in the middle of many of them the sides of which are planted with rows of trees the rapenburg street is a very noble one and as the inhabitants suppose the finest in europe the great church is a vast building but most remarkable for being the burial place of the great boerhaave the inscription on his monument is simple and noble salutifero boerhaavii genio sacrum sacred to the healthrestoring genius of boerhaave had not the family of this illustrious hollander been rich enough to pay this tribute to his memory there would be nothing here to show that this town had the greatest physician that ever lived since hippocrates if a naval officer distinguishes himself ever so little he is honored with a public funeral but those who contribute to enlighten the human mind by deep researches go unnoticed in the church of st mary there is a monument of joseph scaliger and another of elusius the herbalist  the stadthouse presents nothing worthy of observation but a picture by luke of leyden of the last judgment it is said this is the first painter who had any idea of perspective he died in       but what has rendered this city famous all over europe is its university it undoubtedly has produced many great and very able men but this like their commerce appears on the deline whoever expects to see magnificent colleges or pompous heads of houses will here be miserably disappointed  they have only two colleges in the nature of hospitals for the support of poor scholars the rest of the students living at their own expense they wear no gowns or caps but walk about the streets with their swords on and appear in the schools and perform their exercises with them on and their heads uncovered those who wish to be members of the university apply to the rector magnificus corresponding with our vice chancellor who enters their name in the university book for which halfacrown or five shillings is paid which entitles the student to a certain quantity of wine and beer without paying excise  besides the public lecture the professors allot certain hours for reading private ones these last about three months for which the scholars pay forty or fifty guilders though they seldom are much superior to the lectures of our private tutors they commonly dictate in latin which is oftentimes not less obscure than the subject of the lecture  degrees are not regulated here either by time or merit if the student can make a thesis and pay his fees he may be admitted his thesis he is pro forma obliged to maintain in the school against any opponent the degrees of doctor and masters of arts are the only ones in use among them that of bachelor being not known here the graduates give public entertainments and publish their theses  the professors of the several faculties publish their series lectionum containing the times when and the subjects upon which they are to read in public some of them have two hundred others three hundred per annum  the schools consist of a large pile of brick buildings in the uppermost rooms of which the famous elzevir had his printing office they have a library said to contain some curious manuscripts but neither their library their physicgarden nor their collection of natural history presents any thing very interesting to the generality of travelers of all which they seem to make great boast in holland it was a remark of the late doctor johnson that some judgment might be formed of the state of literature in any town from the booksellers shops if this criterion holds good with respect to leyden literature will appear at a very low ebb there the collection of books to be met with in that city being in general but very indifferent and mostly confined to medical subjects this university is the oldest in the united netherlands and was founded by william i prince of orange  as this city seems to be on the decline in its literature so it is in its woollen manufactures the staple commodity of this city and which were formerly much more considerable than at present the workmen consist of several nations particularly french their fabrics employ at present several thousand men women and children chiesly making broad and narrow cloths serges and camlets but they are inferior says marshal to the finest cloths of the same kind in england their camlets and rattines however are greatly superior to those made at brussels which always have been held in high estimation and there are two colors to which they are supposed to give a superior dye to any other country whatever  black and particularly blue the french are supposed to equal them in their black but the leyden blue stands as yet unrivalled every where their cloths they export to spain turkey and the east indies in which countries they have the preference over ours not from their being better in quality but from their being cheaper among other reasons assigned for their trade being on the decline one is that the princes in germany who formerly clothed their armies entirely with dutch cloth have lately supplied themselves from manufactures of their own which they had established  a great trade is carried on here in gardenstuff which is in such esteem as to be carried as far as amsterdam to supply the markets there their gardens are said to produce four or five crops every year and it is further said that an acre of garden ground is worth two hundred and fifty pounds purchasemoney and arable two hundred pounds and an acre of meadow land an hundred and forty pounds  this city likewise is famous for being the birthplace of john of leyden who in      set up to be a king his followers were a kind of anabaptists who committed many outrages but the following year they were punished for their rashness and rebellion and john himself was broken upon the wheel this john of leyden was a tailor and in the hall where the tailors meet is shown the board which he used to cut out his cloth  not far from this place at the village called cathwich near the sea are the ruins of an ancient fortress known by the name of arx britannica which being built by cabjala and afterward destroyed by the normans was at last overwhelmed by the sea yet not so much but that at certain times when the sea is very low its ruins are plainly to be seen and some antiquities have been found with this inscription ex ger inf ex germania inferiori from lower germany  the only remaining city to be noticed in this province is haerlem fifteen miles distant from leyden and nine from amsterdam with which two cities it enjoys a communication by means of two spacious canals the views of the country between leyden and haerlem are by no means unpleasant though there is a range of vast turf pits and the lake of haerlem on one side but the other is much diversified with meadows fed principally with black cattle the lake is twelve miles long and three broad lying between amsterdam leyden and haerlem there is a very considerable commerce on it so that it is finely spread with sails this lake yields great quantities of fish it is surprising that little jealousies between the three great cities near this river should prevent their agreeing in a work so very advantageous to the country as draining and converting this lake into a rich meadow would be the water is in no places more than eight feet deep and all of it could be conveyed away at a small expense and the whole space kept perfectly dry the dutch all agree that it is practicable but three cities abovementioned cannot agree together about doing it  haerlem like other dutch cities has a show of fortifications but there are none that could hold out any siege the streets are wide and straight but the houses have nothing in them to attract notice there are many canals here as to the number of inhabitants they are reckoned at fifty thousand the principal church is a very fine structure it has three organs one of which is so celebrated that it is usual for persons of fashion and fond of music to pay a ducat the established fee to hear a few airs played upon it and they show in this church some cannon balls that are now sticking in the walls which were shot into it by the spaniards during the time of divine service in the famous siege of      in the roof are hung up the models of two vessels with saws to their keel which were sent by the people of haerlem to the siege of damiette on the confines of egypt to cut the chain which stopped the navigation up the nile by effecting which they delivered one of their counts of holland who was kept prisoner there under the reign of barbarossa  in memory of this extraordinary action the young men of this town celebrate the first of january and carry little boats about shaped like the ships in the church they boast that barbarossa in consideration of the signal services done by the people of haerlem in the holy war added the sword to the arms of this city and the partriarch of jerusalem bestowed the cross upon it  haerlem likewise boasts the invention of printing by one laurence coster who as guicciardini says walking one day in one of the groves of which they have several about this place cut some letters from the bark he had peeled from the trees and stamping them inverted on a piece of paper he found them to come right then rubbing them over with ink it produced something like a letter though somewhat blotted however being encouraged by this rough draught he cut regular letters on better materials which being dipped into a more glutinous ink by repeated improvements he brought it at last to perfection they say one of his servants robbed him of all his instruments and went with them to mayence or mentz which is the reason that city disputes this invention with haerlem his picture with the letter a in his hand and drawn with a furred gown is to be seen in the princes garden they likewise show a piece of costers first printing the impressions only on one side as they used to print their first originals  the gardens of this city merit much being seen they are all almost in the fauxbourgs it is the hyacinths which are now the prevailing flowers formerly the preference was given to the tulip though the price of the roots is very much diminished some at present will sell for a hundred florins a root formerly five hundred pounds have been given for a single root of yellow hyacinth but this was before they were general fancy alone constituting the great distinction between them next to the hyacinth they value most the tulip next the anemony then the narcissus and then the auricula other choice flowers which some nations pride themselves in are here in no esteem the bulbous flowers are exported all over europe  the objects most worthy of notice in this neighborhood are the manufactures of the bleachground the principal trade is bleaching linen large quantities that have been made in other provinces in flanders and in silesia are brought to haerlem to be bleached whole shiploads have even been brought here from scotland and ireland for the same purpose it is the quality of the water alone which bleaches the linen in this place so much better than in any other repeated trials have been made in scotland and ireland where dutch bleachers have been employed without their having the same success let it be remembered however that the whiter any cloth is made so much the less time it will wear this extraordinary fine bleaching should therefore be confined to such cloths as are intended for the use of the rich the charge of freight to and from scotland with the price of bleaching amounts to about tenpence a yard which would be a very great addition in the price of any but very fine linens  besides this branch of trade there are several considerable manufactures particularly of velvet damasks satins silk stuffs of various sorts thread tape etc in all which a great number of hands are employed and i was here told says marshal that their fabrics had been increasing for some years but that their bleaching trade was on the decline  weavers upon an average will earn here near halfaguinea a week from different accounts of the number of hands employed in all the manufactures it appears there are from thirty to upwards of forty thousand but there are many of them employed by some very considerable breweries which work for exportation  in all this part of the province of holland scarce any arable land is to be seen their meadow land is very rich and will let from forty shillings to six pounds an english acre this land is principally applied to the feeding of cows which are of a very large breed in the management of them the peasants are remarkably attentive they keep them clothed all the winter and as clean as an english gentleman would a stable of hunters this is not effected by the means of litter for they use none a trench of stone or brick is made in the floor of the cowroom in such a manner that the dung may fall directly into it and which being swept away with the dirt of the rest of the house forms a good compost and a saving of straw in a part of the country where there is no arable land is an object of no small importance they besides dress and rub down their cows as we do our horses which they think will make them give the more milk they likewise keep their cowhouses as warm as possible and stop every crevice till the breath of the beasts makes the whole place perfectly warm this is a strange custom and appears contrary to nature but they carry this notion so far of keeping their cows warm that they even put cloths over their loins whilst they are feeding in the fields in summer  these pastures are likewise fed by large herds of black cattle which the dutch drivers purchase in holstein and denmark for forty or fifty shillings ahead and sell to the farmers here for three or four pounds and it is observable that their meadows are so rich that some of the beasts will be fattened in six weeks time the butchers buy them fat from five to nine pounds ahead and as an english acre will fatten three the farmer makes from three to six pounds an acre for only part of the year  it is asserted the flesh of their oxen is not so firm nor their hides so capable of making good leather as those of english cattle this is owing to the luxuriance of the food puffing them up in so short a time rather than giving them that solid fat which six or eight months effect in england it is accordingly observed that though some of these beasts are as large as the english ones yet they will not equal them in weight  as the dutch eat very little fresh beef the greatest part is salted for the shipping or dried and smoaked in a peculiar manner for hung beef which they send all over europe  land in the neighborhood of leyden sells dearer than in any other part of europe when applied to cultivation and not to building on arable land as has been observed before will fetch  00l an acre and garden ground from   0 to even  00 the products they yield being highly valued by the gourmands at amsterdam  the gardeners are very skilful in cropping their lands continually on the plan now pursued in the gardens round london where this art is carried to as high perfection as in any quarter of the globe  the general fertility the country is owing to the soil and to its being so well watered for from the general flatness of the whole country its vicinity to the sea and its numerous rivers this country is evidently a drained marsh or bog it being all either a fat marly loam mud or a turf bog these are rich soils and with the advantage of cattle and having always water to have recourse to which the dutch boors esteem a matter of great consequence both to fattening cattle and making them give large quantities of milk they produce the wonders that are seen in this country much therefore is owing to the number of canals and rivers that intersect the meadows and probably to their overflowing large tracks of land in winter and leaving behind advantages it may be presumed parallel to those which are left by the nile  among the rivers it is very well known that the rhine is very inconsiderable at leyden an insignificant canal is shown which is the real rhine the glory of other rivers increases proportionably to the length of their course but this dwindles to nothing and is utterly lost before it comes to its harbor  the cause of the rhines fate was an earthquake which shook the downs in the ninth century and filling the mouth of this river forced it to return and seek a new passage the river seck was then scarce worth notice but the waters of the rhine which were driven back and overflowed the country swelled and deepened the leeks channel and the entrance of the sea has been ever since shut up against the ancient course of the rhine  thus this poor river which runs such hazards in the lake of constance and throws itself down a precipice near schaff hausen loses at length its reputation and waters at the village of caturik  before we quit the neighborhood of the hague and leyden which are reckoned the politest places in all the provinces and the most learned one being the seat of government and residence of the foreign ministers and the other an university and the seat of sciences and literature we will beg leave to offer some few remarks on the character of the people in this part of the united netherlands  among the lower classes of people there is a very great national resemblance throughout all the provinces but among the better sort who support themselves without trade and who have traveled these are all more or less french they speak that language only they dress in the french taste eat in like manner and give themselves particularly young men of any fashion in holland the same airs as if they aped french liveliness and vivacity people of this description are not uncommon at the hague this place not being supported by trade but rather the residence of idleness than industry and being full of foreigners it may account for this motley appearance of characters which we find in the inhabitants of that city it is likewise worth remarking that there is something of the character of a frenchified dutchman to be observed at leyden though not so much as at the hague but at rotterdam there is a visible difference this plainly shows that the characters and manners of the people are very much formed by their close adhering to or neglecting business a dutch burgomaster or principal freeman dresses in a formal suit of black and his lady in a hoop every way shaped like a bell with a laced coif worth  00l whilst the daughter shall be tricked out in every french fashion  at leyden the university draws a great number of persons who have no views of trade and who therefore affect the appearance and manners of the inhabitants but at rotterdam every individual is deeply engaged in commerce and therefore exhibits the true dutch character much more to the life  an unshaken industry seems to be the strong characteristic features of this city no application wearies them no accidents divert them their whole attention is directed to the raising of wealth and it is not a little surprising to see the numbers who have attained large fortunes and yet continue the same anxiety and eagerness after more without thinking to enjoy what they have already acquired their constitutions are cold and phlegmatic to an amazing degree a sober regular parsimonious way of life is habitual to them and no passion seems to lurk in their bosom that can ruffle them this however cannot be attributed to their love of trade so much as to their climate  a dutchman is as amphibious as a frog says marshal half their country is water and half their time is spent upon it the vapors which arise from the quantity of water with which they are surrounded and from a soil which is low moist and boggy must necessarily affect the mind of its inhabitants what an astonishing contrast between love in spain or italy and love in holland would it not be amazing to tell a neapolitan inamorato that the height of his fine phrenzy was mere climate and that if he lived in holland he would look upon his mistress with the coldest friendship  but these characteristics are not general there are and must be many exceptions many of the merchants and manufacturers live genteelly and though not all in the french style yet in much ease plenty and affluence while they attend to trade as closely as if no such external marks of riches were to be seen among them they are fond of indulging in the luxuries of the table in expensive furniture and handsome equipages but as for dress amusements and a variety of servants they are totally indifferent about them  the true national character unmixed must be sought for among the lower class in them are to be found the same coldness of constitution with no invigoration than what beer gin and tobacco give which they take in great quantities in them is likewise to be seen a rough boorishness which is not to be met with in other countries the very lowest of the people will not pay the least mark of personal respect to the greatest merchant this is the effect of that equality which flows through a republic and not mere liberty for they are governed with three times the severity in this country that the lower people in england are  the following anecdote will illustrate this after the elector palatine king of bohemia who married the daughter of james i and from whom the kings on the british throne are descended  after this king had been routed at the battle of prague he fled to holland this was in the year    0 about forty years after the dutch had thrown off the spanish yoke and when a spirit of equality had taken hold of the people in general the king with some few attendants was out a coursing and riding incautiously over a field that had just been sowed the farmer and dutch liberty one of his peasants who had been threshing in the barn seeing the king riding on the land quitted their work and ran out to him with the utmost anger hollo cried the farmer who knew the person of the king hollo you king of bohemia  what do you mean by riding over my land  the king more surprised than afraid stopped his horse made an apology and returned  the lower sort of dutch have been reproached with being passionate that they draw their knives on each other and in their insurrections are very barbarous but this scarce ever happens but when they are too free in their use of gin  we will now proceed to north holland  chap iii north holland or west friesland this forms a peninsula it being almost surrounded by the north and zuyder seas and is connected only by an isthmus with south holland  they are both under one regency called the states of holland and westfriesland though the appellation of westfriesland belongs more properly to the northern part of this country  there are a great many very high dykes or sandhills in this part of holland but the other parts of the country lie very low it was formerly overrun with washes or marshes but the persevering inhabitants have drained them and they are now very fine meadow grounds though it is necessary to keep up a great number of windmills to carry off the waters occasionally which is attended with considerable expense  sardam the town much visited by strangers near amsterdam though a village in neatness has not its equal in all europe and for the considerable trade that it carries on  it is the principal place for shipbuilding in all the provinces and when the dutch navy was at the height of its prosperity was noted for a saying that if you gave the people six months notice they could launch a man of war every day in the year  here are at present large magazines of timber masts yards cordage sails anchors cannon and every thing necessary to build rig and fit out all sorts of vessels but this place is not only noted for shipbuilding there are a great many manufactures carried on here particularly of aper this being the most considerable paper manufactory in all the netherlands and employing above six hundred men besides women and children the men earn about seven shillings per week on an average but some of them get much more these wages seem to be about equal to those given by the same manufactures in england but living here is much dearer which is compensated by the superior frugality and sobriety of the dutch  the number of windmills at this place is astonishing busching makes them to be no fewer than twentythree hundred  those for sawing timber to build their ships with are admirable contrivances they facilitate the work so much that it is greatly to be regretted that they are not imitated in england such a sawmill indeed was erected some years since at limehouse but the sawyers who dreaded a loss of employ arose in a body and pulled it down  the dutch have had them above   0 years and yet in england they continue using the handsaw which is forty times the expense the reason alleged is if mills were generally introduced a great number of sawyers would at once be out of employ but it is absurd to suppose that such stout and able men as fawyers could remain without work and the cheapness of the manufactures using mills would make the consumption so much the greater that all the hands dependent on them would be increased this was found to be the case in holland and particularly in sardam where the erecting sawmills increased as appears by authentic registers the number of shipwrights in the proportion of twenty to one  there are also many mills for grinding wood and colors such as the dyers use and likewise a great number of powdermills of which there is a large manufactory carried on all these mills make sardam a very considerable place and their structure is so exceedingly curious that a stranger will find no greater entertainment any where in holland or stronger incitements to reflection on the industry of the dutch and the great national benefit arising from their frugality and their ingenious contrivances for lowering the prices of their manufactures than in this village this was the place in which the great czar peter worked as a common shipwright and the tools he used to work with are still shown it is about seven miles from amsterdam  near eidam is a track of country of more than twenty miles in circumference called purmerend the name of a lake which was here formerly but which is now entirely drained and covered with rich meadows the soil is a rich black loam composed to all appearance of sand and clay but more like a slime settled the grass is admirably rich but full of weeds the dutch having no notion of meadows welllaid out the luxuriance of the herbage is all that they attend to in order to have what is called in england a great swarth of hay yet these meadows let from  0s to  l an acre english  this fertility shows what is to be expected from drained lakes there is no instance of this in england yet the moors in huntingdon and cambridgeshire and the lakes in scotland says marshal would surely admit of this culture larger cows and sheep than are to be met with here are no where to be seen these cows will give four or five gallons of milk english measure in a day and the cheese and butter made from one of them amounts to about eight pounds sterling a year  this track of land is on the whole one of the greatest curosities in the united provinces it was drained in the year      and the whole completely finished in four years the lake contained  0000 acres of which  000 are now made profitable as meadows orchards or gardens the remaining  000 compose villages roads dykes canals drains etc the appearance is as beautiful as that of a dead flat can be the verdure is fine the fences perfectly neat the rows of trees the orcards and the gardens numerous and thriving in short a richer spot is hardly to be seen the rents are very high but the fertility of the soil merits it for here are many meadows that will more than feed a large cow per acre and support her all the summer with great plenty  a dutch boor with fifty or sixty acres will contrive to live as well or better than an english farmer with two hundred acres this is entirely owing to their spirit of frugality and neatness it is not only visible in their houses and furniture but in all their farming offices their tools and implements are kept in the most exact order their scythes spades shovels and forks appear like household instruments their wagons are constantly kept as clean as our coaches and this spirit of cleanliness runs through every thing though this certainly takes up time it answers to them very well in the end for there is a great difference in the wear and tare of any tools or instruments of husbandry whether they are kept clean and under cover or dirty and exposed to the weather from which i conclude says marshal that no time is better spent than that which is employed in keeping all the implements and every thing relative to husbandry neat and clean  this is particularly observable in holland not only in their implements of husbandry but in their cattle their fences the banks of their ditches their dykes their walls poles hedges etc whatever the fence is one is sure to find it in good order and this is equally conspicuous in all their public works the canals bridges dykes etc are all in admirable repair  so great is the economy of the dutch and so much do they live within their income that they never know the want of money being thus rich they will contribute as freely to the erection or repair of a public building as to the fences in their own gardens  next to sardam the village of broek is one of the most curious in holland as well as the most considerable the extreme neatness which reigns there is unexampled even in the rest of the provinces the inhabitants are very rich and some of them can give their daughters several tons of gold for their portion the houses here are all built of timber and seldom exceed one story high they are so frequently painted that they always look as if they were just built the windows are in general sashed and decorated with beautiful curtains the inside also of their houses is neat and embellished beyond conception those who have ever so small a portion of ground before their house never fail to convert it into an agreeable garden diversified with gravel walks shellwork images and little hegdes or painted rails the village itself is watered by a number of canals the banks of which are kept up with the greatest neatness and all the streets are paved with bricks which are kept frequently washed and strewed with white sand in some places the bricks are dispersed in the form of flowers that these ornaments may not be defaced or the streets made dirty no carriages or horses are permitted to pass through them there is but one public house at the entrance of the village and which is the only one that strangers are admitted to see if they have no acquaintance among the inhabitants when any strangers come there they are so jealous at the sight of them that those who have daughters who are in general very handsome make them keep out of sight  not only the wooden furniture in the houses are painted to the very broomsticks but likewise the gates and rails in the meadows and even the very posts in the meadows the latter of which are further ornamented with carved work  at alamaar which is the chief town in north holland there is a very singular charity a considerable estate has been left for the support of old maids and widows no matter of what religion provided they will take an oath never to marry this city is surrounded by a great number of gardens orchards and rich meadows and very near it there is a grove which would make a figure in the best regular garden in england it is so beautiful the streets of this city are regular and well built and the large canals kept so clean that they give the town an elegant appearance in      it was found to contain      houses both within and without the town are several pleasant walks particularly on the ramparts it was once one of the fortresses of holland the country round about it once consisted of lakes which have been all drained and now make an excellent appearance being all cut into rich meadows and hardly an acre lost all the canals and dykes are planted with rows of trees the villages are thick and well peopled and all of them possessing an air of neatness and regularity which alone would make traveling in holland extremely delightful  the road from this place to bemster in summer is very pleasant at the end of the town begins a straight vista which continues for three miles in the middle of this vista there is a wide canal and on each side a road perfectly level and smooth with a row of trees and a ditch running along the outside both of which are bordered with the finest meadows interspersed with seats and gardens every cottage has a garden which the boors cultivate extremely well the women and children are principally employed in making nets for the herring fishery which employs a great number of hands in this country  it is astonishing that the number of people whom this fishery maintains should not have made us on whose coasts they come to fish more attentive to advantages which nature has laid at our doors our poor are starving for want of employment while our more industrious and meritorious neighbors maintain themselves on our fish and come  00 leagues to catch that which we might have in our own harbors such an instance of supineness is not to be met with in the whole circle of european politics the infinite advantages which would attend the establishment of a great herring fishery in some of the western isles of scotland ought to engage our government to act with more vigor in this affair the only possible way of succeeding would be to build a town in the western islands and make it the seat of the whole undertaking the company should above all be careful to provide an immediate market for all the fish caught salted and barrelled under their inspection when once the fishermen found a market for their fish their profession would increase very much new towns would rise up and a general alacrity spread itself through all the coasts this would form new markets for all the productions of the neighboring estates which would animate their culture and greatly increase the value of land all this is in the power not only of the king and parliament but of any nobleman of considerable property in the islands a private capital of  0000l would go further than five times that sum in the hands of a public company  in holland what with pay allowance and herrings the men who go in the busses gain about twelve shillings aweek  on the coast of this province are several islands which formerly made part of the continent and have been separated from it by the violence of the sea the inhabitants of these islands make excellent mariners whether considered with respect to their courage or their skill  one great occupation among them is breeding of sheep with which their fields are covered they accordingly export a great deal of wool and with the milk of these animals they make a green cheese which is eagerly bought up under the name of texel cheese  the most considerable of these islands is the texel which most probably received its name from the multitude of eggs which the seagulls lay on its shores it is the largest of all the islands in this track  on the eastern coast there is a commodious road styled the mosco road which is the rendezvous of all the outward bound east india ships who lie here under the cannon of a fort close erected by the scheld at this place they are also mustered while they wait for an easterly wind to carry them out of the marsdiep during which time they are usually said to be lying in the texel  this is the principal passage for ships that come from amsterdam or the zuydersea into the ocean it is however a very dangerous one on account of two sandbanks which lie at the entrance particularly in bad weather or with a contrary wind  on the   th of july      the english fleet under the duke of york came off this island as with an intent to make a descent but the ebb which used to last only six hours continuing in a very extraordinary manner for twelve and being succeeded by a storm the english were under the necessity of putting out to sea after losing two of their ships in      and      there were two naval engagements here in the first of which the celebrated dutch admiral van trump was killed  at the entrance of the water going up to amsterdam there are two other sand banks where it is so very shallow that the ships are obliged to be carried over them in cradles or camels which are a kind of large boxes   0 feet in length filled with water and fastened with ropes under the side of the ships the water is then drawn out of these machines which as they rise toward the surface lift the ships up four five or six feet according to the more or less water they draw  end of the tenth volume directions for placing the plates of vol vi vii viii and ix vol vi a chinese villa to face page   chinese page    map of
