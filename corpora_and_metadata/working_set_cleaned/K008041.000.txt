the registeroffice a farce of two acts  acted at the theater royal in drury lane  by j reed  dublin printed for h saunders r watts and w whitestone booksellers in skinnerrow  mdcclxi  prologue spoken by mr king the bard whose hopes on comedy depend must strive instruction with delight to blend while he who bounds his less aspiring views to farce the combrush of the comic muse with pleasantry alone may fill the scene  his business chiefly this to cure the spleen to raise the pensive mind from grave to gay and help to laugh a thoughtful hour away if any quibbling wit dispute my thesis pd ask the use of half our petty pieces nay sirs my question still shall higher climb  pray what is the use of fullpricd pantomime how does the pleasurd eye with rapture glance when mingling witches join in hobbling dance when wriggling harlequin the magic sage in hornpipe amble traverses the stage when trembling pierrot in his quivering shines an ostrich enters or a serpent twines when headless tailors raise the laughing fit or flourdredgd footmen twirl upon a spit  but oh how loud the roar how dear the rumble when scaffolds mortarboards and bricklayers tumble when clodpate runs or limps or quaintly rears from laundresstub his anabaptist ears while all the wit these exhibitions draw is comprehended in a cry  o laa our author in this awful court of drury submits his cause to an impartial jury no

genteel apartment enter harwood and frankly fran well this is the most unexpected visit  but prithee harwood what in the name of mystery has brought thee to town at this unfashionable time of the year   har the loss of my fair housekeeper   fran the loss of maria  is she dead   har worse my dear frankly  elopd   fran elopd why i thought you had so great a regard for each other that you had been as inseparable as old age and avarice or a coquette and a lookingglass   har i thought so too but women are as changeable as their dresses there is no answering for the humors of the sex  though faith i cannot altogether excuse myself in the affair of our parting   fran prithee explain   har you know charles after the death of my wise whom with shame i must own i never thoroughly loved as she was not mine but my fathers choice i prevailed on maria who was either beggared by an unnatural father or a villainous uncle to take upon her the care of my family  her good sense beauty and behavior imperceptibly won my heart but my pride forbidding me to marry a woman without a fortune i made use of every means in my power to  gain her affections   fran i understand you to gain them in the old way   har but the fair maria was so much upon her guard or so obstinately virtuous that nothing but downright matrimony would induce her to listen to my solicitations   fran an unreasonable gipsy and so you dropped the affair   har not quite so hasty in your conclusions good sir  after a vast profusion of lying and swearing which failed of the desired success i determined to make my grand attack   fran resolved like a man of spirit   har and accordingly one night the last week when every eye was closed and the pale moon and stars alone shone conscious of the theft hot with the gallic grape and high in blood and so forth i began my assault   fran bravo   har it would be needless to tell thee i was repulsed  in short the dear lovely affronted virtuous maria so highly resented the familiarity that she instantly left the house and from that hour i have not set eye on the fair enslaver   fran and so you are come to town to hire a new housekeeper   har no to marry my old one if i can be so fortunate as to encounter her  i must have her  i cannot be easy without her  i have some faint hopes of meeting with her as she was seen on the london road  which do you think the most likely way of finding her out   fran hum  this requires some thought  ay  pray what do you think of a penitential advertisement   har no hang it should i be discovered for the author it would make me too ridiculous   fran that is true i must confess  stay  do you imagine she will be looking after another place   har i fancy she will as her finances must below   fran then the only method i can put you into is an application to some of our intelligencewarehouses   har i dont understand your cant phrase pray what do you mean by an intelligencewarehouse   fran a registeroffice   har oh i take you the places where servants may be heard of  pray were not these offices invented by the ingenious author of tom jones   fran they were  the project has been and still is of great utility to the public but as there is no general rule without an exception this laudable institution has been strangely perverted through the villainy and avarice of some of it is managers  there is an old rascal in this neighborhood who has amassed a tolerable fortune by abuses of this kind his office is frequented by persons of every degree and among it is other conveniences the good old trade of pimping is carried on with great success and decency i believe as many proselytes have been made to the flesh by the knavery of this rascal as by the most successful bawd in town   har so i find the old fellow is a genius in his way   fran a complete one  our old schoolfellow jack williams is his clerk from which honorable employment he retires in a few days to a stewardship to which i have lately recommended him  by his means i have often had an opportunity of overhearing some passages which have afforded great humor and entertainment   har if my heart were not so full for the loss of this dear woman i could like to throw away an hour in an amusement of this kind   fran that you may this very morning if you please  i will introduce you  it will help to dissipate your melancholy for the loss of your fair deserter   har psha i am not in a humor to relish any pleasantry  excuse me charles  some other time i will accept of your offer   fran since you are so serious i must insist on your going  why thou art as melancholy as a superseded placeman  come come george dont despair  i warrant we will find out it is charmer in a few days  you must go with me harwood   har then i am ready to attend you

in expectation of the imaginary place we have advertised  a registeroffice under the direction of so conscientious a person as mr gulwell instead of a public good becomes a public evil  my upright master seldom feels any reflections of this kind avarice is his leading principle and so long as he can swell his bags by the folly or credulity of mankind he will not suffer conscience to hinder him

without a necessary portion of trick and chicanery   will sir if the imposture of this very advertisement were sound out and duly punished one or both of us would stand a fair chance for the pillory

than downright pickpockets  i am glad i shall have the good fortune to leave it so soon   gul mr williams i am truly sorry for our separation yet rejoice at the occasion of it  however if you hope to make a fortune in your altered condition of life you must learn to keep your conscience in proper subordination i can assure you that fraud is as necessary a requisite in a stewardship as in an

were insisted on  i pleaded the young gentlemans acknowledged merit and the public services of his brave father who lost his life in fighting for his country which so softened my principal that he sunk his demand from    will fifteen to five hundred i hope   gul from guineas to pounds i could get no further abatement   will it is a pity that such extraordinary merit should have no better

predecessors have been a little out of repair to the present time and the name regenerated into plain brush   gul sir as your family has been so long reduced how came you by the education you talk of   capt sir i was taught to read and write freegratis for nothing at a charity school and attended lord pliant to the university where you know there is many opportunities for a man of talons to improve himself   gul right sir such opportunities that i have frequently known a valet return from thence full as wise as his master   capt egad sir i see very plainly youre a gentleman that knows what is what   gul and pray captain what were your favorite studies at college   capt logic and poetry the only two studies sit for a gentleman as the first will teach you to cheat the devil and the last to charm the ladies   gul i should be glad to have a little conference with you on the latter for i am a bit of a dabler in it   capt then serously as a friend i would dissuade you to look out damned sharp or upon my soul you will catch a tartar for i have not met with any body that was fit to hold the candle to me in poetry for a long serus of time  but sir as i am in haste we had better refer the dispute at prosent  any other time i am at your service for a   i shall run through my business with as brief prolixity as possible  at a country town where i was recruiting i had the good fortune to pick up a maiden lady pretty well stricken in years with a fortune of three thousand pounds in the stocks now sir as the interest of the money and my present pay will scarce be sufficient to maintain me  for you know sir a soldier and a gentleman is anonymous characters and a man in my office must live up to his dignity  i say sir as the interest of money is damned low i have a desire to purchase a cornecy or a company of foot that i may be better able to live like a gentleman   gul posts of this kind frequently fall under my disposal i think it a prudent and honorable intention in you as in case of mortality the provision for your lady will be larger   capt pho dam the old hag i dont care if the devil had her i have been married above two months and was as tired of her in the first fortnight as a modern man of quality after a twelvemonths cohabitation i have for these five weeks past done every thing in my power to break her heart but egad it is made of such tough stuff such penctrable stuff as my friend shakespeare calls it that i believe i shall not be able to defect the business damme  in short my disappointment has thrown me into such a hellish deel ha me that the devil fetch me if i know for the blood and soul of me how to execrate myself out of it for i want to be rid of her most cursedly that is certain   gul there are ways  many ways captain by which

honor of his acquaintance   capt oh the most archest comicalest son of a whore in the whole universe egad  as i was a saying tom offered me for ten pieces to give her a dose but no no damme thinks i to myself i will not poison the old beldam neither it will be the more fashionable way to break her heart   gul sir as you are a gentleman i would beg leave to ask why you are so desirous of parting with a woman who has been so great a benefactress to you  i should be afraid your patron and his lady would resent such behavior  will you be kind enough to answer my question with truth   capt truth sir is to be sure a most amable thing and what every gentleman ought to make use of as mr  what is his name  one of the old roman philosophers there  pythogorus i believe  ay squire pythogorus it was  used to say sockratas is my friend pluto is my friend but truth is more my friend so say i lord pliant is my friend lady pliant is my friend but truth is more my friend  and though some persons will affirm that truth ought not to be spoken at all times yet no philosopher not no body else would ever venture to affirm but that truth ought to be spoken at sometimes  which being granted  i say sir which being granted it must follow  necessarily follow sir  that though truth ought not to be spoken at all times occasions and seasons yet seasonable truths may be occasionally spoken at all times  but this sir is the very profundity of logic and consequently out of the reach of every capacity wherefore i shall descend into the spear of common sense to be the better understood   gul sir i must acknowledge that your arguments are very sublime and logical but yet they are no answer to my question  perhaps i have been too rude to press you on the occasion  there may be some lady in the case who    capt egad sir youre in the right i had not been married above ten days till i fell most consumedly in love with a niece of my wises a girl of fifteen with a damned large fortune  a most

 it is a  i cannot find words to express myself properly  it is a  as it were a  as one may say a  chaos i cannot divine it otherwise for the blood and soul of me   gul you have not divined it at all at least not to my satisfaction  i suppose by the connection it signifies dislike   cap right sir it is a  a  kind of dislike but not as one may say a  a  an absolute dislike  but sir to proceed in my story  if i could but break my wifes heart i should assuredly marry my niece in less than a month after her decease  a seprate maintenance will not do or mrs le brush should have it with all my soul but if we part you know all hopes of breaking her heart are over  she has offered to seprate if i would give her two hundred pounds in ready rhino and allow her for life an annual provision of fifty pounds per annum every year    gul which you have refused i suppose   capt refused most certainly sir i was almost putrified with astonishment at the agregious impudence of her demand  i shall not consent to allow here a shilling more as fifteen a year  she may live very comfortably very comfortably on it in the north   gul truly sir i think fifteen pounds a year a very genteel allowance especially as she brought you so small a trifle as three thousand   capt i think so too egad but these old devils have no conscience at all damme  well sir you will give me an answer as soon as possible  you may hear of me at mrs dresdens a milliner under the peeaches in commongarden   gul writing very well sir  i will talk with a principal about your affair this evening   capt there sir

in his prayers and so earnest in his ejaculations that i received great comfort and consolation  i was so easy so composed so resigned after i had made my peace that i could have parted with life with as little uneasiness as a young wife of quality with her deary of threescore  oh he is a most heavenly creature  he said such comfortable moving things  but what success had the advertisement   gul

price of virginity and i assure you i am a person of more honor and conscience than even to endeavor to fob him off with a counterfeit  conscience should be used in all our dealings  i have too strong

to lay it out even to the uttermost farthing in building a new tabernacle   gul i hope madam you have not disinherited your two daughters   snare why i had some scruples on that head but mr watchlight removed them  he told me as they were illegitimate it would be a great slur and reproach to my reputation if i named them in my will and you know one would wish to die with a good name  besides he convinced me of the exceeding great sinfulness of leaving any thing to bastards as it was a direct countenance and encouragement to the cause of lewdness and debauchery  he assured me that many good men in all ages had disinherited even their lawful children for the charitable work of building hospitals and alms houses  and if there be such merit in building an hospital what must there be in erecting a tabernacle   gul here is religion with a vengeance aside   snare besides my daughters are both very happily provided for sukey is in keeping with a rich jew and lucy with a grave merchant
