refined by taste by science polished and by judgment chaste we see the muse in dignity sublime led on by prologue apeing pantomime whose sportive fancy and whose comic skill all must applaud  where roscius guides the quill yet when melpomene in grief appears her suffering virtue bathed in sorrows tears from tyrant laws or jealous love oppressed swelling with silence in her tortured breast how can the heart her genial impulse show feel as she feels or weep anothers woe when gay thalia has so late possessed the laughing transports of the human breast let each her province keep let jocund mirth to epilogue alone give happy birth ease the struck soul from every anxious fcar and wipe from beautys check the silent tear twice metastasios wings have borne our bays and safely brought him over the critic seas fired with success he dares this awful night cheered by your smiles to take a bolder flight nor longer stoop beneath a foreign shade like dian shining from a borrowed aid but comes impregnate with icarian pride to stretch his pinnions and forsake his guide yet doubtful flies lest vapors damp his force and one black cloud should stop his airy course to awful heights his proud ambition soars and the dread regions of applause explores no sun he fears  but courts its warmest ray it is yours to raise  or sink him in the sea let candor then proceed to try the cause that

the laurel of reward to you the tragic muse in britains name comes to announce the merits of his claim it is i have led him timorous to this field and bade him dare his countrys guantlet wield bade him aspire to vault her fiery breed nor humbly stoop to mount the managed steed long had i seen his patient merit toil in culling chaplets from a foreign soil whilst here transplanted by his skilful hand italias honors bloomed in albions land long had i marked as such exotic boughs content he wove to veil his modest brows a spirit that in paths untrod before might snatch the nobler foliage of this shore pleased with the hopes that i had now descried a future son from whom the buskins pride to this my favorite isle again might rise i touched his ear and pointed out the prize wither my honors in this clime i said buds here no bounteous leaf to deck thy head are these once fosiering skies so overcast that genius dares not brave the inclement blast come let me lead thee where my sons of yore in fancys fields amassed their laureate store with active powers aloft bestrode the clouds inspired by kind acclaims of shouting crowds turn thee where shakespeare waved the mystic rod and saw a new creation wait his nod behold where terror with eccentric stride bursts like a torrent from the mountains side behold where gentle pity heaves the sigh sluicing the fruitful conduit of the eye see love at whose approach the airy wiles of mirth and freedom or the jocund smiles of sweet content dispersed in wild affright mount on their silken wings and take their flight see jealousy his hideous form uprear tine the quick brand and shake the vengeful spear while close behind fell anguish and disdain stalk sullen by and swell his gloomy train mark where despair points to some distant ground on blasted yews where nightbirds shrick around where yawning tombs add horror to the night and meteors flash their momentary light here mark thyself what various objects rise nor trust the medium of anothers eyes i spoke  and genius strait began to spread his ready plumage and my voice obeyed adventurous thence he dares this night aspire to stamp the vivid scene with native fire it is yours ye britons then with kind applause to fan the flame i kindled in your cause nor be it said when on your mercy thrown you foster every spark but what is your own from your dread sentence crowned

shrink before the genius of your noble friend  again arsetes bred in distant realms and long a wanderer over the face of earth must hail the hour that led his steps to tread your soil and gave him teramenes for his friend  tera though now the rage of civil strife is past full well thou know tomorrows sun declined his next returning beam lights up the day that ends the truce with pontus and demands our strongest force to meet a mightier foe in artabasus  again five returning suns have changed your vernal groves since as the breath of fame declares your armies met and fought on hippias banks what time your martial powers forgive me if report mislead my tongue bowed to a foreign standard  tera lycomedes whose thirst of glory in his vigorous life compelled the neighboring states to bend beneath bithynias yoke when creeping time had clogged the vital springs and kept his age from scenes of active valor by his generals still maintained the field and through the nations spread his martial terrors till that fatal day when hippias down his current died with blood the frequent corse and glittering ensign bore then midst the slaughter fell a sacrifice to iron war our kings lamented son a youth the early darling of his sire the soldiers hope and nursling of the field  again often have i heard polemons name whose brave unpracticed arm encountered artabasus and from his sword received a glorious death  tera but though the times necessity compelled bithynia to the truce still still the thought of his polemon rankled in the bosom of our afflicted monarch still the hope

amidst this city whose opposing bulwarks rise on the kingdoms edge and dare the foe  again fame speaks your rival great and gives the praise of might and wisdom to the king of pontus and more it is

earnest of new triumphs  tera let him come would yet arsetes aid bithynias cause his sword with brave orontes joined whose hand must sway the scepter of bithynias realm might fix the unsteady wing of victory to lycomedes bands  again orontes valor your sovereign deems to merit cleonice whose piety forsakes the pomp of courts the splendid ease of female life to attend a fathers steps amidst the clang of war but for arsetes thou rememberest well when first he joined to thine his social arms he pledged his faith for five returning moons to abide your welcome guest and now the tenth wanes in her silver orb  tera what says agenor my mind though loath recalls each circumstance but still i hoped arsetes might be won to breathe our friendly air still mixed among bithynias warlike sons now hovering over the verge of hostile pontus when the time and place concurred to pour with sudden inroad the storm of conquest on our hated foe to avenge a form a worth so like his own   but see he comes  enter arsetes beloved arsetes welcome youth at thy presence buds with bloom renewed such as i was when on arabias sands i crushed the wandering robbers of the desert  arse my lord too partial friendship ever finds new praise for your arsetes if i claim of merit aught here heaven receive my thanks that bade me wield the sword for lycomedes  tera and yet arsetes now methinks forgets to prize our countrys honors while the bond of friendship holds no more his changing heart that heart which once i pressed with transport here which seemed with mutual transport to receive the love i proffered when my bosom glowed with warmth of gratitude to him whose arm snatched teramenes from impending death as fierce lysippus aimed the threatening blade at my defenseless head when you rushed in till then unknown and saved me from the foe  ars twas sure some happy star that led my steps at that blessed moment  if i saved the life of teramenes i preserved indeed a faithful counselor for lycomedes an armys chief but for myself a friend  tera and will thou my arsetes now forsake the bands that late pursued the glorious task of conquest taught by thee  now when the great the important moment comes on which depends our monarchs fame our vengeance  led by thee and brave orontes we have stemmed the tide of inbred tumult every rebel head now lies subdued and flushed with great success our soldiers now demand with loud acclaim to pour their fury over yon hostile bounds beneath arsetes and orontes  arse heaven be witness here compulsive honor long has chanllengd my departure  yet till now i waved obedience to the frequent calls of duty but the flame of civil broils at length subsiding through your troubled state i must forgive me chief forgive me friend yield to the powerful voice and quit bithynia by every toil my sword has known in battle but most the toils i shared with teramenes unwilling and compelled i leave your clime and quit a country dearer than my own  tera farewell arsetes think that teramenes feels from his in most soul the fixed resolve of him whom once he fondly deemed by fortune from all mankind selected for his friend i will seek the king  no less will he regret arsetes loss whose presence might insure his wished revenge and fix his kingdoms glory  exit arsetes agenor again why droops arsetes o discover all thy secret grief and let agenor share it  arse indeed thou do  my every thought is thine my other self my bosoms counselor what needs there more to rend my heart to fill my tortured soul while loitering here i wrong my native soil the voice of filial duty chides my delay yet love the powerful god reigns in my breast and mocks each settled purpose come my agenor with thy friendly aid confirm my thoughts and teach me yet to tread yet to resume the path my seet have left to quit the land where all my joys are centered to tear myself from love and cleonice   o never  never   again yet again reflect think who you are to what has heaven reserved your virtues  shall a kingdoms heir   arse go on  it is honest chiding  shall a kingdoms heir thus would thou say on whom the expecting eyes of thousands look for happiness on whom a father fixes every dearest hope to see himself renewed to distant times shall he forgetting all the claims of glory forgetting all the ties of filial duty defraud his longing people of their prince and from his sire withold a darling son say  shall bithynias hostile lands detain from artabasus sight his loved pharnaces o no  agenor  thou have fired my soul my father  yes i will embrace the knees of him whose love reproaches my delay yet never cleonice shall this breast forget its wonted flame  is it a crime to adore the sum of all her sexs graces though wayward chance has placed the hopeless bar of lineal enmity between our loves  again and yet my prince the indulgent hand of fate perchance may weave your future web of life with threads of brighter dye even love itself may find a way to clear the gloomy prospect discord perhaps may once again extinguish her hated torch that fires the rival nations and cleonice be the bond of peace too long already strangers have we lived alien from friends and home though artabasus sent you beneath my fathers guardian care to learn hard lessons in the school of glory yet sure the parent suffered in that absence which as a king his virtue deemed would raise your fame and fit you for a peoples weal  arse yes my agenor often his tenderest greetings have warned me to return when circling time had brought the period fixed for my departure or when the pause of arms or honors duty permitted me to quit the host of rome  again and yet  my prince   arse and yet  too true agenor i feel each just reproach  the land indeed i left and journeyd over a length of soil when fate for sure twas more than common fortune prompted my steps to tread bithynias realm where lycomedes waged intestine war with rebel arms  again thy generous valor then warmed by the common cause of kings to assert a princes rights forgot thy countrys foe  arse full well thou know i vowed to every god by all the solemn ties that bind mankind never to reveal while in this hostile land my country or my birth this urged by thee i swore when first i told thee my design to gaze on cleonices wondrous charms  again nor vain the caution  think o think how far it yet imports to keep the mighty secret alas my friend i tremble had your father been conscious whither fortune led the steps of his pharnaces could he know the land of lycomedes now detains his son  the idea starts a thousand fears should now some dreadful chance betray you to the foe i shudder at the thought  then let us hence and to the longing troops of pontus give a blooming hero promised often in vain then let us hasten  by my fathers shade i now adjure you  for pharnaces once revered his tiridates   arse witness heaven how dear i held him  artabasus only could claim a nearer duty over my heart the guide the great example of my youth methinks i now recall the fatal day that snatched him from us  o my loved agenor the scene is present to my eyes  i see the battle ranged when to my ardent gaze his hand experienced pointed out the files of rigid war and taught me where to drive the thunder of the field when heaven so willed a distant arrow sent with deadly aim pierced his brave breast   again then midst the distant fight it was not given agenors hand to close a dying parents eyes   arse these arms received the venerable chief  take take he cried this last embrace  still let the dear remembrance of tiridates counsels move his prince and for my sake be kind to my agenor he could no more but left in thee his pledge of truth and amity  since which my soul has held thee ever partner of her same her better half her other tiridates  embrace again i am indeed thy tiridates  yes my father from thy seats of bliss and peace see how thy prince rewards thy loyal faith and in his love supplies a parents loss  and yet forgive me prince thy words awake remembrance of that day for ever mourned   my father   arse go agenor since my last resolves are fixed  provide whatever requires to quit this court  to quit my cleonice though death is in the thought  thy piety reproaches mine  ere yet the mounting sun whose early ray now gilds the face of morn attain his midday seat the camp of pontus shall see pharnaces and agenor  exit agenor arse alone yet be still my beating heart  o cleonice i feel her now  instruct me every god in soothing speech  o teach my lips to breathe in gentlest sounds the fatal word  farewell  orontes here  and is not this the blessed the destined husband of my cleonice  i shall relapse  for if i think  distraction ensues and fame and peace are lost for ever  exit enter orontes oron sure twas arsetes that malignant planet that thwarts my course whenever my fiery soul would eaglewingd stretch her aspiring flight he soars above me still  have i not worn the mask of loyal faith smoothed over the dark the sullen brow of deep design with smiles my heart confessed not  what have i not done for thee ambition  let not pale remembrance review the past or paint a scene to stagger the sickly resolution  deeds long done that sleep secure from every mortal ken are but as shadows in the coward eye of conscience  hence  orontes soul disdains the phantoms of remorse  enter zopyrus now my zopyrus  speak have thou aught that claims my ear  zop i learn that the young stranger who so deeply witchd the madding multitude prepares this day to leave bithynias court  oron it cannot be  arsetes  speak  what at this fated time when war again unfolds his brazen portals and pontus brings to view its crested thousands a tempting prospect yet untried to prove his sword  it cannot be  zop this hour agenor declared arsetes purpose  oron speed it gods come near zopyrus to thy faithful ear i have often disclosed the secrets of my heart where love but most ambition holds his sway this stranger is my bane  i shrink beneath his better genius  even the field that once crowned this good sword with honors yields me now but withered laurels which his brow disdains while the blind herd on him with fullmonthd clamor lavish their shouts  zop yet fortune has secured your brightest hopes  has not our king declared orontes next by birth ascends the throne have not the assembled states confirmed the right of just succession hastening on the steep of downward life our king though high in spirit blazing with wasting light that soon must fail shall sudden sink in night and leave to thee a glorious rising to imperial greatness fair cleonice too shall bless your bed and with her beauty smooth the toils of empire  oron it is true the charms of cleonice well might claim the tongue of rapture  yet zopyrus while great ambitions sun lights up my flame the star of love looks sickly at his beams  zop what more can crown your wish when happiness in all your soul aspires to soon shall open her welcome arms  meantime the king my lord esteems and holds you high above the rank of nicomedias nobles  oron true zopyrus spite of the tardy warmth of cautious age i have worked me deep in lycomedes foul by more than common zeal to avenge his son but homebred faction spreading through the land compelled us to the hated truce with pontus till now nine moons elapsed this upstart chief stepped in to bear away the prize of arms due to my elder sword while teramenes with partial eye beheld his every deed and idolized the work himself had raised  zop yet common rumor speaks that friendship holds in strongest bands orontes and arsetes  oron even so my friend  and policy demands that he who runs the mingled race of life should learn to veil himself and often appear the thing he is not   zop should propitious fortune remove your rival hence   oron if this report be true the dark eclipse that late has frowned no more my friend shall intercept my fame the wars great field at this auspicious time begun shall not enrich a strangers hand but fall the harvest of orontes sword  exeunt act ii scene a garden with palm trees olives and other eastern plants cleonice alone alas it will not be and fond remembrance in vain recals the past  where where is now that reasons boast which over creation lifts the pride of man when fickle as the gale that sweeps the blossom from the bough our passions veer with each hour and shake our best resolves how is my bosom changed  no longer now from my example mothers teach the young and tender maid who dreads each swelling wave that heaves but gently over the stream of life to rise superior to her sexs weakness   enter arsinoe arsi friend of my life whose partial choice has given arsinoe long the privilege to pass the ceremonious bounds which birth and title had placed between us wherefore art thou changed from her that loved and loved but her arsinoe  cleo still art thou here the partner of my heart then wherefore this reproach and why complain of change that never yet this breast has known we were two plants that grew in friendships soil and promised fruits of neverdying love  arsi then every care that cleonice knew arsinoe too has shared  but late i have marked that cleonice different from herself shuns even arsinoes presence ever seeks the lone recess and brooding over her thoughts nurses some hidden grief  soon war again shall loose its rage  perhaps the threatening danger alarms your fear  cleo thou know that i alone remained the comfort of a fathers age when fate that tore polemon from the hope of his bithynia from a husbands arms a hapless consort severed thou rememberst my mother sad arete bowed with grief soon mixed her ashes with the sons she mourned then left in early youth my converse often soothed a fond parents pangs when recollection raised up the form of blessings lost for ever while as i grew paternal fondness saw with partial eye his cleonices mind expand beyond her sex hence not alone the soft the winning talents that to life give female polish but the greater arts ennobling man were taught my ripening age but over the rest my sire whose bosom glowed tavenge his son enured my thoughts to cherish deep hatred of the so by whom he fell  arsi hatred and vengeance ill agree my friend with tender grief like thine  estranged from all thy wonted temper solitude bespeaks far other change  then seek not to deceive the searching eye of friendship  cleo alas arsinoe i feel the woman here  thou said but now that war again must soon unloose its rage is there no cause for fear whatever the tongue of stoic fortitude may boast the mind the generous mind that owns lifes dearest ties will nourish feelings pride disdains to own  arsi revolve our present state our countrys sword now used to victory gives high expectance of future triumphs while for you my friend if love if grandeur charm bithynias throne shall raise you high and hymen light his torch at cupids flame  is not the first of men the first of heroes yours yes cleonice each anxious doubt shall fleet like morning mist and all be lost in your orontes arms  cleo orontes arms  o heaven what have i said by every tie of love  but whither  whither now rove my thoughts  leave me leave me my arsinoe to brood in secret over my treasured sorrows  arsi scarce from her tenth fair crescent has the moon silvered nights fleecy robe since i have beheld though silent i have beheld thy altered mien methinks ere since the day when midst the ranks of rebel arms my father scapd with life saved by the gallant aid of brave arsetes  ha thou art pale  and now the mantling blood returns once more  what can this mean  my heart has caught the alarm and oh my soul forebodes distress and anguish to my hopeless love  aside cleo it must be so  hence every vain respect i can no more dissemble  heat arsinoe hear then and pity cleonices weakness while lycomedes with a monarchs care plans future schemes of greatness  cleonice lost to herself her rank her sexs glory doats on the merits of a youth unknown  arsi orontes then   cleo orontes  name him not  i own his worth  i own the sacred rights a king and father claim  but i must own though while i speak confusion fills my soul arsetes bears down all and though the pride of fortune raised me high above his hopes a pleader here which nothing could withstand by looks by deeds by all that can ennoble the pride of youthful manhood had prepared my easy bosom to receive the guest that nw sole tyrant reigns my bosoms lord  arsi then am i lost indeed  aside cleo go my arsinoe and learn if aught is rumored that pertains to my arsetes  soon this favored hero will leave bithynias court  but still remember veiled in thy faithful breast to keep my secret to thee i trust my life my fame my all exit arsin cleon alone lost and bewildered still i rove in fates distressful labyrinth  why cleonice why did thou leave the shore of calm indifference to launch upon the dangerous sea of love  enter lycomedes and teramenes lyco this day my cleonice surely dawns with happiest omens  he whose valiant arm joined with orontes quelled our rebel sons to whom the public voice gave every suffrage of grateful tribute threatened to forsake our realm and bear to other climes his sword but teramenes who with counsel sage for ever watches over his countrys weal has found the happy means to fix him here to graft his virtues on bithynias stock blessed earnest of revenge  cleo what means my father aside my lord the duty cleonice owes her countrys welfare and her fathers honor demands my thanks for every aid that heaven gives to bithynias strength  and sure arsetes stands first in martial praise  but say my father what happy means has teramenes found to fix him yours  lyco such means as often have dealt destruction on mankind what often has drawn the sword of violence may now secure a nations same and vengeance  yes whatever arsetes race or country beautys charms insure his future service  fair arsinoe thy virtuous friend shall bind her native land in grateful thanks for such a heros valor our friend our teramenes joins to his arsinoes hand and gives in such a son a great ally in lycomedes cause led by orontes and arsetes valor what may bithynias squadrons not atchieve  cleo aside support me heaven to ter  sir i confess the virtues of my arsinoe and her beautys charms permit me yet to ask you if arsetes has ever revealed  perhaps some distant fair whose love and beauty had possessed his soul impels him to forsake bithynias court  ter no princess  if this judgment not unskilled in human kind can read the thoughts of men he loves arsinoe late have i observed his bosom laboring with the stifled passion of recent birth and well i know my daughter owns with a virgin blush arsetes virtues nor could a youth whose fortune only rests in his own merits and his sword refuse that hand which nicomedias noblest peers with transport would receive  lyc why droops my daughter still cherish hope a train of better days succeeds where vengeance brightens up the prospect my ages darling it is for thee my soul still labors though declining years would fain woo me to shades of peace  to raise thee high with thy orontes and avenge my boy i scorn repse  nor will i rest till these old eyes behold in chains or breathless stretched the cruel foe by whom polemon fell come teramenes let us seek arsetes then once again renew our vows to pour the wars whole rage on artabasus head  exeunt lyc and ter cleo alone it is enough  misfortune now has spent her utmost shafts  and i defy the future o cleonice has thy struggling bosom for this so long contended often when pride of inborn dignity when sense of fame and every duty to a father urged my soul to combat love  how have the words of perfidy ensnared my easy heart deceived  rejected  wedded to arsinoe but hence  avaunt  i will  i would forget the perjured yet the once beloved arsetes but see  the traitor comes  o heaven away with womans weakness  meet him as befits a princess slighted and her love betrayed  enter arsetes arse while thus the fairest of her sex withdraws to solitude and sadness shuns the gaze of admiration let arsetes yet intrude on cleonices lonely hours ere cruel fate compels   cleo my lord forbear  this needed not  a heros towering soul soars high above the weakness of the lover since thou will part it is not cleonice can here detain arsetes  other charms  but i forget myself  excuse me sir  whatever your aims  let not my presence damp the glorious fortune love and fate prepare  and think not ever awakened from her dream of fond credulity that cleonice will cloud your joys or stop your path to greatness  exit arse alone where am i sure i dream  my every sense is lost in wild amazement   enter agenor again all is ready and nothing now remains but that we quit bithynias court for artabasus camp  what mean those looks of sorrow wherefore heaves your swelling breast while clouded with despair your eyes in silent pause reproach the gods  arse alas what shall i say  could thou believe it agenor she for whom my soul had near forgot a kingdoms fame a fathers love each nice respect of honor made my name to future times the scorn of every tongue that fathers to their sons might point the example and bid them fear to fall as fell pharnaces even she my friend has now with cruel scorn repaid my love   again o sir forgive agenor but sure in pity fate concurs even here to hasten your resolves  whatever the cause of cleonices anger every moment is winged with peril  think what foes conspire against your fathers peace his life and fame  arse no more no more agenor  best of friends in thee thy father tiridates speaks pharnaces still thou shall retrieve thy glory burst from the veil of dark obscurity and blaze in virtues beam  but yet agenor o yet indulge a heart that sinks beneath accumulated anguish  can i leave my cleonice thus  alas who knows how soon by rash resentment urged her hand may to orontes yield her plighted faith while absent hence pharnaces   again will thou then will thou then linger here unmindful still of fame and artabasus  arse no  this night be witness every power we leave the court  this only day indulge a lovers fondness the care be thine that artabasus soon receive this signet whith the welcome news that his pharnaces his expected son will join ere yet they reach the bounds of pontus his native bands  there kneeling at his feet implore forgiveness  in this interval of fate and love these lips shall once again assail with every soothing eloquence the cruel cleonice then agenor to artabasus will i open all my secret heart  perhaps some future day o busy hope may give me undisguisd to plead my cause before her when my sight shall in her breast revive the tender flame and love with endless rapture crown pharnaces  exeunt severally scene a gallery enter lycomedes and teramenes lyco how stand the soldiers hopes my teramenes what spirit breathes among their ranks to give a presage of the war  tera the troops on fire demand alone orontes and arsetes with loud reproach they execrate the so and hail with joy the near expiring truce  lyco yes teramenes  civil discord now that sheaths her sword has left revenge to rear her dreadful banner  nemesis has heard our solemn vows against exulting pontus no more polemons ghost shall haunt my dreams arsetes and orontes shall extend my name to latest times the glorious love of empire and of arms that fired my youth shall warm my frozen age  too long compelled i smothered in my breast the flame of hatred but when my soul forgets thy loss polemon disgrace and ruin over these silver locks shed their black influence  orontes welcome what hearst thou of the foe  enter orontes oron not unprepared the king of pontus from heracleas walls has drawn the choicest sons of valor forth that lie encamped beside parthenius stream  tera it is said they wait the arrival of pharnaces the kingdoms hope whom artabasus sent what time bithynia signed the truce with pontus to distant rome to train his youth in arms and fame with loudest tongue proclaims his praise  lyco a stripling when he left his fathers court  tera he was and now scarce twenty funs have ripened our fruitful years since artabasus

boy  thy pious arms embraced my lost polemon as lifes gushing stream sprinkled his budding laurels  where was then a fathers vengeful sword while to his tent you hoar him pale and senseless distant far detained by coward age these ears received the dreadful tidings when his frantic mother ended her wretched being  powerful jove shed from thy bitter urn the dregs of anguish on my poor span of life withhold each comfort which creeping years overwhelmed with sorrow claim if i forgive the cruel hand that cropped this blooming plant which else had flourished now and sheltered with his shade my wasting age  oron soon shall welead the embattled squadrons forth on artabasus  should this boasted son return though conquest plumed he comes perhaps a fated victim   lyco o that thought orontes gives vigor to my nerves  ye powers of vengeance hear hear a fathers voice and through his son reach artabasus heart that after years of tedious expectation now at length returned and scarcely welcomed he may fall a dreadful sacrifice  then through the sense the thrilling sense of fond parental love by his pharnaces let him know the pangs of lycomedes when polemon fell  exeunt act iii scene a private apartment enter cleonice and arsinoe cleonice talk not of comfort  it is in vain arsinoe arsetes leaves us  my relentless scorn impelled by frantic jealousy the madness of womans love drives from bithynias court the first of warriors his right hand that still held victory captive now to happier realms shall bear his fortune and his same  the sun that rises on the war shall see our troops pale and dismayed for their arsetes lost who knows the event  the same declining sun may blush upon bithynias shame and gild with favoring rays the tent of artabasus may smile upon his arms while lycomedes curses each day that wider spreads his shame  arsi alas my friend your warmth of temper frames the gloomiest prospects of imagined terror  though fortune now may frown   cleo thee too arsinoe thee have i wronged  forgive thy cleonice  art thou to blame if framed for gentlest passions thy breast the seat of innocence and love confessed the manly beauties of arsetes not bound by cruel ties of fame or duty rouse rouse my feeble virtue  yes i feel new strength and should arsetes yet remain  i think arsinoe  heaven support the thought i think  i could resolve to yield him to thee  but see thy father   enter teramenes ter all the hopes we formed to keep arsetes here dissolve in air thus often presumptuous man too fondly grasps ideal good the hero whom we deemed secured by every tie declines the hand by hymen given endowed with wealth and honors while candor blushes on his modest cheek he owns arsinoes virtues owns the fate that now forbids him to receive her love or longer to remain bithynias guest  cleo still art thou true arsetes  ter my arsinoe why heaves thy bosom  still our guardian gods we trust will smile  ars my lord arsio stands prepared for all  be witness heaven how often i checked each flattering hope forgive my father the involuntary sigh perhaps the last the fruitless effort of expiring passion  ter call up the thoughts that suit thy sex and rank time shall with lenient hand relieve thy anguish thy princess with the gracious warmth of friendship shall shed the balm of comfort in thy wounds  still art thou sad  permit me cleonice awhile retired with dear paternal counsels to arm her tender breast that peace again may chase despair and ease an anxious father  exit with arsinoe cle alone though my heart joys to find arsetes true still am i wretched  yet again methinks fain would i once again behold that face where love where aith  but o it is madness all doomed to orontes when the lonely hour invites to shades of sorrow tyrant duty makes even my grief a crime  but let me still let me once more while yet without reproach i may indulge the sight behold arsetes take the last sad adieu  and like a wretch that shivers on the precipice of fate enjoy the parting glimpse of peace and happiness then sink at once to misery and orontes  exit scene a ball enter lycomedes teramenes and orontes lyc the gods have heard our vows my

he for this in romes immortal ranks learn the brave trade of arms to edge the sword of base assassination that the wiles of black conspiracy might catch that life which never had sunk in equal field of combat yes  my arsetes  to pharnaces cruelty thou fallst a victim  fallst by him whose arm had else perhaps confessed thy valors force then had those limbs my father never felt the weight of chains  yet should orontes live his valorous arm  perhaps pharnaces life atones for poor arsetes   arta every power forbid the implication lycomedes could i as well appease each vengeful thought for lost polemon as i now can clear the virtue of my son by lying fame traduced   cleon did not his lips all pale in death proclaim pharnaces guilty  arta there indeed mysterious darkness lurks  but lycomedes speak  should the hero whose triumphant arm espoused bithynias cause  should he yet live   cleon yet live what means this cruel sport with woe  arta hear then and wondering hear  arsetes lives arsetes and pharnaces are the same  lyco the same  speak artabasus   enter officer officer haste my sovereign haste to the grove of palms  the prince assailed by numbers with orontes at their head a hundred lances glitter at his breast and all their cry is vengeance and arsetes  arta what do i hear now cruel lycomedes now cleonice glut your rage  yet know arsetes lives and lives in my pharnaces or this dread moment seals perhaps his doom and ends a wretched parent   exeunt artabasus and barzanes attended cleo does he live live in pharnaces o mysterious heaven should it be thus how has my ruthless hatred pursued the man whom most i loved  the man madness is in the thought who now may breathe his last   lyco forbid it virtue  gods i feel a secret impulse here  it must not be  for me he often has

to make excuses for your simple cheer and i that have no interest in his scenes must bear the train of tragic kings and queens shall i support the weakness of his muse  egad  if so  i will fit him with abuse  i will soon dissect his finespun work and show that all his plot has more of farce than woe for after all the creatures much deceived if ever he thinks his tale can be believed so tame and so inanimate his maid is  how very different from our modern ladies  what could a blooming lass with ripened charms be held so long from her admirers arms  if such were truths in prudish heathen climes examples vary in our later times  then for theatric play  how poor how cold a heroines language should be nobly bold outstrip the decency of vulgar life mouth at the heavens and set the gods at strife  time was indeed an antiquated bard paid to that beldame nature some regard and drew his females with such simple features that all who saw believed them human creatures plain desdemona bore no trace of art and portia played a wifes domestic part while constance showed but what before we knew and only grieved as real mothers do  shall this stale poet give the drama law who poorly copied only what he saw nay stole from life in every clime and age the characters that fill his boasted page  well as i live it is he  looking out  o axe you come does all go well  poor devil  seal his doom this livelong night he watches every eye talks like his heroes in soliloquy  then starts aside  what something goes amiss  sure it is the distant murmur of a hiss  alas kind soul  i pity his condition and
