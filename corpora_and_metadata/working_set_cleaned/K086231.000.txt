the insolvent or filial piety a tragedy  acted at the theater in the haymarket by authority under the direction of mr cibber  written by the late aaron hill esquire author of merope partly on a plan of sir william davenants and mr massengers  london rinted and sold by w reeve opposite cranecourt in fleet street mdcclviii price one shilling and sixpence  preface above thirty years ago mr wilks then one of the patentees of the theater royal gave an old manuscript play called the guiltless adultress or judge in his own cause to mr theophilus cibber who was then manager of what used to be called the summer company this company consisted in general of the junior part of the performers who during the vacation time commonly acted twice or thrice a week as they played on shares divided in proportion according to their several salaries stipulated in the winter their endeavors to please the town generally produced em double pay on those nights sometimes more  this kept most of em from strolling into the country for the summer season it added to their income and gave em an opportunity of getting forward in their business in a more regular manner than has been practiced of late years it had its effect performers then tried their force in characters in the summer and became by practice therein gradually acquainted with their business and the town with them nor was every one supposed to be equal at their very setting out to the most capital characters of the drama  but to return to the play  by the hand and the long time it had been in the possession of the managers it was supposed to have been one of sir william davenants formerly a patentee and by the opening of the piece palpably was founded on a play of massengers called the fatal dowry  this last piece has often been enquired after in vain  mr wilks recommended it to mr cibber to be got up in the summer with some alterations  it lay by some time  in the year      it was intended for the stage in the summer  but the performers were then shut out of the theater by the then patentees of drury lane  a candid account of which will be given when mr cibber has a proper opportunity to speak thereof in his purposed history of the stage  in the following year when the principal comedians of that time returned from the theater in the haymarket and played under the direction of mr fletewood it was proposed again to have a summer company as the use of it both to the actors and managers had been experienced many light pieces were then revived and several new petit pieces brought on the stage such as the devil to pay the mock doctor etc which proved afterward lasting entertainments in the winter season  twas in the devil to pay in a summer season mrs clive then miss kaftor first surpised a delighted audience with a proof of her extraordinary genius in the character of nell her spirited simplicity and strong natural humor carried her through the part with an astonishing variety and propriety she showed herself an excellent original  she has had many followers some imitators and it is but justice to add no equal she then promised to be what she has since proved one of the first performers of the stage and when judiciously examined in the general various cast of parts she acts it is imagined she will be allowed not to be inferior to any performer of her time  well this is digression on digression  pardon it reader and let it pass  in      a summer company was again proposed they played once the play of george barnwell to a very great house the manager jealous least the company should get too much ordered the farther acting to be stopped it was judged indeed the jealousy of some actors who were not concerned in the summer gave this advice  so the affair dropped  and there has been no summer playing since  but to return to our play  on a revisal it was judged to want some alterations  accordingly mr cibbee requested his kind friend the late mr hill who was never happier than when he had an opportunity to do a friendly office to correct it  how much he was taken with the play will appear on a perusal of some letters of his relative thereto published in his collection and sent to mr theophilus cibber about the year       let it suffice here to add  mr hill almost new wrote the whole and the last act was entirely his in conduct sentiment diction etc  it was brought on the stage at the theater in the haymarket early this year       when his grace the duke of devonshire humanely considered the unfortunate extraordinary condition of a comedian who has had more frequent opportunities of happily entertaining the town and gave him liberty to try his fortune awhile at the little theater in the haymarket  but what mighty matters could be hoped from a young raw unexperienced company hastily collected and as hastily to be employed but sinking men catch at reeds while established theaters were open to entertain the town with the united force of tragedy comedy opera pantomime song dance and a long train of et ceteras  some rational and some other exhibitions which are so frequently followed in a winter season  mr cibber was out of pocket by his undertaking yet this does not prevent his having a grateful sense of the favors he received from those noble personages and other friends who have frequently pratonisd his undertakings  to acknowledge a favor is but gratitude  to name the persons might appear vanity  it may not be improper on this occasion to signify as mr cibber has not had the wished success at the theater in the haymarket  that mr rich has with great goodnature granted the use of his theater in covent garden to mr cibber for his benefit the beginning of next month  when a new mocktragedy which many persons of taste have approved of and which the author has kindly allowed mr cibber to make use of on this occasion will be acted with all the variety of scenes machines songs dirges processions etc etc  requisite to embellish  alamoderne this extraordinary heroic piece  prologue spoke by mr cibber then in mourning for his father our scenes tonight would natures pangs impart true filiel piety should reach the heart i feel it now  that thought the tear shall claim to merit sacred and immortal fame now sleeps the honored dust which gave me birth recent in death but newly lodged in earth forgive the

fierce fires we raise lend but attention  and your tears shall praise few are the public stains that tinge the fame of this brave rich goodnatured nations name yet one there is  from times long license grown  that blots out pity  and turns flesh to stone it is  the deaf rage that where hard wants oppress doubles the insolvent suffrers dire distress stung by this wasp past friendships lose their weight warped estimation wears a face like hate suspended mercy bids affliction smart and in a scale of flint immures her heart self  yet unreachd by woe  made proud by gain blind to disaster

should service by any man performed to bless his country exact his countrys mercy  what though my father ere scarce arrived at youth out acted man numbered that day no part of life wherein he snatched not some new trophy from your foes was he for that to triumph over your courts superior to the laws he fought to save what though the sums he died indebted for were borrowed not for his but public use

squeeze no scruple from the law that lends your selon hearts the weight of right i know there is no music to your ears more pleasing than the groans of men in pain the tears of widows and the orphans cry feast but your happier sense of wealths coarse joy but rather than my fathers reverend dust shall want its place in that still monument where all his silent ancestors sleep safe take me your living pledge  renounce the dead and in my fettered freedom find revenge i am possessed of strength to scorn your malice shun the detested world and love restraint i would forget the sun that shines on you and choose my dwelling where no light can enter  release my fathers corpse  valdore alas young lord consider well what hopes you cast away your liberty youth joy life friends and fame your

bind his body  old aumele let him alone  the young man loves renown if he courts misery let misery meet him provided these consent the court objects not  chalons consent  the wrongful doubt offends their wisdom can these tradetools lie sullen and shun work when willing interest hires em  calls their idol and shall their zeal grow deaf  and drop their worship  from my dead fathers corpse what hopes of profit nay they have there no chance of giving pain what relish of revenge where it is not felt in me they are sure at least of present vengeance and cherish prospect of some future gain   st

a black return  to me who loved him what though he knew not half her claims to pity he should have felt for me i loved  i watched her raised her from prattling infancy to wonder she touched my charmed perhaps too partial heart i prized her own sweet bloom  still more endeared by her dead mothers likeness he should have stopped when his fell point was raised and thought whose pangs were to partake her sufferings  chalons had she been dead  had she  but oh she is not  been partaker of her lost paramours disastrous fate think then  oh then  how had my horror torn me who scarce support with life the undue reproach  valdore what says he my la foy does he not mean that my amelia lives  la foy she does my lord i told you that before but your sad heart repelled the offered comfort  valdore generous chalons scarce has the daughters crime more wronged thy goodness than did the fathers anguish  chalons oh my dear lord  could some descending angel but restore her innocence for ever lost  lend peace of mind once more  and make life tasteful to her to such excess of fondness am i here is that i would burn discernments eyes to blindness rather than see a fault in one so loved  so much has this days torture cost my soul  la foy chalons thou have a sure friends voice in heaven my general often would say  pray soldiers pray  if you deserve success  it is yours for asking alas i have too seldom tried this power who knows but some such angel as you wished for i am no teazing troublesome invoker may in yon closet on my prayer descend and whiten the stained name that paints your love goes and unlocks the closet valdore poor man  thy griefs have touched thy pitying friend till his hurt brain grows frantic  la foy appear thou wingclipt demon  if thou hopst to shun the doom that waits perditions tribe wash thy saved soul from all its native black and take an angels form  truths convert friend  la foy leads out florella valdore what means this  florella  florella i once was florella but heaven has touched my heart with will so new that my old name offends me  la foy answer first truly and briefly as when late i caught thee skulking through nights lone gloom that wanted shade to suit thy darker purpose  answer plainly is thy unhappy lady innocent il aumeles dire admission to her chamber or is she guilty of it  florella innocent  valdore how  innocent  chalons a wife  her husband absent admits a lover in his room at midnight  found in her chamber in a loose disrobe nay in the husbands nightdress  yet all this thy venal evidence false maid calls innocence  la foy pray let her speak my lord you are a judge should an accuser browbeat witnesses or interrupt their answers to valdore  chalons nay la foy pity thus forced grows insult i have told thee i heard her loud reproach confess the guilt to amorous aumele when kneeling by her bed she called him cruel aumele  bid him begone for if he there was found her name was blasted  la foy away with such strained proofs had i myself been there but on some far more honest purpose poor soul she might have said the same to me when blundring accident alone had brought me  valdore i think chalons you said that aumele knelt but near amelias bed  was it not more  florella had it been more  she still were innocent unconscious of his coming i alone was guilty i betrayed by bribes profusion admitted the deaf headstrong thoughtless lover both to the house and chamber i advised the nightgrowns needful cover i gave notice of your wronged lordships absence taught him how to personate your chanced return soft whispering that if she waked not ere he reached her bed whatever succeeded might be meant for you  la foy now now chalons what now becomes of all those mad misproofs of guilt she shines untouched by by heaven it is plain to me she waked too full of your remembered image to mistake for that the intruders loathed one she reproached not her accomplished but intended ruin and though the traitor not unjustly fell his crime was nobly by her guarded virtue prevented and ideal  florella never breathed a virtue more untainted may my soul in times last dreadful judgment meet no mercy if ever wife more faithful blessed a husband or with more cautious conduct feared a lover  valdore oh what have thou deserved  if this her due  chalons pity forgiveness  a safe bought retreat to some sweet convents silent space for prayer for penitence to heaven  and scape from shame more shall be here is for oh my gracious lord it is by her just amends for castoff sin your own paternal tenderness  my love  and my brave honest generous friends compassion are all redeemed at once from deep despair go fly florella  take this guilty key  tell the poor captive innocent this tale and court her to be blessed by blessing all gives her the key and exit florella valdore kneeling thou evergracious ever present power that first inspires our virtue  loves it next and guards it in conclusion  take oh take an old mans awful thanks for days prolonged days doomed by grief to pain  now saved for joy  chalons kneeling from me most worthless of the mercy shown accept allworshipd author of all bliss the pourdout hearts whole tide of grateful prayer  la foy let not me seem least sensible of zeal because less taught speak it kneels too  had i words i would adore heaven eloquently  now  receive a plain blunt hearts sincerest thanks for more than i deserve  or know to tell  florella within speaks florella oh horror horror  comfort comes too late death intercepts relief  and help is vain  all start up in confusion and la foy running out meets and assists florella leading in amelia bleeding chalons defend me from this visions ghastly menace or i am lost again  valdore hapless amelia what has thy rashness done just heaven but now heard our given thanks  thy innocence stood cleared florella guilty proved thy virtue wronged and in this illchosen crisis of our joy thou murderst thy own blessing  amelia kneeling to valdore heaven was too kind that eased my honored fathers aching sense of a lost daughters shame death in this thought robbed of its sharpest sting grows half a friend to chalons who raises her weeping oh too unkind chalons  what shall i say  what shall distrusted honor  think  of thee i cannot  must not  blame  thy dreadful rage appearance was against me  ah ebb slow my offered blood  give my sick trembling heart one moments short reprieve  to clear my name  chalons pause my faint injured charmer  thy cleared name is spotless as thy beauty  valdore save thy shook spirits  chalons florella fly  go call immediate aid  la foy no  let her stay  i will haste myself my lord exit la foy valdore how have thou given thy breast that fatal wound  amelia shut up with horror and bound in with death twas natural to despise familiar fear shunning the breathless corpse that clogged my way i stumbled over a sword  thus learnt its use  and thanked it for escape from dreaded shame living and hopeless to attract belief to the unhappy story of my woe the eye of every gazers dumb reproach had given a sharper wound than this i chose  valdore did thou discover the vile youths disguise or  were thou sleeping and unconscious found when his bold craft surpised thee  amelia troubled thoughts for my departed lords so sudden absence chased from my eye lids wish all power of sleep anxiously doubtful for his safe return alarmed by apprehensions busy fears and wondering what strange hasty cause had called him  i started  when the doors soft opening sound gave glanced admission to the intrusive tread  poring i shook with terror  for i saw by the pale gleamy ghostlike glaze of light that nor the force nor freedom showed that ease of manly grace that marks my mienful lord  chalons oh i was born to curses  thus to wrong such tenderness of virtue  amelia twice i raised my frighted voice  and twice he tried in vain to sooth it into silence failing that grew fearful of discovery  paused amazed stepped back  returned  stood doubtful  till at last he threw himself on his presumptuous knees as my dear angry lord you found and heard him nearer than that by the blessed hopes i haste to when from this world of grief i rise to peace he never had approached me  ah  farewell  my swimming eyes dimmed over have lost your forms and i am covered round with dark  sick  shadow  valdore kissing her dear dying child  her lips are cold and pale farewell too illstard girl  farewell  for ever  chalons she cannot die heaven is too kind too just to excellence like here is  to let that be  valdore lead to her chamber  gently guide her feet they lose  oh kiling sight their own sweet motion exit amelia led off by chalons and florella enter la foy with belgard valdore alas youre come too late see where they lead her  lifeless and past all sense of arts lost care  la foy follow belgard haste urge thy utmost skill snatch her from death  and thou commandst my fortune exit belgard valdore i knew belgard  unknowing of his skill  la foy he practiced many a year saved many a life in wars deep wounding rage  but peace came on and his shunned virtue starved him  twas not him i purposed to have called but met him coming to warn us lord aumele who now supports him  fired at his sons presumptuous levity his watched admission here and whole nights absence comes with intent to note and tell his practice then take such measures as you best approve  valdore what shall we do  he seeks a living son he finds a dead one unprepared event but he must bear his part  and share distress  la foy twas due to his hard heart  my curse provoked by his unseeling wrong to my dead general falls heavy on his head  to teach him pity  enter chalons and belgard chalons blessed my la foy be thy successful call of this good angels aid  she wakes  she breathes  he tells me she shall live  her opening eye adds to the mornings light and shines once more  valdore then is indulgent heaven grown kind indeed  belgard the wound itself not mortal gathered danger from weakning waste of blood her spirits thence lost vigor to sustain the toilsome length of agonizd complaint i am told she made so fainting she seemed dead but rest with aid of skilled attention will restore her soon  la foy let us forethink of old aumeles approach  valdore i will justify the fate that reached his son  la foy warned by that fate the brutal mind shall feel pangs due to cruel breasts with hearts of steel on their own heads shall fall woes driving rain and drown too bold contempt of others pain pity shall smile to see the unpitier fall and he who aids no want shall suffer all  finis epilogue by aaron hill esquire spoke by amelia i have scapd tonight two terrible disasters my honors
