the old english baron   by clara reeve     preface    as this story is of a species which though not new is out of the common track it has been thought necessary to point out some circumstances to the reader which will elucidate the design and it is hoped will induce him to form a favourable as well as a right judgment of the work before him  this story is the literary offspring of the castle of otranto written upon the same plan with a design to unite the most attractive and interesting circumstances of the ancient romance and modern novel at the same time it assumes a character and manner of its own that differs from both it is distinguished by the appellation of a gothic story being a picture of gothic times and manners fictitious stories have been the delight of all times and all countries by oral tradition in barbarous by writing in more civilized ones and although some persons of wit and learning have condemned them indiscriminately i would venture to affirm that even those who so much affect to despise them under one form will receive and embrace them under another  thus for instance a man shall admire and almost adore the epic poems of the ancients and yet despise and execrate the ancient romances which are only epics in prose  history represents human nature as it is in real life alas too often a melancholy retrospect romance displays only the amiable side of the picture it shews the pleasing features and throws a veil over the blemishes mankind are naturally pleased with what gratifies their vanity and vanity like all other passions of the human heart may be rendered subservient to good and useful purposes  i confess that it may be abused and become an instrument to corrupt the manners and morals of mankind so may poetry so may plays so may every kind of composition but that will prove nothing more than the old saying lately revived by the philosophers the most in fashion that every earthly thing has two handles  the business of romance is first to excite the attention and secondly to direct it to some useful or at least innocent end happy the writer who attains both these points like richardson and not unfortunate or undeserving praise he who gains only the latter and furnishes out an entertainment for the reader  having in some degree opened my design i beg leave to conduct my reader back again till he comes within view of the castle of otranto a work which as already has been observed is an attempt to unite the various merits and graces of the ancient romance and modern novel to attain this end there is required a sufficient degree of the marvellous to excite the attention enough of the manners of real life to give an air of probability to the work and enough of the pathetic to engage the heart in its behalf  the book we have mentioned is excellent in the two last points but has a redundancy in the first the opening excites the attention very strongly the conduct of the story is artful and judicious the characters are admirably drawn and supported the diction polished and elegant yet with all these brilliant advantages it palls upon the mind though it does not upon the ear and the reason is obvious the machinery is so violent that it destroys the effect it is intended to excite had the story been kept within the utmost verge of probability the effect had been preserved without losing the least circumstance that excites or detains the attention  for instance we can conceive and allow of the appearance of a ghost we can even dispense with an enchanted sword and helmet but then they must keep within certain limits of credibility a sword so large as to require an hundred men to lift it a helmet that by its own weight forces a passage through a courtyard into an arched vault big enough for a man to go through a picture that walks out of its frame a skeleton ghost in a hermits cowlwhen your expectation is wound up to the highest pitch these circumstances take it down with a witness destroy the work of imagination and instead of attention excite laughter i was both surprised and vexed to find the enchantment dissolved which i wished might continue to the end of the book and several of its readers have confessed the same disappointment to me the beauties are so numerous that we cannot bear the defects but want it to be perfect in all respects  in the course of my observations upon this singular book it seemed to me that it was possible to compose a work upon the same plan wherein these defects might be avoided and the keeping as in painting might be preserved  but then i began to fear it might happen to me as to certain translators and imitators of shakespeare the unities may be preserved while the spirit is evaporated however i ventured to attempt it i read the beginning to a circle of friends of approved judgment and by their approbation was encouraged to proceed and to finish it      the old english baron a gothic story   in the minority of henry the sixth king of england when the renowned john duke of bedford was regent of france and humphrey the good duke of gloucester was protector of england a worthy knight called sir philip harclay returned from his travels to england his native country he had served under the glorious king henry the fifth with distinguished valour had acquired an honourable fame and was no less esteemed for christian virtues than for deeds of chivalry after the death of his prince he entered into the service of the greek emperor and distinguished his courage against the encroachments of the saracens in a battle there he took prisoner a certain gentleman by name m zadisky of greek extraction but brought up by a saracen officer this man he converted to the christian faith after which he bound him to himself by the ties of friendship and gratitude and he resolved to continue with his benefactor after thirty years travel and warlike service he determined to return to his native land and to spend the remainder of his life in peace and by devoting himself to works of piety and charity prepare for a better state hereafter  this noble knight had in his early youth contracted a strict friendship with the only son of the lord lovel a gentleman of eminent virtues and accomplishments during sir philips residence in foreign countries he had frequently written to his friend and had for a time received answers the last informed him of the death of old lord lovel and the marriage of the young one but from that time he had heard no more from him sir philip imputed it not to neglect or forgetfulness but to the difficulties of intercourse common at that time to all travellers and adventurers when he was returning home he resolved after looking into his family affairs to visit the castle of lovel and enquire into the situation of his friend he landed in kent attended by his greek friend and two faithful servants one of which was maimed by the wounds he had received in the defence of his master  sir philip went to his family seat in yorkshire he found his mother and sister were dead and his estates sequestered in the hands of commissioners appointed by the protector he was obliged to prove the reality of his claim and the identity of his person by the testimony of some of the old servants of his family after which every thing was restored to him he took possession of his own house established his household settled the old servants in their former stations and placed those he brought home in the upper offices of his family he then left his friend to superintend his domestic affairs and attended by only one of his old servants he set out for the castle of lovel in the west of england they travelled by easy journeys but towards the evening of the second day the servant was so ill and fatigued he could go no further he stopped at an inn where he grew worse every hour and the next day expired sir philip was under great concern for the loss of his servant and some for himself being alone in a strange place however he took courage ordered his servants funeral attended it himself and having shed a tear of humanity over his grave proceeded alone on his journey  as he drew near the estate of his friend he began to enquire of every one he met whether the lord lovel resided at the seat of his ancestors he was answered by one he did not know by another he could not tell by a third that he never heard of such a person sir philip thought it strange that a man of lord lovels consequence should be unknown in his own neighbourhood and where his ancestors had usually resided he ruminated on the uncertainty of human happiness this world said he has nothing for a wise man to depend upon i have lost all my relations and most of my friends and am even uncertain whether any are remaining i will however be thankful for the blessings that are spared to me and i will endeavour to replace those that i have lost if my friend lives he shall share my fortune with me his children shall have the reversion of it and i will share his comforts in return but perhaps my friend may have met with troubles that have made him disgusted with the world perhaps he has buried his amiable wife or his promising children and tired of public life he is retired into a monastery at least i will know what all this silence means  when he came within a mile of the castle of lovel he stopped at a cottage and asked for a draught of water a peasant master of the house brought it and asked if his honour would alight and take a moments refreshment sir philip accepted his offer being resolved to make farther enquiry before he approached the castle he asked the same questions of him that he had before of others  which lord lovel said the man does your honour enquire after  the man whom i knew was called arthur said sir philip  ay said the peasant he was the only surviving son of richard lord lovel as i think  very true friend he was so  alas sir said the man he is dead he survived his father but a short time  dead say you how long since  about fifteen years to the best of my remembrance  sir philip sighed deeply  alas said he what do we by living long but survive all our friends but pray tell me how he died  i will sir to the best of my knowledge ant please your honour i heard say that he attended the king when he went against the welch rebels and he left his lady big with child and so there was a battle fought and the king got the better of the rebels there came first a report that none of the officers were killed but a few days after there came a messenger with an account very different that several were wounded and that the lord lovel was slain which sad news overset us all with sorrow for he was a noble gentleman a bountiful master and the delight of all the neighbourhood  he was indeed said sir philip all that is amiable and good he was my dear and noble friend and i am inconsolable for his loss but the unfortunate lady what became of her  why ant please your honour they said she died of grief for the loss of her husband but her death was kept private for a time and we did not know it for certain till some weeks afterwards  the will of heaven be obeyed said sir philip but who succeeded to the title and estate  the next heir said the peasant a kinsman of the deceased sir walter lovel by name  i have seen him said sir philip formerly but where was he when these events happened  at the castle of lovel sir he came there on a visit to the lady and waited there to receive my lord at his return from wales when the news of his death arrived sir walter did every thing in his power to comfort her and some said he was to marry her but she refused to be comforted and took it so to heart that she died  and does the present lord lovel reside at the castle  no sir  who then  the lord baron fitzowen  and how came sir walter to leave the seat of his ancestors  why sir he married his sister to this said lord and so he sold the castle to him and went away and built himself a house in the north country as far as northumberland i think they call it  that is very strange said sir philip  so it is please your honour but this is all i know about it  i thank you friend for your intelligence i have taken a long journey to no purpose and have met with nothing but cross accidents this life is indeed a pilgrimage pray direct me the nearest way to the next monastery  noble sir said the peasant it is full five miles off the night is coming on and the ways are bad i am but a poor man and cannot entertain your honour as you are used to but if you will enter my poor cottage that and every thing in it are at your service  my honest friend i thank you heartily said sir philip your kindness and hospitality might shame many of higher birth and breeding i will accept your kind offerbut pray let me know the name of my host  john wyatt sir an honest man though a poor one and a christian man though a sinful one  whose cottage is this  it belongs to the lord fitzowen  what family have you  a wife two sons and a daughter who will all be proud to wait upon your honour let me hold your honours stirrup whilst you alight  he seconded these words by the proper action and having assisted his guest to dismount he conducted him into his house called his wife to attend him and then led his horse under a poor shed that served him as a stable sir philip was fatigued in body and mind and was glad to repose himself anywhere the courtesy of his host engaged his attention and satisfied his wishes he soon after returned followed by a youth of about eighteen years  make haste john said the father and be sure you say neither more nor less than what i have told you  i will father said the lad and immediately set off ran like a buck across the fields and was out of sight in an instant  i hope friend said sir philip you have not sent your son to provide for my entertainment i am a soldier used to lodge and fare hard and if it were otherwise your courtesy and kindness would give a relish to the most ordinary food  i wish heartily said wyatt it was in my power to entertain your honour as you ought to be but as i cannot do so i will when my son returns acquaint you with the errand i sent him on  after this they conversed together on common subjects like fellowcreatures of the same natural form and endowments though different kinds of education had given a conscious superiority to the one a conscious inferiority to the other and the due respect was paid by the latter without being exacted by the former in about half an hour young john returned  thou hast made haste said the father  not more than good speed quoth the son  tell us then how you speed  shall i tell all that passed said john  all said the father i dont want to hide any thing   john stood with his cap in his hand and thus told his tale  i went straight to the castle as fast as i could run it was my hap to light on young master edmund first so i told him just as you had me that a noble gentleman was come a long journey from foreign parts to see the lord lovel his friend and having lived abroad many years he did not know that he was dead and that the castle was fallen into other hands that upon hearing these tidings he was much grieved and disappointed and wanting a nights lodging to rest himself before he returned to his own home he was fain to take up with one at our cottage that my father thought my lord would be angry with him if he were not told of the strangers journey and intentions especially to let such a man lie at our cottage where he could neither be lodged nor entertained according to his quality  here john stopped and his father exclaimed  a good lad you did your errand very well and tell us the answer  john proceeded  master edmund ordered me some beer and went to acquaint my lord of the message he stayed a while and then came back to mejohn said he tell the noble stranger that the baron fitzowen greets him well and desires him to rest assured that though lord lovel is dead and the castle fallen into other hands his friends will always find a welcome there and my lord desires that he will accept of a lodging there while he remains in this countryso i came away directly and made haste to deliver my errand  sir philip expressed some dissatisfaction at this mark of old wyatts respect  i wish said he that you had acquainted me with your intention before you sent to inform the baron i was here i choose rather to lodge with you and i propose to make amends for the trouble i shall give you  pray sir dont mention it said the peasant you are as welcome as myself i hope no offence the only reason of my sending was because i am both unable and unworthy to entertain your honour  i am sorry said sir philip you should think me so dainty i am a christian soldier and him i acknowledge for my prince and master accepted the invitations of the poor and washed the feet of his disciples let us say no more on this head i am resolved to stay this night in your cottage tomorrow i will wait on the baron and thank him for his hospitable invitation  that shall be as your honour pleases since you will condescend to stay here john do you run back and acquaint my lord of it  not so said sir philip it is now almost dark  tis no matter said john i can go it blindfold  sir philip then gave him a message to the baron in his own name acquainting him that he would pay his respects to him in the morning john flew back the second time and soon returned with new commendations from the baron and that he would expect him on the morrow sir philip gave him an angel of gold and praised his speed and abilities  he supped with wyatt and his family upon newlaid eggs and rashers of bacon with the highest relish they praised the creator for his gifts and acknowledged they were unworthy of the least of his blessings they gave the best of their two lofts up to sir philip the rest of the family slept in the other the old woman and her daughter in the bed the father and his two sons upon clean straw sir philips bed was of a better kind and yet much inferior to his usual accommodations nevertheless the good knight slept as well in wyatts cottage as he could have done in a palace  during his sleep many strange and incoherent dreams arose to his imagination he thought he received a message from his friend lord lovel to come to him at the castle that he stood at the gate and received him that he strove to embrace him but could not but that he spoke to this effectthough i have been dead these fifteen years i still command here and none can enter these gates without my permission know that it is i that invite and bid you welcome the hopes of my house rest upon you upon this he bid sir philip follow him he led him through many rooms till at last he sunk down and sir philip thought he still followed him till he came into a dark and frightful cave where he disappeared and in his stead he beheld a complete suit of armour stained with blood which belonged to his friend and he thought he heard dismal groans from beneath presently after he thought he was hurried away by an invisible hand and led into a wild heath where the people were inclosing the ground and making preparations for two combatants the trumpet sounded and a voice called out still louder forbear it is not permitted to be revealed till the time is ripe for the event wait with patience on the decrees of heaven he was then transported to his own house where going into an unfrequented room he was again met by his friend who was living and in all the bloom of youth as when he first knew him he started at the sight and awoke the sun shone upon his curtains and perceiving it was day he sat up and recollected where he was the images that impressed his sleeping fancy remained strongly on his mind waking but his reason strove to disperse them it was natural that the story he had heard should create these ideas that they should wait on him in his sleep and that every dream should bear some relation to his deceased friend the sun dazzled his eyes the birds serenaded him and diverted his attention and a woodbine forced its way through the window and regaled his sense of smelling with its fragrance he arose paid his devotions to heaven and then carefully descended the narrow stairs and went out at the door of the cottage there he saw the industrious wife and daughter of old wyatt at their morning work the one milking her cow the other feeding her poultry he asked for a draught of milk which with a slice of rye bread served to break his fast he walked about the fields alone for old wyatt and his two sons were gone out to their daily labour he was soon called back by the good woman who told him that a servant from the baron waited to conduct him to the castle he took leave of wyatts wife telling her he would see her again before he left the country the daughter fetched his horse which he mounted and set forward with the servant of whom he asked many questions concerning his masters family  how long have you lived with the baron  ten years  is he a good master  yes sir and also a good husband and father  what family has he  three sons and a daughter  what age are they of  the eldest son is in his seventeenth year the second in his sixteenth the others several years younger but beside these my lord has several young gentlemen brought up with his own sons two of which are his nephews he keeps in his house a learned clerk to teach them languages and as for all bodily exercises none come near them there is a fletcher to teach them the use of the crossbow a master to teach them to ride another the use of the sword another learns them to dance and then they wrestle and run and have such activity in all their motions that it does one good to see them and my lord thinks nothing too much to bestow on their education  truly says sir philip he does the part of a good parent and i honour him greatly for it but are the young gentlemen of a promising disposition  yes indeed sir answered the servant the young gentlemen my lords sons are hopeful youths but yet there is one who is thought to exceed them all though he is the son of a poor labourer  and who is he said the knight  one edmund twyford the son of a cottager in our village he is to be sure as fine a youth as ever the sun shone upon and of so sweet a disposition that nobody envies his good fortune  what good fortune does he enjoy  why sir about two years ago my lord at his sons request took him into his own family and gives him the same education as his own children the young lords doat upon him especially master william who is about his own age it is supposed that he will attend the young lords when they go to the wars which my lord intends they shall by and by  what you tell me said sir philip increases every minute my respect for your lord he is an excellent father and master he seeks out merit in obscurity he distinguishes and rewards iti honour him with all my heart  in this manner they conversed together till they came within view of the castle in a field near the house they saw a company of youths with crossbows in their hands shooting at a mark  there said the servant are our young gentlemen at their exercises  sir philip stopped his horse to observe them he heard two or three of them cry out edmund is the victor he wins the prize  i must said sir philip take a view of this edmund  he jumped off his horse gave the bridle to the servant and walked into the field the young gentlemen came up and paid their respects to him he apologized for intruding upon their sports and asked which was the victor upon which the youth he spoke to beckoned to another who immediately advanced and made his obeisance as he drew near sir philip fixed his eyes upon him with so much attention that he seemed not to observe his courtesy and address at length he recollected himself and said what is your name young man  edmund twyford replied the youth and i have the honour to attend upon the lord fitzowens sons  pray noble sir said the youth who first addressed sir philip are not you the stranger who is expected by my father  i am sir answered he and i go to pay my respects to him  will you excuse our attendance sir we have not yet finished our exercises  my dear youth said sir philip no apology is necessary but will you favour me with your proper name that i may know to whose courtesy i am obliged  my name is william fitzowen that gentleman is my eldest brother master robert that other my kinsman master richard wenlock  very well i thank you gentle sir i beg you not to stir another step your servant holds my horse  farewell sir said master william i hope we shall have the pleasure of meeting you at dinner  the youths returned to their sports and sir philip mounted his horse and proceeded to the castle he entered it with a deep sigh and melancholy recollections the baron received him with the utmost respect and courtesy he gave a brief account of the principal events that had happened in the family of lovel during his absence he spoke of the late lord lovel with respect of the present with the affection of a brother sir philip in return gave a brief recital of his own adventures abroad and of the disagreeable circumstances he had met with since his return home he pathetically lamented the loss of all his friends not forgetting that of his faithful servant on the way saying he could be contented to give up the world and retire to a religious house but that he was withheld by the consideration that some who depended entirely upon him would want his presence and assistance and beside that he thought he might be of service to many others the baron agreed with him in opinion that a man was of much more service to the world who continued in it than one who retired from it and gave his fortune to the church whose servants did not always make the best use of it sir philip then turned the conversation and congratulated the baron on his hopeful family he praised their persons and address and warmly applauded the care he bestowed on their education the baron listened with pleasure to the honest approbation of a worthy heart and enjoyed the true happiness of a parent  sir philip then made further enquiry concerning edmund whose appearance had struck him with an impression in his favour  that boy said the baron is the son of a cottager in this neighbourhood his uncommon merit and gentleness of manners distinguish him from those of his own class from his childhood he attracted the notice and affection of all that knew him he was beloved everywhere but at his fathers house and there it should seem that his merits were his crimes for the peasant his father hated him treated him severely and at length threatened to turn him out of doors he used to run here and there on errands for my people and at length they obliged me to take notice of him my sons earnestly desired i would take him into my family i did so about two years ago intending to make him their servant but his extraordinary genius and disposition have obliged me to look upon him in a superior light perhaps i may incur the censure of many people by giving him so many advantages and treating him as the companion of my children his merit must justify or condemn my partiality for him however i trust that i have secured to my children a faithful servant of the upper kind and a useful friend to my family  sir philip warmly applauded his generous host and wished to be a sharer in his bounty to that fine youth whose appearance indicated all the qualities that had endeared him to his companions  at the hour of dinner the young men presented themselves before their lord and his guest sir philip addressed himself to edmund he asked him many questions and received modest and intelligent answers and he grew every minute more pleased with him after dinner the youths withdrew with their tutor to pursue their studies sir philip sat for some time wrapt up in meditation after some minutes the baron asked him if he might not be favoured with the fruits of his contemplations  you shall my lord answered he for you have a right to them i was thinking that when many blessings are lost we should cherish those that remain and even endeavour to replace the others my lord i have taken a strong liking to that youth whom you call edmund twyford i have neither children nor relations to claim my fortune nor share my affections your lordship has many demands upon your generosity i can provide for this promising youth without doing injustice to any one will you give him to me  he is a fortunate boy said the baron to gain your favour so soon  my lord said the knight i will confess to you that the first thing that touched my heart in his favour is a strong resemblance he bears to a certain dear friend i once had and his manner resembles him as much as his person his qualities deserve that he should be placed in a higher rank i will adopt him for my son and introduce him into the world as my relation if you will resign him to me what say you  sir said the baron you have made a noble offer and i am too much the young mans friend to be a hindrance to his preferment it is true that i intended to provide for him in my own family but i cannot do it so effectually as by giving him to you whose generous affection being unlimited by other ties may in time prefer him to a higher station as he shall deserve it i have only one condition to make that the lad shall have his option for i would not oblige him to leave my service against his inclination  you say well replied sir philip nor would i take him upon other terms  agreed then said the baron let us send for edmund hither  a servant was sent to fetch him he came immediately and his lord thus bespoke him  edmund you owe eternal obligations to this gentleman who perceiving in you a certain resemblance to a friend of his and liking your behaviour has taken a great affection for you insomuch that he desires to receive you into his family i cannot better provide for you than by disposing of you to him and if you have no objection you shall return home with him when he goes from hence  the countenance of edmund underwent many alterations during this proposal of his lord it expressed tenderness gratitude and sorrow but the last was predominant he bowed respectfully to the baron and sir philip and after some hesitation spoke as follows  i feel very strongly the obligations i owe to this gentleman for his noble and generous offer i cannot express the sense i have of his goodness to me a peasant boy only known to him by my lords kind and partial mention this uncommon bounty claims my eternal gratitude to you my honoured lord i owe every thing even this gentlemans good opinion you distinguished me when nobody else did and next to you your sons are my best and dearest benefactors they introduced me to your notice my heart is unalterably attached to this house and family and my utmost ambition is to spend my life in your service but if you have perceived any great and grievous faults in me that make you wish to put me out of your family and if you have recommended me to this gentleman in order to be rid of me in that case i will submit to your pleasure as i would if you should sentence me to death  during this speech the tears made themselves channels down edmunds cheeks and his two noble auditors catching the tender inflection wiped their eyes at the conclusion  my dear child said the baron you overcome me by your tenderness and gratitude i know of no faults you have committed that i should wish to be rid of you i thought to do you the best service by promoting you to that of sir philip harclay who is both able and willing to provide for you but if you prefer my service to his i will not part with you  upon this edmund kneeled to the baron he embraced his knees my dear lord i am and will be your servant in preference to any man living i only ask your permission to live and die in your service   you see sir philip said the baron how this boy engages the heart how can i part with him  i cannot ask you any more answered sir philip i see it is impossible but i esteem you both still higher than ever the youth for his gratitude and your lordship for your noble mind and true generosity blessings attend you both  oh sir said edmund pressing the hand of sir philip do not think me ungrateful to you i will ever remember your goodness and pray to heaven to reward it the name of sir philip harclay shall be engraven upon my heart next to my lord and his family for ever  sir philip raised the youth and embraced him saying if ever you want a friend remember me and depend upon my protection so long as you continue to deserve it  edmund bowed low and withdrew with his eyes full of tears of sensibility and gratitude when he was gone sir philip said i am thinking that though young edmund wants not my assistance at present he may hereafter stand in need of my friendship i should not wonder if such rare qualities as he possesses should one day create envy and raise him enemies in which case he might come to lose your favour without any fault of yours or his own  i am obliged to you for the warning said the baron i hope it will be unnecessary but if ever i part with edmund you shall have the refusal of him  i thank your lordship for all your civilities to me said the knight i leave my best wishes with you and your hopeful family and i humbly take my leave  will you not stay one night in the castle returned my lord you shall be as welcome a guest as ever  i acknowledge your goodness and hospitality but this house fills me with melancholy recollections i came hither with a heavy heart and it will not be lighter while i remain here i shall always remember your lordship with the highest respect and esteem and i pray god to preserve you and increase your blessings  after some further ceremonies sir philip departed and returned to old wyatts ruminating on the vicissitude of human affairs and thinking on the changes he had seen  at his return to wyatts cottage he found the family assembled together he told them he would take another nights lodging there which they heard with great pleasurefor he had familiarised himself to them in the last evenings conversation insomuch that they began to enjoy his company he told wyatt of the misfortune he had sustained by losing his servant on the way and wished he could get one to attend him home in his place young john looked earnestly at his father who returned a look of approbation  i perceive one in this company said he that would be proud to serve your honour but i fear he is not brought up well enough  john coloured with impatience he could not forbear speaking  sir i can answer for an honest heart a willing mind and a light pair of heels and though i am somewhat awkward i shall be proud to learn to please my noble master if he will but try me  you say well said sir philip i have observed your qualifications and if you are desirous to serve me i am equally pleased with you if your father has no objection i will take you  objection sir said the old man it will be my pride to prefer him to such a noble gentleman i will make no terms for him but leave it to your honour to do for him as he shall deserve  very well said sir philip you shall be no loser by that i will charge myself with the care of the young man  the bargain was struck and sir philip purchased a horse for john of the old man the next morning they set out the knight left marks of his bounty with the good couple and departed laden with their blessing and prayers he stopped at the place where his faithful servant was buried and caused masses to be said for the repose of his soul then pursuing his way by easy journeys arrived in safety at home his family rejoiced at his return he settled his new servant in attendance upon his person he then looked round his neighbourhood for objects of his charity when he saw merit in distress it was his delight to raise and support it he spent his time in the service of his creator and glorified him in doing good to his creatures he reflected frequently upon every thing that had befallen him in his late journey to the west and at his leisure took down all the particulars in writing    here follows an interval of four years as by the manuscript and this omission seems intended by the writer what follows is in a different hand and the character is more modern     about this time the prognostics of sir philip harclay began to be verified that edmunds good qualities might one day excite envy and create him enemies the sons and kinsmen of his patron began to seek occasion to find fault with him and to depreciate him with others the barons eldest son and heir master robert had several contests with master william the second son upon his account this youth had a warm affection for edmund and whenever his brother and kinsmen treated him slightly he supported him against their malicious insinuations mr richard wenlock and mr john markham were the sisters sons of the lord fitzowen and there were several other more distant relations who with them secretly envied edmunds fine qualities and strove to lessen him in the esteem of the baron and his family by degrees they excited a dislike in master robert that in time was fixed into habit and fell little short of aversion   young wenlocks hatred was confirmed by an additional circumstance he had a growing passion for the lady emma the barons only daughter and as love is eagleeyed he saw or fancied he saw her cast an eye of preference on edmund an accidental service that she received from him had excited her grateful regards and attentions towards him the incessant view of his fine person and qualities had perhaps improved her esteem into a still softer sensation though she was yet ignorant of it and thought it only the tribute due to gratitude and friendship   one christmas time the baron and all his family went to visit a family in wales crossing a ford the horse that carried the lady emma who rode behind her cousin wenlock stumbled and fell down and threw her off into the water edmund dismounted in a moment and flew to her assistance he took her out so quick that the accident was not known to some part of the company from this time wenlock strove to undermine edmund in her esteem and she conceived herself obliged in justice and gratitude to defend him against the malicious insinuations of his enemies she one day asked wenlock why he in particular should endeavour to recommend himself to her favour by speaking against edmund to whom she was under great obligations he made but little reply but the impression sunk deep into his rancorous heart every word in edmunds behalf was like a poisoned arrow that rankled in the wound and grew every day more inflamed sometimes he would pretend to extenuate edmunds supposed faults in order to load him with the sin of ingratitude upon other occasions rancour works deepest in the heart that strives to conceal it and when covered by art frequently puts on the appearance of candour by these means did wenlock and markham impose upon the credulity of master robert and their other relations master william only stood proof against all their insinuations   the same autumn that edmund completed his eighteenth year the baron declared his intention of sending the young men of his house to france the following spring to learn the art of war and signalize their courage and abilities  their illwill towards edmund was so well concealed that his patron had not discovered it but it was whispered among the servants who are generally close observers of the manners of their principals edmund was a favourite with them all which was a strong presumption that he deserved to be so for they seldom shew much regard to dependents or to superiour domestics who are generally objects of envy and dislike edmund was courteous but not familiar with them and by this means gained their affections without soliciting them among them was an old serving man called joseph howel this man had formerly served the old lord lovel and his son and when the young lord died and sir walter sold the castle to his brotherinlaw the lord fitzowen he only of all the old servants was left in the house to take care of it and to deliver it into the possession of the new proprietor who retained him in his service he was a man of few words but much reflection and without troubling himself about other peoples affairs went silently and properly about his own business more solicitous to discharge his duty than to recommend himself to notice and not seeming to aspire to any higher office than that of a serving man this old man would fix his eyes upon edmund whenever he could do it without observation sometimes he would sigh deeply and a tear would start from his eye which he strove to conceal from observation one day edmund surprised him in this tender emotion as he was wiping his eyes with the back of his hand why said he my good friend do you look at me so earnestly and affectionately  because i love you master edmund said he because i wish you well  i thank you kindly answered edmund i am unable to repay your love otherwise than by returning it which i do sincerely  i thank you sir said the old man that is all i desire and more than i deserve  do not say so said edmund if i had any better way to thank you i would not say so much about it but words are all my inheritance  upon this he shook hands with joseph who withdrew hastily to conceal his emotion saying god bless you master and make your fortune equal to your deserts i cannot help thinking you were born to a higher station than what you now hold  you know to the contrary said edmund but joseph was gone out of sight and hearing  the notice and observation of strangers and the affection of individuals together with that inward consciousness that always attends superiour qualities would sometimes kindle the flames of ambition in edmunds heart but he checked them presently by reflecting upon his low birth and dependant station he was modest yet intrepid gentle and courteous to all frank and unreserved to those that loved him discreet and complaisant to those who hated him generous and compassionate to the distresses of his fellowcreatures in general humble but not servile to his patron and superiors once when he with a manly spirit justified himself against a malicious imputation his young lord robert taxed him with pride and arrogance to his kinsmen edmund denied the charge against him with equal spirit and modesty master robert answered him sharply how dare you contradict my cousins do you mean to give them the lie  not in words sir said edmund but i will behave so as that you shall not believe them  master robert haughtily bid him be silent and know himself and not presume to contend with men so much his superiors in every respect these heartburnings in some degree subsided by their preparations for going to france master robert was to be presented at court before his departure and it was expected that he should be knighted the baron designed edmund to be his esquire but this was frustrated by his old enemies who persuaded robert to make choice of one of his own domestics called thomas hewson him did they set up as a rival to edmund and he took every occasion to affront him all that master robert gained by this step was the contempt of those who saw edmunds merit and thought it want of discernment in him not to distinguish and reward it edmund requested of his lord that he might be master williams attendant and when said he my patron shall be knighted as i make no doubt he will one day be he has promised that i shall be his esquire the baron granted edmunds request and being freed from servitude to the rest he was devoted to that of his beloved master william who treated him in public as his principal domestic but in private as his chosen friend and brother   the whole cabal of his enemies consulted together in what manner they should vent their resentment against him and it was agreed that they should treat him with indifference and neglect till they should arrive in france and when there they should contrive to render his courage suspected and by putting him upon some desperate enterprize rid themselves of him for ever about this time died the great duke of bedford to the irreparable loss of the english nation he was succeeded by richard plantagenet duke of york as regent of france of which great part had revolted to charles the dauphin frequent actions ensued cities were lost and won and continual occasions offered to exercise the courage and abilities of the youths of both nations  the young men of baron fitzowens house were recommended particularly to the regents notice master robert was knighted with several other young men of family who distinguished themselves by their spirit and activity upon every occasion the youth were daily employed in warlike exercises and frequent actions and made their first essay in arms in such a manner as to bring into notice all that deserved it various a  but all their contrivances recoiled upon themselves and brought increase of honour upon edmunds head he distinguished himself upon so many occasions that sir robert himself began to pay him more than ordinary regard to the infinite mortification of his kinsmen and relations they laid many schemes against him but none took effect  from this place the characters in the manuscript are effaced by time and damp here and there some sentences are legible but not sufficient to pursue the thread of the story mention is made of several actions in which the young men were engagedthat edmund distinguished himself by intrepidity in action by gentleness humanity and modesty in the cessationsthat he attracted the notice of every person of observation and also that he received personal commendation from the regent    the following incidents are clear enough to be transcribed but the beginning of the next succeeding pages is obliterated however we may guess at the beginning by what remains    as soon as the cabal met in sir roberts tent mr wenlock thus beganyou see my friends that every attempt we make to humble this upstart turns into applause and serves only to raise his pride still higher something must be done or his praise will go home before us at our own expence and we shall seem only soils to set off his glories any thing would i give to the man who should execute our vengeance upon him  stop there cousin wenlock said sir robert though i think edmund proud and vainglorious and would join in any scheme to humble him and make him know himself i will not suffer any man to use such base methods to effect it edmund is brave and it is beneath an englishman to revenge himself by unworthy means if any such are used i will be the first man to bring the guilty to justice and if i hear another word to this purpose i will inform my brother william who will acquaint edmund with your mean intentions upon this the cabal drew back and mr wenlock protested that he meant no more than to mortify his pride and make him know his proper station soon after sir robert withdrew and they resumed their deliberations   then spoke thomas hewson there is a party to be sent out tomorrow night to intercept a convoy of provisions for the relief of rouen i will provoke mr edmund to make one of this party and when he is engaged in the action i and my companions will draw off and leave him to the enemy who i trust will so handle him that you shall no more be troubled with him  this will do said mr wenlock but let it be kept from my two cousins and only known to ourselves if they offer to be of the party i will persuade them off it and you thomas if you bring this scheme to a conclusion may depend upon my eternal gratitude  and mine said markham and so said all the next day the affair was publicly mentioned and hewson as he promised provoked edmund to the trial several young men of family offered themselves among the rest sir robert and his brother william mr wenlock persuaded them not to go and set the danger of the enterprize in the strongest colours at last sir robert complained of the toothache and was confined to his tent edmund waited on him and judging by the ardour of his own courage of that of his patron thus bespoke himi am greatly concerned dear sir that we cannot have your company at night but as i know what you will suffer in being absent i would beg the favour of you to let me use your arms and device and i will promise not to disgrace them  no edmund i cannot consent to that i thank you for your noble offer and will remember it to your advantage but i cannot wear honours of another mans getting you have awakened me to a sense of my duty i will go with you and contend with you for glory and william shall do the same   in a few hours they were ready to set out wenlock and markham and their dependants found themselves engaged in honour to go upon an enterprize they never intended and set out with heavy hearts to join the party they marched in silence in the horrors of a dark night and wet roads they met the convoy where they expected and a sharp engagement ensued the victory was some time doubtful but the moon rising on the backs of the english gave them the advantage they saw the disposition of their enemies and availed themselves of it edmund advanced the foremost of the party he drew out the leader on the french side he slew him mr william pressed forward to assist his friend sir robert to defend his brother wenlock and markham from shame to stay behind   thomas hewson and his associates drew back on their side the french perceived it and pursued the advantage edmund pushed them in front the young nobles all followed him they broke through the detachment and stopped the waggons the officer who commanded the party encouraged them to go on the defeat was soon complete and the provisions carried in triumph to the english camp  edmund was presented to the regent as the man to whom the victory was chiefly owing not a tongue presumed to move itself against him even malice and envy were silenced  approach young man said the regent that i may confer upon you the honour of knighthood which you have well deserved   mr wenlock could no longer forbear speakingknighthood said he is an order belonging to gentlemen it cannot be conferred on a peasant  what say you sir returned the regent is this youth a peasant  he is said wenlock let him deny it if he can  edmund with a modest bow replied it is true indeed i am a peasant and this honour is too great for me i have only done my duty  the duke of york whose pride of birth equalled that of any man living or dead sheathed his sword immediately though said he i cannot reward you as i intended i will take care that you shall have a large share in the spoils of this night and i declare publicly that you stand first in the list of gallant men in this engagement  thomas hewson and his associates made a poor figure in their return they were publicly reproved for their backwardness hewson was wounded in body and more in mind for the bad success of his illlaid design he could not hold up his head before edmund who unconscious of their malice administered every kind of comfort to them he spoke in their behalf to the commanding officer imputing their conduct to unavoidable accidents he visited them privately he gave them a part of the spoils allotted to himself by every act of valour and courtesy he strove to engage those hearts that hated envied and maligned him but where hatred arises from envy of superior qualities every display of those qualities increases the cause from whence it arises   another pause ensues here   the young nobles and gentlemen who distinguished edmund were prevented from raising him to preferment by the insinuations of wenlock and his associates who never failed to set before them his low descent and his pride and arrogance in presuming to rank with gentlemen    here the manuscript is not legible for several pages there is mention about this time of the death of the lady fitzowen but not the cause    wenlock rejoiced to find that his schemes took effect and that they should be recalled at the approach of winter the baron was glad of a pretence to send for them home for he could no longer endure the absence of his children after the loss of their mother   the manuscript is again defaced for many leaves at length the letters become more legible and the remainder of it is quite perfect    from the time the young men returned from france the enemies of edmund employed their utmost abilities to ruin him in the barons opinion and get him dismissed from the family they insinuated a thousand things against him that happened as they said during his residence in france and therefore could not be known to his master but when the baron privately enquired of his two elder sons he found there was no truth in their reports sir robert though he did not love him scorned to join in untruths against him mr william spoke of him with the warmth of fraternal affection the baron perceived that his kinsmen disliked edmund but his own good heart hindered him from seeing the baseness of theirs it is said that continual dropping will wear away a stone so did their incessant reports by insensible degrees produce a coolness in his patrons behaviour towards him if he behaved with manly spirit it was misconstrued into pride and arrogance his generosity was imprudence his humility was hypocrisy the better to cover his ambition edmund bore patiently all the indignities that were thrown upon him and though he felt them severely in his bosom scorned to justify his conduct at the expence even of his enemies perhaps his gentle spirit might at length have sunk under this treatment but providence interposed in his behalf and by seemingly accidental circumstances conducted him imperceptibly towards the crisis of his fate   father oswald who had been preceptor to the young men had a strong affection for edmund from a thorough knowledge of his heart he saw through the mean artifices that were used to undermine him in his patrons favour he watched their machinations and strove to frustrate their designs   this good man used frequently to walk out with edmund they conversed upon various subjects and the youth would lament to him the unhappiness of his situation and the peculiar circumstances that attended him the father by his wholesome advice comforted his drooping heart and confirmed him in his resolution of bearing unavoidable evils with patience and fortitude from the consciousness of his own innocence and the assurance of a future and eternal reward  one day as they were walking in a wood near the castle edmund asked the father what meant those preparations for building the cutting down trees and burning of bricks  what said oswald have you not heard that my lord is going to build a new apartment on the west side of the castle  and why said edmund should my lord be at that expence when there is one on the east side that is never occupied  that apartment said the friar you must have observed is always shut up  i have observed it often said edmund but i never presumed to ask any questions about it  you had then said oswald less curiosity and more discretion than is common at your age  you have raised my curiosity said edmund and if it be not improper i beg of you to gratify it  we are alone said oswald and i am so well assured of your prudence that i will explain this mystery in some degree to you  you must know that apartment was occupied by the last lord lovel when he was a batchelor he married in his fathers lifetime who gave up his own apartment to him and offered to retire to this himself but the son would not permit him he chose to sleep here rather than in any other he had been married about three months when his father the old lord died of a fever about twelve months after his marriage he was called upon to attend the king henry the fourth on an expedition into wales whither he was attended by many of his dependants he left his lady big with child and full of care and anxiety for his safety and return  after the king had chastised the rebels and obtained the victory the lord lovel was expected home every day various reports were sent home before him one messenger brought an account of his health and safety soon after another came with bad news that he was slain in battle his kinsman sir walter lovel came here on a visit to comfort the lady and he waited to receive his kinsman at his return it was he that brought the news of the sad event of the battle to the lady lovel  she fainted away at the relation but when she revived exerted the utmost resolution saying it was her duty to bear this dreadful stroke with christian fortitude and patience especially in regard to the child she went with the last remains of her beloved husband and the undoubted heir of a noble house for several days she seemed an example of patience and resignation but then all at once she renounced them and broke out into passionate and frantic exclamations she said that her dear lord was basely murdered that his ghost had appeared to her and revealed his fate she called upon heaven and earth to revenge her wrongs saying she would never cease complaining to god and the king for vengeance and justice  upon this sir walter told the servants that lady lovel was distracted from grief for the death of her lord that his regard for her was as strong as ever and that if she recovered he would himself be her comforter and marry her in the mean time she was confined in this very apartment and in less than a month the poor lady died she lies buried in the family vault in st austins church in the village sir walter took possession of the castle and all the other estates and assumed the title of lord lovel  soon after it was reported that the castle was haunted and that the ghosts of lord and lady lovel had been seen by several of the servants whoever went into this apartment were terrified by uncommon noises and strange appearances at length this apartment was wholly shut up and the servants were forbid to enter it or to talk of any thing relating to it however the story did not stop here it was whispered about that the new lord lovel was so disturbed every night that he could not sleep in quiet and being at last tired of the place he sold the castle and estate of his ancestors to his brotherinlaw the lord fitzowen who now enjoys it and left this country  all this is news to me said edmund but father tell me what grounds there were for the ladys suspicion that her lord died unfairly  alas said oswald that is only known to god there were strange thoughts in the minds of many at that time i had mine but i will not disclose them not even to you i will not injure those who may be innocent and i leave it to providence who will doubtless in its own best time and manner punish the guilty but let what i have told you be as if you had never heard it  i thank you for these marks of your esteem and confidence said edmund be assured that i will not abuse them nor do i desire to pry into secrets not proper to be revealed i entirely approve your discretion and acquiesce in your conclusion that providence will in its own time vindicate its ways to man if it were not for that trust my situation would be insupportable i strive earnestly to deserve the esteem and favour of good men i endeavour to regulate my conduct so as to avoid giving offence to any man but i see with infinite pain that it is impossible for me to gain these points  i see it too with great concern said oswald and every thing that i can say and do in your favour is misconstrued and by seeking to do you service i lose my own influence but i will never give my sanction to acts of injustice nor join to oppress innocence my dear child put your trust in god he who brought light out of darkness can bring good out of evil  i hope and trust so said edmund but father if my enemies should prevailif my lord should believe their stories against me and i should be put out of the house with disgrace what will become of me i have nothing but my character to depend upon if i lose that i lose every thing and i see they seek no less than my ruin  trust in my lords honour and justice replied oswald he knows your virtue and he is not ignorant of their illwill towards you  i know my lords justice too well to doubt it said edmund but would it not be better to rid him of this trouble and his family of an incumbrance i would gladly do something for myself but cannot without my lords recommendation and such is my situation that i fear the asking for a dismission would be accounted base ingratitude beside when i think of leaving this house my heart saddens at the thought and tells me i cannot be happy out of it yet i think i could return to a peasants life with cheerfulness rather than live in a palace under disdain and contempt  have patience a little longer my son said oswald i will think of some way to serve you and to represent your grievances to my lord without offence to eitherperhaps the causes may be removed continue to observe the same irreproachable conduct and be assured that heaven will defend your innocence and defeat the unjust designs of your enemies let us now return home  about a week after this conference edmund walked out in the fields ruminating on the disagreeable circumstances of his situation insensible of the time he had been out several hours without perceiving how the day wore away when he heard himself called by name several times looking backward he saw his friend mr william and hallooed to him he came running towards him and leaping over the style stood still a while to recover his breath  what is the matter sir said edmund your looks bespeak some tidings of importance  with a look of tender concern and affection the youth pressed his hand and spoke  my dear edmund you must come home with me directly your old enemies have united to ruin you with my father my brother robert has declared that he thinks there will be no peace in our family till you are dismissed from it and told my father he hoped he would not break with his kinsmen rather than give up edmund  but what do they lay to my charge said edmund  i cannot rightly understand answered william for they make a great mystery of it something of great consequence they say but they will not tell me what however my father has told them that they must bring their accusation before your face and he will have you answer them publicly i have been seeking you this hour to inform you of this that you might be prepared to defend yourself against your accusers  god reward you sir said edmund for all your goodness to me i see they are determined to ruin me if possible i shall be compelled to leave the castle but whatever becomes of me be assured you shall have no cause to blush for your kindness and partiality to your edmund  i know it i am sure of it said william and here i swear to you as jonathan did to david i beseech heaven to bless me as my friendship to you shall be steady and inviolable  only so long as i shall deserve so great a blessing interrupted edmund  i know your worth and honour continued william and such is my confidence in your merit that i firmly believe heaven designs you for something extraordinary and i expect that some great and unforeseen event will raise you to the rank and station to which you appear to belong promise me therefore that whatever may be your fate you will preserve the same friendship for me that i bear to you  edmund was so much affected that he could not answer but in broken sentences  oh my friend my master i vow i promise my heart promises  he kneeled down with clasped hands and uplifted eyes william kneeled by him and they invoked the supreme to witness to their friendship and implored his blessing upon it they then rose up and embraced each other while tears of cordial affection bedewed their cheeks  as soon as they were able to speak edmund conjured his friend not to expose himself to the displeasure of his family out of kindness to him  i submit to the will of heaven said he i wait with patience its disposal of me if i leave the castle i will find means to inform you of my fate and fortunes  i hope said william that things may yet be accommodated but do not take any resolution let us act as occasions arise  in this manner these amiable youths conferred till they arrived at the castle the baron was sitting in the great hall on a high chair with a footstep before with the state and dignity of a judge before him stood father oswald as pleading the cause for himself and edmund round the barons chair stood his eldest son and his kinsmen with their principal domestics the old servant joseph at some distance with his head leaning forward as listening with the utmost attention to what passed mr william approached the chair my lord i have found edmund and brought him to answer for himself  you have done well said the baron edmund come hither you are charged with some indiscretions for i cannot properly call them crimes i am resolved to do justice between you and your accusers i shall therefore hear you as well as them for no man ought to be condemned unheard  my lord said edmund with equal modesty and intrepidity i demand my trial if i shall be found guilty of any crimes against my benefactor let me be punished with the utmost rigour but if as i trust no such charge can be proved against me i know your goodness too well to doubt that you will do justice to me as well as to others and if it should so happen that by the misrepresentations of my enemies who have long sought my ruin privately and now avow it publicly if by their artifices your lordship should be induced to think me guilty i would submit to your sentence in silence and appeal to another tribunal  see said mr wenlock the confidence of the fellow he already supposes that my lord must be in the wrong if he condemns him and then this meek creature will appeal to another tribunal to whose will he appeal i desire he may be made to explain himself  that i will immediately said edmund without being compelled i only meant to appeal to heaven that best knows my innocence  tis true said the baron and no offence to any one man can only judge by appearances but heaven knows the heart let every one of you bear this in mind that you may not bring a false accusation nor justify yourselves by concealing the truth edmund i am informed that oswald and you have made very free with me and my family in some of your conversations you were heard to censure me for the absurdity of building a new apartment on the west side of the castle when there was one on the east side uninhabited oswald said that apartment was shut up because it was haunted that some shocking murder had been committed there adding many particulars concerning lord lovels family such as he could not know the truth of and if he had known was imprudent to reveal but further you complained of illtreatment here and mentioned an intention to leave the castle and seek your fortune elsewhere i shall examine into all these particulars in turn at present i desire you edmund to relate all that you can remember of the conversation that passed between you and oswald in the wood last monday  good god said edmund is it possible that any person could put such a construction upon so innocent a conversation  tell me then said the baron the particulars of it  i will my lord as nearly as my memory will allow me accordingly he related most of the conversation that passed in the wood but in the part that concerned the family of lovel he abbreviated as much as possible oswalds countenance cleared up for he had done the same before edmund came the baron called to his eldest son  you hear sir robert what both parties say i have questioned them separately neither of them knew what the other would answer yet their accounts agree almost to a word  i confess they do so answered sir robert but sir it is very bold and presuming for them to speak of our family affairs in such a manner if my uncle lord lovel should come to know it he would punish them severely and if his honour is reflected upon it becomes us to resent and to punish it here mr wenlock broke out into passion and offered to swear to the truth of his accusation  be silent dick said the baron i shall judge for myself i protest said he to sir robert i never heard so much as oswald has now told me concerning the deaths of lord and lady lovel i think it is best to let such stories alone till they die away of themselves i had indeed heard of an idle story of the east apartments being haunted when first i came hither and my brother advised me to shut it up till it should be forgotten but what has now been said has suggested a thought that may make that apartment useful in future i have thought of a punishment for edmund that will stop the mouth of his accusers for the present and as i hope will establish his credit with every body edmund will you undertake this adventure for me  what adventure my lord said edmund there is nothing i would not undertake to shew my gratitude and fidelity to you as to my courage i would shew that at the expence of my malicious accusers if respect to my lords blood did not tie up my hands as i am situated i beg it may be put to the proof in whatever way is most for my masters service  that is well said cried the baron as to your enemies i am thinking how to separate you from them effectually of that i shall speak hereafter i am going to try edmunds courage he shall sleep three nights in the east apartment that he may testify to all whether it be haunted or not afterwards i will have that apartment set in order and my eldest son shall take it for his own it will spare me some expence and answer my purpose as well or better will you consent edmund  with all my heart my lord said edmund i have not wilfully offended god or man i have therefore nothing to fear  brave boy said my lord i am not deceived in you nor shall you be deceived in your reliance on me you shall sleep in that apartment tonight and tomorrow i will have some private talk with you do you oswald go with me i want to have some conversation with you the rest of you retire to your studies and business i will meet you at dinner  edmund retired to his own chamber and oswald was shut up with the baron he defended edmunds cause and his own and laid open as much as he knew of the malice and designs of his enemies the baron expressed much concern at the untimely deaths of lord and lady lovel and desired oswald to be circumspect in regard to what he had to say of the circumstances attending them adding that he was both innocent and ignorant of any treachery towards either of them oswald excused himself for his communications to edmund saying they fell undesignedly into the subject and that he mentioned it in confidence to him only  the baron sent orders to the young men to come to dinner but they refused to meet edmund at table accordingly he ate in the stewards apartment after dinner the baron tried to reconcile his kinsmen to edmund but found it impossible they saw their designs were laid open and judging of him by themselves thought it impossible to forgive or be forgiven the baron ordered them to keep in separate apartments he took his eldest son for his own companion as being the most reasonable of the malcontents and ordered his kinsmen to keep their own apartment with a servant to watch their motions mr william had oswald for his companion old joseph was bid to attend on edmund to serve him at supper and at the hour of nine to conduct him to the haunted apartment edmund desired that he might have a light and his sword lest his enemies should endeavour to surprise him the baron thought his request reasonable and complied with it  there was a great search to find the key of the apartment at last it was discovered by edmund himself among a parcel of old rusty keys in a lumber room the baron sent the young men their suppers to their respective apartments edmund declined eating and desired to be conducted to his apartment he was accompanied by most of the servants to the door of it they wished him success and prayed for him as if he had been going to execution  the door was with great difficulty unlocked and joseph gave edmund a lighted lamp and wished him a good night he returned his good wishes to them all with the utmost cheerfulness took the key on the inside of the door and dismissed them  he then took a survey of his chamber the furniture by long neglect was decayed and dropping to pieces the bed was devoured by the moths and occupied by the rats who had built their nests there with impunity for many generations the bedding was very damp for the rain had forced its way through the ceiling he determined therefore to lie down in his clothes there were two doors on the further side of the room with keys in them being not at all sleepy he resolved to examine them he attempted one lock and opened it with ease he went into a large diningroom the furniture of which was in the same tattered condition out of this was a large closet with some books in it and hung round with coats of arms with genealogies and alliances of the house of lovel he amused himself here some minutes and then returned into the bedchamber  he recollected the other door and resolved to see where it led to the key was rusted into the lock and resisted his attempts he set the lamp on the ground and exerting all his strength opened the door and at the same instant the wind of it blew out the lamp and left him in utter darkness at the same moment he heard a hollow rustling noise like that of a person coming through a narrow passage till this moment not one idea of fear had approached the mind of edmund but just then all the concurrent circumstances of his situation struck upon his heart and gave him a new and disagreeable sensation he paused a while and recollecting himself cried out aloud what should i fear i have not wilfully offended god or man why then should i doubt protection but i have not yet implored the divine assistance how then can i expect it upon this he kneeled down and prayed earnestly resigning himself wholly to the will of heaven while he was yet speaking his courage returned and he resumed his usual confidence again he approached the door from whence the noise proceeded he thought he saw a glimmering light upon a staircase before him if said he this apartment is haunted i will use my endeavours to discover the cause of it and if the spirit appears visibly i will speak to it  he was preparing to descend the staircase when he heard several knocks at the door by which he first entered the room and stepping backward the door was clapped to with great violence again fear attacked him but he resisted it and boldly cried out who is there  a voice at the outer door answered its i joseph your friend  what do you want said edmund  i have brought you some wood to make a fire said joseph  i thank you kindly said edmund but my lamp is gone out i will try to find the door however  after some trouble he found and opened it and was not sorry to see his friend joseph with a light in one hand a flagon of beer in the other and a fagot upon his shoulder i come said the good old man to bring you something to keep up your spirits the evening is cold i know this room wants airing and beside that my master i think your present undertaking requires a little assistance  my good friend said edmund i never shall be able to deserve or requite your kindness to me  my dear sir you always deserved more than i could do for you and i think i shall yet live to see you defeat the designs of your enemies and acknowledge the services of your friends  alas said edmund i see little prospect of that  i see said joseph something that persuades me you are designed for great things and i perceive that things are working about to some great end have courage my master my heart beats strangely high upon your account  you make me smile said edmund  i am glad to see it sir may you smile all the rest of your life  i thank your honest affection returned edmund though it is too partial to me you had better go to bed however if it is known that you visit me here it will be bad for us both  so i will presently but please god i will come here again tomorrow night when all the family are abed and i will tell you some things that you never yet heard  but pray tell me said edmund where does that door lead to  upon a passage that ends in a staircase that leads to the lower rooms and there is likewise a door out of that passage into the diningroom  and what rooms are there below stairs said edmund  the same as above replied he  very well then i wish you a good night we will talk further tomorrow  aye tomorrow night and in this place my dear master  why do you call me your master i never was nor ever can be your master  god only knows that said the good old man goodnight and heaven bless you  goodnight my worthy friend  joseph withdrew and edmund returned to the other door and attempted several times to open it in vain his hands were benumbed and tired at length he gave over he made a fire in the chimney placed the lamp on a table and opened one of the windowshutters to admit the daylight he then recommended himself to the divine protection and threw himself upon the bed he presently fell asleep and continued in that state till the sun saluted him with his orient beams through the window he had opened  as soon as he was perfectly awake he strove to recollect his dreams he thought that he heard people coming up the staircase that he had a glimpse of that the door opened and there entered a warrior leading a lady by the hand who was young and beautiful but pale and wan the man was dressed in complete armour and his helmet down they approached the bed they undrew the curtains he thought the man said is this our child the woman replied it is and the hour approaches that he shall be known for such they then separated and one stood on each side of the bed their hands met over his head and they gave him a solemn benediction he strove to rise and pay them his respects but they forbad him and the lady said sleep in peace oh my edmund for those who are the true possessors of this apartment are employed in thy preservation sleep on sweet hope of a house that is thought past hope  upon this they withdrew and went out at the same door by which they entered and he heard them descend the stairs after this he followed a funeral as chief mourner he saw the whole procession and heard the ceremonies performed he was snatched away from this mournful scene to one of a contrary kind a stately feast at which he presided and he heard himself congratulated as a husband and a father his friend william sat by his side and his happiness was complete every succeeding idea was happiness without allay and his mind was not idle a moment till the morning sun awakened him he perfectly remembered his dreams and meditated on what all these things should portend am i then said he not edmund twyford but somebody of consequence in whose fate so many people are interested vain thought that must have arisen from the partial suggestion of my two friends mr william and old joseph  he lay thus reflecting when a servant knocked at his door and told him it was past six oclock and that the baron expected him to breakfast in an hour he rose immediately paid his tribute of thanks to heaven for its protection and went from his chamber in high health and spirits he walked in the garden till the hour of breakfast and then attended the baron  good morrow edmund said he how have you rested in your new apartment  extremely well my lord answered he  i am glad to hear it said the baron but i did not know your accommodations were so bad as joseph tells me they are  tis of no consequence said edmund if they were much worse i could dispense with them for three nights  very well said the baron you are a brave lad i am satisfied with you and will excuse the other two nights  but my lord i will not be excused no one shall have reason to suspect my courage i am determined to go through the remaining nights upon many accounts  that shall be as you please said my lord i think of you as you deserve so well that i shall ask your advice by and by in some affairs of consequence  my life and services are yours my lord command them freely  let oswald be called in said my lord he shall be one of our consultation he came the servants were dismissed and the baron spoke as follows  edmund when first i took you into my family it was at the request of my sons and kinsmen i bear witness to your good behaviour you have not deserved to lose their esteem but nevertheless i have observed for some years past that all but my son william have set their faces against you i see their meanness and i perceive their motives but they are and must be my relations and i would rather govern them by love than fear i love and esteem your virtues i cannot give you up to gratify their humours my son william has lost the affections of the rest for that he bears to you but he has increased my regard for him i think myself bound in honour to him and you to provide for you i cannot do it as i wished under my own roof if you stay here i see nothing but confusion in my family yet i cannot put you out of it disgracefully i want to think of some way to prefer you that you may leave this house with honour and i desire both of you to give me your advice in this matter if edmund will tell me in what way i can employ him to his own honour and my advantage i am ready to do it let him propose it and oswald shall moderate between us  here he stopped and edmund whose sighs almost choked him threw himself at the barons feet and wet his hand with his tears oh my noble generous benefactor do you condescend to consult such a one as me upon the state of your family does your most amiable and beloved son incur the illwill of his brothers and kinsmen for my sake what am i that i should disturb the peace of this noble family oh my lord send me away directly i should be unworthy to live if i did not earnestly endeavour to restore your happiness you have given me a noble education and i trust i shall not disgrace it if you will recommend me and give me a character i fear not to make my own fortune  the baron wiped his eyes i wish to do this my child but in what way  my lord said edmund i will open my heart to you i have served with credit in the army and i should prefer a soldiers life  you please me well said the baron i will send you to france and give you a recommendation to the regent he knows you personally and will prefer you for my sake and for your own merit  my lord you overwhelm me with your goodness i am but your creature and my life shall be devoted to your service  but said the baron how to dispose of you till the spring  that said oswald may be thought of at leisure i am glad that you have resolved and i congratulate you both the baron put an end to the conversation by desiring edmund to go with him into the menage to see his horses he ordered oswald to acquaint his son william with all that had passed and to try to persuade the young men to meet edmund and william at dinner  the baron took edmund with him into his menage to see some horses he had lately purchased while they were examining the beauties and defects of these noble and useful animals edmund declared that he preferred caradoc a horse he had broke himself to any other in my lords stables then said the baron i will give him to you and you shall go upon him to seek your fortune he made new acknowledgments for this gift and declared he would prize it highly for the givers sake but i shall not part with you yet said my lord i will first carry all my points with these saucy boys and oblige them to do you justice  you have already done that said edmund and i will not suffer any of your lordships blood to undergo any farther humiliation upon my account i think with humble submission to your better judgment the sooner i go hence the better  while they were speaking oswald came to them and said that the young men had absolutely refused to dine at the table if edmund was present tis well said the baron i shall find a way to punish their contumacy hereafter i will make them know that i am the master here edmund and you oswald shall spend the day in my apartment above stairs william shall dine with me alone and i will acquaint him with our determination my son robert and his cabal shall be prisoners in the great parlour edmund shall according to his own desire spend this and the following night in the haunted apartment and this for his sake and my own for if i should now contradict my former orders it would subject us both to their impertinent reflections  he then took oswald aside and charged him not to let edmund go out of his sight for if he should come in the way of those implacable enemies he trembled for the consequences he then walked back to the stables and the two friends returned into the house  they had a long conversation on various subjects in the course of it edmund acquainted oswald with all that had passed between him and joseph the preceding night the curiosity he had raised in him and his promise to gratify it the night following  i wish said oswald you would permit me to be one of your party  how can that be said edmund we shall be watched perhaps and if discovered what excuse can you make for coming there beside if it were known i shall be branded with the imputation of cowardice and though i have borne much i will not promise to bear that patiently  never fear replied oswald i will speak to joseph about it and after prayers are over and the family gone to bed i will steal away from my own chamber and come to you i am strongly interested in your affairs and i cannot be easy unless you will receive me into your company i will bind myself to secrecy in any manner you shall enjoin   your word is sufficient said edmund i have as much reason to trust you father as any man living i should be ungrateful to refuse you any thing in my power to grant but suppose the apartment should really be haunted would you have resolution enough to pursue the adventure to a discovery  i hope so said oswald but have you any reason to believe it is  i have said edmund but i have not opened my lips upon this subject to any creature but yourself this night i purpose if heaven permit to go all over the rooms and though i had formed this design i will confess that your company will strengthen my resolution i will have no reserves to you in any respect but i must put a seal upon your lips  oswald swore secrecy till he should be permitted to disclose the mysteries of that apartment and both of them waited in solemn expectation the event of the approaching night  in the afternoon mr william was allowed to visit his friend an affecting interview passed between them he lamented the necessity of edmunds departure and they took a solemn leave of each other as if they foreboded it would be long ere they should meet again  about the same hour as the preceding evening joseph came to conduct edmund to his apartment  you will find better accommodations than you had last night said he and all by my lords own order  i every hour receive some new proof of his goodness said edmund  when they arrived he found a good fire in the chamber and a table covered with cold meats and a flagon of strong beer  sit down and get your supper my dear master said joseph i must attend my lord but as soon as the family are gone to bed i will visit you again  do so said edmund but first see father oswald he has something to say to you you may trust him for i have no reserves to him  well sir i will see him if you desire it and i will come to you as soon as possible so saying he went his way and edmund sat down to supper  after a moderate refreshment he kneeled down and prayed with the greatest fervency he resigned himself to the disposal of heaven i am nothing said he i desire to be nothing but what thou o lord pleasest to make me if it is thy will that i should return to my former obscurity be it obeyed with cheerfulness and if thou art pleased to exalt me i will look up to thee as the only fountain of honour and dignity while he prayed he felt an enlargement of heart beyond what he had ever experienced before all idle fears were dispersed and his heart glowed with divine love and affiancehe seemed raised above the world and all its pursuits he continued wrapt up in mental devotion till a knocking at the door obliged him to rise and let in his two friends who came without shoes and on tiptoe to visit him  save you my son said the friar you look cheerful and happy  i am so father said edmund i have resigned myself to the disposal of heaven and i find my heart strengthened above what i can express  heaven be praised said oswald i believe you are designed for great things my son  what do you too encourage my ambition says edmund strange concurrence of circumstancessit down my friends and do you my good joseph tell me the particulars you promised last night they drew their chairs round the fire and joseph began as follows  you have heard of the untimely death of the late lord lovel my noble and worthy master perhaps you may have also heard that from that time this apartment was haunted what passed the other day when my lord questioned you both on this head brought all the circumstances fresh into my mind you then said there were suspicions that he came not fairly to his end i trust you both and will speak what i know of it there was a person suspected of this murder and whom do you think it was  you must speak out said oswald  why then said joseph it was the present lord lovel  you speak my thoughts said oswald but proceed to the proofs  i will said joseph  from the time that my lords death was reported there were strange whisperings and consultations between the new lord and some of the servants there was a deal of private business carried on in this apartment soon after they gave out that my poor lady was distracted but she threw out strong expressions that savoured nothing of madness she said that the ghost of her departed lord had appeared to her and revealed the circumstances of this murder none of the servants but one were permitted to see her at this very time sir walter the new lord had the cruelty to offer love to her he urged her to marry him and one of her women overheard her say she would sooner die than give her hand to the man who caused the death of her lord soon after this we were told my lady was dead the lord lovel made a public and sumptuous funeral for her  that is true said oswald for i was a novice and assisted at it  well says joseph now comes my part of the story as i was coming home from the burial i overtook roger our ploughman said he what think you of this buryingwhat should i think said i but that we have lost the best master and lady that we shall ever know god he knows quoth roger whether they be living or dead but if ever i saw my lady in my life i saw her alive the night they say she died i tried to convince him that he was mistaken but he offered to take his oath that the very night they said she died he saw her come out at the garden gate into the fields that she often stopped like a person in pain and then went forward again until he lost sight of her now it is certain that her time was out and she expected to lie down every day and they did not pretend that she died in childbed i thought upon what i heard but nothing i said roger told the same story to another servant so he was called to an account the story was hushed up and the foolish fellow said he was verily persuaded it was her ghost that he saw now you must take notice that from this time they began to talk about that this apartment was troubled and not only this but at last the new lord could not sleep in quiet in his own room and this induced him to sell the castle to his brotherinlaw and get out of this country as fast as possible he took most of the servants away with him and roger among the rest as for me they thought i knew nothing and so they left me behind but i was neither blind nor deaf though i could hear and see and say nothing  this is a dark story said oswald  it is so said edmund but why should joseph seem to think it concerns me in particular  ah dear sir said joseph i must tell you though i never uttered it to mortal man before the striking resemblance this young man bears to my dear lord the strange dislike his reputed father took to him his gentle manners his generous heart his noble qualities so uncommon in those of his birth and breeding the sound of his voiceyou may smile at the strength of my fancy but i cannot put it out of my mind but that he is my own masters son  at these words edmund changed colour and trembled he clapped his hand upon his breast and looked up to heaven in silence his dream recurred to his memory and struck upon his heart he related it to his attentive auditors  the ways of providence are wonderful said oswald if this be so heaven in its own time will make it appear  here a silence of several minutes ensued when suddenly they were awakened from their reverie by a violent noise in the rooms underneath them it seemed like the clashing of arms and something seemed to fall down with violence  they started and edmund rose up with a look full of resolution and intrepidity  i am called said he i obey the call  he took up a lamp and went to the door that he had opened the night before oswald followed with his rosary in his hand and joseph last with trembling steps the door opened with ease and they descended the stairs in profound silence  the lower rooms answered exactly to those above there were two parlours and a large closet they saw nothing remarkable in these rooms except two pictures that were turned with their faces to the wall joseph took the courage to turn them these said he are the portraits of my lord and lady father look at this face do you know who is like it  i should think said oswald it was done for edmund  i am said edmund struck with the resemblance myself but let us go on i feel myself inspired with unusual courage let us open the closet door  oswald stopped him short  take heed said he lest the wind of the door put out the lamp i will open this door  he attempted it without success joseph did the same but to no purpose edmund gave the lamp to joseph he approached the door tried the key and it gave way to his hand in a moment  this adventure belongs said he to me only that is plainbring the lamp forward  oswald repeated the paternoster in which they all joined and then entered the closet  the first thing that presented itself to their view was a complete suit of armour that seemed to have fallen down on an heap  behold said edmund this made the noise we heard above they took it up and examined it piece by piece the inside of the breast plate was stained with blood  see here said edmund what think you of this  tis my lords armour said joseph i know it wellhere has been bloody work in this closet  going forward he stumbled over something it was a ring with the arms of lovel engraved upon it  this is my lords ring said joseph i have seen him wear it i give it to you sir as the right owner and most religiously do i believe you his son  heaven only knows that said edmund and if it permits i will know who was my father before i am a day older  while he was speaking he shifted his ground and perceived that the boards rose up on the other side of the closet upon farther examination they found that the whole floor was loose and a table that stood over them concealed the circumstance from a casual observer  i perceive said oswald that some great discovery is at hand  god defend us said edmund but i verily believe that the person that owned this armour lies buried under us  upon this a dismal hollow groan was heard as if from underneath a solemn silence ensued and marks of fear were visible upon all three the groan was thrice heard oswald made signs for them to kneel and he prayed audibly that heaven would direct them how to act he also prayed for the soul of the departed that it might rest in peace after this he arose but edmund continued kneelinghe vowed solemnly to devote himself to the discovery of this secret and the avenging the death of the person there buried he then rose up it would be to no purpose  said he for us to examine further now when i am properly authorised i will have this place opened i trust that time is not far off  i believe it said oswald you are designed by heaven to be its instrument in bringing this deed of darkness to light we are your creatures only tell us what you would have us do and we are ready to obey your commands  i only demand your silence said edmund till i call for your evidence and then you must speak all you know and all you suspect  oh said joseph that i may but live to see that day and i shall have lived long enough  come said edmund let us return up stairs and we will consult further how i shall proceed  so saying he went out of the closet and they followed him he locked the door and took the key outi will keep this said he till i have power to use it to purpose lest any one should presume to pry into the secret of this closet i will always carry it about me to remind me of what i have undertaken  upon this they returned up stairs into the bedchamber all was still and they heard nothing more to disturb them how said edmund is it possible that i should be the son of lord lovel for however circumstances have seemed to encourage such a notion what reason have i to believe it  i am strangely puzzled about it said oswald it seems unlikely that so good a man as lord lovel should corrupt the wife of a peasant his vassal and especially being so lately married to a lady with whom he was passionately in love  hold there said joseph my lord was incapable of such an action if master edmund is the son of my lord he is also the son of my lady  how can that be said edmund  i dont know how said joseph but there is a person who can tell if she will i mean margery twyford who calls herself your mother  you meet my thoughts said edmund i had resolved before you spoke to visit her and to interrogate her on the subject i will ask my lords permission to go this very day  that is right said oswald but be cautious and prudent in your enquiries  if you said edmund would bear me company i should do better she might think herself obliged to answer your questions and being less interested in the event you would be more discreet in your interrogations  that i will most readily said he and i will ask my lords permission for us both  this point is well determined said joseph i am impatient for the result and i believe my feet will carry me to meet you whether i consent or not  i am as impatient as you said oswald but let us be silent as the grave and let not a word or look indicate any thing knowing or mysterious  the daylight began to dawn upon their conference and edmund observing it begged his friends to withdraw in silence they did so and left edmund to his own recollections his thoughts were too much employed for sleep to approach him he threw himself upon the bed and lay meditating how he should proceed a thousand schemes offered themselves and were rejected but he resolved at all events to leave baron fitzowens family the first opportunity that presented itself  he was summoned as before to attend my lord at breakfast during which he was silent absent and reserved my lord observed it and rallied him enquiring how he had spent the night  in reflecting upon my situation my lord and in laying plans for my future conduct oswald took the hint and asked permission to visit edmunds mother in his company and acquaint her with his intentions of leaving the country soon he consented freely but seemed unresolved about edmunds departure  they set out directly and edmund went hastily to old twyfords cottage declaring that every field seemed a mile to him restrain your warmth my son said oswald compose your mind and recover your breath before you enter upon a business of such consequence margery met them at the door and asked edmund what wind blew him thither  is it so very surprising said he that i should visit my parents  yes it is said she considering the treatment you have met with from us but since andrew is not in the house i may say i am glad to see you lord bless you what a fine youth you be grown tis a long time since i saw you but that is not my fault many a cross word and many a blow have i had on your account but i may now venture to embrace my dear child  edmund came forward and embraced her fervently the starting tears on both sides evinced their affection and why said he should my father forbid you to embrace your child what have i ever done to deserve his hatred  nothing my dear boy you were always good and tenderhearted and deserved the love of every body  it is not common said edmund for a parent to hate his firstborn son without his having deserved it  that is true said oswald it is uncommon it is unnatural nay i am of opinion it is almost impossible i am so convinced of this truth that i believe the man who thus hates and abuses edmund cannot be his father in saying this he observed her countenance attentively she changed colour apparently come said he let us sit down and do you margery answer to what i have said  blessed virgin said margery what does your reverence mean what do you suspect  i suspect said he that edmund is not the son of andrew your husband  lord bless me said she what is it you do suspect  do not evade my question woman i am come here by authority to examine you upon this point  the woman trembled every joint would to heaven said she that andrew was at home  it is much better as it is said oswald you are the person we are to examine  oh father said she do you think that ithat ithat i am to blame in this matter what have i done  do you sir said he ask your own questions  upon this edmund threw himself at her feet and embraced her knees o my mother said he for as such my heart owns you tell me for the love of heaven tell me who was my father  gracious heaven said she what will become of me  woman said oswald confess the truth or you shall be compelled to do it by whom had you this youth  who i said she i had him no father i am not guilty of the black crime of adultery god he knows my innocence i am not worthy to be the mother of such a sweet youth as that is  you are not his mother then nor andrew his father  oh what shall i do said margery andrew will be the death of me  no he shall not said edmund you shall be protected and rewarded for the discovery  goody said oswald confess the whole truth and i will protect you from harm and from blame you may be the means of making edmunds fortune in which case he will certainly provide for you on the other hand by an obstinate silence you will deprive yourself of all advantages you might receive from the discovery and beside you will soon be examined in a different manner and be obliged to confess all you know and nobody will thank you for it  ah said she but andrew beat me the last time i spoke to edmund and told me he would break every bone in my skin if ever i spoke to him again  he knows it then said oswald  he know it lord help you it was all his own doing  tell us then said oswald for andrew shall never know it till it is out of his power to punish you  tis a long story said she and cannot be told in a few words  it will never be told at this rate said he sit down and begin it instantly  my fate depends upon your words said edmund my soul is impatient of the suspense if ever you loved me and cherished me shew it now and tell while i have breath to ask it  he sat in extreme agitation of mind his words and actions were equally expressive of his inward emotions  i will said she but i must try to recollect all the circumstances you must know young man that you are just oneandtwenty years of age  on what day was he born said oswald  the day before yesterday said she the   st of september  a remarkable era said he  tis so indeed said edmund oh that night that apartment  be silent said oswald and do you margery begin your story  i will said she just oneandtwenty years ago on that very day i lost my firstborn son i got a hurt by overreaching myself when i was near my time and so the poor child died and so as i was sitting all alone and very melancholy andrew came home from work see margery said he i have brought you a child instead of that you have lost so he gave me a bundle as i thought but sure enough it was a child a poor helpless babe just born and only rolled up in a fine handkerchief and over that a rich velvet cloak trimmed with gold lace and where did you find this says i upon the footbridge says he just below the clayfield this child said he belongs to some great folk and perhaps it may be enquired after one day and may make our fortunes take care of it said he and bring it up as if it was your own the poor infant was cold and it cried and looked up at me so pitifully that i loved it beside my milk was troublesome to me and i was glad to be eased of it so i gave it the breast and from that hour i loved the child as if it were my own and so i do still if i dared to own it  and this is all you know of edmunds birth said oswald  no not all said margery but pray look out and see whether andrew is coming for i am all over in a twitter  he is not said oswald go on i beseech you  this happened said she as i told you on the   st on the morrow my andrew went out early to work along with one robin rouse our neighbour they had not been gone above an hour when they both came back seemingly very much frightened says andrew go you robin and borrow a pickaxe at neighbour styless what is the matter now said i matter enough quoth andrew we may come to be hanged perhaps as many an innocent man has before us tell me what is the matter said i i will said he but if ever you open your mouth about it woe be to you i never will said i but he made me swear by all the blessed saints in the calendar and then he told me that as robin and he were going over the footbridge where he found the child the evening before they saw something floating upon the water so they followed it till it stuck against a stake and found it to be the dead body of a woman as sure as you are alive madge said he this was the mother of the child i brought home  merciful god said edmund am i the child of that hapless mother  be composed said oswald proceed good woman the time is precious  and so continued she andrew told me they dragged the body out of the river and it was richly dressed and must be somebody of consequence i suppose said he when the poor lady had taken care of her child she went to find some help and the night being dark her foot slipped and she fell into the river and was drowned  lord have mercy said robin what shall we do with the dead body we may be taken up for the murder what had we to do to meddle with it ay but says andrew we must have something to do with it now and our wisest way is to bury it robin was sadly frightened but at last they agreed to carry it into the wood and bury it there so they came home for a pickaxe and shovel well said i andrew but will you bury all the rich clothes you speak of why said he it would be both a sin and a shame to strip the dead so it would said i but i will give you a sheet to wrap the body in and you may take off her upper garments and any thing of value but do not strip her to the skin for any thing well said wench said he i will do as you say so i fetched a sheet and by that time robin was come back and away they went together  they did not come back again till noon and then they sat down and ate a morsel together says andrew now we may sit down and eat in peace aye says robin and sleep in peace too for we have done no harm no to be sure said i but yet i am much concerned that the poor lady had not christian burial never trouble thyself about that said andrew we have done the best we could for her but let us see what we have got in our bags we must divide them so they opened their bags and took out a fine gown and a pair of rich shoes but besides these there was a fine necklace with a golden locket and a pair of earrings says andrew and winked at me i will have these and you may take the rest robin said he was satisfied and so he went his way when he was gone here you fool says andrew take these and keep them as safe as the bud of your eye if ever young master is found these will make our fortune  and have you them now said oswald  yes that i have answered she andrew would have sold them long ago but i always put him off it  heaven be praised said edmund  hush said oswald let us not lose time proceed goody  nay said margery i have not much more to say we looked every day to hear some enquiries after the child but nothing passed nobody was missing  did nobody of note die about that time said oswald  why yes said margery the widow lady lovel died that same week by the same token andrew went to the funeral and brought home a scutcheon which i keep unto this day  very well go on  my husband behaved well enough to the boy till such time as he had two or three children of his own and then he began to grumble and say it was hard to maintain other folks children when he found it hard enough to keep his own i loved the boy quite as well as my own often and often have i pacified andrew and made him to hope that he should one day or other be paid for his trouble but at last he grew out of patience and gave over all hopes of that kind  as edmund grew up he grew sickly and tender and could not bear hard labour and that was another reason why my husband could not bear with him if quoth he the boy could earn his living i did not care but i must bear all the expence there came an old pilgrim into our parts he was a scholar and had been a soldier and he taught edmund to read then he told him histories of wars and knights and lords and great men and edmund took such delight in hearing him that he would not take to any thing else  to be sure edwin was a pleasant companion he would tell old stories and sing old songs that one could have sat all night to hear him but as i was a saying edmund grew more and more fond of reading and less of work however he would run of errands and do many handy turns for the neighbours and he was so courteous a lad that people took notice of him andrew once catched him alone reading and then told him that if he did not find some way to earn his bread he would turn him out of doors in a very short time and so he would have done sure enough if my lord fitzowen had not taken him into his service just in the nick  very well goody said oswald you have told your story very well i am glad for edmunds sake that you can do it so properly but now can you keep a secret  why ant please your reverence i think i have shewed you that i can  but can you keep it from your husband  aye said she surely i can for i dare not tell it him  that is a good security said he but i must have a better you must swear upon this book not to disclose any thing that has passed between us three till we desire you to do it be assured you will soon be called upon for this purpose edmunds birth is near the discovery he is the son of parents of high degree and it will be in his power to make your fortune when he takes possession of his own  holy virgin what is it you tell me how you rejoice me to hear that what i have so long prayed for will come to pass  she took the oath required saying it after oswald  now said he go and fetch the tokens you have mentioned  when she was gone edmunds passions long suppressed broke out in tears and exclamations he kneeled down and with his hands clasped together returned thanks to heaven for the discovery oswald begged him to be composed lest margery should perceive his agitation and misconstrue the cause she soon returned with the necklace and earrings they were pearls of great value and the necklace had a locket on which the cypher of lovel was engraved  this said oswald is indeed a proof of consequence keep it sir for it belongs to you  must he take it away said she  certainly returned oswald we can do nothing without it but if andrew should ask for it you must put him off for the present and hereafter he will find his account in it  margery consented reluctantly to part with the jewels and after some further conversation they took leave of her  edmund embraced her affectionately i thank you with my whole heart  said he for all your goodness to me though i confess i never felt much regard for your husband yet for you i had always the tender affection of a son you will i trust give your evidence in my behalf when called upon and i hope it will one day be in my power to reward your kindness in that case i will own you as my fostermother and you shall always be treated as such  margery wept the lord grant it said she and i pray him to have you in his holy keeping farewell my dear child  oswald desired them to separate for fear of intrusion and they returned to the castle margery stood at the door of her cottage looking every way to see if the coast was clear  now sir said oswald i congratulate you as the son of lord and lady lovel the proofs are strong and indisputable  to us they are so said edmund but how shall we make them so to others and what are we to think of the funeral of lady lovel  as of a fiction said oswald the work of the present lord to secure his title and fortune  and what means can we use to dispossess him said edmund he is not a man for a poor youth like me to contend with  doubt not said oswald but heaven who has evidently conducted you by the hand thus far will complete its own work for my part i can only wonder and adore  give me your advice then said edmund for heaven assists us by natural means  it seems to me said oswald that your first step must be to make a friend of some great man of consequence enough to espouse your cause and to get this affair examined into by authority  edmund started and crossed himself he suddenly exclaimed a friend yes i have a friend a powerful one too one sent by heaven to be my protector but whom i have too long neglected  who can that be said oswald  who should it be said edmund but that good sir philip harclay the chosen friend of him whom i shall from henceforward call my father  tis true indeed said oswald and this is a fresh proof of what i before observed that heaven assists you and will complete its own work  i think so myself said edmund and rely upon its direction i have already determined on my future conduct which i will communicate to you my first step shall be to leave the castle my lord has this day given me a horse upon which i purpose to set out this very night without the knowledge of any of the family i will go to sir philip harclay i will throw myself at his feet relate my strange story and implore his protection with him i will consult on the most proper way of bringing this murderer to public justice and i will be guided by his advice and direction in everything  nothing can be better said oswald than what you propose but give me leave to offer an addition to your scheme you shall set off in the dead of night as you intend joseph and i will favour your departure in such a manner as to throw a mystery over the circumstances of it your disappearing at such a time from the haunted apartment will terrify and confound all the family they will puzzle themselves in vain to account for it and they will be afraid to pry into the secrets of that place  you say well and i approve your addition replied edmund suppose likewise there was a letter written in a mysterious manner and dropt in my lords way or sent to him afterwards it would forward our design and frighten them away from that apartment that shall be my care said oswald and i will warrant you that they will not find themselves disposed to inhabit it presently  but how shall i leave my dear friend mr william without a word of notice of this separation  i have thought of that too said oswald and i will so manage as to acquaint him with it in such a manner as he shall think out of the common course of things and which shall make him wonder and be silent  how will you do that said edmund  i will tell you hereafter said oswald for here comes old joseph to meet us  he came indeed as fast as his age would permit him as soon as he was within hearing he asked them what news they related all that had passed at twyfords cottage he heard them with the greatest eagerness of attention and as soon as they came to the great event i knew it i knew it exclaimed joseph i was sure it would prove so thank god for it but i will be the first to acknowledge my young lord and i will live and die his faithful servant here joseph attempted to kneel to him but edmund prevented him with a warm embrace  my friend my dear friend said he i cannot suffer a man of your age to kneel to me are you not one of my best and truest friends i will ever remember your disinterested affection for me and if heaven restores me to my rights it shall be one of my first cares to render your old age easy and happy joseph wept over him and it was some time before he could utter a word  oswald gave them both time to recover their emotion by acquainting joseph with edmunds scheme for his departure joseph wiped his eyes and spoke i have thought said he of something that will be both agree  and useful to my dear master john wyatt sir philip harclays servant is now upon a visit at his fathers i have heard that he goes home soon now he would be both a guide and companion on the way  that is indeed a happy circumstance said edmund but how shall we know certainly the time of his departure  why sir i will go to him and enquire and bring you word directly  do so said edmund and you will oblige me greatly  but sir said oswald i think it will be best not to let john wyatt know who is to be his companion only let joseph tell him that a gentleman is going to visit his master and if possible prevail upon him to set out this night  do so my good friend said edmund and tell him further that this person has business of great consequence to communicate to his master and cannot delay his journey on any account  i will do this you may depend said joseph and acquaint you with my success as soon as possible but sir you must not go without a guide at any rate  i trust i shall not said edmund though i go alone he that has received such a call as i have can want no other nor fear any danger  they conversed on these points till they drew near the castle when joseph left them to go on his errand and edmund attended his lord at dinner the baron observed that he was silent and reserved the conversation languished on both sides as soon as dinner was ended edmund asked permission to go up into his own apartment where he packed up some necessaries and made a hasty preparation for his departure  afterwards he walked into the garden revolving in his mind the peculiarity of his situation and the uncertainty of his future prospects lost in thought he walked to and fro in a covered walk with his arms crossed and his eyes cast down without perceiving that he was observed by two females who stood at a distance watching his motions it was the lady emma and her attendant who were thus engaged at length he lifted up his eyes and saw them he stood still and was irresolute whether to advance or retire they approached him and as they drew near fair emma spoke  you have been so wrapt in meditation edmund that i am apprehensive of some new vexation that i am yet a stranger to would it were in my power to lessen those you have already but tell me if i guess truly  he stood still irresolute he answered with hesitation o ladyi ami am grieved i am concerned to be the cause of so much confusion in this noble family to which i am so much indebted i see no way to lessen these evils but to remove the cause of them  meaning yourself said she  certainly madam and i was meditating on my departure  but said she by your departure you will not remove the cause  how so madam  because you are not the cause but those you will leave behind you  lady emma  how can you affect this ignorance edmund you know well enough it is that odious wenlock your enemy and my aversion that has caused all this mischief among us and will much more if he is not removed  this madam is a subject that it becomes me to be silent upon mr wenlock is your kinsman he is not my friend and for that reason i ought not to speak against him nor you to hear it from me if he has used me ill i am recompensed by the generous treatment of my lord your father who is all that is great and good he has allowed me to justify myself to him and he has restored me to his good opinion which i prize among the best gifts of heaven your amiable brother william thinks well of me and his esteem is infinitely dear to me and you excellent lady permit me to hope that you honour me with your good opinion are not these ample amends for the illwill mr wenlock bears me  my opinion of you edmund said she is fixed and settled it is not founded upon events of yesterday but upon long knowledge and experience upon your whole conduct and character  you honour me lady continue to think well of me it will excite me to deserve it when i am far distant from this place the remembrance of your goodness will be a cordial to my heart  but why will you leave us edmund stay and defeat the designs of your enemy you shall have my wishes and assistance  pardon me madam that is among the things i cannot do even if it were in my power which it is not mr wenlock loves you lady and if he is so unhappy as to be your aversion that is a punishment severe enough for the rest i may be unfortunate by the wickedness of others but if i am unworthy it must be by my own fault  so then you think it is an unworthy action to oppose mr wenlock very well sir then i suppose you wish him success you wish that i may be married to him  i madam said edmund confused what am i that i should give my opinion on an affair of so much consequence you distress me by the question may you be happy may you enjoy your own wishes  he sighed he turned away she called him back he trembled and kept silence  she seemed to enjoy his confusion she was cruel enough to repeat the question  tell me edmund and truly do you wish to see me give my hand to wenlock i insist upon your answer  all on a sudden he recovered both his voice and courage he stepped forward his person erect his countenance assured his voice resolute and intrepid  since lady emma insists upon my answer since she avows a dislike to wenlock since she condescends to ask my opinion i will tell her my thoughts my wishes  the fair emma now trembled in her turn she blushed looked down and was ashamed to have spoken so freely  edmund went on my most ardent wishes are that the fair emma may reserve her heart and hand till a certain person a friend of mine is at liberty to solicit them whose utmost ambition is first to deserve and then to obtain them  your friend sir said lady emma her brow clouded her eye disdainful  edmund proceeded my friend is so particularly circumstanced that he cannot at present with propriety ask for lady emmas favour but as soon as he has gained a cause that is yet in suspence he will openly declare his pretensions and if he is unsuccessful he will then condemn himself to eternal silence   lady emma knew not what to think of this declaration she hoped she feared she meditated but her attention was too strongly excited to be satisfied without some gratification after a pause she pursued the subject  and this friend of yours sir of what degree and fortune is he  edmund smiled but commanding his emotion he replied his birth is noble his degree and fortune uncertain  her countenance fell she sighed he proceeded it is utterly impossible said he for any man of inferior degree to aspire to lady emmas favour her noble birth the dignity of her beauty and virtues must awe and keep at their proper distance all men of inferior degree and merit they may admire they may revere but they must not presume to approach too near lest their presumption should meet with its punishment  well sir said she suddenly and so this friend of yours has commissioned you to speak in his behalf  he has madam  then i must tell you that i think his assurance is very great and yours not much less  i am sorry for that madam  tell him that i shall reserve my heart and hand for the man to whom my father shall bid me give them  very well lady i am certain my lord loves you too well to dispose of them against your inclination  how do you know that sir but tell him that the man that hopes for my favour must apply to my lord for his  that is my friends intentionhis resolution i should sayas soon as he can do it with propriety and i accept your permission for him to do so  my permission did you say i am astonished at your assurance tell me no more of your friend but perhaps you are pleading for wenlock all this time it is all one to me only say no more  are you offended with me madam  no matter sir  yes it is  i am surprised at you edmund  i am surprised at my own temerity but forgive me  it does not signify good bye tye sir  dont leave me in anger madam i cannot bear that perhaps i may not see you again for a long time   he looked afflicted she turned back  i do forgive you edmund i was concerned for you but it seems you are more concerned for every body than for yourself she sighed farewell said she  edmund gazed on her with tenderness he approached her he just touched her hand his heart was rising to his lips but he recollected his situation he checked himself immediately he retired back he sighed deeply bowed low and hastily quitted her  the lady turning into another walk he reached the house first and went up again to his chamber he threw himself upon his knees prayed for a thousand blessings upon every one of the family of his benefactor and involuntarily wept at mentioning the name of the charming emma whom he was about to leave abruptly and perhaps for ever he then endeavoured to compose himself and once more attended the baron wished him a good night and withdrew to his chamber till he was called upon to go again to the haunted apartment  he came down equipped for his journey and went hastily for fear of observation he paid his customary devotions and soon after oswald tapped at the door they conferred together upon the interesting subject that engrossed their attention until joseph came to them who brought the rest of edmunds baggage and some refreshment for him before he set out edmund promised to give them the earliest information of his situation and success at the hour of twelve they heard the same groans as the night before in the lower apartment but being somewhat familiarized to it they were not so strongly affected oswald crossed himself and prayed for the departed soul he also prayed for edmund and recommended him to the divine protection he then arose and embraced that young man who also took a tender leave of his friend joseph they then went with silence and caution through a long gallery they descended the stairs in the same manner they crossed the hall in profound silence and hardly dared to breathe lest they should be overheard they found some difficulty in opening one of the folding doors which at last they accomplished they were again in jeopardy at the outward gate at length they conveyed him safely into the stables there they again embraced him and prayed for his prosperity  he then mounted his horse and set forward to wyatts cottage he hallooed at the door and was answered from within in a few minutes john came out to him  what is it you master edmund  hush said he not a word of who i am i go upon private business and would not wish to be known  if you will go forward sir i will soon overtake you he did so and they pursued their journey to the north in the mean time oswald and joseph returned in silence into the house they retired to their respective apartments without hearing or being heard by any one  about the dawn of day oswald intended to lay his packets in the way of those to whom they were addressed after much contrivance he determined to take a bold step and if he were discovered to frame some excuse encouraged by his late success he went on tiptoe into master williams chamber placed a letter upon his pillow and withdrew unheard exulting in his heart he attempted the barons apartment but found it fastened within finding this scheme frustrated he waited till the hour the baron was expected down to breakfast and laid the letter and the key of the haunted apartment upon the table soon after he saw the baron enter the breakfast room he got out of sight but staid within call preparing himself for a summons the baron sat down to breakfast he saw a letter directed to himselfhe opened it and to his great surprise read as follows  the guardian of the haunted apartment to baron fitzowen to thee i remit the key of my charge until the right owner shall come who will both discover and avenge my wrongs then woe be to the guiltybut let the innocent rest in peace in the mean time let none presume to explore the secrets of my apartment lest they suffer for their temerity  the baron was struck with amazement at the letter he took up the key examined it then laid it down and took up the letter he was in such confusion of thought he knew not what to do or say for several minutes at length he called his servants about him the first question he asked was  where is edmund  they could not tell  has he been called  yes my lord but nobody answered and the key was not in the door  where is joseph  gone into the stables  where is father oswald  in his study  seek him and desire him to come hither  by the time the baron had read the letter over again he came  he had been framing a steady countenance to answer to all interrogatories as he came in he attentively observed the baron whose features were in strong agitation as soon as he saw oswald he spoke as one out of breath  take that key and read this letter  he did so shrugged up his shoulders and remained silent  father said my lord what think you of this letter  it is a very surprising one  the contents are alarming where is edmund  i do not know  has nobody seen him  not that i know of  call my sons my kinsmen my servants  the servants came in  have any of you seen or heard of edmund  no was the answer  father step upstairs to my sons and kinsmen and desire them to come down immediately  oswald withdrew and went first to mr williams chamber  my dear sir you must come to my lord now directlyhe has something extraordinary to communicate to you  and so have i fathersee what i have found upon my pillow  pray sir read it to me before you shew it to any body my lord is alarmed too much already and wants nothing to increase his consternation  william read his letter while oswald looked as if he was an utter stranger to the contents which were these  whatever may be heard or seen let the seal of friendship be upon thy lips the peasant edmund is no more but there still lives a man who hopes to acknowledge and repay the lord fitzowens generous care and protection to return his beloved williams vowed affection and to claim his friendship on terms of equality  what said william can this mean  it is not easy to say replied oswald  can you tell what is the cause of this alarm  i can tell you nothing but that my lord desires to see you directlypray make haste down i must go up to your brothers and kinsmen nobody knows what to think or believe  master william went down stairs and father oswald went to the malcontents as soon as he entered the outward door of their apartment mr wenlock called out here comes the friendnow for some new proposal  gentlemen said oswald my lord desires your company immediately in the breakfast parlour  what to meet your favourite edmund i suppose said mr wenlock  no sir  what then is the matter said sir robert  something very extraordinary has happened gentlemen edmund is not to be foundhe disappeared from the haunted apartment the key of which was conveyed to my lord in a strange manner with a letter from an unknown hand my lord is both surprised and concerned and wishes to have your opinion and advice on the occasion  tell him said sir robert we will wait upon him immediately  as oswald went away he heard wenlock say so edmund is gone it is no matter how or whither  another said i hope the ghost has taken him out of the way the rest laughed at the conceit as they followed oswald down stairs they found the baron and his son william commenting upon the key and the letter my lord gave them to sir robert who looked on them with marks of surprise and confusion  the baron addressed him  is not this a very strange affair son robert lay aside your ill humours and behave to your father with the respect and affection his tenderness deserves from you and give me your advice and opinion on this alarming subject  my lord said sir robert i am as much confounded as yourselfi can give no advicelet my cousins see the letterlet us have their opinion  they read it in turnthey were equally surprised but when it came into wenlocks hand he paused and meditated some minutes  at lengthi am indeed surprised and still more concerned to see my lord and uncle the dupe of an artful contrivance and if he will permit me i shall endeavour to unriddle it to the confusion of all that are concerned in it  do so dick said my lord and you shall have my thanks for it  this letter said he i imagine to be the contrivance of edmund or some ingenious friend of his to conceal some designs they have against the peace of this family which has been too often disturbed upon that rascals account  but what end could be proposed by it said the baron  why one part of the scheme is to cover edmunds departure that is clear enough for the rest we can only guess at itperhaps he may be concealed somewhere in that apartment from whence he may rush out in the night and either rob or murder us or at least alarm and terrify the family  the baron smiled  you shoot beyond the mark sir and overshoot yourself as you have done before now you shew only your inveteracy against that poor lad whom you cannot mention with temper to what purpose should he shut himself up there to be starved  starved no no he has friends in this house looking at oswald who will not suffer him to want anything those who have always magnified his virtues and extenuated his faults will lend a hand to help him in time of need and perhaps to assist his ingenious contrivances  oswald shrugged up his shoulders and remained silent  this is a strange fancy of yours dick said my lord but i am willing to pursue itfirst to discover what you drive at and secondly to satisfy all that are here present of the truth or falsehood of it that they may know what value to set upon your sagacity hereafter let us all go over that apartment together and let joseph be called to attend us thither  oswald offered to call him but wenlock stopped him no father said he you must stay with us we want your ghostly counsel and advice joseph shall have no private conference with you  what mean you said oswald to insinuate to my lord against me or joseph but your illwill spares nobody it will one day be known who is the disturber of the peace of this family i wait for that time and am silent  joseph came when he was told whither they were going he looked hard at oswald wenlock observed them  lead the way father said he and joseph shall follow us  oswald smiled  we will go where heaven permits us said he alas the wisdom of man can neither hasten nor retard its decrees  they followed the father up stairs and went directly to the haunted apartment the baron unlocked the door he bid joseph open the shutters and admit the daylight which had been excluded for many years they went over the rooms above stairs and then descended the staircase and through the lower rooms in the same manner however they overlooked the closet in which the fatal secret was concealed the door was covered with tapestry the same as the room and united so well that it seemed but one piece wenlock tauntingly desired father oswald to introduce them to the ghost the father in reply asked them where they should find edmund do you think said he that he lies hid in my pocket or in josephs  tis no matter answered he thoughts are free  my opinion of you sir said oswald is not founded upon thoughtsi judge of men by their actionsa rule i believe it will not suit you to be tried by  none of your insolent admonitions father returned wenlock this is neither the time nor the place for them   that is truer than you are aware of sir i meant not to enter into the subject just now  be silent said my lord  i shall enter into this subject with you hereafterthen look you be prepared for it in the mean time do you dick wenlock answer to my questionsdo you think edmund is concealed in this apartment  no sir  do you think there is any mystery in it  no my lord  is it haunted think you  no i think not  should you be afraid to try  in what manner my lord  why you have shewn your wit upon the subject and i mean to show your courageyou and jack markham your confident shall sleep here three nights as edmund has done before  sir said sir robert for what purpose i should be glad to understand why  i have my reasons sir as well as your kinsmen there no reply sirs i insist upon being obeyed in this point joseph let the beds be well aired and every thing made agreeable to the gentlemen if there is any contrivance to impose upon me they i am sure will have pleasure in detecting it and if not i shall obtain my end in making these rooms habitable oswald come with me and the rest may go where they list till dinnertime  the baron went with oswald into the parlour  now tell me father said he do you disapprove what i have done  quite the contrary my lord said he i entirely approve it  but you do not know all my reasons for it yesterday edmunds behaviour was different from what i have ever seen ithe is naturally frank and open in all his ways but he was then silent thoughtful absent he sighed deeply and once i saw tears stand in his eyes now i do suspect there is something uncommon in that apartmentthat edmund has discovered the secret and fearing to disclose it he is fled away from the house as to this letter perhaps he may have written it to hint that there is more than he dares reveal i tremble at the hints contained in it though i shall appear to make light of it but i and mine are innocent and if heaven discloses the guilt of others i ought to adore and submit to its decrees  that is prudently and piously resolved my lord let us do our duty and leave events to heaven  but father i have a further view in obliging my kinsmen to sleep thereif any thing should appear to them it is better that it should only be known to my own family if there is nothing in it i shall put to the proof the courage and veracity of my two kinsmen of whom i think very indifferently i mean shortly to enquire into many things i have heard lately to their disadvantage and if i find them guilty they shall not escape with impunity  my lord said oswald you judge like yourself i wish you to make enquiry concerning them and believe the result will be to their confusion and your lordship will be enabled to reestablish the peace of your family  during this conversation oswald was upon his guard lest any thing should escape that might create suspicion he withdrew as soon as he could with decency and left the baron meditating what all these things should mean he feared there was some misfortune impending over his house though he knew not from what cause  he dined with his children and kinsmen and strove to appear cheerful but a gloom was perceivable through his deportment sir robert was reserved and respectful mr william was silent and attentive the rest of the family dutifully assiduous to my lord only wenlock and markham were sullen and chagrined the baron detained the young men the whole afternoon he strove to amuse and to be amused he shewed the greatest affection and parental regard to his children and endeavoured to conciliate their affections and engage their gratitude by kindness wenlock and markham felt their courage abate as the night approached at the hour of nine old joseph came to conduct them to the haunted apartment they took leave of their kinsmen and went up stairs with heavy hearts  they found the chamber set in order for them and a table spread with provision and good liquor to keep up their spirits  it seems said wenlock that your friend edmund was obliged to you for his accommodations here  sir said joseph his accommodations were bad enough the first night but afterwards they were bettered by my lords orders  owing to your officious cares said wenlock  i own it said joseph and i am not ashamed of it  are you not anxious to know what is become of him said markham  not at all sir i trust he is in the best protection so good a young man as he is is safe everywhere  you see cousin jack said wenlock how this villain has stole the hearts of my uncles servants i suppose this canting old fellow knows where he is if the truth were known  have you any further commands for me gentlemen said the old man  no not we  then i am ordered to attend my lord when you have done with me  go then about your business  joseph went away glad to be dismissed  what shall we do cousin jack said wenlock to pass away the timeit is plaguy dull sitting here  dull enough said markham i think the best thing we can do is to go to bed and sleep it away  faith says wenlock i am in no disposition to sleep who would have thought the old man would have obliged us to spend the night here  dont say us i beg of you it was all your own doing replied markham  i did not intend he should have taken me at my word  then you should have spoken more cautiously i have always been governed by you like a fool as i am you play the braggart and i suffer for it but they begin to see through your finespun arts and contrivances and i believe you will meet with your deserts one day or other  what now do you mean to affront me jack know that some are born to plan others to execute i am one of the former thou of the latter know your friend or  or what replied markham do you mean to threaten me if you do  what then said wenlock  why then i will try which of us two is the best man sir  upon this markham arose and put himself into a posture of defence wenlock perceiving he was serious in his anger began to soothe him he persuaded he flattered he promised great things if he would be composed markham was sullen uneasy resentful whenever he spoke it was to upbraid wenlock with his treachery and falsehood wenlock tried all his eloquence to get him into a good humour but in vain he threatened to acquaint his uncle with all that he knew and to exculpate himself at the others expence wenlock began to find his choler rise they were both almost choaked with rage and at length they both rose with a resolution to fight  as they stood with their fists clenched on a sudden they were alarmed with a dismal groan from the room underneath they stood like statues petrified by fear yet listening with trembling expectation a second groan increased their consternation and soon after a third completed it they staggered to a seat and sunk down upon it ready to faint presently all the doors flew open a pale glimmering light appeared at the door from the staircase and a man in complete armour entered the room he stood with one hand extended pointing to the outward door they took the hint and crawled away as fast as fear would let them they staggered along the gallery and from thence to the barons apartment where wenlock sunk down in a swoon and markham had just strength enough to knock at the door  the servant who slept in the outward room alarmed his lord  markham cried out for heavens sake let us in  upon hearing his voice the door was opened and markham approached his uncle in such an attitude of fear as excited a degree of it in the baron he pointed to wenlock who was with some difficulty recovered from the fit he was fallen into the servant was terrified he rung the alarmbell the servants came running from all parts to their lords apartment the young gentlemen came likewise and presently all was confusion and the terror was universal oswald who guessed the business was the only one that could question them he asked several times  what is the matter  markham at last answered him we have seen the ghost  all regard to secrecy was now at an end the echo ran through the whole familythey have seen the ghost  the baron desired oswald to talk to the young men and endeavour to quiet the disturbance he came forward he comforted some he rebuked others he had the servants retire into the outward room the baron with his sons and kinsmen remained in the bedchamber  it is very unfortunate said oswald that this affair should be made so public surely these young men might have related what they had seen without alarming the whole family i am very much concerned upon my lords account  i thank you father said the baron but prudence was quite overthrown here wenlock was half dead and markham half distracted the family were alarmed without my being able to prevent it but let us hear what these poor terrified creatures say  oswald demanded what have you seen gentlemen  the ghost said markham  in what form did it appear  a man in armour  did it speak to you  no  what did it do to terrify you so much  it stood at the farthest door and pointed to the outward door as if to have us leave the room we did not wait for a second notice but came away as fast as we could  did it follow you  no  then you need not have raised such a disturbance  wenlock lifted up his head and spoke  i believe father if you had been with us you would not have stood upon ceremonies any more than we did i wish my lord would send you to parley with the ghost for without doubt you are better qualified than we  my lord said oswald i will go thither with your permission i will see that every thing is safe and bring the key back to you perhaps this may help to dispel the fears that have been raisedat least i will try to do it  i thank you father for your good officesdo as you please  oswald went into the outward room i am going said he to shut up the apartment the young gentlemen have been more frightened than they had occasion for i will try to account for it which of you will go with me  they all drew back except joseph who offered to bear him company they went into the bedroom in the haunted apartment and found every thing quiet there they put out the fire extinguished the lights locked the door and brought away the key as they returned i thought how it would be said joseph  hush not a word said oswald you find we are suspected of something though they know not what wait till you are called upon and then we will both speak to purpose they carried the key to the baron  all is quiet in the apartment said oswald as we can testify  did you ask joseph to go with you said the baron or did he offer himself  my lord i asked if any body would go with me and they all declined it but he i thought proper to have a witness beside myself for whatever might be seen or heard  joseph you were servant to the late lord lovel what kind of man was he  a very comely man please your lordship  should you know him if you were to see him  i cannot say my lord  would you have any objection to sleep a night in that apartment  i begi hopei beseech your lordship not to command me to do it  you are then afraid why did you offer yourself to go thither  because i was not so much frightened as the rest  i wish you would lie a night there but i do not insist upon it  my lord i am a poor ignorant old man not fit for such an undertaking beside if i should see the ghost and if it should be the person of my master and if it should tell me any thing and bid me keep it secret i should not dare to disclose it and then what service should i do your lordship  that is true indeed said the baron  this speech said sir robert is both a simple and an artful one you see however that joseph is not a man for us to depend upon he regards the lord lovel though dead more than lord fitzowen living he calls him his master and promises to keep his secrets what say you father is the ghost your master or your friend are you under any obligation to keep his secrets  sir said oswald i answer as joseph does i would sooner die than discover a secret revealed in that manner  i thought as much said sir robert there is a mystery in father oswalds behaviour that i cannot comprehend  do not reflect upon the father said the baron i have no cause to complain of him perhaps the mystery may be too soon explained but let us not anticipate evils oswald and joseph have spoken like good men i am satisfied with their answers let us who are innocent rest in peace and let us endeavour to restore peace in the family and do you father assist us  with my best services said oswald he called the servants in let nothing be mentioned out of doors said he of what has lately passed within especially in the east apartment the young gentlemen had not so much reason to be frightened as they apprehended a piece of furniture fell down in the rooms underneath which made the noise that alarmed them so much but i can certify that all things in the rooms are in quiet and there is nothing to fear all of you attend me in the chapel in an hour do your duties put your trust in god and obey your lord and you will find every thing go right as it used to do  they dispersed the sun rose the day came on and every thing went on in the usual course but the servants were not so easily satisfied they whispered that something was wrong and expected the time that should set all right the mind of the baron was employed in meditating upon these circumstances that seemed to him the forerunners of some great events he sometimes thought of edmund he sighed for his expulsion and lamented the uncertainty of his fate but to his family he appeared easy and satisfied  from the time of edmunds departure the fair emma had many uneasy hours she wished to enquire after him but feared to shew any solicitude concerning him the next day when her brother william came into her apartment she took courage to ask a question  pray brother can you give any guess what is become of edmund  no said he with a sigh why do you ask me  because my dear william i should think if any body knew it must be you and i thought he loved you too well to leave you in ignorance but dont you think he left the castle in a very strange manner  i do my dear there is a mystery in every circumstance of his departure nevertheless i will trust you with a secret he did not leave the castle without making a distinction in my favour  i thought so said she but you might tell me what you know about him  alas my dear emma i know nothing when i saw him last he seemed a good deal affected as if he were taking leave of me and i had a foreboding that we parted for a longer time than usual  ah so had i said she when he parted from me in the garden  what leave did he take of you emma  she blushed and hesitated to tell him all that passed between them but he begged persuaded insisted and at length under the strongest injunctions of secrecy she told him all  he said that edmunds behaviour on that occasion was as mysterious as the rest of his conduct but now you have revealed your secret you have a right to know mine  he then gave her the letter he found upon his pillow she read it with great emotion  saint winifred assist me said she what can i think the peasant edmund is no more but there lives onethat is to my thinking edmund lives but is no peasant  go on my dear said william i like your explanation  nay brother i only guess but what think you  i believe we think alike in more than one respect that he meant to recommend no other person than himself to your favour and if he were indeed of noble birth i would prefer him to a prince for a husband to my emma  bless me said she do you think it possible that he should be of either birth or fortune  it is hard to say what is impossible we have proof that the east apartment is haunted it was there that edmund was made acquainted with many secrets i doubt not and perhaps his own fate may be involved in that of others i am confident that what he saw and heard there was the cause of his departure we must wait with patience the unravelling this intricate affair i believe i need not enjoin your secrecy as to what i have said your heart will be my security  what mean you brother  dont affect ignorance my dear you love edmund so do i it is nothing to be ashamed of it would have been strange if a girl of your good sense had not distinguished a swan among a flock of geese  dear william dont let a word of this escape you but you have taken a weight off my heart you may depend that i will not dispose of my hand or heart till i know the end of this affair  william smiled keep them for edmunds friend i shall rejoice to see him in a situation to ask them  hush my brother not a word more i hear footsteps  they were her eldest brothers who came to ask mr william to ride out with him which finished the conference  the fair emma from this time assumed an air of satisfaction and william frequently stole away from his companions to talk with his sister upon their favourite subject  while these things passed at the castle of lovel edmund and his companion john wyatt proceeded on their journey to sir philip harclays seat they conversed together on the way and edmund found him a man of understanding though not improved by education he also discovered that john loved his master and respected him even to veneration from him he learned many particulars concerning that worthy knight wyatt told him that sir philip maintained twelve old soldiers who had been maimed and disabled in the wars and had no provision made for them also six old officers who had been unfortunate and were grown grey without preferment he likewise mentioned the greek gentleman his masters captive and friend as a man eminent for valour and piety but beside these said wyatt there are many others who eat of my masters bread and drink of his cup and who join in blessings and prayers to heaven for their noble benefactor his ears are ever open to distress his hand to relieve it and he shares in every good mans joys and blessings  oh what a glorious character said edmund how my heart throbs with wishes to imitate such a man oh that i might resemble him though at ever so great a distance  edmund was never weary of hearing the actions of this truly great man nor wyatt with relating them and during three days journey there were but few pauses in their conversation  the fourth day when they came within view of the house edmunds heart began to raise doubts of his reception if said he sir philip should not receive me kindly if he should resent my long neglect and disown my acquaintance it would be no more than justice  he sent wyatt before to notify his arrival to sir philip while he waited at the gate full of doubts and anxieties concerning his reception wyatt was met and congratulated on his return by most of his fellowservants he asked  where is my master  in the parlour  are any strangers with him  no only his own family  then i will shew myself to him  he presented himself before sir philip  so john said he you are welcome home i hope you left your parents and relations well  all well thank god and send their humble duty to your honour and they pray for you every day of their lives i hope your honour is in good health  very well  thank god for that but sir i have something further to tell you i have had a companion all the way home a person who comes to wait on your honour on business of great consequence as he says  who is that john  it is master edmund twyford from the castle of lovel  young edmund says sir philip surprised where is he  at the gate sir  why did you leave him there  because he bade me come before and acquaint your honour that he waits your pleasure  bring him hither said sir philip tell him i shall be glad to see him  john made haste to deliver his message and edmund followed him in silence into sir philips presence  he bowed low and kept at a distance sir philip held out his hand and bad him approach as he drew near he was seized with an universal trembling he kneeled down took his hand kissed it and pressed it to his heart in silence  you are welcome young man said sir philip take courage and speak for yourself  edmund sighed deeply he at length broke silence with difficulty i am come thus far noble sir to throw myself at your feet and implore your protection you are under god my only reliance  i receive you said sir philip with all my heart your person is greatly improved since i saw you last and i hope your mind is equally so i have heard a great character of you from some that knew you in france i remember the promise i made you long ago and am ready now to fulfil it upon condition that you have done nothing to disgrace the good opinion i formerly entertained of you and am ready to serve you in any thing consistent with my own honour  edmund kissed the hand that was extended to raise him i accept your favour sir upon this condition only and if ever you find me to impose upon your credulity or incroach on your goodness may you renounce me from that moment  enough said sir philip rise then and let me embrace you you are truly welcome  oh noble sir said edmund i have a strange story to tell you but it must be by ourselves with only heaven to bear witness to what passes between us  very well said sir philip i am ready to hear you but first go and get some refreshment after your journey and then come to me again john wyatt will attend you  i want no refreshment said edmund and i cannot eat or drink till i have told my business to your honour  well then said sir philip come along with me he took the youth by the hand and led him into another parlour leaving his friends in great surprise what this young mans errand could be john wyatt told them all that he knew relating to edmunds birth character and situation  when sir philip had seated his young friend he listened in silence to the surprising tale he had to tell him edmund told him briefly the most remarkable circumstances of his life from the time when he first saw and liked him till his return from france but from that era he related at large every thing that had happened recounting every interesting particular which was imprinted on his memory in strong and lasting characters sir philip grew every moment more affected by the recital sometimes he clasped his hands together he lifted them up to heaven he smote his breast he sighed he exclaimed aloud when edmund related his dream he breathed short and seemed to devour him with attention when he described the fatal closet he trembled sighed sobbed and was almost suffocated with his agitation but when he related all that passed between his supposed mother and himself and finally produced the jewels the proofs of his birth and the death of his unfortunate mother he flew to him he pressed him to his bosom he strove to speak but speech was for some minutes denied he wept aloud and at length his words found their way in broken exclamations  son of my dearest friend dear and precious relic of a noble house child of providence the beloved of heaven welcome thrice welcome to my arms to my heart i will be thy parent from henceforward and thou shalt be indeed my child my heir my mind told me from the first moment i beheld thee that thou wert the image of my friend my heart then opened itself to receive thee as his offspring i had a strange foreboding that i was to be thy protector i would then have made thee my own but heaven orders things for the best it made thee the instrument of this discovery and in its own time and manner conducted thee to my arms praise be to god for his wonderful doings towards the children of men every thing that has befallen thee is by his direction and he will not leave his work unfinished i trust that i shall be his instrument to do justice on the guilty and to restore the orphan of my friend to his rights and title i devote myself to this service and will make it the business of my life to effect it  edmund gave vent to his emotions in raptures of joy and gratitude they spent several hours in this way without thinking of the time that passed the one enquiring the other explaining and repeating every particular of the interesting story  at length they were interrupted by the careful john wyatt who was anxious to know if any thing was likely to give trouble to his master  sir said john it grows darkdo you want a light  we want no light but what heaven gives us said sir philip i knew not whether it was dark or light  i hope said john nothing has happened i hope your honour has heard no bad tidings iii hope no offence  none at all said the good knight i am obliged to your solicitude for me i have heard some things that grieve me and others that give me great pleasure but the sorrows are past and the joys remain  thank god said john i was afraid something was the matter to give your honour trouble  i thank you my good servant you see this young gentleman i would have you john devote yourself to his service i give you to him for an attendant on his person and would have you show your affection to me by your attachment to him  oh sir said john in a melancholy voice what have i done to be turned out of your service  no such matter john said sir philip you will not leave my service  sir said john i would rather die than leave you  and my lad i like you too well to part with you but in serving my friend you will serve me know that this young man is my son  your son sir said john  not my natural son but my relation my son by adoption my heir  and will he live with you sir  yes john and i hope to die with him  oh then i will serve him with all my heart and soul and i will do my best to please you both  i thank you john and i will not forget your honest love and duty i have so good an opinion of you that i will tell you of some things concerning this gentleman that will entitle him to your respect  tis enough for me said john to know that your honour respects him to make me pay him as much duty as yourself  but john when you know him better you will respect him still more at present i shall only tell you what he is not for you think him only the son of andrew twyford  and is he not said john  no but his wife nursed him and he passed for her son  and does old twyford know it sir  he does and will bear witness to it but he is the son of a near friend of mine of quality superior to my own and as such you must serve and respect him  i shall to be sure sir but what name shall i call him  you shall know that hereafter in the mean time bring a light and wait on us to the other parlour  when john was withdrawn sir philip said that is a point to be considered and determined immediately it is proper that you should assume a name till you can take that of your father for i choose you should drop that of your fosterfather and i would have you be called by one that is respectable  in that and every other point i will be wholly governed by you sir  said edmund  well then i will give you the name of seagrave i shall say that you are a relation of my own and my mother was really of that family  john soon returned and attended them into the other parlour sir philip entered with edmund in his hand   my friends said he this gentleman is mr edward seagrave the son of a dear friend and relation of mine he was lost in his infancy brought up by a good woman out of pure humanity and is but lately restored to his own family the circumstances shall be made known hereafter in the meantime i have taken him under my care and protection and will use all my power and interest to see him restored to his fortune which is enjoyed by the usurper who was the cause of his expulsion and the death of his parents receive him as my relation and friend zadisky do you embrace him first edmund you and this gentleman must love each other for my sake hereafter you will do it for your own they all rose each embraced and congratulated the young man  zadisky said sir whatever griefs and misfortunes you may have endured you may reckon them at an end from the hour you are beloved and protected by sir philip harclay  i firmly believe it sir replied edmund and my heart enjoys already more happiness than i ever yet felt and promises me all that i can wish in future his friendship is the earnest heaven gives me of its blessings hereafter  they sat down to supper with mutual cheerfulness and edmund enjoyed the repast with more satisfaction than he had felt a long time sir philip saw his countenance brighten up and looked on him with heartfelt pleasure  every time i look on you said he reminds me of your father you are the same person i loved twentythree years agoi rejoice to see you under my roof go to your repose early and tomorrow we will consult farther  edmund withdrew and enjoyed a night of sweet undisturbed repose  the next morning edmund arose in perfect health and spirits he waited on his benefactor they were soon after joined by zadisky who shewed great attention and respect to the youth and offered him his best services without reserve edmund accepted them with equal respect and modesty and finding himself at ease began to display his amiable qualities they breakfasted together afterwards sir philip desired edmund to walk out with him  as soon as they were out of hearing sir philip said i could not sleep last night for thinking of your affairs i laid schemes for you and rejected them again we must lay our plan before we begin to act what shall be done with this treacherous kinsman this inhuman monster this assassin of his nearest relation i will risk my life and fortune to bring him to justice shall i go to court and demand justice of the king or shall i accuse him of the murder and make him stand a public trial if i treat him as a baron of the realm he must be tried by his peers if as a commoner he must be tried at the county assize but we must shew reason why he should be degraded from his title have you any thing to propose  nothing sir i have only to wish that it might be as private as possible for the sake of my noble benefactor the lord fitzowen upon whom some part of the family disgrace would naturally fall and that would be an ill return for all his kindness and generosity to me  that is a generous and grateful consideration on your part but you owe still more to the memory of your injured parents however there is yet another way that suits me better than any hitherto proposed i will challenge the traitor to meet me in the field and if he has spirit enough to answer my call i will there bring him to justice if not i will bring him to a public trial  no sir said edmund that is my province should i stand by and see my noble gallant friend expose his life for me i should be unworthy to bear the name of that friend whom you so much lament it will become his son to vindicate his name and revenge his death i will be the challenger and no other  and do you think he will answer the challenge of an unknown youth with nothing but his pretensions to his name and title certainly not leave this matter to me i will think of a way that will oblige him to meet me at the house of a third person who is known to all the parties concerned and where we will have authentic witnesses of all that passes between him and me i will devise the time place and manner and satisfy all your scruples  edmund offered to reply but sir philip bad him be silent and let him proceed in his own way  he then led him over his estate and shewed him every thing deserving his notice he told him all the particulars of his domestic economy and they returned home in time to meet their friends at dinner  they spent several days in consulting how to bring sir walter to account and in improving their friendship and confidence in each other edmund endeared himself so much to his friend and patron that he declared him his adopted son and heir before all his friends and servants and ordered them to respect him as such he every day improved their love and regard for him and became the darling of the whole family  after much consideration sir philip fixed his resolutions and began to execute his purposes he set out for the seat of the lord clifford attended by edmund m zadisky and two servants lord clifford received them with kindness and hospitality  sir philip presented edmund to lord clifford and his family as his near relation and presumptive heir they spent the evening in the pleasures of convivial mirth and hospitable entertainment the next day sir philip began to open his mind to lord clifford informing him that both his young friend and himself had received great injuries from the present lord lovel for which they were resolved to call him to account but that for many reasons they were desirous to have proper witnesses of all that should pass between them and begging the favour of his lordship to be the principal one lord clifford acknowledged the confidence placed in him and besought sir philip to let him be the arbitrator between them sir philip assured him that their wrongs would not admit of arbitration as he should hereafter judge but that he was unwilling to explain them further till he knew certainly whether or not the lord lovel would meet him for if he refused he must take another method with him  lord clifford was desirous to know the grounds of the quarrel but sir philip declined entering into particulars at present assuring him of a full information hereafter he then sent m zadisky attended by john wyatt and a servant of lord clifford with a letter to lord lovel the contents were as follow  my lord lovelsir philip harclay earnestly desires to see you at the house of lord clifford where he waits to call you to account for the injuries done by you to the late arthur lord lovel your kinsman if you accept his demand he will make the lord clifford a witness and a judge of the cause if not he will expose you publicly as a traitor and a coward please to answer this letter and he will acquaint you with the time place and manner of the meeting  philip harclay   zadisky presented the letter to lord lovel informing him that he was the friend of sir philip harclay he seemed surprised and confounded at the contents but putting on an haughty air i know nothing said he of the business this letter hints at but wait a few hours and i will give you an answer he gave orders to treat zadisky as a gentleman in every respect except in avoiding his company for the greek had a shrewd and penetrating aspect and he observed every turn of his countenance the next day he came and apologized for his absence and gave him the answer sending his respects to the lord clifford the messengers returned with all speed and sir philip read the answer before all present   lord lovel knows not of any injuries done by him to the late arthur lord lovel whom he succeeded by just right of inheritance nor of any right sir philip harclay has to call to account a man to whom he is barely known having seen him only once many years ago at the house of his uncle the old lord lovel nevertheless lord lovel will not suffer any man to call his name and honour into question with impunity for which reason he will meet sir philip harclay at any time place and in what manner he shall appoint bringing the same number of friends and dependents that justice may be done to all parties  lovel   tis well said sir philip i am glad to find he has the spirit to meet me he is an enemy worthy of my sword  lord clifford then proposed that both parties should pass the borders and obtain leave of the warden of the scottish marches to decide the quarrel in his jurisdiction with a select number of friends on both sides sir philip agreed to the proposal and lord clifford wrote in his own name to ask permission of the lord graham that his friends might come there and obtained it on condition that neither party should exceed a limited number of friends and followers  lord clifford sent chosen messengers to lord lovel acquainting him with the conditions and appointing the time place and manner of their meeting and that he had been desired to accept the office of judge of the field lord lovel accepted the conditions and promised to be there without fail lord clifford notified the same to lord graham warden of the marches who caused a piece of ground to be inclosed for the lists and made preparations against the day appointed  in the interim sir philip harclay thought proper to settle his worldly affairs he made zadisky acquainted with every circumstance of edmunds history and the obligation that lay upon him to revenge the death of his friend and see justice done to his heir zadisky entered into the cause with an ardour that spoke the affection he bore to his friend  why said he would you not suffer me to engage this traitor your life is of too much consequence to be staked against his but though i trust that the justice of your cause must succeed yet if it should happen otherwise i vow to revenge you he shall never go back from us both however my hope and trust is to see your arm the minister of justice   sir philip then sent for a lawyer and made his will by which he appointed edmund his chief heir by the name of lovel alias seagrave alias twyford he ordered that all his old friends soldiers and servants should be maintained in the same manner during their lives he left to zadisky an annuity of an hundred a year and a legacy of two hundred pounds one hundred pounds to a certain monastery the same sum to be distributed among disbanded soldiers and the same to the poor and needy in his neighbourhood  he appointed lord clifford joint executor with edmund and gave his will into that noblemans care recommending edmund to his favour and protection  if i live said he i will make him appear to be worthy of it if i die he will want a friend i am desirous your lordship as a judge of the field should be unprejudiced on either side that you may judge impartially if i die edmunds pretensions die with me but my friend zadisky will acquaint you with the foundation of them i take these precautions because i ought to be prepared for every thing but my heart is warm with better hopes and i trust i shall live to justify my own cause as well as that of my friend who is a person of more consequence than he appears to be  lord clifford accepted the trust and expressed the greatest reliance upon sir philips honour and veracity  while these preparations were making for the great event that was to decide the pretensions of edmund his enemies at the castle of lovel were brought to shame for their behaviour to him  the disagreement between wenlock and markham had by degrees brought on an explanation of some parts of their conduct father oswald had often hinted to the baron wenlocks envy of edmunds superior qualities and the artifices by which he had obtained such an influence with sir robert as to make him take his part upon all occasions oswald now took advantage of the breach between these two incendiaries to persuade markham to justify himself at wenlocks expence and to tell all he knew of his wickedness at length he promised to declare all he knew of wenlocks conduct as well in france as since their return when he should be called upon and by him oswald was enabled to unravel the whole of his contrivances against the honour interest and even life of edmund  he prevailed on hewson and kemp his associate to add their testimony to the others hewson confessed that he was touched in his conscience when he reflected on the cruelty and injustice of his behaviour to edmund whose behaviour towards him after he had laid a snare for his life was so noble and generous that he was cut to the heart by it and had suffered so much pain and remorse that he longed for nothing so much as an opportunity to unburden his mind but the dread of mr wenlocks anger and the effects of his resentment had hitherto kept him silent always hoping there would come a time when he might have leave to declare the whole truth  oswald conveyed this information to the barons ear who waited for an opportunity to make the proper use of it not long after the two principal incendiaries came to an open rupture and markham threatened wenlock that he would shew his uncle what a serpent he had harboured in his bosom the baron arrested his words and insisted upon his telling all he knew adding  if you speak the truth i will support you but if you prove false i will punish you severely as to mr wenlock he shall have a fair trial and if all the accusations i have heard are made good it is high time that i should put him out of my family  the baron with a stern aspect bade them follow him into the great hall and sent for all the rest of the family together  he then with great solemnity told them he was ready to hear all sides of the question he declared the whole substance of his informations and called upon the accusers to support the charge hewson and kemp gave the same account they had done to oswald offering to swear to the truth of their testimony several of the other servants related such circumstances as had come to their knowledge markham then spoke of every thing and gave a particular account of all that had passed on the night they spent in the east apartment he accused himself of being privy to wenlocks villany called himself fool and blockhead for being the instrument of his malignant disposition and asked pardon of his uncle for concealing it so long  the baron called upon wenlock to reply to the charge who instead of answering flew into a passion raged swore threatened and finally denied every thing the witnesses persisted in their assertions markham desired leave to make known the reason why they were all afraid of him  he gives it out said he that he is to be my lords soninlaw and they supposing him to stand first in his favour are afraid of his displeasure  i hope said the baron i shall not be at such a loss for a soninlaw as to make choice of such a one as him he never but once hinted at such a thing and then i gave him no encouragement i have long seen there was something very wrong in him but i did not believe he was of so wicked a disposition it is no wonder that princes should be so frequently deceived when i a private man could be so much imposed upon within the circle of my own family what think you son robert  i sir have been much more imposed on and i take shame to myself on the occasion  enough my son said the baron a generous confession is only a proof of growing wisdom you are now sensible that the best of us are liable to imposition the artifices of this unworthy kinsman have set us at variance with each other and driven away an excellent youth from this house to go i know not whither but he shall no longer triumph in his wickedness he shall feel what it is to be banished from the house of his protector he shall set out for his mothers this very day i will write to her in such a manner as shall inform her that he has offended me without particularising the nature of his faults i will give him an opportunity of recovering his credit with his own family and this shall be my security against his doing further mischief may he repent and be forgiven  markham deserves punishment but not in the same degree  i confess it said he and will submit to whatever your lordship shall enjoin  you shall only be banished for a time but he for ever i will send you abroad on a business that shall put you in a way to do credit to yourself and service to me son robert have you any objection to my sentence  my lord said he i have great reason to distrust myself i am sensible of my own weakness and your superior wisdom as well as goodness and i will henceforward submit to you in all things  the baron ordered two of his servants to pack up wenlocks clothes and necessaries and to set out with him that very day he bade some others keep an eye upon him lest he should escape as soon as they were ready my lord wished him a good journey and gave him a letter for his mother he departed without saying a word in a sullen kind of resentment but his countenance shewed the inward agitations of his mind  as soon as he was gone every mouth was opened against him a thousand stories came out that they never heard before the baron and his sons were astonished that he should go on so long without detection my lord sighed deeply at the thoughts of edmunds expulsion and ardently wished to know what was become of him   sir robert took the opportunity of coming to an explanation with his brother william he took shame to himself for some part of his past behaviour mr william owned his affection to edmund and justified it by his merit and attachment to him which were such that he was certain no time or distance could alter them he accepted his brothers acknowledgement as a full amends for all that had passed and begged that henceforward an entire love and confidence might ever subsist between them these new regulations restored peace confidence and harmony in the castle of lovel  at length the day arrived for the combatants to meet the lord graham with twelve followers gentlemen and twelve servants was ready at the dawn of day to receive them  the first that entered the field was sir philip harclay knight armed completely excepting his headpiece hugh rugby his esquire bearing his lance john barnard his page carrying his helmet and spurs and two servants in his proper livery the next came edmund the heir of lovel followed by his servant john wyatt zadisky followed by his servant   at a short distance came the lord clifford as judge of the field with his esquire two pages and two liveryservants followed by his eldest son his nephew and a gentleman his friend each attended by one servant he also brought a surgeon of note to take care of the wounded   the lord graham saluted them and by his order they took their places without the lists and the trumpet sounded for the challenger it was answered by the defendant who soon after appeared attended by three gentlemen his friends with each one servant beside his own proper attendants  a place was erected for the lord clifford as judge of the field he desired lord graham would share the office who accepted it on condition that the combatants should make no objection and they agreed to it with the greatest courtesy and respect they consulted together on many points of honour and ceremony between the two combatants  they appointed a marshal of the field and other inferior officers usually employed on these occasions the lord graham sent the marshal for the challenger desiring him to declare the cause of his quarrel before his enemy sir philip harclay then advanced and thus spoke  i philip harclay knight challenge walter commonly called lord lovel as a base treacherous and bloody man who by his wicked arts and devices did kill or cause to be killed his kinsman arthur lord lovel my dear and noble friend i am called upon in an extraordinary manner to revenge his death and i will prove the truth of what i have affirmed at the peril of my life  lord graham then bade the defendant answer to the charge lord lovel stood forth before his followers and thus replied  i walter baron of lovel do deny the charge against me and affirm it to be a base false and malicious accusation of this sir philip harclay which i believe to be invented by himself or else framed by some enemy and told to him for wicked ends but be that as it may i will maintain my own honour and prove him to be a false traitor at the hazard of my own life and to the punishment of his presumption  then said the lord graham will not this quarrel admit of arbitration  no replied sir philip when i have justified this charge i have more to bring against him i trust in god and the justice of my cause and defy that traitor to the death  lord clifford then spoke a few words to lord graham who immediately called to the marshal and bade him open the lists and deliver their weapons to the combatants  while the marshal was arranging the combatants and their followers edmund approached his friend and patron he put one knee to the ground he embraced his knees with the strongest emotions of grief and anxiety he was dressed in complete armour with his visor down his device was a hawthorn with a graft of the rose upon it the mottothis is not my true parent but sir philip bade him take these wordse fructu arbor cognoscitur  sir philip embraced the youth with strong marks of affection be composed my child said he i have neither guilt fear nor doubt in me i am so certain of success that i bid you be prepared for the consequence  zadisky embraced his friend he comforted edmund he suggested every thing that could confirm his hopes of success  the marshal waited to deliver the spear to sir philip he now presented it with the usual form  sir receive your lance and god defend the right  sir philip answered amen in a voice that was heard by all present  he next presented his weapon to lord lovel with the same sentence who likewise answered amen with a good courage immediately the lists were cleared and the combatants began to fight  they contended a long time with equal skill and courage at length sir philip unhorsed his antagonist the judges ordered that either he should alight or suffer his enemy to remount he chose the former and a short combat on foot ensued the sweat ran off their bodies with the violence of the exercise sir philip watched every motion of his enemy and strove to weary him out intending to wound but not to kill him unless obliged for his own safety  he thrust his sword through his left arm and demanded whether he would confess the fact lord lovel enraged answered he would die sooner sir philip then passed the sword through his body twice and lord lovel fell crying out that he was slain  i hope not said sir philip for i have a great deal of business for you to do before you die confess your sins and endeavour to atone for them as the only ground to hope for pardon  lord lovel replied you are the victor use your good fortune generously  sir philip took away his sword and then waved it over his head and beckoned for assistance the judges sent to beg sir philip to spare the life of his enemy  i will said he upon condition that he will make an honest confession  lord lovel desired a surgeon and a confessor  you shall have both said sir philip but you must first answer me a question or two did you kill your kinsman or not  it was not my hand that killed him answered the wounded man  it was done by your own order however you shall have no assistance till you answer this point  it was said he and heaven is just  bear witness all present said sir philip he confesses the fact  he then beckoned edmund who approached  take off your helmet said he look on that youth he is the son of your injured kinsman  it is himself said the lord lovel and fainted away  sir philip then called for a surgeon and a priest both of which lord graham had provided the former began to bind up his wounds and his assistants poured a cordial into his mouth preserve his life if it be possible said sir philip for much depends upon it  he then took edmund by the hand and presented him to all the company in this young man said he you see the true heir of the house of lovel heaven has in its own way made him the instrument to discover the death of his parents his father was assassinated by order of that wicked man who now receives his punishment his mother was by his cruel treatment compelled to leave her own house she was delivered in the fields and perished herself in seeking a shelter for her infant i have sufficient proofs of every thing i say which i am ready to communicate to every person who desires to know the particulars heaven by my hand has chastised him he has confessed the fact i accuse him of and it remains that he make restitution of the fortune and honours he hath usurped so long  edmund kneeled and with uplifted hands returned thanks to heaven that his noble friend and champion was crowned with victory the lords and gentlemen gathered round them they congratulated them both while lord lovels friends and followers were employed in taking care of him lord clifford took sir philips hand  you have acted with so much honour and prudence that it is presumptuous to offer you advice but what mean you to do with the wounded man  i have not determined said he i thank you for the hint and beg your advice how to proceed  let us consult lord graham replied he  lord graham insisted upon their going all to his castle there said he you will have impartial witnesses of all that passes sir philip was unwilling to give so much trouble the lord graham protested he should be proud to do any service to so noble a gentleman lord clifford enforced his request saying it was better upon all accounts to keep their prisoner on this side the borders till they saw what turn his health would take and to keep him safely till he had settled his worldly affairs  this resolution being taken lord graham invited the wounded man and his friends to his castle as being the nearest place where he could be lodged and taken proper care of it being dangerous to carry him further they accepted the proposal with many acknowledgements and having made a kind of litter of boughs they all proceeded to lord grahams castle where they put lord lovel to bed and the surgeon dressed his wounds and desired he might be kept quiet not knowing at present whether they were dangerous or not  about an hour after the wounded man complained of thirst he asked for the surgeon and enquired if his life was in danger the surgeon answered him doubtfully he asked  where is sir philip harclay  in the castle  where is that young man whom he calls the heir of lovel  he is here too  then i am surrounded with my enemies i want to speak to one of my own servants without witnesses let one be sent to me  the surgeon withdrew and acquainted the gentlemen below he shall not speak to any man said sir philip but in my presence he went with him into the sick mans room upon the sight of sir philip he seemed in great agitation  am i not allowed to speak with my own servant said he  yes sir you may but not without witnesses  then i am a prisoner it seems  no not so sir but some caution is necessary at present but compose yourself i do not wish for your death  then why did you seek it i never injured you  yes you have in the person of my friend and i am only the instrument of justice in the hand of heaven endeavour to make atonement while life is spared to you shall i send the priest to you perhaps he may convince you of the necessity of restitution in order to obtain forgiveness of your sins  sir philip sent for the priest and the surgeon and obliged the servant to retire with him i leave you sir to the care of these gentlemen and whenever a third person is admitted i will be his attendant i will visit you again within an hour  he then retired and consulted his friends below they were of opinion that no time should be lost you will then said he accompany me into the sick mans apartment in an hours time  within the hour sir philip attended by lord clifford and lord graham entered the chamber lord lovel was in great emotion the priest stood on one side of the bed the surgeon on the other the former exhorted him to confess his sins the other desired he might be left to his repose lord lovel seemed in great anguish of mind he trembled and was in the utmost confusion sir philip intreated him with the piety of a confessor to consider his souls health before that of his body he then asked sir philip by what means he knew that he was concerned in the death of his kinsman  sir replied he it was not merely by human means this fact was discovered there is a certain apartment in the castle of lovel that has been shut up these one and twenty years but has lately been opened and examined into  o heaven exclaimed he then geoffry must have betrayed me  no sir he has not it was revealed in a very extraordinary manner to that youth whom it most concerns  how can he be the heir of lovel  by being the son of that unfortunate woman whom you cruelly obliged to leave her own house to avoid being compelled to wed the murderer of her husband we are not ignorant moreover of the fictitious funeral you made for her all is discovered and you will not tell us any more than we know already but we desire to have it confirmed by your confession   the judgments of heaven are fallen upon me said lord lovel i am childless and one is arisen from the grave to claim my inheritance  nothing then hinders you to do justice and make restitution it is for the ease of your conscience and you have no other way of making atonement for all the mischief you have done  you know too much said the criminal and i will relate what you do not know  you may remember proceeded he that i saw you once at my uncles house  i well remember it  at that time my mind was disturbed by the baleful passion of envy it was from that root all my bad actions sprung  praise be to god said the good priest he hath touched your heart with true contrition and you shew the effect of his mercies you will do justice and you will be rewarded by the gift of repentance unto salvation  sir philip desired the penitent to proceed  my kinsman excelled me in every kind of merit in the graces of person and mind in all his exercises and in every accomplishment i was totally eclipsed by him and i hated to be in his company but what finished my aversion was his addressing the lady upon whom i had fixed my affections i strove to rival him there but she gave him the preference that indeed was only his due but i could not bear to see or acknowledge it  the most bitter hatred took possession of my breast and i vowed to revenge the supposed injury as soon as opportunity should offer i buried my resentment deep in my heart and outwardly appeared to rejoice at his success i made a merit of resigning my pretensions to him but i could not bear to be present at his nuptials i retired to my fathers seat and brooded over my revenge in secret my father died this year and soon after my uncle followed him within another year my kinsman was summoned to attend the king on his welch expedition  as soon as i heard he was gone from home i resolved to prevent his return exulting in the prospect of possessing his title fortune and his lady i hired messengers who were constantly going and coming to give me intelligence of all that passed at the castle i went there soon after under pretence of visiting my kinsman my spies brought me an account of all that happened one informed me of the event of the battle but could not tell whether my rival was living or dead i hoped the latter that i might avoid the crime i meditated i reported his death to his lady who took it very heavily  soon after a messenger arrived with tidings that he was alive and well and had obtained leave to return home immediately  i instantly dispatched my two emissaries to intercept him on the way he made so much haste to return that he was met within a mile of his own castle he had outrode his servants and was alone they killed him and drew him aside out of the highway they then came to me with all speed and desired my orders it was then about sunset i sent them back to fetch the dead body which they brought privately into the castle they tied it neck and heels and put it into a trunk which they buried under the floor in the closet you mentioned the sight of the body stung me to the heart i then felt the pangs of remorse but it was too late i took every precaution that prudence suggested to prevent the discovery but nothing can be concealed from the eye of heaven  from that fatal hour i have never known peace always in fear of something impending to discover my guilt and to bring me to shame at length i am overtaken by justice i am brought to a severe reckoning here and i dread to meet one more severe hereafter  enough said the priest you have done a good work my son trust in the lord and now this burden is off your mind the rest will be made easy to you  lord lovel took a minutes repose and then went on  i hope by the hint you gave sir philip the poor lady is yet alive  no sir she is not but she died not till after she brought forth a son whom heaven made its instrument to discover and avenge the death of both his parents  they are well avenged said he i have no children to lament for me all mine have been taken from me in the bloom of youth only one daughter lived to be twelve years old i intended her for a wife for one of my nephews but within three months i have buried her he sighed wept and was silent  the gentlemen present lifted up their hands and eyes to heaven in silence  the will of heaven be obeyed said the priest my penitent hath confessed all what more would you require  that he make atonement said sir philip that he surrender the title and estate to the right heir and dispose of his own proper fortune to his nearest relations and resign himself to penitence and preparation for a future state for this time i leave him with you father and will join my prayers with yours for his repentance  so saying he left the room and was followed by the barons and the surgeon the priest alone remaining with him as soon as they were out of hearing sir philip questioned the surgeon concerning his patients situation who answered that at present he saw no signs of immediate danger but he could not yet pronounce that there was none  if he were mortally wounded said he he could not be so well nor speak so long without faintness and it is my opinion that he will soon recover if nothing happens to retard the cure  then said sir philip keep this opinion from him for i would suffer the fear of death to operate on him until he hath performed some necessary acts of justice let it only be known to these noblemen upon whose honour i can rely and i trust they will approve my request to you sir  i join in it said lord clifford from the same motives  i insist upon it said lord graham and i can answer for my surgeons discretion  my lords said the surgeon you may depend on my fidelity and after what i have just heard my conscience is engaged in this noble gentlemans behalf and i will do every thing in my power to second your intentions  i thank you sir said sir philip and you may depend on my gratitude in return i presume you will sit up with him tonight if any danger should arise i desire to be called immediately but otherwise i would suffer him to rest quietly that he may be prepared for the business of the following day  i shall obey your directions sir my necessary attendance will give me a pretence not to leave him and thus i shall hear all that passes between him and all that visit him  you will oblige me highly said sir philip and i shall go to rest with confidence in your care  the surgeon returned to the sick mans chamber sir philip and the barons to the company below they supped in the great hall with all the gentlemen that were present at the combat sir philip and his edmund retired to their repose being heartily fatigued and the company staid to a late hour commenting upon the action of the day praising the courage and generosity of the noble knight and wishing a good event to his undertaking  most of lord lovels friends went away as soon as they saw him safely lodged being ashamed of him and of their appearance in his behalf and the few that stayed were induced by their desire of a further information of the base action he had committed and to justify their own characters and conduct  the next morning sir philip entered into consultation with the two barons on the methods he should take to get edmund received and acknowledged as heir of the house of lovel they were all of opinion that the criminal should be kept in fear till he had settled his worldly affairs and they had resolved how to dispose of him with this determination they entered his room and enquired of the surgeon how he had passed the night he shook his head and said but little  lord lovel desired that he might be removed to his own house lord graham said he could not consent to that as there was evident danger in removing him and appealed to the surgeon who confirmed his opinion lord graham desired he would make himself easy and that he should have every kind of assistance there  sir philip then proposed to send for the lord fitzowen who would see that all possible care was taken of his brotherinlaw and would assist him in settling his affairs lord lovel was against it he was peevish and uneasy and desired to be left with only his own servants to attend him sir philip quitted the room with a significant look and the two lords endeavoured to reconcile him to his situation he interrupted them it is easy for men in your situation to advise but it is difficult for one in mine to practise wounded in body and mind it is natural that i should strive to avoid the extremes of shame and punishment i thank you for your kind offices and beg i may be left with my own servants  with them and the surgeon you shall said lord graham and they both retired  sir philip met them below my lords said he i am desirous that my lord fitzowen should be sent for and that he may hear his brothers confession for i suspect that he may hereafter deny what only the fear of death has extorted from him with your permission i am determined to send messengers today  they both expressed approbation and lord clifford proposed to write to him saying a letter from an impartial person will have the more weight i will send one of my principal domestics with your own this measure being resolved upon lord clifford retired to write and sir philip to prepare his servants for instant departure edmund desired leave to write to father oswald and john wyatt was ordered to be the bearer of his letter when the lord clifford had finished his letter he read it to sir philip and his chosen friends as follows  right hon my good lordi have taken upon me to acquaint your lordship that there has been a solemn combat at arms between your brotherinlaw the lord lovel and sir philip harclay knt of yorkshire it was fought in the jurisdiction of the lord graham who with myself was appointed judge of the field it was fairly won and sir philip is the conqueror after he had gained the victory he declared at large the cause of the quarrel and that he had revenged the death of arthur lord lovel his friend whom the present lord lovel had assassinated that he might enjoy his title and estate the wounded man confessed the fact and sir philip gave him his life and only carried off his sword as a trophy of his victory both the victor and the vanquished were conveyed to lord grahams castle where the lord lovel now lies in great danger he is desirous to settle his worldly affairs and to make his peace with god and man sir philip harclay says there is a male heir of the house of lovel for whom he claims the title and estate but he is very desirous that your lordship should be present at the disposal of your brothers property that of right belongs to him of which your children are the undoubted heirs he also wants to consult you in many other points of honour and equity let me intreat you on the receipt of this letter to set out immediately for lord grahams castle where you will be received with the utmost respect and hospitality you will hear things that will surprise you as much as they do me you will judge of them with that justice and honour that speaks your character and you will unite with us in wondering at the ways of providence and submitting to its decrees in punishing the guilty and doing justice to the innocent and oppressed my best wishes and prayers attend you and your hopeful family my lord i remain your humble servant  clifford   every one present expressed the highest approbation of this letter sir philip gave orders to john wyatt to be very circumspect in his behaviour to give edmunds letter privately to father oswald and to make no mention of him or his pretensions to lovel castle  lord clifford gave his servant the requisite precautions lord graham added a note of invitation and sent it by a servant of his own as soon as all things were ready the messengers set out with all speed for the castle of lovel  they stayed no longer by the way than to take some refreshment but rode night and day till they arrived there  lord fitzowen was in the parlour with his children father oswald was walking in the avenue before the house when he saw three messengers whose horses seemed jaded and the riders fatigued like men come a long journey he came up just as the first had delivered his message to the porter john wyatt knew him he dismounted and made signs that he had something to say to him he retired back a few steps and john with great dexterity slipped a letter into his hand the father gave him his blessing and a welcome  who do you come from said he aloud  from the lords graham and clifford to the lord fitzowen and we bring letters of consequence to the baron  oswald followed the messengers into the hall a servant announced their arrival lord fitzowen received them in the parlour lord cliffords servant delivered his masters letter lord grahams his and they said they would retire and wait his lordships answer the baron ordered them some refreshment they retired and he opened his letters he read them with great agitations he struck his hand upon his heart he exclaimed my fears are all verified the blow is struck and it has fallen upon the guilty  oswald came in a minute after  you are come in good time said the baron read that letter that my children may know the contents  he read it with faultering voice and trembling limbs they were all in great surprise william looked down and kept a studied silence sir robert exclaimed  is it possible can my uncle be guilty of such an action  you hear said the baron he has confessed it  but to whom said sir robert  his father replied lord cliffords honour is unquestionable and i cannot doubt what he affirms  sir robert leaned his head upon his hand as one lost in thought at length he seemed to awake  my lord i have no doubt that edmund is at the bottom of this business do you not remember that sir philip harclay long ago promised him his friendship edmund disappears and soon after this man challenges my uncle you know what passed here before his departure he has suggested this affair to sir philip and instigated him to this action this is the return he has made for the favours he has received from our family to which he owes every thing  softly my son said the baron let us be cautious of reflecting upon edmund there is a greater hand in this business my conjecture was too true it was in that fatal apartment that he was made acquainted with the circumstances of lord lovels death he was perhaps enjoined to reveal them to sir philip harclay the bosom friend of the deceased the mystery of that apartment is disclosed the woe to the guilty is accomplished there is no reflection upon any one heaven effects its purposes in its own time and manner i and mine are innocent let us worship and be silent  but what do you propose to do said sir robert  to return with the messengers answered the baron i think it highly proper that i should see your uncle and hear what he has to say my children are his heirs in justice to them i ought to be acquainted with every thing that concerns the disposal of his fortune  your lordship is in the right answered sir robert it concerns us all i have only to ask your permission to bear you company  with all my heart said the baron i have only to ask of you in return that you will command yourself and not speak your mind hastily wait for the proofs before you give judgment and take advice of your reason before you decide upon any thing if you reflect upon the past you will find reason to distrust yourself leave all to me and be assured i will protect your honour and my own  i will obey you in all things my lord and will make immediate preparation for our departure so saying he left the room  as soon as he was gone mr william broke silence  my lord said he if you have no great objection i beg leave also to accompany you both  you shall my son if you desire it i think i can see your motives and your brothers also your coolness will be a good balance to his warmth you shall go with us my son walter shall be his sisters protector in our absence and he shall be master here till we return  i hope my dear father that will not be long i shall not be happy till you come home said the fair emma  it shall be no longer my dearest than till this untoward affair is settled  the baron desired to know when the messengers were expected to return oswald took this opportunity to retire he went to his own apartment and read the letter as follows  the heir of lovel to his dear and reverend friend father oswald  let my friends at the castle of lovel know that i live in hopes one day to see them there if you could by any means return with the messengers your testimony would add weight to mine perhaps you might obtain permission to attend the baron i leave it to you to manage this john wyatt will inform you of all that has passed here and that hitherto my success has outrun my expectation and almost my wishes i am in the high road to my inheritance and trust that the power who hath conducted me thus far will not leave his work unfinished tell my beloved william that i live and hope to embrace him before long i recommend myself to your holy prayers and blessing and remain your son and servant edmund  oswald then went to the messengers he drew john wyatt to a distance from the rest and got the information he wanted he stayed with him till he was sent for by the baron to whom he went directly and prevented his questions by saying i have been talking with the messengers i find they have travelled night and day to bring the letters with all speed they only require one nights rest and will be ready to set out with you tomorrow  tis well said the baron we will set out as soon as they are ready  my lord said oswald i have a favour to beg of you it is that i may attend you i have seen the progress of this wonderful discovery and i have a great desire to see the conclusion of it perhaps my presence may be of service in the course of your business  perhaps it may said the baron i have no objection if you desire to go  they then separated and went to prepare for their journey  oswald had a private interview with joseph whom he informed of all that he knew and his resolution to attend the baron in his journey to the north  i go said he to bear witness in behalf of injured innocence if it be needful i shall call upon you therefore hold yourself in readiness in case you should be sent for  that i will said joseph and spend my last remains of life and strength to help my young lord to his right and title but do they not begin to suspect who is the heir of lovel  not in the least said oswald they think him concerned in the discovery but have no idea of his being interested in the event  oh father said joseph i shall think every day a week till your return but i will no longer keep you from your repose  good night said oswald but i have another visit to pay before i go to rest  he left joseph and went on tiptoe to mr williams room and tapped at his door he came and opened it what news father  not much i have only orders to tell you that edmund is well and as much your friend as ever  i guessed said william that we should hear something of him i have still another guess  what is that my child  that we shall see or hear of him where we are going  it is very likely said oswald and i would have you be prepared for iti am confident we shall hear nothing to his discredit  i am certain of that said william and i shall rejoice to see him i conclude that he is under the protection of sir philip harclay  he is so said oswald i had my information from sir philips servant who is one of the messengers and was guide to the others in their way hither  after some farther conversation they separated and each went to his repose  the next morning the whole party set out on their journey they travelled by easy stages on account of the barons health which began to be impaired and arrived in health and spirits at the castle of lord graham where they were received with the utmost respect and kindness by the noble master  the lord lovel had recovered his health and strength as much as possible in the time and was impatient to be gone from thence to his own house he was surprised to hear of the arrival of his brother and nephews and expressed no pleasure at the thoughts of seeing them when sir philip harclay came to pay his respects to baron fitzowen the latter received him with civility but with a coldness that was apparent sir robert left the room doubting his resolution sir philip advanced and took the baron by the hand  my lord said he i rejoice to see you here i cannot be satisfied with the bare civilities of such a man as you i aspire to your esteem to your friendship and i shall not be happy till i obtain them i will make you the judge of every part of my conduct and where you shall condemn me i will condemn myself  the baron was softened his noble heart felt its alliance with its counterpart but he thought the situation of his brother demanded some reserve towards the man who sought his life but in spite of himself it wore off every moment lord clifford related all that had passed with the due regard to sir philips honour he remarked how nobly he concealed the cause of his resentment against the lord lovel till the day of combat that he might not prepossess the judges against him he enlarged on his humanity to the vanquished on the desire he expressed to have justice done to his heirs finally he mentioned his great respect for the lord fitzowen and the solicitude he shewed to have him come to settle the estate of the sick man in favour of his children lord clifford also employed his son to soften sir robert and to explain to him every doubtful part of sir philips behaviour  after the travellers had taken some rest the lord graham proposed that they should make a visit to the sick mans chamber the lords sent to acquaint him they were coming to visit him and they followed the messenger the lord fitzowen went up to the bedside he embraced his brother with strong emotions of concern sir robert followed him then mr william  lord lovel embraced them but said nothing his countenance shewed his inward agitations lord fitzowen first broke silence  i hope said he i see my brother better than i expected  lord lovel bit his fingers he pulled the bedclothes he seemed almost distracted at length he broke out  i owe no thanks to those who sent for my relations sir philip harclay you have used ungenerously the advantage you have gained over me you spared my life only to take away my reputation you have exposed me to strangers and what is worse to my dearest friends when i lay in a state of danger you obliged me to say any thing and now you take advantage of it to ruin me in my friends affection but if i recover you may repent it  sir philip then came forward  my lords i shall take no notice of what this unhappy man has just now said i shall appeal to you as to the honourable witnesses of all that has passed you see it was no more than necessary i appeal to you for the motives of my treatment of him before at and after our meeting i did not take his life as i might have done i wished him to repent of his sins and to make restitution of what he unjustly possesses i was called out to do an act of justice i had taken the heir of lovel under my protection my chief view was to see justice done to himwhat regarded this man was but a secondary motive this was my end and i will never never lose sight of it  lord lovel seemed almost choaked with passion to see every one giving some mark of approbation and respect to sir philip he called out  i demand to know who is this pretended heir whom he brings out to claim my title and fortune  my noble auditors said sir philip i shall appeal to your judgment in regard to the proofs of my wards birth and family every circumstance shall be laid before you and you shall decide upon them  here is a young man supposed the son of a peasant who by a train of circumstances that could not have happened by human contrivance discovers not only who were his real parents but that they came to untimely deaths he even discovers the different places where their bones are buried both out of consecrated ground and appeals to their ashes for the truth of his pretensions he has also living proofs to offer that will convince the most incredulous i have deferred entering into particulars till the arrival of baron fitzowen i know his noble heart and honourable character from one that has long been an eyewitness of his goodness such is the opinion i have of his justice that i will accept him as one of the judges in his brothers cause i and my ward will bring our proofs before him and the company here present in the course of them it will appear that he is the best qualified of any to judge of them because he can ascertain many of the facts we shall have occasion to mention i will rest our cause upon their decision  lord graham applauded sir philips appeal affirming his own impartiality and calling upon lord clifford and his son and also his own nephews who were present lord clifford said  sir philip offers fairly and like himself there can be no place nor persons more impartial than the present and i presume the lord lovel can have no objection  no objection answered he what to be tried like a criminal to have judges appointed over me to decide upon my right to my own estate and title i will not submit to such a jurisdiction  then said sir philip you had rather be tried by the laws of the land and have them pronounce sentence upon you take your choice sir if you refuse the one you shall be certain of the other  lord clifford then saidyou will allow lord lovel to consider of the proposal he will consult his friends and be determined by their advice  lord fitzowen saidi am very much surprised at what i have heard i should be glad to know all that sir philip harclay has to say for his ward that i may judge what my brother has to hope or fear i will then give my best advice or offer my mediation as he may stand in need of them  you say well replied lord graham and pray let us come directly to the point sir philip you will introduce your ward to this company and enter upon your proofs  sir philip bowed to the company he went out and brought in edmund encouraging him by the way he presented him to baron fitzowen who looked very serious  edmund twyford said he are you the heir of the house of lovel  i am my lord said edmund bowing to the ground the proofs will appear but i am at the same time the most humble and grateful of all your servants and the servant of your virtues  sir robert rose up and was going to leave the room  son robert stay said the baron if there is any fraud you will be pleased to detect it and if all that is affirmed be true you will not shut your eyes against the light you are concerned in this business hear it in silence and let reason be arbiter in your cause  he bowed to his father bit his lip and retired to the window william nodded to edmund and was silent all the company had their eyes fixed on the young man who stood in the midst casting down his eyes with modest respect to the audience while sir philip related all the material circumstances of his life the wonderful gradation by which he came to the knowledge of his birth the adventures of the haunted apartment the discovery of the fatal closet and the presumptive proofs that lord lovel was buried there at this part of his narration lord fitzowen interrupted him  where is this closet you talk of for i and my sons went over the apartment since edmunds departure and found no such place as you describe  my lord said edmund i can account for it the door is covered with tapestry the same as the room and you might easily overlook it but i have a witness here said he and putting his hand into his bosom he drew out the key if this is not the key of that closet let me be deemed an impostor and all i say a falsehood i will risk my pretensions upon this proof  and for what purpose did you take it away said the baron  to prevent any person from going into it replied edmund i have vowed to keep it till i shall open that closet before witnesses appointed for that purpose  proceed sir said the baron fitzowen  sir philip then related the conversation between edmund and margery twyford his supposed mother  lord fitzowen seemed in the utmost surprise he exclaimed can this be true strange discovery unfortunate child   edmunds tears bore witness to his veracity he was obliged to hide his face he lifted up his clasped hands to heaven and was in great emotions during all this part of the relation while lord lovel groaned and seemed in great agitation  sir philip then addressed himself to lord fitzowen  my lord there was another person present at the conversation between edmund and his fostermother who can witness to all that passed perhaps your lordship can tell who that was  it was father oswald replied the baron i well remember that he went with him at his request let him be called in  he was sent for and came immediately the baron desired him to relate all that passed between edmund and his mother  oswald then began  since i am now properly called upon to testify what i know concerning this young man i will speak the truth without fear or favour of any one and i will swear by the rules of my holy order to the truth of what i shall relate  he then gave a particular account of all that passed on that occasion and mentioned the tokens found on both the infant and his mother  where are these tokens to be seen said the lord clifford  i have them here my lord said edmund and i keep them as my greatest treasures  he then produced them before all the company  there is no appearance of any fraud or collusion said lord graham if any man thinks he sees any let him speak  pray my lord suffer me to speak a word said sir robert do you remember that i hinted my suspicions concerning father oswald the night our kinsmen lay in the east apartment  i do said the baron  well sir it now appears that he did know more than he would tell us you find he is very deep in all edmunds secrets and you may judge what were his motives for undertaking this journey  i observe what you say answered his father but let us hear all that oswald has to say i will be as impartial as possible  my lord returned oswald i beg you also to recollect what i said on the night your son speaks of concerning secrecy in certain matters  i remember that also said the baron but proceed  my lord continued oswald i knew more than i thought myself at liberty to disclose at that time but i will now tell you every thing i saw there was something more than common in the accidents that befell this young man and in his being called out to sleep in the east apartment i earnestly desired him to let me be with him on the second night to which he consented reluctantly we heard a great noise in the rooms underneath we went down stairs together i saw him open the fatal closet i heard groans that pierced me to the heart i kneeled down and prayed for the repose of the spirit departed i found a seal with the arms of lovel engraven upon it which i gave to edmund and he now has it in his possession he enjoined me to keep secret what i had seen and heard till the time should come to declare it i conceived that i was called to be a witness of these things besides my curiosity was excited to know the event i therefore desired to be present at the interview between him and his mother which was affecting beyond expression i heard what i have now declared as nearly as my memory permits me i hope no impartial person will blame me for any part of my conduct but if they should i do not repent it if i should forfeit the favour of the rich and great i shall have acquitted myself to god and my conscience i have no worldly ends to answer i plead the cause of the injured orphan and i think also that i second the designs of providence  you have well spoken father said the lord clifford your testimony is indeed of consequence  it is amazing and convincing said lord graham and the whole story is so well connected that i can see nothing to make us doubt the truth of it but let us examine the proofs  edmund gave into their hands the necklace and earrings he showed them the locket with the cypher of lovel and the seal with the arms he told them the cloak in which he was wrapped was in the custody of his fostermother who would produce it on demand he begged that some proper persons might be commissioned to go with him to examine whether or no the bodies of his parents were buried where he affirmed adding that he put his pretensions into their hands with pleasure relying entirely upon their honour and justice  during this interesting scene the criminal covered his face and was silent but he sent forth bitter sighs and groans that denoted the anguish of his heart at length lord graham in compassion to him proposed that they should retire and consider of the proofs adding lord lovel must needs be fatigued we will resume the subject in his presence when he is disposed to receive us  sir philip harclay approached the bed sir said he i now leave you in the hands of your own relations they are men of strict honour and i confide in them to take care of you and of your concerns  they then went out of the room leaving only the lord fitzowen and his sons with the criminal they discoursed of the wonderful story of edmunds birth and the principal events of his life  after dinner sir philip requested another conference with the lords and their principal friends there were present also father oswald and lord grahams confessor who had taken the lord lovels confession edmund and zadisky now gentlemen said sir philip i desire to know your opinion of our proofs and your advice upon them  lord graham replied i am desired to speak for the rest we think there are strong presumptive proofs that this young man is the true heir of lovel but they ought to be confirmed and authenticated of the murder of the late lord there is no doubt the criminal hath confessed it and the circumstances confirm it the proofs of his crime are so connected with those of the young mans birth that one cannot be public without the other we are desirous to do justice and yet are unwilling for the lord fitzowens sake to bring the criminal to public shame and punishment we wish to find out a medium we therefore desire sir philip to make proposals for his ward and let lord fitzowen answer for himself and his brother and we will be moderators between them  here every one expressed approbation and called upon sir philip to make his demands  if said he i were to demand strict justice i should not be satisfied with any thing less than the life of the criminal but i am a christian soldier the disciple of him who came into the world to save sinnersfor his sake continued he crossing himself i forego my revenge i spare the guilty if heaven gives him time for repentance man should not deny it it is my wards particular request that i will not bring shame upon the house of his benefactor the lord fitzowen for whom he hath a filial affection and profound veneration my proposals are thesefirst that the criminal make restitution of the title and estate obtained with so much injustice and cruelty to the lawful heir whom he shall acknowledge such before proper witnesses secondly that he shall surrender his own lawful inheritance and personal estate into the hands of the lord fitzowen in trust for his sons who are his heirs of blood thirdly that he shall retire into a religious house or else quit the kingdom in three months time and in either case those who enjoy his fortune shall allow him a decent annuity that he may not want the comforts of life by the last i disable him from the means of doing further mischief and enable him to devote the remainder of his days to penitence these are my proposals and i give him fourandtwenty hours to consider of them if he refuses to comply with them i shall be obliged to proceed to severer measures and to a public prosecution but the goodness of the lord fitzowen bids me expect from his influence with his brother a compliance with proposals made out of respect to his honourable character  lord graham applauded the humanity prudence and piety of sir philips proposals he enforced them with all his influence and eloquence lord clifford seconded him and the rest gave tokens of approbation  sir robert fitzowen then rose up i beg leave to observe to the company who are going to dispose so generously of another mans property that my father purchased the castle and estate of the house of lovel who is to repay him the money for it  sir philip then said i have also a question to ask who is to pay the arrears of my wards estate which he has unjustly been kept out of these oneandtwenty years let lord clifford answer to both points for he is not interested in either  lord clifford smiled  i think returned he the first question is answered by the second and that the parties concerned should set one against the other especially as lord fitzowens children will inherit the fortune which includes the purchasemoney  lord graham said this determination is both equitable and generous and i hope will answer the expectations on all sides  i have another proposal to make to my lord fitzowen said sir philip but i first wait for the acceptance of those already made  lord fitzowen replied i shall report them to my brother and acquaint the company with his resolution tomorrow  they then separated and the baron with his sons returned to the sick mans chamber there he exhorted his brother with the piety of a confessor to repent of his sins and make atonement for them he made known sir philips proposals and observed on the wonderful discovery of his crime and the punishment that followed it your repentance  continued he may be accepted and your crime may yet be pardoned if you continue refractory and refuse to make atonement you will draw down upon you a severer punishment  the criminal would not confess and yet could not deny the truth and justice of his observations the baron spent several hours in his brothers chamber he sent for a priest who took his confession and they both sat up with him all night advising persuading and exhorting him to do justice and to comply with the proposals he was unwilling to give up the world and yet more so to become the object of public shame disgrace and punishment  the next day lord fitzowen summoned the company into his brothers chamber and there declared in his name that he accepted sir philip harclays proposals that if the young man could as he promised direct them to the places where his parents were buried and if his birth should be authenticated by his fosterparents he should be acknowledged the heir of the house of lovel that to be certified of these things they must commission proper persons to go with him for this purpose and in case the truth should be made plain they should immediately put him in possession of the castle and estate in the state it was he desired lord graham and lord clifford to chuse the commissioners and gave sir philip and edmund a right to add to them each another person sic  lord graham named the eldest son of lord clifford and the other in return named his nephew they also chose the priest lord grahams confessor and the eldest son of baron fitzowen to his great mortification sir philip appointed mr william fitzowen and edmund named father oswald they chose out the servants to attend them who were also to be witnesses of all that should pass lord clifford proposed to baron fitzowen that as soon as the commissioners were set out the remainder of the company should adjourn to his seat in cumberland whither lord graham should be invited to accompany them and to stay till this affair was decided after some debate this was agreed to and at the same time that the criminal should be kept with them till every thing was properly settled  lord fitzowen gave his son william the charge to receive and entertain the commissioners at the castle but before they set out sir philip had a conference with lord fitzowen concerning the surrender of the castle in which he insisted on the furniture and stock of the farm in consideration of the arrears lord fitzowen slightly mentioned the young mans education and expences sir philip answered you are right my lord i had not thought of this point we owe you in this respect more than we can ever repay but you know not half the respect and affection edmund bears for you when restitution of his title and fortune are fully made his happiness will still depend on you  how on me said the baron  why he will not be happy unless you honour him with your notice and esteem but this is not all i must hope that you will do still more for him  indeed said the baron he has put my regard for him to a severe proof what further can he expect from me  my dear lord be not offended i have only one more proposal to make to you if you refuse it i can allow for you and i confess it requires a greatness of mind but not more than you possess to grant it  well sir speak your demand  say rather my request it is this cease to look upon edmund as the enemy of your house look upon him as a son and make him so indeed  how say you sir philip my son  yes my lord give him your daughter he is already your son in filial affection your son william and he are sworn brothers what remains but to make him yours he deserves such a parent you such a son and you will by this means ingraft into your family the name title and estate of lovel which will be entailed on your posterity for ever  this offer requires much consideration returned the baron  suffer me to suggest some hints to you said sir philip this match is i think verily pointed out by providence which hath conducted the dear boy through so many dangers and brought him within view of his happiness look on him as the precious relic of a noble house the son of my dearest friend or look on him as my son and heir and let me as his father implore you to consent to his marriage with your daughter  the barons heart was touched he turned away his face  oh sir philip harclay what a friend are you why should such a man be our enemy  my lord said sir philip we are not cannot be enemies our hearts are already allied and i am certain we shall one day be dear friends  the baron suppressed his emotions but sir philip saw into his heart  i must consult my eldest son returned he  then replied sir philip i foresee much difficulty he is prejudiced against edmund and thinks the restitution of his inheritance an injury to your family hereafter he will see this alliance in a different light and will rejoice that such a brother is added to the family but at present he will set his face against it however we will not despair virtue and resolution will surmount all obstacles let me call in young lovel  he brought edmund to the baron and acquainted him with the proposal he had been making in his name my lords answers and the objections he feared on the part of sir robert edmund kneeled to the baron he took his hand and pressed it to his lips  best of men of parents of patrons said he i will ever be your son in filial affection whether i have the honour to be legally so or not not one of your own children can feel a stronger sense of love and duty  tell me said the baron do you love my daughter  i do my lord with the most ardent affection i never loved any woman but her and if i am so unfortunate as to be refused her i will not marry at all oh my lord reject not my honest suit your alliance will give me consequence with myself it will excite me to act worthy of the station to which i am exalted if you refuse me i shall seem an abject wretch disdained by those whom my heart claims relation to your family are the whole world to me give me your lovely daughter give me also your son my beloved william and let me share with them the fortune providence bestows upon me but what is title or fortune if i am deprived of the society of those i love  edmund said the baron you have a noble friend but you have a stronger in my heart which i think was implanted there by heaven to aid its own purposes i feel a variety of emotions of different kinds and am afraid to trust my own heart with you but answer me a question are you assured of my daughters consent have you solicited her favour have you gained her affections  never my lord i am incapable of so base an action i have loved her at an humble distance but in my situation i should have thought it a violation of all the laws of gratitude and hospitality to have presumed to speak the sentiments of my heart  then you have acted with unquestionable honour on this and i must say on all other occasions  your approbation my lord is the first wish of my life it is the seal of my honour and happiness  sir philip smiled my lord fitzowen i am jealous of edmunds preferable regard for you it is just the same now as formerly  edmund came to sir philip he threw himself into his arms he wept he was overpowered with the feelings of his heart he prayed to heaven to strengthen his mind to support his inexpressible sensations  i am overwhelmed with obligation said he oh best of friends teach me like you to make my actions speak for me  enough edmund i know your heart and that is my security my lord speak to him and bring him to himself by behaving coldly to him if you can  the baron said i must not trust myself with you you make a child of me i will only add gain my son roberts favour and be assured of mine i owe some respect to the heir of my family he is brave honest and sincere your enemies are separated from him you have williams influence in your behalf make one effort and let me know the result  edmund kissed his hand in transports of joy and gratitude  i will not lose a moment said he i fly to obey your commands  edmund went immediately to his friend william and related all that had passed between the baron sir philip and himself william promised him his interest in the warmest manner he recapitulated all that had passed in the castle since his departure but he guarded his sisters delicacy till it should be resolved to give way to his address they both consulted young clifford who had conceived an affection to edmund for his amiable qualities and to william for his generous friendship for him he promised them his assistance as sir robert seemed desirous to cultivate his friendship accordingly they both attacked him with the whole artillery of friendship and persuasion clifford urged the merits of edmund and the advantages of his alliance william enforced his arguments by a retrospect of edmunds past life and observed that every obstacle thrown in his way had brought his enemies to shame and increase of honour to himself i say nothing continued he of his noble qualities and affectionate heart those who have been so many years his companions can want no proofs of it  we know your attachment to him sir said sir robert and in consequence your partiality  nay replied william you are sensible of the truth of my assertions and i am confident would have loved him yourself but for the insinuations of his enemies but if he should make good his assertions even you must be convinced of his veracity  and you would have my father give him your sister upon this uncertainty  no sir but upon these conditions  but suppose he does not make them good  then i will be of your party and give up his interest  very well sir my father may do as he pleases but i cannot agree to give my sister to one who has always stood in the way of our family and now turns us out of our own house  i am sorry brother you see his pretensions in so wrong a light but if you think there is any imposture in the case go with us and be a witness of all that passes  no not i if edmund is to be master of the castle i will never more set my foot in it  this matter said mr clifford must be left to time which has brought stranger things to pass sir roberts honour and good sense will enable him to subdue his prejudices and to judge impartially  they took leave and went to make preparations for their journey edmund made his report of sir roberts inflexibility to his father in presence of sir philip who again ventured to urge the baron on his favourite subject  it becomes me to wait for the further proofs said he but if they are as clear as i expect i will not be inexorable to your wishes say nothing more on this subject till the return of the commissioners  they were profuse in their acknowledgments of his goodness  edmund took a tender leave of his two paternal friends  when said he i take possession of my inheritance i must hope for the company of you both to complete my happiness  of me said sir philip you may be certain and as far as my influence reaches of the baron  he was silent edmund assured them of his constant prayers for their happiness  soon after the commissioners with edmund set out for lovel castle and the following day the lord clifford set out for his own house with baron fitzowen and his son the nominal baron was carried with them very much against his will sir philip harclay was invited to go with them by lord clifford who declared his presence necessary to bring things to a conclusion they all joined in acknowledging their obligations to lord grahams generous hospitality and besought him to accompany them at length he consented on condition they would allow him to go to and fro as his duty should call him  lord clifford received them with the greatest hospitality and presented them to his lady and three daughters who were in the bloom of youth and beauty they spent their time very pleasantly excepting the criminal who continued gloomy and reserved and declined company  in the mean time the commissioners proceeded on their journey when they were within a days distance from the castle mr william and his servant put forward and arrived several hours before the rest to make preparations for their reception his sister and brother received them with open arms and enquired eagerly after the event of the journey to the north he gave them a brief account of every thing that had happened to their uncle adding but this is not all sir philip harclay has brought a young man who he pretends is the son of the late lord lovel and claims his estate and title this person is on his journey hither with several others who are commissioned to enquire into certain particulars to confirm his pretensions if he make good his claim my father will surrender the castle and estate into his hands sir philip and my lord have many points to settle and he has proposed a compromise that you my sister ought to know because it nearly concerns you  me brother william pray explain yourself  why he proposes that in lieu of arrears and other expectations my father shall give his dear emma to the heir of lovel in full of all demands   she changed colour  holy mary said she and does my father agree to this proposal  he is not very averse to it but sir robert refuses his consent however i have given him my interest with you  have you indeed what a stranger perhaps an impostor who comes to turn us out of our dwelling  have patience my emma see this young man without prejudice and perhaps you will like him as well as i do  i am surprised at you william  dear emma i cannot bear to see you uneasy think of the man who of all others you would with to see in a situation to ask you of your father and expect to see your wishes realized  impossible said she  nothing is impossible my dear let us be prudent and all will end happily you must help me to receive and entertain these commissioners i expect a very solemn scene but when that is once got over happier hours than the past will succeed we shall first visit the haunted apartment you my sister will keep in your own till i shall send for you i go now to give orders to the servants  he went and ordered them to be in waiting and himself and his youngest brother stood in readiness to receive them  the sound of the horn announced the arrival of the commissioners at the same instant a sudden gust of wind arose and the outward gates flew open they entered the courtyard and the great foldingdoors into the hall were opened without any assistance the moment edmund entered the hall every door in the house flew open the servants all rushed into the hall and fear was written on their countenances joseph only was undaunted these doors said he open of their own accord to receive their master this is he indeed  edmund was soon apprized of what had happened  i accept the omen said he gentlemen let us go forward to the apartment let us finish the work of fate i will lead the way he went on to the apartment followed by all present open the shutters  said he the daylight shall no longer be excluded here the deeds of darkness shall now be brought to light  they descended the staircase every door was open till they came to the fatal closet edmund called to mr william approach my friend and behold the door your family overlooked  they came forward he drew the key out of his bosom and unlocked the door he made them observe that the boards were all loose he then called to the servants and bid them remove every thing out of the closet while they were doing this edmund shewed them the breastplate all stained with blood he then called to joseph  do you know whose was this suit of armour  it was my lords said joseph the late lord lovel i have seen him wear it  edmund bade them bring shovels and remove the earth while they were gone he desired oswald to repeat all that passed the night they sat up together in that apartment which he did till the servants returned they threw out the earth while the bystanders in solemn silence waited the event after some time and labour they struck against something they proceeded till they discovered a large trunk which with some difficulty they drew out it had been corded round but the cords were rotted to dust they opened it and found a skeleton which appeared to have been tied neck and heels together and forced into the trunk  behold said edmund the bones of him to whom i owe my birth  the priest from lord grahams advanced this is undoubtedly the body of the lord lovel i heard his kinsman confess the manner in which he was interred let this awful spectacle be a lesson to all present that though wickedness may triumph for a season a day of retribution will come  oswald exclaimed behold the day of retribution of triumph to the innocent of shame and confusion to the wicked  the young gentlemen declared that edmund had made good his assertions  what then said they remains  i propose said lord grahams priest that an account be written of this discovery and signed by all the witnesses present that an attested copy be left in the hands of this gentleman and the original be sent to the barons and sir philip harclay to convince them of the truth of it  mr clifford then desired edmund to proceed in his own way  the first thing i propose to do said he is to have a coffin made for these honoured remains i trust to find the bones of my other parent and to inter them all together in consecrated ground unfortunate pair you shall at last rest together your son shall pay the last duties to your ashes  he stopped to shed tears and none present but paid this tribute to their misfortunes edmund recovered his voice and proceeded  my next request is that father oswald and this reverend father with whoever else the gentlemen shall appoint will send for andrew and margery twyford and examine them concerning the circumstances of my birth and the death and burial of my unfortunate mother  it shall be done said mr william but first let me intreat you to come with me and take some refreshment after your journey for you must be fatigued after dinner we will proceed in the enquiry  they all followed him into the great hall where they were entertained with great hospitality and mr william did the honours in his fathers name edmunds heart was deeply affected and the solemnity of his deportment bore witness to his sincerity but it was a manly sorrow that did not make him neglect his duty to his friends or himself he enquired after the health of the lady emma  she is well said william and as much your friend as ever  edmund bowed in silence  after dinner the commissioners sent for andrew and his wife they examined them separately and found their accounts agreed together and were in substance the same as oswald and edmund had before related separately also the commissioners observed that there could be no collusion between them and that the proofs were indisputable they kept the foster parents all night and the next day andrew directed them to the place where the lady lovel was buried between two trees which he had marked for a memorial they collected the bones and carried them to the castle where edmund caused a stately coffin to be made for the remains of the unfortunate pair the two priests obtained leave to look in the coffin buried in the church and found nothing but stones and earth in it the commissioners then declared they were fully satisfied of the reality of edmunds pretensions  the two priests were employed in drawing up a circumstantial account of these discoveries in order to make their report to the barons at their return in the mean time mr william took an opportunity to introduce edmund to his sister  my emma said he the heir of lovel is desirous to pay his respects to you  they were both in apparent confusion but edmunds wore off and emmas increased  i have been long desirous said he to pay my respects to the lady whom i most honour but unavoidable duties have detained me when these are fully paid it is my wish to devote the remainder of my life to lady emma  are you then the heir of lovel  i am madam and am also the man in whose behalf i once presumed to speak  tis very strange indeed  it is so madam to myself but time that reconciles us to all things will i hope render this change in my situation familiar to you  william said you are both well acquainted with the wishes of my heart but my advice is that you do not encourage a farther intimacy till my lords determination be fully known  you may dispose of me as you please said edmund but i cannot help declaring my wishes yet i will submit to my lords sentence though he should doom me to despair  from this period the young pair behaved with solemn respect to each other but with apparent reserve the young lady sometimes appeared in company but oftener chose to be in her own apartment where she began to believe and hope for the completion of her wishes the uncertainty of the barons determination threw an air of anxiety over edmunds face his friend william by the most tender care and attention strove to dispel his fears and encourage his hopes but he waited with impatience for the return of the commissioners and the decision of his fate  while these things passed at the castle of lovel the nominal baron recovered his health and strength at the house of lord clifford in the same proportion he grew more and more shy and reserved avoided the company of his brother and nephew and was frequently shut up with his two servants sir robert fitzowen made several attempts to gain his confidence but in vain he was equally shy to him as the rest m zadisky observed his motions with the penetration for which his countrymen have been distinguished in all ages he communicated his suspicions to sir philip and the barons giving it as his opinion that the criminal was meditating an escape they asked what he thought was to be done zadisky offered to watch him in turn with another person and to lie in wait for him he also proposed that horses should be kept in readiness and men to mount them without knowledge of the service they were to be employed in the barons agreed to leave the whole management of this affair to zadisky he took his measures so well that he intercepted the three fugitives in the fields adjoining to the house and brought them all back prisoner they confined them separately while the lords and gentlemen consulted how to dispose of them  sir philip applied to lord fitzowen who begged leave to be silent i have nothing said he to offer in favour of this bad man and i cannot propose harsher measures with so near a relation  zadisky then begged to be heard  you can no longer have any reliance upon the word of a man who has forfeited all pretensions to honour and sincerity i have long wished to revisit once more my native country and to enquire after some very dear friends i left there i will undertake to convey this man to a very distant part of the world where it will be out of his power to do further mischief and free his relations from an ungrateful charge unless you should rather chuse to bring him to punishment here  lord clifford approved of the proposal lord fitzowen remained silent but shewed no marks of disapprobation  sir philip objected to parting with his friend but zadisky assured him he had particular reasons for returning to the holy land of which he should be judge hereafter sir philip desired the lord fitzowen to give him his company to the criminals apartment saying we will have one more conversation with him and that shall decide his fate  they found him silent and sullen and he refused to answer their questions  sir philip then bespoke him after the proofs you have given of your falsehood and insincerity we can no longer have any reliance upon you nor faith in your fulfilling the conditions of our agreement i will therefore once more make you a proposal that shall still leave you indebted to our clemency you shall banish yourself from england for ever and go in pilgrimage to the holy land with such companions as we shall appoint or secondly you shall enter directly into a monastery and there be shut up for life or thirdly if you refuse both these offers i will go directly to court throw myself at the feet of my sovereign relate the whole story of your wicked life and actions and demand vengeance on your head the king is too good and pious to let such villany go unpunished he will bring you to public shame and punishment and be you assured if i begin this prosecution i will pursue it to the utmost i appeal to your worthy brother for the justice of my proceeding i reason no more with you i only declare my resolution i wait your answer one hour and the next i put in execution whatever you shall oblige me to determine  so saying they retired and left him to reflect and to resolve at the expiration of the hour they sent zadisky to receive his answer he insinuated to him the generosity and charity of sir philip and the lords and the certainty of their resolutions and begged him to take care what answer he returned for that his fate depended on it he kept silent several minutes resentment and despair were painted on his visage at length he spoke  tell my proud enemies that i prefer banishment to death infamy or a life of solitude  you have chosen well said zadisky to a wise man all countries are alike it shall be my care to make mine agreeable to you  are you then the person chosen for my companion  i am sir and you may judge by that circumstance that those whom you call your enemies are not so in effect farewell siri go to prepare for our departure  zadisky went and made his report and then set immediately about his preparations he chose two active young men for his attendants and gave them directions to keep a strict eye upon their charge for that they should be accountable if he should escape them  in the meantime the baron fitzowen had several conferences with his brother he endeavoured to make him sensible of his crimes and of the justice and clemency of his conqueror but he was moody and reserved to him as to the rest sir philip harclay obliged him to surrender his worldly estates into the hands of lord fitzowen a writing was drawn up for that purpose and executed in the presence of them all lord fitzowen engaged to allow him an annual sum and to advance money for the expences of his voyage he spoke to him in the most affectionate manner but he refused his embrace  you will have nothing to regret said he haughtily for the gain is yours  sir philip conjured zadisky to return to him again who answered  i will either return or give such reasons for my stay as you shall approve i will send a messenger to acquaint you with my arrival in syria and with such other particulars as i shall judge interesting to you and yours in the meantime remember me in your prayers and preserve for me those sentiments of friendship and esteem that i have always deemed one of the chief honours and blessings of my life commend my love and duty to your adopted son he will more than supply my absence and be the comfort of your old age adieu best and noblest of friends  they took a tender leave of each other not without tears on both sides  the travellers set out directly for a distant seaport where they heard of a ship bound for the levant in which they embarked and proceeded on their voyage  the commissioners arrived at lord cliffords a few days after the departure of the adventurers they gave a minute account of their commission and expressed themselves entirely satisfied of the justice of edmunds pretensions they gave an account in writing of all that they had been eyewitnesses to and ventured to urge the baron fitzowen on the subject of edmunds wishes the baron was already disposed in his favour his mind was employed in the future establishment of his family during their residence at lord cliffords his eldest son sir robert had cast his eye upon the eldest daughter of that nobleman and he besought his father to ask her in marriage for him the baron was pleased with the alliance and took the first opportunity to mention it to lord clifford who answered him pleasantly   i will give my daughter to your son upon condition that you will give yours to the heir of lovel the baron looked serious lord clifford went on  i like that young man so well that i would accept him for a soninlaw if he asked me for my daughter and if i have any influence with you i will use it in his behalf  a powerful solicitor indeed said the baron but you know my eldest sons reluctance to it if he consents so will i  he shall consent said lord clifford or he shall have no daughter of mine let him subdue his prejudices and then i will lay aside my scruples  but my lord replied the baron if i can obtain his free consent it will be the best for all i will try once more and if he will not i will leave it wholly to your management  when the noble company were all assembled sir philip harclay revived the subject and besought the lord fitzowen to put an end to the work he had begun by confirming edmunds happiness the baron rose up and thus spoke  the proofs of edmunds noble birth the still stronger ones of his excellent endowments and qualities the solicitations of so many noble friends in his behalf have altogether determined me in his favour and i hope to do justice to his merit without detriment to my other children i am resolved to make them all as happy as my power will allow me to do lord clifford has been so gracious to promise his fair daughter to my son robert upon certain conditions that i will take upon me to ratify and which will render my son worthy of the happiness that awaits him my children are the undoubted heirs of my unhappy brother lovel you my son shall therefore immediately take possession of your uncles house and estate only obliging you to pay to each of your younger brothers the sum of one thousand pounds on this condition i will secure that estate to you and your heirs for ever i will by my own act and deed surrender the castle and estate of lovel to the right owner and at the same time marry him to my daughter i will settle a proper allowance upon my two younger sons and dispose of what remains by a will and testament and then i shall have done all my business in this world and shall have nothing to do but prepare for the next  oh my father said sir robert i cannot bear your generosity you would give away all to others and reserve nothing for yourself  not so my son said the baron i will repair my old castle in wales and reside there i will visit my children and be visited by them i will enjoy their happiness and by that means increase my own whether i look backwards or forwards i shall have nothing to do but rejoice and be thankful to heaven that has given me so many blessings i shall have the comfortable reflection of having discharged my duties as a citizen a husband a father a friend and whenever i am summoned away from this world i shall die content  sir robert came forward with tears on his cheeks he kneeled to his father  best of parents and of men said he you have subdued a heart that has been too refractory to your will you have this day made me sensible how much i owe to your goodness and forbearance with me forgive me all that is past and from henceforward dispose of me i will have no will but yours no ambition but to be worthy of the name of your son  and this day said the baron do i enjoy the true happiness of a father rise my son and take possession of the first place in my affection without reserve they embraced with tears on both sides the company rose and congratulated both father and son the baron presented his son to lord clifford who embraced him and said  you shall have my daughter for i see that you deserve her  sir philip harclay approachedthe baron gave his sons hand to the knight  love and respect that good man said he deserve his friendship and you will obtain it  nothing but congratulations were heard on all sides  when their joy was in some degree reduced to composure sir philip proposed that they should begin to execute the schemes of happiness they had planned he proposed that my lord fitzowen should go with him to the castle of lovel and settle the family there the baron consented and both together invited such of the company as liked it to accompany them thither it was agreed that a nephew of lord grahams another of lord cliffords two gentlemen friends of sir philip harclay and father oswald should be of the party together with several of sir philips dependants and domestics and the attendants on the rest lord fitz owen gave orders for their speedy departure lord graham and his friends took leave of them in order to return to his own home but before he went he engaged his eldest nephew and heir to the second daughter of the lord clifford sir robert offered himself to the eldest who modestly received his address and made no objection to his proposal the fathers confirmed their engagement  lord fitzowen promised to return to the celebration of the marriage in the mean time he ordered his son to go and take possession of his uncles house and to settle his household he invited young clifford and some other gentlemen to go with him the company separated with regret and with many promises of friendship on all sides and the gentlemen of the north were to cultivate the good neighbourhood on both sides of the borders  sir philip harclay and the baron fitzowen with their friends and attendants set forwards for the castle of lovel a servant went before at full speed to acquaint the family of their approach edmund was in great anxiety of mind now the crisis of his fate was near at hand he enquired of the messenger who were of the party and finding that sir philip harclay was there and that sir robert fitzowen stayed in the north his hopes rose above his fears mr william attended by a servant rode forward to meet them he desired edmund to stay and receive them edmund was under some difficulty with regard to his behaviour to the lovely emma a thousand times his heart rose to his lips as often he suppressed his emotions they both sighed frequently said little thought much and wished for the event master walter was too young to partake of their anxieties but he wished for the arrival of his father to end them  mr williams impatience spurred him on to meet his father as soon as he saw him he rode up directly to him  my dear father you are welcome home said he  i think not sir said the baron and looked serious  why so my lord said william  because it is no longer mine but another mans home answered he and i must receive my welcome from him  meaning edmund said william  whom else can it be  ah my lord he is your creature your servant he puts his fate into your hands and will submit to your pleasure in all things  why comes he not to meet us said the baron  his fears prevent him said william but speak the word and i will fetch him  no said the baron we will wait on him  william looked confused  is edmund so unfortunate said he as to have incurred your displeasure  sir philip harclay advanced and laid his hand on williams saddle  generous impatience noble youth said he look round you and see if you can discover in this company one enemy of your friend leave to your excellent father the time and manner of explaining himself he only can do justice to his own sentiments  the baron smiled on sir philip williams countenance cleared up they went forward and soon arrived at the castle of lovel  edmund was walking to and fro in the hall when he heard the horn that announced their arrival his emotions were so great that he could hardly support them the baron and sir philip entered the hall hand in hand edmund threw himself at their feet and embraced their knees but could not utter a word they raised him between them and strove to encourage him but he threw himself into the arms of sir philip harclay deprived of strength and almost of life they supported him to a seat where he recovered by degrees but had no power to speak his feelings he looked up to his benefactors in the most affecting manner he laid his hand upon his bosom but was still silent  compose yourself my dear son said sir philip you are in the arms

he distinguished joseph by a cordial embrace he called him his dear friend  now said he i can return your friendship and i am proud to acknowledge it  the old man with a faltering voice cried out  now i have lived long enough i have seen my masters son acknowledged for the heir of lovel  the hall echoed with his words long live the heir of lovel  the baron took edmunds hands in his own  let us retire from this crowd said he we have business of a more private nature to transact  he led to the parlour followed by sir philip and the other gentlemen  where are my other children said he  william retired and presently returned with his brother and sister they kneeled to their father who raised and embraced them he then called out williamedmundcome and receive my blessing also  they approached hand in hand they kneeled and he gave them a solemn benediction  your friendship deserves our praise my children love each other always and may heaven pour down its choicest blessings upon your heads

second place in my heart i shall tell him at more leisure how much i love and honour him for his own sake as well as yours  he embraced the youth and desired his friendship  come hither my emma said the baron  she approached with tears on her check sweetly blushing like the damask rose wet with the dew of the morning  i must ask you a serious question my child answer me with the same sincerity you would to heaven you see this young man the heir of lovel you have known him long consult your own heart and tell me whether you have any objection to receive him for your husband i have promised to all this company to give you to him but upon condition that you approve him i think him worthy of you and whether you accept him or not he shall ever be to me a son but heaven forbid that i should compel my child to give her hand where she cannot bestow her heart speak freely and decide this point for me and for yourself  the fair emma blushed and was under some confusion her virgin modesty prevented her speaking for some moments edmund trembled he leaned upon williams shoulder to support himself emma cast her eye upon him she saw his emotion and hastened to relieve him and thus spoke in a soft voice which gathered strength as she proceeded  my lord and fathers goodness has always prevented my wishes i am the happiest of all children in being able to obey his commands without offering violence to my own inclinations as i am called upon in this public manner it is but justice to this gentlemans merit to declare that were i at liberty to chuse a husband from all the world he only should be my choice who i can say with joy is my fathers also  edmund bowed low he advanced towards her the baron took his daughters hand and presented it to him he kneeled upon one knee he took her hand kissed it and pressed it to his bosom the baron embraced and blessed them he presented them to sir philip harclayreceive and acknowledge your children said he  i do receive them as the gift of heaven said the noble knight they are as much mine as if i had begotten them all that i have is theirs and shall descend to their children for ever a fresh scene of congratulation ensued and the hearts of all the auditors were too much engaged to be able soon to return to the ease and tranquillity of common life  after they had refreshed themselves and recovered from the emotions they had sustained on this interesting occasion edmund thus addressed the baron  on the brink of happiness i must claim your attention to a melancholy subject the bones of both my parents lie unburied in this house permit me my honoured lord to perform my last duties to them and the remainder of my life shall be devoted to you and yours  certainly said the baron why have you not interred them  my lord i waited for your arrival that you might be certified of the reality and that no doubts might remain  i have no doubts said the baron alas both the crime and punishment of the offender leave no room for them he sighed let us now put an end to this affair and if possible forget it for ever  if it will not be too painful to you my lord i would intreat you with these gentlemen our friends to follow me into the east apartment the scene of my parents woes and yet the dawning of my better hopes  they rose to attend him he committed the lady emma to the care of her youngest brother observing that the scene was too solemn for a lady to be present at it they proceeded to the apartment he showed the baron the fatal closet and the place where the bones were found also the trunk that contained them he recapitulated all that passed before their arrival he shewed them the coffin where the bones of the unfortunate pair were deposited he then desired the baron to give orders for their interment  no replied he it belongs to you to order and every one here is ready to perform it  edmund then desired father oswald to give notice to the friars of the monastery of st austin that with their permission the funeral should be solemnized there and the bones interred in the church he also gave orders that the closet should be floored the apartment repaired and put in order he then returned to the other side of the castle  preparations being made for the funeral it was performed a few days after edmund attended in person as chief mourner sir philip harclay as the second joseph desired he might assist as servant to the deceased they were followed by most people of the village the story was now become public and every one blessed edmund for the piety and devotion with which he performed the last duties to his parentsedmund appeared in deep mourning the week after he assisted at a mass for the repose of the deceased  sir philip harclay ordered a monument to be erected to the memory of his friends with the following inscription  praye for the soules of arthur lord lovele and marie his wife who were cut off in the flowere of theire youthe by the trecherye and crueltie of theire neare kinnesmanne edmunde theire onlie sonne one and twentie yeares after theire deathe by the direction of heavene made the discoverye of the mannere of theire deathe and at the same time proved his owne birthe he collected theire bones together and interred them in this place a warning and proofe to late posteritie of the justice of providence and the certaintie of retribution  the sunday after the funeral edmund threw off his mourning and appeared in a dress suitable to his condition he received the compliments of his friends with ease and cheerfulness and began to enjoy his happiness he asked an audience of his fair mistress and was permitted to declare the passion he had so long stifled in his own bosom she gave him a favourable hearing and in a short time confessed that she had suffered equally in that suspense that was so grievous to him they engaged themselves by mutual vows to each other and only waited the barons pleasure to complete their happiness every cloud was vanished from their brows and sweet tranquillity took possession of their bosoms their friends shared their happiness william and edmund renewed their vows of everlasting friendship and promised to be as much together as williams other duties would permit  the baron once more summoned all his company together he told edmund all that had passed relating to his brother inlaw his exile and the pilgrimage of zadisky he then related the circumstances of sir roberts engagement to lord cliffords daughter his establishment in his uncles seat and his own obligations to return time enough to be present at the marriage but before i go said he i will give my daughter to the heir of lovel and then i shall have discharged my duty to him and my promise to sir philip harclay  you have nobly performed both said sir philip and whenever you depart i shall be your companion  what said edmund am i to be deprived of both my fathers at once my honoured lord you have given away two houseswhere do you intend to reside  no matter said the baron i know i shall be welcome to both  my dear lord said edmund stay here and be still the master i shall be proud to be under your command and to be your servant as well as your son  no edmund said the baron that would not now be proper this is your castle you are its lord and master and it is incumbent on you to shew yourself worthy of the great things providence has done for you  how shall i a young man acquit myself of so many duties as will be upon me without the advice and assistance of my two paternal friends oh sir philip will you too leave me once you gave me hopes  he stopped greatly affected  sir philip said tell me truly edmund do you really desire that i should live with you  as truly sir as i desire life and happiness  then my dear child i will live and die with you  they embraced with tears of affection and edmund was all joy and gratitude  my good lord said sir philip you have disposed of two houses and have none ready to receive you will you accept of mine it is much at your service and its being in the same county with your eldest son will be an inducement to you to reside there  the baron caught sir philips hand  noble sir i thank you and i will embrace your kind offer i will be your tenant for the present my castle in wales shall be put in repair in the meantime if i do not reside there it will be an establishment for one of my younger sons  but what will you do with your old soldiers and dependants  my lord i will never cast them off there is another house on my estate that has been shut up many years i will have it repaired and furnished properly for the reception of my old men i will endow it with a certain sum to be paid annually and will appoint a steward to manage their revenue i will continue it during the lives of the first inhabitants and after that i shall leave it to my son here to do as he pleases  your son said edmund will make it the business of his life to act worthy of such a father  enough said sir philip i am satisfied that you will i purpose to reside myself in that very apartment which my dear friend your father inhabited i will tread in his footsteps and think he sees me acting his part in his sons family i will be attended by my own servants and whenever you desire it i will give you my company your joys your griefs shall be mine i shall hold your children in my arms and their prattle shall amuse my old age and as my last earthly wish your hands shall close my eyes  long very long said edmund with eyes and hands lifted up may it be ere i perform so sad a duty  long and happily may you live together said the baron i will hope to see you sometimes and to claim a share in your blessings but let us give no more tears to sorrow the rest shall be those of joy and transport the first step we take shall be to marry our edmund i will give orders for the celebration and they shall be the last orders i shall give in this house they then separated and went to prepare for the approaching solemnity  sir philip and the baron had a private conference concerning edmunds assuming the name and title of lovel i am resolved said sir philip to go to the king to acquaint him briefly with edmunds history i will request that he may be called up to parliament by a writ for there is no need of a new patent he being the true inheritor in the mean time he shall assume the name arms and title and i will answer any one that shall dispute his right to them sir philip then declared his resolution to set out with the baron at his departure and to settle all his other affairs before he returned to take up his residence at the castle  a few days after the marriage was celebrated to the entire satisfaction of all parties the baron ordered the doors to be thrown open and the house free for all comers with every other token of joy and festivity edmund appeared full of joy without levity of mirth without extravagance he received the congratulations of his friends with ease freedom and vivacity he sent for his foster father and mother who began to think themselves neglected as he had been so deeply engaged in affairs of more consequence that he had not been particularly attentive to them he made them come into the great hall and presented them to his lady  these said he are the good people to whom i am under god indebted for my present happiness they were my first benefactors i was obliged to them for food and sustenance in my childhood and this good woman nourished my infancy at her own breast the lady received them graciously and saluted margery andrew kneeled down and with great humility begged edmunds pardon for his treatment of him in his childhood i heartily forgive you said he and i will excuse you to yourself it was natural for you to look upon me as an intruder that was eating your childrens bread you saved my life and afterwards you sustained it by your food and raiment i ought to have maintained myself and to have contributed to your maintenance but besides this your treatment of me was the first of my preferment it recommended me to the notice of this noble family everything that happened to me since has been a step to my present state of honour and happiness never man had so many benefactors as myself but both they and myself have been only instruments in the hands of providence to bring about its own purposes let us praise god for all i shared your poverty and you will share my riches i will give you the cottage where you dwell and the ground about it i will also pay you the annual sum of ten pounds for the lives of you both i will put out your children to manual trades and assist you to provide for them in their own station and you are to look upon this as paying a debt and not bestowing a gift i owe you more than i can ever pay and if there be any thing further in my power that will contribute to your happiness you can ask nothing in reason that i will deny you  andrew hid his face i cannot bear it said he oh what a brute was i to abuse such a child as this i shall never forgive myself  you must indeed my friend for i forgive and thank you  andrew retired back but margery came forward she looked earnestly on edmund she then threw her arms about his neck and wept aloud  my precious child my lovely babe thank god i have lived to see this day i will rejoice in your good fortune and your bounty to us but i must ask one more favour yet that i may sometimes come hither and behold that gracious countenance and thank god that i was honoured so far as to give thee food from my own breast and to bring thee up to be a blessing to me and to all that know thee  edmund was affected he returned her embrace he bade her come to the castle as often as she pleased and she should always be received as his mother the bride saluted her and told her the oftener she came the more welcome she should be  margery and her husband retired full of blessings and prayers for their happiness she gave vent to her joy by relating to the servants and neighbours every circumstance of edmunds birth infancy and childhood many a tear was dropped by the auditors and many a prayer wafted to heaven for his happiness joseph took up the story where she left it he told the rising dawn of youth and virtue darting its ray through the clouds of obscurity and how every stroke of envy and malignity brushed away some part of the darkness that veiled its lustre he told the story of the haunted apartment and all the consequences of it how he and oswald conveyed the youth away from the castle no more to return till he came as master of it he closed the tale with praise to heaven for the happy discovery that gave such an heir to the house of lovel to his dependants such a lord and master to mankind a friend and benefactor there was truly a house of joy not that false kind in the midst of which there is heaviness but that of rational creatures grateful to the supreme benefactor raising their minds by a due enjoyment of earthly blessings to a preparation for a more perfect state hereafter  a few days after the wedding the lord fitzowen began to prepare for his journey to the north he gave to edmund the plate linen and furniture of the castle the farming stock and utensils he would have added a sum of money but sir philip stopped his hand  we do not forget said he that you have other children we will not suffer you to injure them give us your blessing and paternal affection and we have nothing more to ask i told you my lord that you and i should one day be sincere friends  we must be so answered the baron it is impossible to be long your enemy we are brothers and shall be to our lives end  they regulated the young mans household the baron gave leave to the servants to choose their master the elder ones followed him except joseph who desired to live with edmund as the chief happiness of his life most of the younger ones chose the service of the youthful pair there was a tender and affectionate parting on all sides edmund besought his beloved william not to leave him the baron said he must insist on his being at his brothers wedding as a due attention to him but after that he should return to the castle for some time  the baron and sir philip harclay with their train set forward sir philip went to london and obtained all he desired for his edmund from thence he went into yorkshire and settled his affairs there removing his pensioners to his other house and putting lord fitzowen in possession of his own they had a generous contention about the terms but sir philip insisted on the barons accepting the use of everything there  you hold it in trust for a future grandchild said he whom i hope to live to endow with it  during sir philips absence the young lord lovel caused the haunted apartment to be repaired and furnished for the reception of his father by adoption he placed his friend joseph over all his menservants and ordered him to forbear his attendance but the old man would always stand at the sideboard and feast his eyes with the countenance of his own masters son surrounded with honour and happiness john wyatt waited upon the person of his lord and enjoyed his favour without abatement mr william fitzowen accompanied sir philip harclay from the north country when he returned to take up his residence at the castle of lovel  edmund in the arms of love and friendship enjoyed with true relish the blessings that surrounded him with an heart overflowing with benevolence to his fellow creatures and raptures of gratitude to his creator his lady and himself were examples of conjugal affection and happiness within a year from his marriage she brought him a son and heir whose birth renewed the joy and congratulations of all his friends the baron fitzowen came to the baptism and partook of his childrens blessings the child was called arthur after the name of his grandfather  the year following was born a second son who was called philip harclay upon him the noble knight of that name settled his estate in yorkshire and by the kings permission he took the name and arms of that family  the third son was called william he inherited the fortune of his uncle of that name who adopted him and he made the castle of lovel his residence and died a bachelor  the fourth son was called edmund the fifth owen and there was also a daughter called emma  when time had worn out the prejudices of sir robert fitzowen the good old baron of that name proposed a marriage between his eldest son and heir and the daughter of edmund lord lovel which was happily concluded the nuptials were honoured with the presence of both families and the old baron was so elevated with this happy union of his descendants that he cried out now i am ready to diei have lived long enoughthis is the band of love that unites all my children to me and to each other he did not long survive this happy event he died full of years and honours and his name was never mentioned but with the deepest marks of gratitude love and veneration sweet is the remembrance of the virtuous and happy are the descendants of such a father they will think on him and emulate his virtuesthey will remember him and be ashamed to degenerate from their ancestor  many years after sir philip harclay settled at the castle he received tidings from his friend zadisky by one of the two servants who attended him to the holy land from him he learned that his friend had discovered by private advices that he had a son living in palestine which was the chief motive of his leaving england that he had met with various adventures in pursuit of him that at length he found him converted him to the christian religion and then persuaded him to retire from the world into a monastery by the side of mount libanus where he intended to end his days  that walter commonly called lord lovel had entered into the service of the greek emperor john paleologus not bearing to undergo a life of solitude and retirement that he made up a story of his being compelled to leave his native country by his relations for having accidentally killed one of them and that he was treated with great cruelty and injustice that he had accepted a post in the emperors army and was soon after married to the daughter of one of the chief officers of it  zadisky foresaw and lamented the downfall of that empire and withdrew from the storm he saw approaching finally he bade the messenger tell sir philip harclay and his adopted son that he should not cease to pray for them and desired their prayers in return  sir philip desired lord lovel to entertain this messenger in his service that good knight lived to extreme old age in honour and happiness and died in the arms of his beloved edmund who also performed the last duties to his faithful joseph  father oswald lived many years in the family as chaplain he retired from thence at length and died in his own monastery  edmund lord lovel lived to old age in peace honour and happiness and died in the arms of his children  sir philip harclay caused the papers relating to his sons history to be collected together the first part of it was written under his own eye in yorkshire the subsequent parts by father oswald at the castle of lovel all these when together furnish a striking lesson to posterity of the overruling hand of providence and the certainty of retribution
