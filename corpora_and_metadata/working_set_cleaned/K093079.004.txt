lone retreat where my oak extends its pride of twisted arms and fit to ride sublime on neptunes swelling wave now the roaring winds does brave where the vines soft tendrils run and swell to meet the southern sun where contemplation wont to stray winds through the wood her easy way or marks the lake the field or sky the silent anglers steadfast eye the gunners aim or industry who with his loud resounding blow lays the nodding forest low or teaches where to wind the stream or whistles to his laboring team the meads which suck the dews of morn or uplands crowned with golden corn richer than iberias mine the bleating flocks the lowing kine the smoking cots and pointed spires the setting suns reflecting fires woods dark waving in the dale rays which gleam and clouds which sail shades and

feet wherever the bowl of moderate mirth unlocks the soul when tales of time and ancient fear suspend the young astonished ear or carrols quaint in longdrawn note swell the rustics ample throat or where high lifted steps resound when the peasant thumps the ground with awkward heel and gives a fall to mistress of the rural ball or presses with his iron hand and whirls her through the shouting

soft verse delight us more o grant of verse the wondrous power strong ideas to inspire words which paint and sounds which fire which calls up shades of heroes bold whose virtues warmed the times of

billows of the watery way serene as cynthia through the fields of air queen of the night extends her cloudless ray when all the forests tremble to the gleam and the transparent seas reflect the silver beam but see the whitening surge the gathering clouds hark the winds whistle through the shrowds they bow the mast they rend the sail the seaworn mariner is pale and views the blackening storm and hears the increasing gale but not o royal maid let fear thy breast invade know happy fair approved by heaven to thee the empire of the main is given in vain loud winds the deep deform love shall

dorubernian cliffs the muse has told prophetic child of druids old whereon she sits and hears from either pole in every wind victorious thunders roll ode on death written in french by his majesty the king of prussia translated by the same what does the sad presaging mean few days few years perhaps few moments urge my footsteps to the dreary verge where fate the curtain drops to close the scene then farewell life and light and thou blessed sun serene earth over me rolls thy mighty bed the world recedes i view the grave profound of life i touch the utmost bound and rush to mix a victim with the dead where fate embraces all and none can backward tread while yet i wake or sleep there stand ten thousand deaths in arms before behind they press me round and every wind wafts the contagion from each distant land and all the elements conspire to arm the dreadful band within without above below by turns they sink or rend my feeble frame now chill now urge the vital flame till natures tortured stream forgets to flow and art itself but proves a still more dangerous foe dust to its dust will soon return this mortal part proud tyrant of the mind nor leave of all its pomp behind but horrid lessons human pride should learn foul worms and blood and stench that sill the royal urn recede ye base and servile train i cannot be the mighty thing ye say the wretched object of a day which slatterd fancy would exalt in vain i know what i must be and what i am disdain but warmed with heavens eternal flame shall that which lives which thinks the mind be fleeting as the empty wind or say can death its active efforts tame o god who first inspired this animated frame no for the mind above the grave unfettered springs and searching natures stores it knows itself and thee adores secure o god whose word its being gave that what created first has certain power to save while thus of death dispels the cloud can sensual joy lifes narrow view confine true virtue feels the hope divine of bliss sincere not so the guilty crowd thy arm for ever blasts the wicked and the proud great god and is eternal pain or joy of heaven reserved for me in store thy breath but wafts to either shore scarce can the tortured mind the thought sustain i fly forbidden joys the sensual and the vain yet fast to earth is nature bound back on its wonted objects turns the mind and lags the slave of life behind while reasons efforts are too painful found to rend the rooted oak that loves its native ground objects of every jealous eye ye dreams of mortal good that swift decay how do ye stop my destined way and force me back the paths of sense to try ye point the sting of death and more than once i die scenes of astonishment the world how blind is death deprived of all his mighty power do none expect the fatal hour is there a wish to natures bounds confined is there a scheme forgot or toil for this resigned see mortals still acquire assume as if more vigilant they death could shun to honors fly to combats run and he whose footsteps tremble over the tomb builds up new plans of life and sudden meets his doom rush on ye madding train a thousand rocks a thousand storms despise to reach the good ye idolize go of accumulated wealth be vain go ravage other worlds if other worlds remain let neither law nor power divine nor natures anxious monitor within repress each greatly daring sin go bid with want the plundered orphan pine and with polluted hands disturb each sacred shrine proceed but soon your views are past accursed at once ye droop and are no more who would not think to see your store that all the projects your ambition cast beyond the grave were stretched and would for ever last ye mighty leaders mighty kings with flames and blood whose battles mark your way do monarchs hope eternal sway in vain each distant clime its tribute brings sprung from the dust ye mix with longforgotten things himself the victor cannot save if but to die is yours how short is glorys sum in vain ye fought and overcome nor aught avail the spoils ambition gave to hang with conquered crowns the putrid monarchs grave on natures theater displayed all is the sport of death the change i fear new objects rise then disappear around my brows the cypress casts a shade i scorn the sweets of life and all its roses fade yet midst this sage but painful lore while awful truths their sacred light reveal what means this latent wish i feel is then my bosoms lord itself no more wretch that i drag new chains more ponderous than before rules then the mind this lord supreme which every weak and vain allurement draws to pleasures throne and tyrant laws quick we return in life from what we seem to what we are and wake from calm reflections dream as wandering fancy leads we go by turns we reason or submit to sense and incoherent parts commence that fill the stage of folly shame and woe nor from the hook escaped again the bait we know voltaire in this eternal round how swift our active spirits urge their way by both extremes deceived we stray now caught by sense now lost in thought profound and in the mutual change our happiness is found inscription upon a monument by the same how soon with nimble wings our pleasures haste and clouds involve the sunshine of the day the wintry storms howl over the dreary waste and fairest things tend swiftest to decay in dark oblivion all our glory ends this morn we flourish and the next we fade time lifts his sweeping scythe the pile descends where vain ambition all her toils displayed the work of nations and the pomp of power sink the once lofty spire the domes proud state the dust receives them at the destined hour and mighty kingdoms feel the force of fate fall vain ambitions pile and lofty spires but spare stern fate the youthful and the gay soft pity sure such innocence requires and so much beauty well might death delay to a lady sitting for her picture by the same the weary look desponding air ill suits my dear a face so fair resume your smiles again supply the graces caught by fancys eye while wilson sketches out the piece well talk to pass the time of greece of greece as you have often heard for warriors and for wits revered the seat of learning and the graces famed for fine arts but finer faces where painters poets not as since were greater held than any prince in temples palaces carest none more the ladies smiles possessed for they were rich as well as clever and riches were successful ever priests senates nations kings desired the works their heaventaught art inspired and if a pencil chanced to drop an

the spirits mantling in the cheek and lips that softness seemed to speak thus from their various charms combined one perfect whole impressed his mind but had apelles painted now he might my dear have copied you and as in truth i think was done he would have from the picture run and left the venus but begun to sacrifice the pride of art to the bright goddess of his heart and given up an immortal claim for beautys prize the prize of fame elegy on the death of a young lady by the same yes it is past the fatal stroke is given our pious sorrows own the hand of heaven how short our joys encumbered life how vain still vexed with evils neverceasing train while roll the hours which lead each fleeting year each asks a sigh and each demands a tear over pleasing scenes the mind with rapture roves grasps in idea all its hopes or loves snatched from its view the pleasing scenes decay and the fair vision melts in shades away of youth of beauty and of wit the boast o loved for ever and too early lost sweet maid for thee now mingling with the dead her sacred griefs the tuneful muse shall shed the soft remembrance of thy charms to save she plants with all her bays thy hallowed grave ye too companions of her happier days heirs of her charms and rivals of her praise amid the circles of the young and gay your years unheeded urge their stealing way while mixed with pleasures eversmiling train ye know no sorrows and ye feel no pain yet when no more the pulse tumultuous beats nor the pleased sense each flattering tale repeats let calm reflection the sad moral teach that bliss below evades our eager reach that virtue only grants the real charm gives wit to win and beauty power to warm and though like hers whose recent fate we mourn and ask your pity for a sisters urn your beauties shine in all their bloom confessed mid gazing slaves contending to be blessed yet think like hers may soon those beauties fade like hers your glories in the dust be laid times hardy steps in silence swift advance dim the bright ray that darts the fiery glance and age dread herald of deaths awful reign blasts every grace and freezes every vein when with a mothers joy a mothers fear the thoughtful parent dropped the silent tear gazed on her child and saw new beauties rise glow in her cheeks and sparkle in her eyes in expectation planned each hope of life the sister daughter mother friend and wife ah fleeting joys how soon those hopes were over we doomed to mourn and she to charm no more the waning moon shall fill her wasted horn and natures radiance gild the orient morn the smiling spring with charms renewed appear the sleeping blossoms haste to deck the year but bloom no more this fair departed flower nor waked by genial sun nor vernal shower how vain alas was all thy fathers art vain were the sighs which swelled thy mothers heart again i see thee just expiring lie pale thy cold lip half closed thy languid eye thy guardian innocence beside thee stands and patient faith uplifts her holy hands teach thee with smiles to meet the stroke of death calm all thy pangs and ease thy struggling breath resigned dear maid to earths maternal breast may sister seraphs chant thy soul to rest there shall the constant amaranthus bloom and wings of zephyrs shed the morns perfume over thy sad hearse fair emblems of the dead by virgin hands are dying lilies shed the weeping graces shall thy tomb surround the loves with broken darts shall strew the ground in vain for thee they waked the fond desires wove myrtle wreaths and fanned their purer fires the youthful god who joins the nuptial bands in vain expecting near his altar stands fate spread the cloud his torch extinct he flies and veils with saffron robe his streaming eyes yet o while crowned with neverfading flowers thy spirit wanders through elysian bowers if plaintive sounds of mortal grief below reach the blessed seats and waft our tender woe hear happy shade while thus our mortal lays this monument of soft affection raise by gentle ties of kindred birth allied the muse that sports on camus willowd side in memorys lofty dome inscribes thy name and with thy beauties strives to mix her fame the academic written april mdcclv at the time of the establishment of classical prizes and building the new public library  by the same i while silent streams the mossgrown turrets lave came on thy banks with pensive steps i tread the dipping osiers kiss thy passing wave and evening shadows over the plains are spread from restless eye of painful care to thy secluded grot i fly where fancys sweetest forms repair to soothe her darling poesy reclined the lovely visionary lies in yonder vale and laurelvested bower where the gay turf is decked with various dies and breathes the mingling scents of every flower while holy dreams prolong her calm repose her pipe is cast the whispering reeds among high on the boughs her waving harp is hung murmuring to every wind that over it blows ii often have i seen her bathe at dewy morn her wanton bosom in thy silver spring and while her hands her flowing locks adorn with busy elegance have heard her sing but say what long recorded theme through all the lofty tale of time more worthy can the goddess deem of sounding chords and song sublime than whose parental hand to vigor bred each infant art the noble and the wise whose bounty gave yon arching shades to spread yon pointed spires in holy pomp to rise shall war alone loudechoing numbers claim and shall the deeds of smiling peace be drowned amid the heros shouts and trumpets sound these too shall flourish in immortal fame iii when science sled from latiums polished coasts and grecian groves her long and loved abode far from the din of fierce conflicting hosts through barbarous realms the weary wanderer trod but to what more indulgent sky to what more hospitable shade could trembling bleeding fainting fly the helpless and devoted maid timehonourd founders ye the virgin wooed twas yours with souls to native grandeur born to bid her radiant beauties shine renewed with wealth to heap with honors to adorn in grantas happier paths she wept no more healed were the wounds that scarrd her gentle breast here still she smiles with freedoms sons to rest nor mourns her attic towers nor tuscan shore iv fathers of genius whom the muse adores for sure to you her noblest strains belong beneath whose venerable roofs she pours the grateful notes of sweetly flowing song the increase of swift revolving years with conscious pride exulting view how all ye planned complete appears how all your virtues bloom anew the generous zeal which erst ye felt remains its bounteous beams still ardent to dispense while unexhausted to your learned plains rolls the rich stream of wide munificence joy to

walls renowned whose spirits mingling with the ethereal ray of universal nature traced the bound or raised in majesty of thought the lay see your loved arts this clime to grace their rival radiance brighter shed while holles smiles the wreath to place upon the youthful victors head where spencer sits among your thrones sublime to the soft music of his mournful lays listening ye weep for his ungrateful time and point the better hope of happier days if with the dead dishonours memory dies forget much injured name the unworthy woe in strains like thine so may our accents flow in nobler numbers yon fair domes arise vi when factions storms or some fell tyrants hate arts joined with freedom to one grave shall doom then though these structures to the hand of fate bend their proud height like thine imperial rome know vainly time thy rapid rage shall point its wide destroying aim since what defies the force of age thus consecrates the pile to fame some future eye the ruined heap shall trace the name of holles on the stone behold shall point a brunswic to a distant race benign and awful on the swelling gold the historic page the poets tuneful toil with these compared their mutual aid shall raise to build the records of eternal praise and deck with endless wreaths their honored soil vii sweeter than warbled sounds that win the sense flows the glad music of a grateful heart beyond the pomp of wordy eloquence or strains too cold highwrought with labored art though weakly sounds the jarring string though vainly would the muse explore the heights to which with eagle wing alone can heaventaught genius soar yet shall her hand ingenious strive to twine the blooming chaplet for her leaders brow while with new verdure graced in glorys shrine the ampler palms of civic honors grow when he these favored shades appears to bless whose guardian counsels guide a nations fate and with superior toils for europes state mixes the thought of grantas happiness viii hail seats revered where thoughtful pleasures dwell and hovering peace extends her downy wings where musing knowledge holds her humble cell and truth divine unlocks her secret springs this verse with mild acceptance deign to hear this verse yourselves inspire ere yet within your sacred fane the muse suspends her votive lyre thee granta thus with filial thanks i greet with smiles maternal thou those thanks receive for learnings humble wealth for friendship sweet for every calmer joy thy scenes could give while thus i sport upon thy peaceful strand the storms of life at awful distance roar and still i dread still lingering on the shore to launch my little bark and quit the land amabella the subject of this poem is founded on a circumstance that happended during the late war  a young lady not meeting with the concurrence of her relations in favor of an officer for whom she expressed her regard was prevailed upon by his solicitations to consent to a clandestine marriage which took place on the day he sat out to join his regiment abroad where he was unfortunately killed in an engagement  written by the desire of mrs montagu by mr jerningham harmodius breathed the rural air nor found his ruddy health with length of years decrease by duty prompted amabella crowned his silver forehead with the wreath of peace by partial nature framed in beautys mould adorned with every grace unspoild by art to friendships circle still did she unfold the lovelier beauties of a feeling heart endeared to all she met each welcome day by fortunes hand with various blessings fraught when lo her gaietys accustomed ray was quenched untimely with the gloom of thought what fixed the bosomthorn affliction knows where peace sat brooding as the gentle dove what blasted on her cheek the summer rose or slow disease or unsuccessful love remained unknown  twas by the many guessed that love to her soft vows had proved unkind beyond the power of her weak frame oppressed infanity oerthrew her lovely mind at length recovering yet to grief devote to solitude she gave the unsocial day like a pale votry from the world remote uncheard unvisited of pleasures ray often did harmodius at her state dismayed solicit from his child her secret pain her vague reply still from his question strayed and each repeated effort proved in vain to speed the moments of the loitering hour and by their plaintive strains perchance allured within a spacious myrtlewoven bower two turtle doves the pensive fair secured  ye little captives would she often say  though here secluded from the fields of air  through yonder vernal grove forbid to stray  and join the kindred train that wanton there  against you the gunner never lifts his arm  nor over this mansion does the falcon sail  you live unconscious of the storms alarm  the rain impetuous and the beating hail  nor here by kind compassion unimpressd  the schoolboy ever rears his impious hand  to fill with agony the feathered breast  and raze the little domes that love had planned their harmless joys disease too soon effaced one fatal morn her turturellas mate she found with flagging wing subdued oppressed and just just sinking at the blow of fate while down her cheek compassions shower distilled she gently raised it to her anxious breast but deaths cold blast lifes crimson current chilled and thus the fair her breathless bird addressed  illfated turtle round whose peaceful bower  the jocund loves so lately wont to play  how sunk alas in youths exulting hour  to fell disease to death the untimely prey  how silent is the voice which void of art  along the tender day was heard to coo  how still how frozen is the constant heart  which to its dear companion beat so true  that dear companion that now widowed dove  to screen from every harm be mine the care  and while she mourns her neerreviving love  her grief to me the mourner will endear  like thee a widow too condemned to mourn  no more to me does life unfold its charms  death death forbids him ever to return she said  and sunk into the attendants arms her swift relapsing to her former state with boding fears approached the serving train this scenes dread period tremblingly they wait nor were their boding fears indulged in vain awakening from her trance around she threw distressful fair her much disordered eyes and wildering said  repeat that kind adieu  ah no from love to war to death he flies  did ye not hear the clash of hostile spears  ah mark ye not that breast plate stained with gore  what groan was that which pierced these fearful ears  he falls he falls  my warrior is no more  nor was o heaven his amabella near  to soothe his pain and echo sigh to sigh  drop on the gaping ground a balmy tear  kiss his cold lip and close his fading eye of her distress the alarmed harmodius taught with trembling steps approached the unconscious fair  give me he cried with grief paternal fraught  give me o amabel to soothe thy care  say what affliction has thy soul impressed  reveal what storm thy bosomed calmness breaks  reveal  and thus relieve this anguishd breast  the tender father to his daughter speaks amabella  ah what avails the praise the brave obtain  through his white bosom rushed the hostile steel  twas his to swell the number of the slain  and mine afflictions keenest point to feel  harmodius  her roving thought no trace of reason bears  to her racked mind o heaven thy peace impart  a loving parent bathes thy cheek with tears  harmodius holds thee to his breaking heart  amabella  to thee i grateful kneel o generous seer  who do to one unknown thy care extend  along thy path may peace her olives rear  and heaven in battle shield thy dearest friend  for me who droop beneath misfortunes shower  i had a father  now alas a foe   thou wilt blush to hear  in sorrows darkest hour  he leaves his child abandoned to her woe  but to thy heart that is framed of softer mould  what can to thee a wretch like me endear  the spring the motive of thy love unfold  say say for me why flows that friendly tear  yet soft awhile  methinks that hoary brow   that plaintive voice  ah bear with my distress  or much remembrance is effaced or now  a tender fathers teardewd cheek i press  harmodius  on knees of gratitude i bless the skies  that amabella to herself restore  amabella  ah wherefore do thou joy thy daughter dies  support me to yon couch  i can no more   i feel i feel the pulse of life retire  ah deign to hear thy dying child reveal  what in rebellion to thy just desire  locked in her breast she dared so long conceal  by thee unsanctiond did i plight my love  and all to thee unknown a bride became  harmodius  harmodius will to both a father prove  amabella  to him thy pardon thou can never proclaim  three fleeting hours had scarcely called me bride  when he was summoned to the martial plain  and there  forgive these tears  in beautys pride  the muchlamented valiant youth was slain  what though unworthy of thy care i prove  to thy remembrance let thy child be dear  thy kind compassion let the daughter move  when this weak frame shall press the untimely bier more would she say  her voice began to fail from her

patron your augustus reigns  but hark with undulation soft and sweet what melting music steals upon the ear am i deceived or does a choir of winged cupids fan the buxom air till silence smiles while from their silver lyre harmonious numbers flow whose dulcet breath would recreate a soul beneath the pangs of death i did not err a choir of loves sublime in air attune the enchanting lay they leave

fierce tyrant fell to lust a prey here filled with grief an injured princess catherine of spain during the latter part of the time of the divorce retired to kimbolton castle where she died it is supposed of grief for the cruel treatment she received from henry viii fled from shortlived grandeur and divided bed oppression spread her horrors over the plain and all thy sweets kimbolton bloomed

relieved and thankful widows crowd the opened door where weeping majesty complained before o britons if to pagan powers ye bow be smiling liberty adored by you where mad oppression waves her iron wand

hawke and thee and thus united subject of my lays thy sons kimbolton claimed the patriots praise who left their fields to guard the the threatned shore ere eliot fought and thurot was no more and though no annals to their race shall tell what numbers vanquished by their valor fell the soul resolved that waited firm the foe and in his bosom braved the impending blow or conquered for his native fields or bled though no green laurels shade his honored head but lo my muse the humid drops descend and parting shepherds to the hamlets tend o quit the task those beauties to display that fairer spring with each returning day so reynolds thus presuming on his art to trace those charms my lord that win your heart sees softer smiles whenever he lifts his eye that bid him throw his baffled pencil by retirement an ode by mr beatie shook from the purple wings of even when dews impearl the grove and from the darkening verge of heaven beams the sweet star of love laid on a daisysprinkled green beside a plaintive stream a meekeyd youth of serious mien indulged this solemn theme ye cliffs in hoary grandeur pild high over the glimmering dale ye groves along whose windings wild soft sighs the saddening gale where often lone melancholy strays by wilderd fancy swayed what time the wan moons yellow rays gleam through the checkered shade to you ye wastes whose artless charms never drew ambitions eye scapd a tumultuous worlds alarms to your retreats i fly deep in your most sequestered bower let me my woes resign where solitude mild modest power leans on her ivyd shrine how shall i woo thee matchless fair thy heavenly smile how win thy smile that smooths the brow of care and stills each storm within o will thou to thy favorite grove thine ardent votary bring and bless his hours and bid them move serene on silent wing often let remembrance soothe his mind with dreams of former days when soft on leisures lap reclined he carolld sprightly lays blessed days when fancy smiled at care when pleasure toyd with truth nor envy with malignant glare had harmed his simple youth twas then o solitude to thee his early vows were paid from heart sincere and warm and free devoted to the shade ah why did fate his steps decoy in thorny paths to roam remote from all congenial joy  o take thy wanderer home henceforth thy awful haunts be mine the longabandond hill the hollow cliff whose waving pine oerhangs the darksome rill whence the scared owl on pinions gray breaks from the rustling boughs and down the lone vale sails away to shades of deep repose o while to thee the woodland pours its wildly warbling song and fragrant from the waste of flowers the zephyr breathes along let no rude sound invade from far no vagrant foot be nigh no ray from grandeurs gilded car flash on the startled eye yet if some pilgrim mid the glade thy hallowed bowers explore o guard from harm his hoary head and listen to his lore for he of joys divine shall tell that wean from earthly woe and triumph over the mighty spell that chains this heart below for me no more the path invites ambition loves to tread no more i climb those toilsome heights by guileful hope misled leaps my fond fluttering heart no more to mirths enlivening strain for present pleasure soon is over and all the past is vain the triumph of melancholy by the same memory be still why throng upon the thought these scenes so deeply stained with sorrows die is there in all thy stores no cheerful draught to brighten yet once more in fancys eye yes  from afar a landscape seems to rise embellished by the lavish hand of spring thin gilded clouds float lightly over the skies and laughing loves disport on fluttering wing how blessed the youth in yonder valley laid what smiles in every conscious feature play while to the murmurs of the breezy glade his merry pipe attunes the rural lay hail innocence whose bosom all serene feels not as yet the internal tempest roll o never may care distract that placid mien never may the shades of doubt overwhelm thy soul vain wish for lo in gay attire concealed yonder she comes the heartenflaming fiend will no kind power the helpless stripling shield swift to her destined prey see passion bend o smile accursed to hide the worst designs now with blithe eye she wooes him to be blessed while round her arm unseen a serpent twines  and lo she hurls it hissing at his breast and instant lo his dizzy eyeball swims ghastly and reddening darts a frantic glare pain with strong grasp distorts his writhing limbs and fears cold hand erects his frozen hair is this o life is this thy boasted prime and does thy spring no happier prospect yield why should the sunbeam pain thy glittering clime when the keen mildew desolates the field how memory pains let some gay theme beguile the musing mind and soothe to soft delight ye images of woe no more recoil be lifes past scenes wrapped in oblivious night now when fierce winter armed with wasteful power heaves the wild deep that thunders from afar how sweet to sit in the sequestered bower to hear and but to hear the mingling war ambition here displays no gilded toy that tempts on desperate wing the soul to rise nor pleasures paths to wilds of woe decoy nor anguish lurks in grandeurs proud disguise often has contentment cheered this lone abode with the mild languish of her smiling eye here health in rosy bloom has often glowed while looserobd quiet stood enamored by even the storm lulls to more profound repose the storm these humble walls assails in vain the shrub is sheltered when the whirlwind blows while the oaks mighty ruin strows the plain blow on ye winds thine winter be the skies and toss the infuriate surge and vales lay waste nature thy temporary rage defies to her relief the gentler seasons haste throned in her emerald car see spring appear as fancy wills the landscape starts to view her emerald car the youthful zephyrs bear fanning her bosom with their pinions blue around the jocund hours are fluttering seen and lo her rod the roselipd power extends and lo the lawns are decked in living green and beautys brighteyd train from heaven descends haste happy days and make all nature glad  but will all nature joy at your return o can ye cheer pale sickness gloomy bed or dry the tears that bathe the untimely urn will ye one transient ray of gladness dart where groans the dungeon to the captives wail to ease tired disappointments bleeding heart will all your stores of softening balm avail when stern oppression in his harpyfangs from wants weak grasp the last sad morsel bears can ye allay the dying parents pangs whose infant craves relief with fruitless tears for ah thy reign oppression is not past who from the shivering limbs the vestment rends who lays the once rejoicing village waste bursting the ties of lovers and of friends but hope not muse vainglorious as thou art with the weak impulse of thy humble strain hope not to soften prides obdurate heart when errolls bright example shines in vain then cease the theme turn fancy turn thine eye thy weeping eye nor further urge thy flight thy haunts alas no gleams of joy supply or transient gleams that flash and sink in night yet fain the mind its anguish would forego spread then historic muse thy pictured scroll bid thy great scenes in all their splendour glow and rouse to thought sublime the exulting soul what mingling pomps rush on the enraptured gaze lo where the gallant navy rides the deep here glittering towns their spiry turrets raise there bulwarks overhang the shaggy steep bristling with spears and bright with burnished shields the embattled legions stretch their long array discords red torch as fierce she scours the fields with bloody tincture stains the face of day and now the hosts in silence wait the sign keen are their looks whom liberty inspires quick as the goddess darts along the line each breast impatient burns with noble fires her form how graceful in her lofty mien the smiles of love stern wisdoms frown control her fearless eye determined though serene speaks the great purpose and the unconquered soul mark where ambition leads the adverse band each feature fierce and haggard as with pain with menace loud he cries while from his hand he vainly strives to wipe the crimson stain lo at his call impetuous as the storms headlong to deeds of death the hosts are driven hatred to madness wrought each face deforms mounts the black whirlwind and involves the heaven now virtue now thy powerful succor lend shield them for liberty who dare to die  ah liberty will none thy cause befriend are those thy sons thy generous sons that fly not virtues self when heaven its aid denies can brace the loosened nerves or warm the heart not virtues self can still the bursts of sighs when festers in the soul misfortunes dart see where by terror and despair dismayed the scattering legions pour along the plain ambitions car in bloody spoils arrayed hews its broad way as vengeance guides the rein but who is he that by yon lonely brook such according to plutarch was the scene of brutuss death  with woods oerhung and precipices rude lies all abandoned yet with dauntless look sees streaming from his breast the purple flood ah brutus ever thine be virtues tear lo his dim eyes to liberty he turns as scarce supported on her broken spear over her expiring son the goddess mourns loose to the wind her azure mantle flies from her dishevelled locks she rends the plume no luster lightens in her weeping eyes and on her tearstaind cheek no roses bloom meanwhile the world ambition owns thy sway fames loudest trumpet labors with thy name for thee the muse awakes her sweetest lay and flattery bids for thee her altars flame nor in lifes lofty bustling sphere alone the sphere where monarchs and where heroes toil sink virtues sons beneath misfortunes frown while guilts thrilled bosom leaps at pleasures smile full often where solitude and silence dwell far far remote amid the lowly plain resounds the voice of woe from virtues cell such is mans doom and pity weeps in vain still grief recoils  how vainly have i strove thy power o melancholy to withstand tired i submit but yet o yet remove or ease the pressure of thy heavy hand yet for a while let the bewildered soul find in society relief from woe o yield a while to friendships soft control some respite friendship will thou not bestow come then philander whose exalted mind looks down from far on all that charms the great for thou can bear unshaken and resigned the brightest smiles the blackest frowns of fate come thou whose love unlimited sincere nor faction cools nor injury destroys who lendst to miserys moan a pitying ear and feelst with ecstasy anothers joys who know mans frailty with a favoring eye and melting heart beholdst a brothers fall who unenslavd by fashions narrow tie with manly freedom followst natures call and bring thy delia sweetlysmiling fair whose spotless soul no rankling thoughts

sentiment sublime is joined to female softness and a form divine come and disperse the involving shadows drear let chastend mirth the social hours employ o catch the swiftwingd moment while it is near on swiftest wing the moment flies of joy even while the careless disencumberd soul sinks all dissolving into pleasures dream even then to times tremendous verge we roll with headlong haste along lifes surgy stream can gaiety the vanished years restore or on the withering limbs fresh beauty shed or soothe the sad inevitable hour or cheer the dark dark mansions of the dead still sounds the solemn knell in fancys ear that called eliza to the silent tomb with her how jocund rolled the sprightly year how shone the nymph in beautys brightest bloom ah beautys bloom avails not in the grave youths lofty mien nor ages awful grace moulder alike unknown the prince and slave whelmed in the enormous wreck of human race the thoughtfixd portraiture the breathing bust the arch with proud memorials arrayed the longlived pyramid shall sink in dust to dumb oblivions everdesart shade fancy from joy still wanders far astray ah melancholy how i feel thy power long have i labored to elude thy sway  but it is enough for i resist no more the traveller thus that over the midnight waste through many a lonesome path is doomed to roam wilderd and weary sits him down at last for the long night and distant far his home elegy occasioned by the death of a lady by the same still shall unthinking man substantial deem the forms that fleet through lifes deceitful dream on clouds where fancys beam amusive plays shall heedless hope his towering fabric raise till at deaths touch the ideal glories fly and real scenes rush dismal on the eye and from the bowers of beauty torn the startled soul awakes to think  and mourn o ye whose hours in jocund train advance whose spirits to the song of gladness dance who flowery scenes in endless view survey glittering in beams of visionary day o yet while fate delays the impending woe be roused to thought anticipate the blow lest like the lightnings glance the sudden ill flash to confound and penetrate to kill lest thus encompassed with funereal gloom like me ye bend over some untimely tomb pour your wild ravings in nights frighted ear and half pronounce heavens sacred doom severe wise beauteous good  o every grace combined that charms the eye that captivates the mind fair as the flowret opening on the morn whose leaves bright drops of liquid pearl adorn sweet as the downypiniond gale that roves to gather fragrance in arabian groves mild as the strains that at the close of day warbling remote along the vales decay yet why with those compared what tints so fine what sweetness mildness can be matched with thine why roam abroad since still to fancys eyes i see i see thy lovely form arise still let me gaze and every care beguile gaze on that cheek where all the graces smile that soulexpressing eye benignly bright where meekness beams ineffable delight that brow where wisdom sits enthroned serene each feature forms and dignifies the mien still let me listen while her words impart the sweet effusions of the blameless heart till all my soul each tumult charmed away yields gently led to virtues easy sway by thee inspired o virtue age is young and music warbles from the faultering tongue thy ray creative chears the clouded brow and decks the faded cheek with rosy glow brightens the joyless aspect and supplies pure heavenly luster to the languid eyes each look each action while it awes invites and age with every youthful grace delights but when youths living bloom reflects thy beams resistless on the view the glory streams the ecstatic breast triumphant virtue warms and beauty dazzles with angelic charms ah whither fled  ye dear illusions stay lo pale and silent lies the lovely clay how are the roses on that lip decayed which health in all the pride of bloom arrayed health on her form each sprightly grace bestowed with active life each speaking feature glowed fair was the flower and soft the vernal sky elate with hope we deemed no tempest nigh when lo a whirlwinds instantaneous gust left all its beauties withering in the dust all cold the hand that soothed woes weary head all quenched the eye the pitying tear that shed all mute the voice whose pleasing accents stole infusing balm into the rankled soul  o death why arm with cruelty thy power and spare the weed yet lop the lovely flower why fly thy shafts in lawless error driven to virtue then no more the care of heaven  but peace bold thought be still my bursting heart we not eliza felt the fatal dart escaped the dark dungeon does the slave complain nor bless the hand that broke the galling chain say pines not virtue for the lingering morn on this dark wild condemned to roam forlorn where reasons meteorrays with sickly glow over the dun gloom a dreadful glimmering throw disclosing dubious to the affrighted eye oerwhelming mountains tottering from on high black billowy seas in storms perpetual tossed and weary ways in wildering labyrinths lost o happy stroke that bursts the bonds of clay darts through the rending gloom the blaze of day and wings the soul with boundless flight to soar when dangers threat and fears alarm no more transporting thought here let me wipe away the falling tear and wake a bolder lay but ah afresh the swimming eye overflows  nor check the tear that streams for human woes lo over her dust in speechless anguish bend the hopeless parent husband brother friend  how vain the hope of man  but cease thy strain nor sorrows dread solemnity profane mixed with yon drooping mourners over her bier in silence shed the sympathetic tear absence a pastoral ballad by  how sweet to recall the sweet moments of joy it is this and this only can absence employ can ease my fond heart and beguile my soft pain till i see with delight my dear charmer again ah who ever knew such full transports as i while with her the swift minutes unheeded passed by alas with the sweet recollection i burn bring back your delights ye dear moments return ah me what delights in my bosom would rise while with eager attention i have hung on her eyes and watched the kind beams of compassion and love while she pitied my passion and seemed to approve ah me with what raptured attention i have hung to catch the sweet accents that flowed from her tongue when tenderness bade the dear maiden impart the pleasing sensations that glowed in her heart o how does my fair one consume the long day is the charmer quite easy while i am away indeed if our thoughts like our hearts should agree the dear lovely maiden is thinking on me ah did she but think with such fondness as i how much would she grieve and how often would she sigh yet with so much fond love may her bosom never burn if she fighs as i sigh if she mourns as i mourn but why do i wander why sigh thus alone alas it is the loss of my fair that i moan why thus every hour does my sorrow increase alas it is absence that ruins my peace why swells my sad bosom with fear and with grief ah naught but her presence can bring me relief why thus down my cheek trickles fast the big tear alas can i help it  my fair is not here till i nourished this passion i all unconcerned saw peace my companion wherever i turned till now with my heart all at ease i could rest and a sigh was a stranger unknown to my breast what then is this love and why do i endure these griefs in my mind nor endeavor to cure when thus my fond heart is overwhelmed with despair and i know no delight when away from my fair yet colin these pains spite of all thou have said by one hour of her presence are far overpaid these sorrows from absence which now you deplore then vanish are lost and are thought of no more recall those rash words and forbear to complain since the next tender meeting rewards all your pain let sweet expectation then lessen your care let hope soften absence and keep off despair sure sure those dear pleasures once more will return how long in this absence distressed must i mourn how long must i wish while my lot i deplore that dear angelface  could i see

vocal hills shall speak the praise of friendships sacred fire to the moon by mr robert lloyd all hail majestic queen of night bright cynthia sweetest nymph whose presence brings the pensive pleasures calm delight while contemplation smooths her ruffled wings which follys vain tumultuous joys or business care and buzz of lusty day have all too ruffled  hence away stale jest and flippant mirth and strifeengendering noise when evening dons her mantle gray i will wind my solitary way and hie me to some lonely grove the haunt of fancy and of love whose social branches far outspread possess the mind with pleasing dread while cynthia quivers through the trees that wanton with the summer breeze and the clear brook or dimpled stream reflects oblique her dancing beam how often by thy silver light have lovers tongues beguiled the night when forth the happy pair have strayed the amorous swain and tender maid and as they walked the groves along cheered the still eve with various song while every artful strain confessed the mutual passion in their breast to lovers hours fly swift away and night reluctant yields to day thrice happy nymph thrice happy youth when beauty is the meed of truth yet not the happy loves alone has thy celestial presence known to thee complains the nymph forlorn of broken faith and vows forsworn and the dull swain with folded arms still musing on his false ones charms frames many a sonnet to her name as lovers use to express their flame or pining wan with thoughtful care in downcast silence feeds despair or when the air dead stillness keeps and cynthia on the water sleeps charms the dull ear of sober night with loveborn musics sweet delight often as thy orb performs its round thou listenest to the various sound of shepherds hopes and maidens fears those conscious cynthia silent hears while echo which still loves to mock bears them about from rock to rock but shift we now the pensive scene where cynthia silvers over the green mark yonder spot whose equal rim forms the green circle quaint and trim hither the fairies blithe advance and lightly trip in mazy dance beating the pansiepaven ground in frolic measures round and round these cynthias revels gaily keep while lazy mortals snore asleep whom often they visit in the night not visible to human sight and as old prattling wives relate though now the fashions out of date drop sixpence in the housewifes shoe and pinch the slattern black and blue they fill the mind with airy schemes and bring the ladies pleasant dreams who knows not mab whose chariot glides and athwart mens noses rides while oberon blithe fairy trips and hovers over the ladies lips and when he steals ambrosial bliss and soft imprints the charming kiss in dreams the nymph her swain pursues nor thinks it is oberon that wooes ye sportive youth and lovely fair from hence my lesson read beware while innocence and mirth preside we care not where the fairies glide and oberon will never miss to greet his favorites with a kiss nor ever more ambrosia sips than when he visits  s lips when all things else in silence sleep the blithsome elfs their vigils keep and always hover round about to find our worth or frailties out receive with joy these elfin sparks their kisses leave no telltale marks but breathe fresh beauty over the face where all is virtue all is grace not only elfin fays delight to hail the sober queen of night but that sweet bird whose gurgling throat warbles the thick melodious note duly as evening shades prevail renews her soothing lovelorn tale and as the lover pensive goes chaunts out her symphony of woes which in boon natures wilder tone beggar all sounds which art has known but hist  the melancholy bird among the groves no more is heard and cynthia pales her silver ray before the approach of golden day which on yon mountains misty height stands tiptoe with his gladsome light now the shrill lark in ether floats and carols wide her liquid notes while phoebus in his lusty pride his flaming beams flings far and wide cynthia farewell  the pensive muse no more her feeble flight pursues but all unwilling takes her way and mixes with the buzz of day a ballad by the same ye shepherds so careless and gay who sport with the nymphs of the plain take heed lest you frolic away the peace you can never regain let not folly your bosoms annoy and of love the dear mischief beware

night of despair hope paints the gay scene to the sight while fancy her visions bestows and gilds every dream with delight but to wake us to sensible woes how hard is my lot to complain of a nymph whom i yet must adore though she love not her shepherd again her damon must love her the more for it was not the pride of her sex that treated his vows with disdain for it was not the pleasure to vex that made her delude her fond swain twas his the fair nymph to behold he hoped  and he rashly believed twas hers to be fatally cold  he loved  and was fondly deceived for such is of lovers the doom while passions their reason beguile it is warrant enough to presume if they catch but a look or a smile yet surely my phillis would seem to prize me most shepherds above but that might be only esteem while i foolishly construed it love yet others like damon believed the nymph might have favored her swain and others like him were deceived like him though they cannot complain of phyllis was always my song for she was my pride and my care and the folks as we wandered along would call us the conjugal pair they marked how i walked at her side how her hand to my bosom i pressed each tender endearment i tried and i thought none was ever so blessed but now the delusion is over these daydreams of pleasure are fled now her damon is pleasing no more and the hopes of her shepherd are dead may he that my fair shall obtain may he as thy damon be true or happily thou wilt think of that swain who bids thee dear maiden adieu a ballad by the same hark hark it is a voice from the tomb come lucy it cries come away the grave of thy colin has room to rest thee beside his cold clay i come my dear shepherd i come ye friends and companions adieu i haste to my colins dark home to die on his bosom

cold ground while stormy winds over her blew and nightravens croakd all around how long my loved colin she cried how long must thy lucy complain how long shall the grave my love hide how long ere it join us again for thee thy fond shepherdess lived with thee over the world would she fly for thee has she sorrowd and grieved for thee would she lie down and die alas what avails it how dear thy lucy was once to her swain her face like the lily so fair and eyes that gave light to the plain the shepherd that loved her is gone that face and those eyes charm no more and lucy forgot and alone to death shall her colin deplore while thus she lay sunk in despair and mourned to the echoes around inflamed all at once grew the air and thunder shook dreadful the ground i hear the kind call and obey o colin receive me she cried then breathing a groan over his clay she hung on his tombstone and died loveelegies by mr hammond elegy i while calm you sit beneath your secret shade and lose in pleasing

over thy liquid plain the azure worlds below surveyed led by the rosyhanded hours when time tript over that bank of flowers which in thy crystal bosom smiled though old the god yet light and gay he flung his glass his scythe away and seemed himself a child the poplar tall that waving near would whisper to thy murmurs free yet rustling seems to soothe mine ear and trembles when i sigh for thee yet seated on thy shelving brim can fancy see the naiads trim burnish their green locks in the sun or at the last lone hour of day to chase the lighty glancing jay in airy circles run but fancy can thy mimic power again those happy moments bring can thou restore that golden hour when young joy waved his laughing wing when first in edens rosy vale my full heart poured the lovers tale the vow sincere devoid of guile while delia in her panting breast with sighs the tender thought suppressed and looked as angels smile o goddess of the crystal brow that dwellst the golden meads among whose streams still fair in memory flow whose murmurs melodize my song o yet those gleams of joy display which brightening glowed in fancys ray when near thy lucid urn reclined the dryad nature barred her

sullen evergreen  shall thou my shining sphere invade  my noonday beauties beam unseen  obscured beneath thy dusky shade  deluded flower the myrtle cries  shall we thy moments bloom adore  the meanest shrub that you despise  the meanest flower has merit more  that daisy in its simple bloom  shall last along the changing year  blush on the snow of winters gloom and bid the smiling spring appear  the violet that those banks beneath  hides from thy scorn its modest head  shall fill the air with fragrant breath  when thou art in thy dusty bed  even i who boast no golden shade  am of no shining tints possessed  when low thy lucld form is laid  shall bloom on many a lovely breast  and he whose kind and fostering care  to thee to me our beings gave  shall near his breast my flowrets wear  and walk regardless over thy grave  deluded flower the friendly screen  that hides thee from the noontide ray  and mocks thy passion to be seen  prolongs thy transitory day  but kindly deeds with scorn repaid  no more by virtue need be done  i now withdraw my dusky shade  and yield thee to thy darling sun fierce on the flower the scorching beam with all its weight of glory fell the flower exulting caught the gleam and lent its leaves a bolder swell expanded by the searching fire the curling leaves the breast disclosed the mantling bloom was painted higher and every latent charm exposed but when the sun was sliding low and evening came with dews so cold the wanton beauty ceased to blow and sought her bending leaves to fold those leaves alas no more will close relaxed exhausted sickening pale they

waked thy gentle reed repose beneath my humble tree if thou love simplicity stranger if thy lot has laid in toilsome scenes of busy life full sorely may thou see the strife of weary passions ill repaid in a garden live like me if thou love simplicity flowers have sprung for many a year over the villagemaidens grave that one memorialsprig to save bore it from a sisters bier and homeward walking wept over me the true tears of simplicity and soon her cottagewindow near with care my slender stem she placed and fondly thus her grief embraced and cherished sad remembrance dear for love sincere and friendship free are children of simplicity when past was many a painful day slowpacing over the villagegreen in white were all its maidens seen and bore my guardian friend away ah death what sacrifice to thee the ruins of simplicity one generous swain her heart approved a youth whose fond and faithful breast with many an artless sigh confessed in natures language that he loved but stranger it is no tale for thee unless thou love simplicity he died  and soon her lip was cold and soon her rosy lip was pale the village wept to hear the tale when for both the slow bell tolled  beneath yon flowery turf they lie the lovers of simplicity yet one boon have i to crave stranger if thy pity bleed will thou do one tender deed and ew my pale flowers over their grave so lightly lie the turf on thee because thou love simplicity written on a chinese temple in mr scotts garden at amwell by the same to scenes where taste and genius dwell unwillingly we bid farewell for these of more than mortal birth strangers and sojourners on earth have far from every vulgar road at amwell fixed their fair abode written on another open temple under the words mihi et amicis by the same thy friends have access to a nobler part they claim the open temple of thy heart o may no sighs from that calm region borne thy shades soft whispers turn to sounds forlorn far far be thence each monument

fired unfold the riper treasures of his mind and tune those lays which love and grief inspired to truth and freedom may thou still be kind a sonnet made on isabella markhame when i first thought her

blessing or without the aid of truthassimilated fiction thou wast given by god himself a chearing light to guide mans feet driven from fair edens groves across the untrackd wilderness of life to heavens blessed mansions where and where alone thy office friendly hope shall sweetly cease to full fruition yielded but on earth nay not perchance even in fair edens groves are thy assuasive consolations vain for what is life or what its highest scenes of boasted happiness if present bliss bounds the horizon of our views nor hope with eagle eye kens aught beyond on which to fix the future ardent hearts desire to fill the soul and make the rapid wish run over with plentitude of joy  vain vain to mans felicity in youth or age the present draught of pleasure though once wished with all the eagerness of panting thirst deep deep he drinks and longs for more from hope to hope he springs he views and still extends his view over cloudcapt alps new alps arise he gains the summit still the prospect wide enlarges to his eye forward he fares nor ceases to ascend till high in heaven he rides at anchor and then hopes no more but o thou general blessing smiling hope thy lucid ray not only leads us on from view to view not only do thou cheer with expectation sweet of future good but with serenity of present bliss thou fillst the heart expectant hope can give habitual good humor to the soul a vital heat she quickens the still parts nay even in motion keeps the springs of life and when most indolent and most remiss or rouzes or preserves the mind awake see too how few  and even those few how short  are actual enjoyments but through thee blessed hope we gain a taste delicious taste of pleasures possible taste not less sweet perchance than real for kind hope bestows a bliss in expectation not less full and fuller often than ripe fruition brings fruition haughty nymph she never deigns to walk with humble hope who at her sight retires abashed unnoticd and unthankd but o blessed comforter ingrate to thee let me not ever prove should wished success crown my hearts hope let me not ever forget the dear indulgences thy soothing views have to my soul presented yet o yet  thy promised consummation too too long delayed the heart in deep despondence sighs and sickens sad with care o then indulge thy votarys prayer nor ever let me lose thy chearing aspect never let the night of black despondence with its dismal veil my little prospects in thick darkness wrap nor yet too long delay to grant my wish accomplishment if worthy so my soul invigorated still shall onward press to more and more improvement nor grow faint till the big buds of hope terrestrial burst to blossoms full and fair in better climes but say bright hope what numbers shall be found worthy to sing thy praise for that thy hand not only to the happiest life imparts its zest its relish but with tender care is stretched forth to assuage the wretchs woe to soothe the anguish of disease and pain and soften sad adversitys rough bed thou only cheap and universal cure of human ills  of human sorrow thou best comforter and often full often alas the only comforter the wretched find ah see from that unfortunate overwhelmed in the deep gulf of sorrow with what speed what cruel speed as from contagion all with one consent are flying  and will none for gentle pitys sake remain behind to comfort the diftrest yes faithful hope benevolently stays and flatterer kind her farforeseeing tube applies through which the eye though dim with mourning often discerns future and happier days through the black gloom of melancholy prospects shining bright ah honest flatterer  yes for once the muse commends what most the worthy mind abhors and calls thee honest flatterer for while all assiduous join to adulate the blessed hope tender hope alone with soft concern flatters the unhappy and when every friend flies from the shipwreckd naked ruined wretch when every woe in dire array crowds round even then in that sad hour hope still remains as loath to leave divine philanthrophist her labor of disinterested love see  with those anxious sailors this refers to a real event which happened two winters past these mariners when their vessel was sunk continued two days and nights on the mast where they found an accidental keg of brandy which under god preserved their lives till a vessel from margate came with great hazard to their preservation the person who first saw the vessel immediately fainted away  see her watch her eye almost exhausted on the mast the topmast of yon high admiral just peeping from those waves that have ingulphd the gallant vessel with its hapless crew save those who sit as if for bitterer fate reserved long wakeful nights and anxious days high on the topmast fearing instant death from each insulting wave yet yet not yet will hope desert them see she strains her eye far over the trackless occan see she looks with eager expectation looks around wild winds alone are heard green waves alone foaming with fury are beheld o hope blessed hope forsake them not should thou forsake and from the top mast fly they fall they sink irrevocably lost  she will not go still will she watch nor watch in vain she spies a white sail rising from the waves it comes behold it comes and in its bosom bears thriceprecious life they faint for joy their feet scarce bear them trembling to the welcome bark where safely boarded  hope her golden wings plumes and exulting shoots across the deep quick as in winters skies the radiant star but whither thus precipitate her flight urges the general comforter behold where stretched upon the bed of sore disease worn out with pain the sick man languid lies she comes blessed hope and lo her kindly arm rears from the pillow his enfeebled head and lenient sooths his melancholy heart now pointing to fair health with roseate bloom rekindling vigor in the mantling cheek now to the robe of white and crown of gold reserved for christs true servants in the realms of everlasting day  thrice faithful hope thou like the heart livst first and die last nor even in deaths extremest pangs wilt leave the fluttering soul  but when earths fears and joys sink into darkness all thy beaming light unvelopes prospects new and better far prospects which make man man and cause the soul in death to triumph and defy the grave nor ceases with the man of sorrow stretched on bed of sickness hores indulgent aid the balm of comfort see how she presents to the dear tender partner of his heart the wife with weeping love beside the couch watching solicitous with sleepless eye hope shows her the fond husband to her arms once more restored hope to her aching heart the valued parent represents once more smiling amidst his children and endeared as thus endangered tenfold more endeared look through the varied scenes of hapless life hope allbeneficent is ever found wherever is found affliction none so low can sink but hope will to their wretchedness descend and point out consolations star brightning in better skies not even the slave laden with cruel chains deep in the mines of rich potosi toiling though from light ever sequestered of allcheering day can from her light be hid see through his soul it shoots illuminating and affords bright blessing glances of his native land recovered freedom and rejoicing friends all

human race devoutly sacrifice while to thy shrine all mortals bend the knee whence does it hap that often the mournful tongue proclaims thee false and dares to desecrate thy hallowed name deceitful calling thee and apt to slide full often from the embrace even in the hour of highest expectation often found to promise what thou never do bestow  vain mortals  yes with serious solemn heed i mark thy words celestial  mortals know  it is not in hope it is in yourselves deceived  and still deceiving that the error lies  shortlived and of a span ye stretch your hopes  proud hopes of sublunary

idly hope where reasons self recoils  thus rendering your existence dream at best  still more a dream  less credulous and fond  mortals bewise either as mortals hope  or still more wise hope as immortals yes with sacred awe thy counsel i receive blessed teacher o assist me to obey its dictates far above this waning moon teach me to rise over momentary bliss triumphant and to soar on thy bright wings beyond the lessened clouds beyond all time deep into vast immensity where thou though born of immortality and proof of thy high parents glory  where even thou earths blessing  never never shall be known then farewell hope for ever  then adieu sweet expectation when each ravished sense lives in the plenitude of gods own joy but till that hour o deign allcheering hope to smile before me gild my prospects round with thy reviving splendour full in view present the vast realities which wait the immortal stranger traveling from this world to his eternal home his rest his haven so shall my heart never with impatient throbs pant for the uncertain sublunary gifts of this eerchanging life so reasons hand with fortitude attending on shall lead to the neat cottage of retired content where dwells mans truest happiness there lodged like caesar with a generous disdain present possessions nobly i will despise and from them frankly part in the full hope hope which can never deceive nor mount too high hope of possessions future better far boundless duration bliss immutable hail then bright hope of immortality true genuine daughter hail mans chiefest good and his best portion while no mor than man smile over the human race and still vouchsafe to gild to gladden all their joys to soothe with gentle blandishment their woes to fill with just contempt of transitory life still realizing to their raptured view heavens high felicities o while strong faith with steady finger points us to our home do thou invigorate our active feet along the rugged way full sull in sight place that homes

others was a work of time perhaps in those rude ages when no law kept the warm passions of mankind in awe rapine was frequent from his neighbors fold some proud oppressor of gigantic mold his fleecy charge his only treasure bore and left the shepherd weltering in his gore yet then no dire necessity had made murder a system war a needful trade no frederick foe to nature and to man justice his pretext tyranny his plan born every right of nations to betray over leipzicks walls had forced his desperate way coarse was their food their sordid dwelling small such was the lot of one the lot of

peaceful shepherds uncontrolled their ranging flocks through boundless pastures drove or tuned their pipes beneath the myrtle grove their laws on brazen tablets unimprest were deeply engraved on each

gilded toy freedom thenceforth and peace and justice fled infernal discord reared her snaky head from blackest erebus whose scorpions hurled by dread oppression curbed a wretched world too late remorse congealed each guilty soul and forky lightnings flashed from pole to pole wherever we search the vast instructive page of fact or fiction we in every age see saints impaled and tortured at the stake through fervent zeal and for religions sake murders and sorceries and men whose heart never prompted one humane one generous part while some vain mortal arbiter os ill governed the rest at whose imperious will millions of slaughtered heroes bit the dust to soothe a tyrants pride a strumpets lust till loathing both the present and the past we learn this melancholy truth at last  on lifes rough

stalls and with heroic frenzy risk their life fomenting some unnecessary strife unfalln and uncorrupted they fulfill their natures end their mighty makers will stoop then ye sons of reason stoop and

of care since she is lost  ye powers divine what have i done or thought or said o say what horrid act of mine has drawn this vengeance on my head why should heaven favor lycons claim why are my hearts best wishes crossed what fairer deeds adorn his name what nobler merit can he boast what higher worth in him was found my true hearts service to outweigh a senseless fop  a dull compound of scarcely animated clay he dressed indeed he danced with ease and charmed her by repeating over unmeaning raptures in her praise that twenty fools had said before but i alas who thought all art my passions force would meanly prove could only boast an honest heart and claimed no merit but my love have i not sat  ye conscious hours be witness  while my stella sung from morn to eve with all my powers rapt in the enchantment of her tongue ye conscious hours that saw me stand entranced in wonder and surprise in silent rapture press her hand with passion bursting from my eyes have i not loved  o earth and heaven where now is all my youthful boast the dear exchange i hoped was given for slighted fame and fortune lost where now the joys that once were mine where all my hopes of future bliss must i those joys these hopes resign is all her friendship come to this must then each woman faithless prove and each fond lover be undone are vows no more  almighty love the sad remembrance let me shun it will not be  my honest heart the dear sad image still retains and spite of reason spite of art the dreadful memory remains ye powers divine whose wondrous skill deep in the womb of time can see behold i bend me to your will nor dare arraign your high decree let her be blessed with health with ease with all your bounty has in store let sorrow cloud my future days be stella blessed  i ask no more but lo where high in yonder cast the star of morning mounts apace hence  let me fly the unwelcome guest and bid the muses labor cease elegy ii by the same when young lifes journey i began the glittering prospect charmed my eyes i saw along the extended plan joy after joy successive rise and fame her golden trumpet blew and power displayed her gorgeous charms and wealth engaged my wandering view and pleasure wooed me to her arms to each by turns my vows i paid as folly led me to admire while fancy magnified each shade and hope increased each fond desire but soon i found twas all a dream and learned the fond pursuit to shun where few can reach their purposed aim and thousands daily are undone and fame i found was empty air and wealth had terror for her guest and pleasures path was strewn with care and power was vanity at best tired of the chase i gave it over and in a far sequestered shade to contemplations sober power my youths next services i paid there health and peace adorned the scene and often indulgent to my prayer with mirthful eye and frolic mien the muse would deign to visit there there would she often delighted rove the slowerenamelld vale along or wander with me through the grove and listen to the woodlarks song or mid the forests awful gloom whilst wild amazement filled my eyes recall past ages from the tomb and bid ideal worlds arise thus in the muses favor

of britains youth the boast and wonder of the plain still with our years our friendship grew no cares did then my peace destroy time brought new blessings as he flew and every hour was winged with joy but soon the blissful scene was lost soon did the sad reverse appear love came like an untimely frost to blast the promise of my year i saw young daphnes angelform fool that i was i blessed the smart and while i gazed nor thought of harm the dear infection seized my heart she was  at least in damons eyes  made up of loveliness and grace her heart a stranger to disguise her mind as perfect as her face to hear her speak to see her move unhappy i alas the while her voice was joy her look was love and heaven was opened in her smile she heard me breathe my amorous prayers she listened to the tender strain she heard my sighs she saw my tears and seemed at length to share my pain she said she loved  and i poor youth how soon alas can hope persuade thought all she said no more than truth and all my love was well repaid in joys unknown to courts or kings with her i sat the livelong day and said and looked such tender things as none beside could look or say how soon can fortune shift the scene and all our earthly bliss destroy care hovers round and griefs fell train still treads upon the heels of joy my ages hope my youths best boast my souls chief blessing and my pride in one sad moment all were lost and daphne changed and thyrsis died o who that heard her vows erewhile could dream these vows were insincere or who could think that saw her smile that fraud could find admittance there yet she was false  my heart will break her frauds her perjuries were such  some other tongue than mine must speak  i have not power to say how much ye swains hence warned avoid the bait o shun her paths the traitress shun her voice is death her smile is fate who hears or sees her is undone and when deaths hand shall close my eye for soon i know the day will come o cheer my spirit with a

and thee ode to horror in the allegoric descriptive alliterative epithetical fantastic hyperbolical and diabolical style of our modern odewrights and monodymongers by  o goddess of the gloomy scene of shadowy shapes thou blackbrowd queen thy tresses dark with ivy crowned on yonder mouldering abbey found often wont from charnels damp and dim to call the sheeted spectre grim while as his loose chains loudly clink thou addst a length to every link o thou that love at eve to seek the pensivepacing pilgrim meek and setst before his shuddering eyes strange forms and fiends of giantsize as wildly works thy wizzard will till fearstruck fancy has her fill dark power whose magic might prevails over hermitrocks and fairyvales o goddess erst by spensers fairy queen b   canto   spenser viewed what time the enchanter vile embrued his hands in florimels pure heart till loosed by steelclad britomart o thou that erst on fancys wing did terrortrembling gierus liberat b    tasso bring to groves where kept damned furies dire their bluetipt battlements of fire thou that through many a darksome pine over the rugged rock recline did wake the hollowwhispering breeze with careconsumed eloise o thou with whom in chearless cell the midnightclock pale prisoners tell o haste thee mild miltonic maid from yonder yews sequestered shade more bright than all the fabled nine teach me to breathe the solemn line o bid my wellrangd numbers rise pervious to none but attic eyes o give the strain that madness moves till every starting sense approves what felt the gallic i do not remember that any poetical use has been made of this story traveller when far in arabdesert drear he found within the catacomb alive the terrors of a tomb while many a mummy through the shade in hieroglyphic stole arrayed seemed to uprear the mystic head and trace the gloom with ghostly tread thou heardst him pour the stifled groan horror his soul was all thy own o mother of the fireclad thought o haste thee from thy gravelike grot what time the witch performed her rite sprung from the embrace of taste and night o queen that erst did thinly spread the willowy leaves over see isis an elegy isis head and to her meek mien did dispense woes most awful negligence what time in cave with visage pale she told her elegiac tale o thou whom wandering warton saw amazed with more than youthful awe as by the pale moons glimmering gleam he mused his melancholy theme see the pleasures of melancholy a poem  o curfeuloving goddess haste o waft me to some scythian waste where in gothic solitude mid prospects most sublimely rude beneath a rough rocks gloomy chasm thy sister sits enthusiasm let me with her in magic trance hold most delirious dalliance till i thy pensive votary horror look madly wild like thee until i gain true transports shore and lifes retiring scene is over aspire to some more azure sky remote from dim mortality at length recline the fainting head in druiddreams dissolved and dead verses on the expected arrival of queen charlotte in an epistle to a friend      by  yes  every hopeful son of rhyme will surely seize this happy time vault upon pegasuss back now grown an academic hack and sing the beauties of a queen whom by the by he has not seen will swear her eyes are black as jet her teeth in pearls as coral set will tell us that the rose has lent her cheek its bloom her lips its scent that philomel breaks off her song and listens to her sweeter tongue that venus and the graces joined to form this phoenix of her kind and pallas undertook to store her mind with wisdoms chiefest lore thus formed jove issues a decree that georges consort she shall be then cupid for what match is made by poets without cupids aid picks out the swiftest of his darts and pierces instant both their hearts your fearful prosemen here might doubt how best to bring this match about for winds and waves are illbred things and little care for queens and kings but as the gods assembled stand and wait each youthful bards command all fancied dangers they deride of boisterous winds and swelling tide neptune is called to wait upon her and seanymphs are her maids of honor whilst we instead of eastern gales with vows and praises fill the sails and when with due poetic care they safely land the royal fair they catch the happy simile of venus rising from the sea soon as she moves the hill and vale responsive tell the joyful tale and wonder holds the enraptured throng to see the goddess pass along the bowing forests all adore her and flowers spontaneous spring before her where you and i all day might travel and meet with naught but sand and gravel but poets have a piercing eye and many pretty things can spy which neither you nor i can see but then the faults in you and me the king astonished must appear and find that fame has wronged his dear then hymen like a bishop stands to join the lovers plighted hands apollo and the muses wait the nuptial song to celebrate but i who rarely spend my time in paying court or spinning rhyme who cannot from the high abodes call down at will a troop of gods must in the plain prosaic way the wishes of my soul convey may heaven our monarchs choice approve may he be blessed with mutual love and be as happy with his queen as with my chloe i have been when wandering through the beechen grove she sweetly smiled and talked of love and o that he may live to see a son as wise and good as he and may his consort grace the throne with virtues equal to his own our courtly bards will needs be telling that she is like venus or like helen i wish that she may prove as fair as egremont and pembroke are for though by sages it is confessed that beautys but a toy at best yet it is methinks in married life a pretty douceur with a wife and may the minutes as they fly strengthen still the nuptial tie while hand in hand through life they go till love shall into friendship grow for though these blessings rarely wait on regal pomp and tinseld state yet happiness is virtues lot alike in palace and in cot it is true the grave affairs of state with little folks have little weight yet i confess my patriot heart in britains welfare bears its part with transport glows at georges name and triumphs in its countrys fame with hourly pleasure i can sit and talk of granby hawke and pit and whilst i praise the good and brave disdain the coward and the knave at growth of taxes others fret and shudder at the nations debt i never the fancied ills bemoan no debts disturb me but my own what though our coffers sink our trade repairs the breach which war has made and if expenses now run high our minds must with our means comply thus far my politics extend and here my warmest wishes end may merit flourish faction cease and i and europe live in peace aminta an elegy by mr gerrard an oergrown wood my wandering steps invade with surface mantled in untrodden snow dire haunt for none but savage monsters made where frosts descend and howling tempests blow here from the search of busy mortals strayed my woeworn soul shall hug her galling chain for sure no forest boasts too deep a shade no haunt too wild for misery to remain o my aminta dear distracting name late all my comfort all my fond delight still writhes my soul beneath its torturing flame still thy pale image fills my aching sight when shall vain memory slumber over her woes when to oblivion be her tale resigned when shall this fatal form in death repose like thine fair victim to the dust consigned again the accents faulter on my tongue again to tear the conscious tear succeeds from sharp reflection is the dagger sprung and nature wounded to the center bleeds ye bitter skies upon the tale descend  ye blasts though rude your visits lend an ear  around ye gentler oaks your branches bend and as ye listen drop an icy tear twas when the step with conscious pleasure roves where round the shades the circling woodbines throng when flora wantons over the enameled groves and feathered choirs indulge the amorous song inspired by duteous love i fondly strayed two milkwhite doves officious to ensnare beneath a silent thicket as they played a grateful present for my softer fair but ah in smiles no more they met my sight their ruffled heads lay gasping on the ground where my dire emblem a rapacious kite tore their soft limbs and strewn their plumes around the tear of pity stole into my eye while ruder passions in their turn succeed forbid the victims unrevenged to die and doom the author of their wrongs to bleed with hasty step enraged i homewards ran curse on my speed the unerring tube i brought that fatal hour my date of woe began too sharp to tell  too horrible for thought  disastrous deed  irrevocable ill  how shall i tell the anguish of my fate teach me remorseless monsters not to feel instruct me fiends and furies to relate wrathful behind the guilty shade i stole i raised the tube  the clamorous woods resound  too late i saw the idol of my soul struck by my aim fall shrieking to the ground no other bliss her soul allowed but me hapless the pair that thus indulgent prove she sought concealment from a shady tree in amorous silence to observe her love i ran  but o too soon i found it true  from her stained breast lifes crimson streamed apace  from her wan eyes the sparkling lustres flew  the shortlived roses faded from her face gods  could i bear that fond reproachful look that strove her peerless innocence to plead  but partial death awhile her tongue forsook to save a wretch that doomed himself to bleed while i distracted pressed her in my arms and fondly strove to imbibe her latest breath  o spare rash love she cried thy fatal charms  nor seek cold shelter in the arms of death  content beneath thy erring hand i die  our fates grew envious of a bliss so true  then urge not thy distress when low i lie  but in this breath receive my last adieu  no more she spoke but drooped her lily head in death she sickend  breathless  haggard  pale  while all my inmost soul with horror bled and asked kind vengeance from the passing gale where slept your bolts ye lingering lightnings say why rivd ye not this selfcondemned breast  or why too passive earth did thou delay to stretch thy jaws and crush me into rest  low in the dust the beauteous corse i placed bedewed and soft with many a falling tear with sable yew the rising turf i graced and bade the cypress mourn in silence near often as bright morns allsearching eye returns full to my view the fatal spot is brought through sleepless night my haunted spirit mourns no gloom can hide me from distracting thought when spotless victim shall my form decay this guilty load say when shall i resign when shall my spirit wing her chearless way and my cold corse lie treasured up with thine pethertonbridge an elegy tradition holds that the catastrophe alluded to in this elegy happened about two centuries ago of which the sculpture is yet to be seen at the abovementioned bridge near southpetherton somerset  inscribed to the rev mr bean of stokesubhamdon somerset by the same o bean whose fond connubial days a beauteous infantrace attend say will thou once more aid my lays and join the patron to the friend but not over bright aonian plains enraptured as we used to roam the muse each joyous thought restrains and calls her winged ideas home the wedded pair for children pray they come  fair blessings from the skies what raptures gild the haleyon day what joys in distant azure rise but ah enamored as they view the smiling hopeful infanttrain unseen misfortune marks his due unheard he threats the heart with pain had sad disaster never ensnared the soft the innocent and young the tender muse had gladly spared the little heroes of her song see thou the limpid current glide beneath yon bridge my hapless theme where brambles fringe its verdant side and willows tremble over the stream from petherton it takes its name from whence two smiling infants strayed led by the stream they hither came and on the flowery margin played sweet victims must your shortlived day so soon extinguish in the wave and point the setting sun his way that glimmerd over your watery grave as each by childish fancy led cropped the broad daisies as they sprung lay stretched along the verdant bed and sweetly plied the lisping tongue lo from the spraydeserted steep where either way the twigs divide the one rolled headlong to the deep and plunged beneath the closing tide the other saw and from the land while nature imagd strange distress stretched over the brink his little hand the fruitless signal of redress the offered pledge without delay the struggling victim rose and caught but ah in vain  their fatal way they both descended swift as thought short was the waveoppressing space convulsed with pains too sharp to bear their lives dissolved in one embrace their mingled souls flew up in air lo there yon timeworn sculpture shows the sad the melancholy truth what pangs the tortured parent knows what snares await defenseless youth here not to sympathy unknown full often the sad muse wandering near bends silent over the mossy stone and wets it with a willing tear an epistle from an unfortunate gentleman to a young lady occasioned by a catastrophe well known in the west  by the same these the last lines my trembling hands can write these words the last my dying lips recite read and repent that your unkindness gave a wretched lover an untimely grave sunk by despair from lifes enchanting view lost ever lost to happiness and you  no more these eyelids shower incessant tears no more my spirit sinks with boding fears no more your frowns my suing passion meet no more i fall submissive at your feet with fruitless love this heart shall cease to burn lifes empty dream shall nevermore return think not that laboring to subdue your hate my artful soul forebodes a fancied fate for ever yon sun descends his western way cold shall i lie a lifeless lump of clay tired of my long encounters with disdain peaceful my pulse and ebbing from its pain each vital movement sinking to decay and my spent soul just languishing away ever my last breath yet hovers to depart i prompt my hand to pour out all my heart the hand often raised compassion to implore the heart that burns with slighted fires no more relentless nymph of natures fairest frame unpitying soul and woman but in name angelic bloom the coldest heart to win without allurement but disdain within regard the sounds which seal my parting breath ever the vain murmurs shall be hushed in death let pity view what love disdained to save and mourn a wretch sent headlong to the grave profuse of all an anxious lovers care to urge his suit and win the listening fair tried every purpose to relieve my woe my soul chides not for innocent i go save when soft pity bids my gentler mind shrink at your fate and drop a tear behind how often and fruitless have i strove to move unfeeling beauty with the pangs of love as rose your breast with captivating grace and heightened charms flew blushing to your face insulting charms that gave a fiercer wound fond as i lay and prostrate on the ground heavens with what scorn you strove my suit to meet frowned with your eyes and spurned me with your feet to bleeding love such hard returns you gave as barbarous rocks that dash the pressing wave o could your looks have turned my hapless fate and frowned my shortlived passion into hate then had no scattering breeze my sorrows known nor vale responsive had prolonged the moan then had those lips never learnt their woeful tale nor death yet clothed them in eternal pale often to the woods in frantic rage i slew to cool my bosom with the falling dew often in sad accents sighed each prompting ill and taught wild oaks to pity and to feel till with despair my heart rekindled burns and all the anguish of my soul returns then restless to the fragrant meads i hie death in my face distraction in my eye there as reclined along the verdant plain my grief renews her heartwrung strains again lo pitying phoebus sinks with sorrow pale and mournful night descends upon the tale when tired at length my wrongs no more complain and sighs are stifled in obtuser pain when the deep fountains of my eyes are spent and fiercer anguish sinks to discontent slow i return and prostrate on my bed bid the soft pillow lull my heavy head but o when downy sleep its court renews and shades the soul with visionary views illusive dreams to fan my slumbering fire and wake the fever of intense desire present your softer image to my sight all warm with smiles and glowing with delight gods with what bliss i view thy darling charms and strive to clasp thee melting in my arms  but ah the shade my empty grasp deceives and as it flits and my fond soul bereaves the transient slumbers slip their airy chain and give me back to all my woes again there wrapped in floods of grief i sigh forlorn the constant greetings of unwelcome morn but should oblivion reassume her sway and slumbers once more steal my woes away when the short flights of fancy intervene your muchloved image fills out every scene but now no more soft smiles your face adorn lo over each feature broods destructive scorn suppliant in tears i urge my suit again sullen you stand and view me with disdain your ears exclude the story of my smart your baleful eyes dart anguish to my heart i wake  glad nature hails returning day and the wild songsters chaunt their mattinlay the sun in glory mounts the crystal sky and all creation is in smiles but i then sink in death my senses  for in vain you strive to quench the phrenzy of your pain break break fond heart  her hate thou can not tame then take this certain triumph over thy flame it is done  the dread of future wrongs is past  lo brittle passion verges to its last it is done  vain lifes illusive scenes are over  disdainful beauty shakes her chains no more come peaceful gloom expand thy downy breast and soothe o soothe me to eternal rest there hush my plaints and gently lull my woes where one still stream of dull oblivion flows no laboring breast there heaves with tortures throws no heart consumes her daily hoard of woes no dreams of former pain the soul invade calmly she sleeps a sad unthinking shade but ever from thought my struggling soul is free one latest tear she dedicates to thee she views thee on the brink of vain despair beat thy big breast and rend thy flowing hair feels torturing love her sable deluge roll weigh down thy senses and oerbear thy soul in vain your heart relents in vain you weep no lover wakes from his eternal sleep alas i see thy frantic spirit rave and thy last breath expiring on my grave is this the fortune of those highprizd charms ah spare them for some worthier lovers arms and may these bodings never with truth agree may grief and anguish be unknown to thee may bitter memory never recount with pain that ever you frowned or i admired in vain no more  my spirit is prepared to fly suppressed my voice and stiffend is my eye deaths swimming shadows intercept my view vain world and thou relentless nymph adieu a song by the same ye scenes that engaged my gay youth say whither so fast do ye fly if the lesson you told me was truth ah why do ye fade from my eye that meadow where often i strayed that bank and yon shadowy tree those streams with such fondness surveyed have hid all their sweetness from me yon hill that uprears his smooth head where the wildthyme its fragrance bestows whose verdures have rose from my bed and whose breezes have sighed my repose what though from his summit so high flock cottage and woodland are seen yet no more i with fondness descry for indifference rises between ah whither ye sweets do ye fly for fancy your absence must mourn ah say will ye fade from my eye and yet will ye never return that valley whose mantle so gay is with primrose and cowslip overspread no longer invites me to stray and rifle the sweets of their bed not odious at present they look i discern that their colors are bright but their charms have my fancy forsook and their fragrance forgot to delight to my cooler attention how dear the soothing complaint of the dove i have left my companions to hear the woodlinnet warble her love nor these can my footsteps retard or if round me they carelessly fly from mine eyes they attract no regard and my ears their soft warblings deny ah sure it is the business of life that bids those endearments depart to involve us in cares and in strife that estrange and entangle the heart with destiny all must comply yet cannot my fancy but mourn for the season that fades from my eye and the sweets that must never return on the eternity of the supreme being by christopher smart m a hail

their march directing still faithful still inconstant to the sun or where the comet through space infinite though whirling worlds oppose and globes of fire darts like a javelin to his destined goal or where in heaven above the heaven of heavens burn brighter sans and goodlier planets roll with satellits more glorious  thou art there or whether on the oceans boisterous back thou ride triumphant and
