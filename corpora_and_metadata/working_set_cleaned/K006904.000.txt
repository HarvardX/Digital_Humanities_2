between them law is a bottomlesspit chap i the occasion of the lawsuit i need not tell you of the great quarrels that have happened in our neighborhood since the death of the late lord strutt how the parson and a cunning attorney got him to settle his estate upon his cousin philip baboon to the great disappointment of his cousin esquire south some stick not to say that the parson and the attorney forged a will for which they were well paid by the family of the baboons let that be as it will it is matter of fact that the honor and estate have continued ever since in the person of philip baboon  you know that the lord strutts have for many years been possessed of a very great landed estate well conditiond wooded waterd with coal salt tin copper iron etc all within themselves that it has been the misfortune of that family to be the property of their stewards tradesmen and inferior servants which has brought great encumbrances upon them at the same time not abating of their expensive way of living has forced them to mortgage their best manors it is credibly reported that the butchers and bakers bills of a lord strutt that lived two hundred years ago are not yet paid  when philip baboon came first to the possession of the lord strutts estate his tradesmen as is usual upon such occasions waited upon him to wish him joy and bespeak his custom the two chief were john bull the clothier and nic frog the linnendraper they told him that the bulls and frogs had served the lord strutts with drapery ware for many years that they were honest and fair dealers that their bills had never been questioned that the lord strutts lived generously and never used to dirty their fingers with pen ink and counters that his lordship might depend upon their honesty that they would use him as kindly as they had ne his predecessors the young lord seemd to  all in good part and dismissed them with a deal of  content assuring them he did not intend to  any of the honorable maxims of his predecessors  chap ii how bull and frog grew jealous that the lord strutt tended to give all his customs to his grandfather  baboon it happened unfortunately for the peace of our nebourhood that this young lord had an old cunni rogue or as the scots call it a false loon of a grafather that one might justly call a jack of all tra sometimes you would see him behind his counter sell broad cloth sometimes measuring linen next day  would be dealing in mercery ware high heads rbons gloves fans and lace he understood to a nice charles mather could not bubble a young beau bet with a toy nay he would descend even to the sell of tape garters and shooebuckles when shop  shut up he would go about the neighborhood and ea half a crown by teaching the young men and maids  dance by these methods he had acquired imme riches which he used to squander away at backswor quarterstaff and cudgel play in which he took gre pleasure and challenged all the country you will  it is no wonder if bull and frog should be jealous of th fllow it is not impossible says frog to bull but the old rogue will take the management of the ou lords business into his hands besides the rasc has good ware and will serve him as cheap as a body in that case i leave you to judge what mu become of us and our families we must starve or tu journeymen to lewis baboon therefore neighbou i hold it advisable that we write to young lord strutt to know the bottom of this matter  chap iii a copy of bull and frogs letter to the lord strutt my lord i suppose your lordship knows that the bulls and the frog have served the lord strutts with all sorts of draper ware time out of mind and whereas we are jealous not without reason that your lordship intends henceforth to buy of your grandsire old lewis baboon this is to inform your lordship that this procceediug does not suit with the circumstances of our families who have lived and made a good figure in the world by the generosity of the lord strutts therefore we think fit to acquaint your lordship that you must find sufficient security to us our heirs and assigns that you will not employ lewis baboon or else we take our remedy at law clap an action upon you of  0000 l for old debts seize and distrain your goods and chattels which considering your lordships circumstances will plunge you into difficulties from which it will not be easy to extricate your self therefore we hope when your lordship has better considered on it you will comply with the desire of  your loving friends john bull nic frog   some of bulls friends advised him to take gentler methods with the young lord but john naturally loved rough play it is impossible to express the surprise of the lord strutt upon the receipt of his letter he was not flush in ready either to go to law or clear old debts neither could he find good bail he offered to bring matters to a friendly accommodation and promised upon his word of honor that he would not change his drapers but all to no purpose for bull and frog saw clearly that old lewis would have the cheating of him  chap iv how bull and frog went to law with lord strutt about the premises and were joined by the rest of the tradesmen all endeavors of accommodation between lord strutt and his drapers proved vain jealousies encreasd and indeed it was rumored abroad that lord strutt had bespoke his new liveries of old lewis baboon this coming to mrs bulls ears when john bull came home he found all his family in an uproar mrs bull you must know was very apt to be choleric you sot says she you loyter about alehouses and taverns spend your time t billiards ninepins or puppetshows or flaunt about the strets in your new gilt chariot never minding me nor your numerous family dont you hear how lord strutt has bespoke his liveries at lewis baboons shop dont you see how that old fox steals away your customers and turns you out of your business every day and you sit like an idle drone with your hands in your pockets fie  up man rouse thy self ill sell to my shift before ll be so used by that knave you must think mrs bull had been pretty well tuned up by frog who chimd in with her learnd harangue no further delay now but to counsel learned in the law they go who unanimously assured em both of the justice and infallible success of their lawsuit  i told you before that old lewis baboon was a sort of a jack of all trades which made the rest of the tradesmen jealous as well as bull and frog they hearing of the quarrel were glad of an opportunity of joining against old lewis baboon provided that bull and frog would bear the charges of the suit even lying ned the chimneysweeper and tom the dustman put in their claims and the cause was put into the hands of humphrey hocus the attorney  a declaration was drawn up to show that bull and frog had undoubted right by prescription to be drapers to the lord strutts that there were several old contracts to that purpose that lewis baboon had taken up the trade of clothier and draper without serving his time or purchasing his freedom that he sold goods that were not marketable without the stamp that he himself was more fit for a bully than a tradesman and went about through all the country fairs challenging people to fight prizes wrestling and cudgelplay and abundance more to this purpose  chap v the true characters of john bull nic frog and hocus for the better understanding the following history the reader ought to know that bull in the main was an honest plaindealing fellow choleric bold and of a very unconstant temper he dreaded not old lewis either at backsword single fauchion or cudgelplay but then he was very apt to quarrel with his best friends especially if they pretended to govern him if you fatterd him you might lead him like a child johns temper depended very much upon the air his spirits rose and fell with the weatherglass john was quick and understood his business very well but no man alive was more careless in looking into his accounts or more cheated by partners apprentices and servants this was occasioned by his being a booncompanion loving his bottle and his diversion for to say truth no man kept a better house than john nor spent his money more generously by plain and fair dealing john had acquired some plumbs and might have kept them had it not been for his unhappy lawsuit  nic frog was a cunning fly whoreon quite the reverse of john in many particulars covetous frugal minded domestic affairs would pine his belly to save his pocket never lost a farthing by careless servants or bad debtors he did not care much for any sort of diversions except tricks of highgerman artists and legerdemain no man exceeded nic in these yet it must be owned that nic was a fair dealer and in that way had acquired immense riches  hocus was an old cunning attorney what he wanted of skil in law was made up by a clerk which he kept that was the prettiest felow in the world he loved money was smooth tongued gave good words and seldom lost his temper he was not worse than an infidel for he provided plentifuly for his family but he loved himself better than them all he had a termagant wise and as the neighbors said was plaguey henpeckd he was seldom obervd as some atornies will practice to give his own personal evidence in causes he rather chose to do it per test conduct in a word the man was very well for an attorney  chap vi of the various success of the lawsuit law is a bottomless pit it is a cormorant a harpy that devours every thing john bull was flattered by his lawyers that his suit would not last above a year or two at most that before that time he would be in quiet possession of his business yet ten long years did hocus steer his cause through all the meanders of the law and all the courts no skill no address was wanting and to say truth john did not starve the cause there wanted not tellow boys to see counsel hire witnesses and bribe juries lord strutt was generally cast never had one verdict in his favor and john was promised that the next would be the final determination but alas that final determination and happy conclusion was like an enchanted island the nearer john came to it the further it went from him new trials upon new points still arose new doubts new matters to be cleared in short lawyers seldom part with so good a cause ti they have got the oyster and their clients the shell john money book debts bonds mortgages all went into the lawyers pockets then john began to borrow money up in bankstock east india bonds and now and then  farm went to pot at last it was thought a good expedient to set up esquire souths title to prove the wi forged and dispossess philip lord strutt at once here a gain was a new field for the lawyers and the caul grew more intricate than ever john grew madder and madder wherever he met any of lord strutts servants he tore off their clothes now and then you would see them come home naked without shoes stockings and linen as for old lewis baboon he was reduced to his last shift though he had as many as any other his children were reduced from rich silks to doi stuff his servants in rags and barefooted instead or good victuals they now lived upon neckbees and bullocksliver in short no body got much by the matter but the men of law  chap vii how john bull was so mightily pleased with his success tha he was going to leav off his trade and turn lawyer it is wisely observed by a great philosopher that ha bit is a second nature this was verified in the case o john bull who from an honest and plain tradesman had got such a haunt about the courts of justice and such a jargon of lawwords that he concluded himself as able a lawyer as any that pleaded at the bar or sat on the bench he was overheard one day talking to himself after this manner how capriciously does fate or chance dispose of mankind how seldom is that business allotted to a man for which he is fitted by nature it is plain i was intended for a man of law how did my guardians mistake my genius in placing me like a mean slave behind a counter bless me what immense estates these fellows raise by the law besides it is the profession of a gentleman what a pleasure it is to be victorious in a cause to swagger at the bar what a fool am i to drudge any more in this woollen trade for a lawyer i was born and a lawyer i will be one is never too old to learn all this while john had cond over such a catalogue of hard words as were enough to conjure up the devil these he used to bubble indifferently in all companies especially at coffeehouses so that his neighbor tradesmen began to shun his company as a man that was crackd instead of the affairs of blackwellhall and price of broadcloath wool and bayses he talked of nothing but actions upon the case returns capias alias capias demurrers venire facias replevins supersedeas certioraris writs of error actions of trovre and conversion trespasses precipes and dedimus this was matter of jest to the learned in law however hocus and the rest of the tribe encouraged john in his fancy assuring him that he had a great genius for law that they questioned not but in time he might raise money enough by it to reimburse him of all his charges that if he studied he would undoubtedly arrive to the dignity of a lord chief justice as for the advice of honest friends and neighbors john despised it he looked upon them as fellows of a low genius poor grovelling mechanics john reckoned it more honor to have got one favorable verdict than to have sold a bale of broadcloath as for nic frog to say the truth he was more prudent for though he followed his lawsuit closely he neglected not his ordinary business but was both in court and in his shop at the proper hours  chap viii how john discovered that hocus had an intrigue with his wife and what followed thereupon john had not run on a madding so long had it not been for an extravagant bitch of a wife whom hocus perceiving john to be fond of resolved to win over to his side it is a true saying that the last man of the parish that knows of his cuckoldom is himself it twas observed by all the neighborhood that hocus had dealings with johns wife that were not so much for his honor but this was perceived by john a little too late she was a luxurious jade loved splendid equipages plays treats and bals differing very much from the sober manners of her ancestors and by no means fit for a tradesmans wife hocus fed er extravagancy what was still more shameful with johns own money every body said that hocus had a months mind to her body be that as it will it is matter of fact that upon all occasions she run out extravagantly on the praise of hocus when john used to be finding fault with his bills she used to reproach him as ungrateful to his greatest benefactor one that had taken so much pains in his lawsuit and retrieved his family from the oppression of old lewis baboon a good swinging sum of johns readiest cash went toward building of hocuss country house this affair between hocus and mrs bull was now so open that all the world were scandalized at it john was not so clodpated but at last he took the hint the parson of the parish preaching one day a little sharply against adultery mrs bull told her husband that he was a very uncivil fellow to use such course language before people o condition that hocus was of the same mind and that they would join to have him turned out of his living for using personal reflections how do you mean says john by personal reflections i hope in god wie he did not reflect upon you no thank god my reputation is too well established in the world to receive any hurt from such a oul mouthed scoundrel as he his doctrine tends only to make husbands tyrants and wive slaves must we be shut up and husbands left to their liberty very pretty indeed a wie must never go abroad with a platonic to see a play or a ball she must never stir without her husband nor walk in spring garden with a cousin i do say husband and i will stand by it that without the innocent freedoms of life matrimony would be a most intolerable state and that a wies virtue ought to be the result of her own reason and not of her husbands government for my part i would scorn a husband that would be jealous if he saw a fellow in bed with me all this while johns blood boiled o his veins he was now confirmed in all his suspicions jade bitch and whore were the best words that john gave her things went from better to worse till mrs bull aimed a knife at john though john threw a bottle at her head very brutally indeed after this there was nothing but confusion bottles glasses spoons plates knives forks and dishes flew about like dust reslt of which was that mrs bull received a bruise in her right side of which she died half a year after the bruise imposthumated and afterward turned to a stinking ulcer which made every body shie to come near her she melt so yet she wanted not the help of many able physicians who attended very diligently and did what men of skill could do but all to no purpose for her condition was now quite desperate all regular physicians and her nearest relations having given her over  chap ix how signior cavallo an italian quack undertook to cure mrs bull of her ulcer there is nothing so impossible in nature but montebanks will undertake nothing so incredible but they will affirm mrs bulls condition was looked upon as desperate by all the men of art then signior cavallo judged it was high time for him to interpose he bragged that he had an infallible ointment and plaster which being applied to the sore would cure it in a few days at the same time he would give her a pill that would purge off all her bad humors sweeten her blood and rectify her disturbed imagination in spite of all signior cavallos applications the patient grew worse every day she stank so no body durst come within a stones throw of her except signior cavallo and his wife whom he sent every day to dress her she having a very gentle soft hand all this while signior apprehended no danger if one asked him how mrs bull did better and better says signior cavallo the parts heal and her constitution mends if she submits to my government she will be abroad in a little time nay it is reported that he wrote to her friends in the country that she should dance a jig next october in westmisterhall that her illness had been chiefly owing to bad physicians at last signior one day was sent for in great haste his patient growing worse and worse when he came he affirmed that it was a gross mistake that she never was in a fairer way bring hither the salve says he and give her a plentiful draught of my cordial as he was applying his ointments and administering the cordial the patient gave up the ghost to the great confusion of signior cavalio and the great joy of bull and his friends signior slung away out of the house in great disorder and swore there was foul play for he was sure his medicines were infallible mrs bull having died without any signs of repentance or devotion the clergy would hardly allow her christian burial the relations had once resolved to sue john for the murder but considering better of it and that such a trial would rip up old sores and discover things not so much to the reputation of the deceased they dropped their design she left no will only there was found in her strong box the following words wrote on a scrip of paper my curse on john bull and all my posterity if ever they come to any composition with my lord strutt there were many epitaphs writ upon her one was as follows here lies johnt wife plague of his life she spent his wealth she wronged his health and left him daughters three as bad as she   the daughters names were polemia discordia and vsuria  chap x of john bulls second wise and the good advice that she gave him john quickly got the better of his grief and seeing that neither his constitution nor the affairs of his family could permit him to live in an unmarried state he resolved to get him another wife a cousin of his last wifes was proposed but john would have no more of the breed in short he wedded a sober country gentlewoman of a good family and a pentiful fortune the reverse of the other in her temper not but that she loved money for she was of a saving temper and applied her fortune to pay johns clamarous debts that the unfrugal methods of his last wife and this ruinous law suit had brought him into one day as she  her husband in good humor she talked to him after the following manner my dear since i have been our wife i have observd great abuses and disorders in ur family your servants are mutinous and quarrelsom d cheat you most abominably your cookmaid is in comination with your butcher poulterer and wishmonger ur butler purloin your liquor and your brewr sells your ogwash your baker cheats both in weight and in tale en your milkwoman and your nursary maid have a fellow eling your tailor instead of shreads cabages whole ards of cloth besides leaving such long scores and not ing to market with ready money forces us to take bad ware  the tradesmen at their own price you have not posted  books these ten years how is it possible for a man of usiness to keep his affairs even in the world at this rate ay god this hocus be honest would to god you would  over his bills and see how matters stand between frog d you prodigious sums are spent in this law suit and more st be borrowed of scriveners and usurers at heavy interest sides my dear let me beg of you to lay aside that wild ject of leaving your business to turn lawyer for which  me tell you nature never designed you believe me these gues do but flatter that they may pick your pocket john ard her all this while with patience till she prcikd  maggot and touched his tender point then he broke  in a violent passion what i not fit for a lawyer  me tell you my clodpated relations spoiled the greatest ius in the world when they bred me a mechanic lord tt and his old rogue of a gransire have found to their  that i can magine a law suit as well as another i  deny what you say says mrs bull nor do i call in que your parts but i say it does not suit with your circumces you and your predecessors have lived in good repuon among your neighbors by this same clothing trade  it were madness to leave it off besides there are few  know all the tricks and cheats of these lawyers does  our own experience teach you how they have drawn you om one term to another and how you have danced the  of all the courts still flattering you with a final issue  for ought i can see your cause is not a bit clearer than it  seven years ago i will be damned says john if i  of any composition from strutt or his grandfather i will  wheel about the streets an engine to grind knives and scissars however i will take your advice and look over my accounts  chap xi how john looked over his attorneys bill when john first brought out the bills the surprise of all the family was unexpressible at the prodigious dimensions of them in short they would have measured with the best bale of cloth in johns shop fees to judges puny judges clerks prothonotories philizers cirographers underclerks proclamators council witnesses jurymen marshals tipstaffs cryers porters for enrollings exemplifications bails vouchers returns caveas examinations filngs of words entries declarations replications recordats nolle pros qis certioraris mittimus demurrers special verdicts informations scire facius supersiedeas abeas corpus coachhire treating of witnesses etc verily says john there are a prodigious number of learned words in this law what a pretty science it is ay but husband you have paid for every sylable and letter of these fine words bless me what immense sums are at the bottom of the account john spent several weeks in looking over his bills and by comparing and stating his accounts he discovered that besides the extravagance of every article he had been egregiously cheated that he had paid for council that were never feed for writs that were never drawn for dinners that were never dressed and journeys that were never made in short that hocus and frog had agreed to throw the burden of the lawsuit upon his shoulders  chap xii how john grew angry resolved to accept a composition and what methods were practiced by the lawyers for keeping him from it well might the learned daniel burgess say that a lawsuit is a suit for life he that sows his grain upon marble will have many a hungry belly before harvest this john felt by woeful experience johns cause was a good milch cow and many a man subsisted his family out of it however john began to think it high time to look about him he had a cousin in the country one sir roger bold whose predecessors had been bred up to the law and knew as much of it as any body but having left off the profession for some time they took great pleasure in compounding lawsuits amongst their neighbors for which they were the aversion of the gentlemen of the long robe and at perpetual war with all the country attorneys john put his cause in sir rogers hands desiring him to make the best of it the news had no sooner reached the ears of the lawyers but they were all in an uproar they brought all the rest of the tradesmen upon john squire south swore he was betrayd that he would starve before he compounded frog said he was highly wronged even lying ned the chimneysweeper and tom the dustman complained that their interest was sacrificed as for hocuss wife she took a hackneychair and came to johns house immediately and fell a scolding at his wife like the mother of beelzebub you silly awkward illbred country sow you have you no more manners than to rail at my husband that has saved that clodpated numskulld ninny hammer of yours from ruin and all his family it is well known how he has rose early and sat up late to make him easy when he was sotting at every alehouse in town i knew his last wife she was a woman of breeding good humor and complaisance knew how to live in the world as for you you look like a puppet moved by clockwork your clothes hang upon you as they were upon tenterhooks and you come into a room as you were going to steal away a piss pot get you gone into the country to look af your mothers poultry to milk the cows churn the butter and dress up nosegays for a holy day and meddle not with matters that you know no more of than the signpost before your door it is well known that my husband has an established reputation he never swore an oath nor told a lie in all his life he is grateful to his benefactors faithful to his friends liberal to his dependants and dutiful to his superiors he values not your money more than the dust under his feet but he hates to be abused once for all mrs mynx leave off talking of my husband or i will pull out these saucer eyes of yours and make that redstreak countryface look as raw as an ox cheek upon a butchers stall remember i say that there are pillories and duckingstools with this away she flung leaving mrs bull no time to reply no stone was left unturnd to fright john from this composition sometimes they spread reports at coffeehouses that john and his wife were ran mad tt they intended to give up house and make over all the estate to old lewis baboon that john had been often talking to himself and seen in the streets without shoes or stockings that he did nothing from morning to night but beat his servants after having been the best master alive as for his wife she was a mere natural sometimes johns house was beset with a whole regiment of attorneys clerks bailiffs followers and other small retainers of the law who threw stones at his windows and dirt at himself as he went along the street when john complained of want of ready money to carry on his suit they advised him to pawn his plate and jewels and that mrs bull should sell her linnnen and wearing clothes  chap xiii how the lawyers agreed to send don diego dismallo the conjurer to john bull to diswade him from making an end of his law suit and what passed between them bull how does my good friend don diego   don never worse who can be easy when their friends are playing the fool   bull but then you may be easy for i am resolved to play the fool no longer i wish i had hearkened to your advice and compounded this law suit sooner   don it is true i was then against the ruinous ways of this law suit but looking over my scheme since i find there is an error in my calculation sol and jupiter were in a wrong house but i have now discovered their true places i tell you i find that the stars are unanimously of opinion that you will be successful in this cause that lewis will come to an untimely  and strutt will be turned out of doors by his wife and children then he went on with a torrent of eclypticks cycles epicycles ascendants trines quadrants conjunctions bulls bears goats and rams and abundance of hard words which being put together signified nothing john all this while stood gaping and staring like a man in a trance   finis
