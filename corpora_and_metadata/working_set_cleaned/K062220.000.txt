an elegy written among the ruins of an abbey by the author of the nun  london printed for j dodsley in pall mall  mdcclxv  price six pence  an elegy where sighs the zephyr to yon lonely tree a solemn grove its leafy mantle spread where bend yon mouldering turrets over the sea a venerable dome once reared ts head the solemn grove the venerable dome were erst frequented by a numerous train even chaste as they who dians mountain roam but not subjected to her gentle reign far other goddess did this train obey far other temples other altars raised far other meaning breathed their choral lay far other incense on their altars blazed veiled superstition waked her magic sound bad albions sons forsake the splendid court forsake amusements variegated round and to her able standard here resort alas obsequious to her stern command a sullenpensive brotherhood they came refused to trace the paths by nature pland and razed from glorys page their ancient name nor these alone were found incloisterd here here also dwelt the simpleminded swain who wrapped in sloth dreamed out the lazy year while industry sat weeping on the plain the many temples rising fair to view which towering superstition called her own with hand unerring radiant truth oerthrew and snatched the impostor from her tinseld throne on yon dustleveld spire the crafty maid with indignation brooding in her breast sits gloomily  her votries all are fled her lamps extinguished and her rites suppressed within her hand a vacant string she holds that one connected many a hallowed bead the blotted scroll the other hand unfolds contains the maxims of her slighted creed couched at her feet behold a mouldering shrine of various relics once the dread abode where runs the spider over his treacherous line where lurks the beetle and the loathsome toad on darkness wing now sails the midnight hour when for the grateful sound of choral prayer the shrieking owl from yon disparted tower with notes of horror wakes her trembling ear of human grandeur mark the fleeting day how frail each purpose and each wish how vain the strongbuilt domes the cloistered fanes decay and ruin hovers round the desert scene the path that leads to yonder shattered pile is now perplexed with many a sordid brier no crowd is seen within the sacred isle the sabbath mourns its longdeserted quire the golden crozier blended with the dust in horrid folds the serpent clasps around the powerful image and the sainted bust defamed unhallowed press the weedy ground not distant far her goldencircled tower the inviolable dome majestic reared on whose dread altar breathed some hidden power by terror guarded and by kings revered to which asylum even the assassin came his hand audacious still imbrued with gore the boon of full impunity to claim while feeble justice wept her baffled lore so truth at length dissolved the mental chain and banished error from the enlightened shore so closed at length the busyacted scene the curtain dropped and follys mask was over then gladsome ceres raised her drooping head while yellow harvests gilt the smiling plain beheld a youthful band around her spread with sickles armed to reap the bearded grain the warrior then beneath the trailing vest the peaceful cassock or the drowsy cowl no longer quenched the flame within his breast or lulled the purpose of his daring soul but rushed undaunted to the doubtful war pursued where glory led the radiant way till neptune rising on his coral car resigned his watery world to britains sway the virgin fair by venal guardians doomed by error prompted or subdued by force no more in cloisters drear their days consumed like flowerets strewn around the senseless corse triumphant hymen hailed the blissful hour and saw a whiterobd social train approach for whom the pleasures dressed the happy bower and scattered roses over the destined couch still other blessings from this change appeared no injured family did then behold on loitring monks its native wealth conferred nor spacious altars covered with its gold full many trod that crooked path to fame yet from her hand received no lasting meed she from her annals rends their fading name and gives to infamy the worthless deed but vengeance some pursued with dire disgrace pursued beyond the circle of its sphere even to the cemeterys dark recess nor spared them sleeping on the peaceful bier beside the spreading of that sombrous yew where yawns with hideous chasm the vaulted cave presenting to the fixed astonished view the profanation of a rifled grave the largeendowing rufus lay inurnd with many a sculptured image on his shrine that smit with sorrow over his ashes mourned the sistergraces and the tuneful nine imprinted on traditions storied leaf is found to this sepulchral spot confined a terrorbreathing tale that wins belief and often repeated by the neighbring ind from where yon mountain shades the dreary pla attracted by the scent of human blood a troop of wolves voracious scoured amain and at this charnel vault required their food when horrid to relate they burst the tomb and swift descending to the deepest shade uptore the shrouded tenant from its womb and over the mangled corse relentless preyed the paly stars with dim reluctant light like tapers glimmerd on their orgies foul while gliding specter screamd with wild affright reechod loud by their tremendous howl ah what availed the solemnmoving hearse the sabledmantled cars the funeral throng engraved on his monument the soothing verse the priests the torches and the choral song misjudging wretch while thou with hand profuse thy treasures on this mansion did entail and pour down riches on the vowed recluse thine orphan babes partook a scanty meal thy widowed fair her cheek bedewed with tears approached with suppliant knee the cloistergate there often disclosed in vain her poignant cares returning still to weep her haploso fate finis
