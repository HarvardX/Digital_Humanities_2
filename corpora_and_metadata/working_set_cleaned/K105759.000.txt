land late be thou numbered with our sainted band rich in thy gathered fame and graced with long command to thee o keppel while the muse conveys these hallowed accents of no mortal praise may she with glory all thy wrongs repay may her bright subject consecrate her lay it is hers all furious party rage above the faithful herald of a nations love with naval oak to twine her laurel leaf and crown the temples of her favorite chief it is hers while warm her indignation glows hurling contempt on thy defeated foes with an impartial and avenging hand the blushing front of calumny to brand  worst of all evils of all pests the chief diffusing general or domestic grief pernicious child of a corrupted state with private horror marked and public hate false accusation stands whose serpent tooth delights to fasten on distinguished truth in greece in rome when guardian freedom fled on noblest blood this fattend monster fed there every bribe that could allure the slave all that distinction once to virtue gave debased by tyrants to the villains pay tempted this lurking fiend to brave the open day o p the muse disdains to think a naval son of england ever could sink to sell his fame and as an hireling rend the unsuspecting bosom of a friend no twas wild passion pride and spleen combined to rob of reason thy disordered mind which while delirious dreams its powers enthrall mistook a statesmans smile for honors call at length awaking freedom like the sun shows thee the fatal course thy frenzy run and that of all by public hatred cursed the baffled false accuser ranks the first in sir lewis stuckley vice admiral of devonshire and the kinsman of raleigh whose design of escaping he perfidiously betrayed was surprised in whitehall clipping the gold bestowed on him as a reward of his treachery and being condemned for that crime and reduced to the necessity of stripping himself to his shirt to raise money to purchase a pardon withdrew himself from the odium of mankind to the island of lundy in the severn sea where he died mad    0 in less than two years after raleigh  birchs life of sir w raleigh stuckleys end their dreadful fate we view whose plots the ruin of the brave pursue stuckley that knight of perfidy who sold the blood of raleigh for a tyrants gold full on himself his own dire arts recoiled first of the wages of his sin despoiled then justly doomed his head abhorred to hide in frantic penury the traitor died worst of bad men  yet see a name appear which deeper brands of detestation sear whose soul would rob by basest passion led the brave of honor and the poor of bread who placed the stream of charity to guide and over her hallowed temple to preside in darkness entering at a private door profanes with vile abuse her sacred store o if our isle who boasts a generous race could rear a being of a soul so base may public vengeance all his guilt proclaim and injured honor execrate his name while in full day his deepest crimes are seen give him to feel how wide the space between th eselfperplexing wiles of courtly art and the clear conduct of a keppels heart that generous heart with public virtue fraught of private vengeance will despise the thought for thy accuser keppel still retain silent abhorrence and a brave disdain whatever his motives if of envy born disease of little minds they merit scorn if sprung from public zeal with passion blind they claim the pity of thy nobler mind thy mind which scorned to play the accusers part or doubt the courage of an english heart even in those galling hours when reared in vain thy warlike signal called a tardy train and disobedience joined with envious night to rob thy valor of the promised fight  full often have chiefs disgusted with command abjured the service of a thankless land untaught to bear the wrongs of base mankind the last and hardest conquest of the mind may thou o keppel every wrong forget and pay thy country still a britons debt clear as thy own may englands honor grow proved by the voice of each applauding foe though speculation in dark visions tossed has long pronounced her mighty empire lost there are who over the fancied ruin sigh who course of thought and course of language cry that england fell in that disastrous hour when the scotch serpent climbed the tree of power who hid in governments perplexed machine yet lives malignant and corrodes unseen  thus while the imperial ship sublimely rides in awful splendour on the subject tides beneath her keel a foe insidious lurks through the strong oak the mining mischief works the lofty fabric though in semblance firm sinks the proud victim of a foreign worm whatever this voice by skeptics may be found factions false cry or truths prophetic sound let every briton with bold blake proclaim his ruling passion is his countrys fame what men soer her seats of counsel fill the brave must feel she is their country still let them for her the worst of perils dare and never never of the state despair not even when doomed with darkness to overspread the sacred glory round britannias head the evil genius of the pale  prompts the weak pause or plans the dire campaign the curse of mindens field or saratogas plain yet dare to hope that built by freedoms hand the splendid pile of britains fame shall stand though her weak statesmen ill sustain its weight mere mouldering vain pilasters of the state yet british virtue theme of noblest song strong in her fleets and in her armies strong like the firm cement of an ancient tower desies the rage of time and every hostile power this virtue still the bards peculiar care shall prompt the patriot song and martial prayer thou god of hosts whose sacred breath imparts valors unclouded flame to british hearts whose hand has spread our triumphs round the globe and dressed the queen of isles in glorys gorgeous robe may thy protecting spirit still the same sustain her tottering on the throne of fame  but if prepared the avenging angel stand to pour thy wrath on this devoted land if her brave sons their forfeit lives must pay grant them to perish in the face of day for britain perish mid the combats clang where honors smile endears the dying pang let courage when ensnared by falshoods breath still burst the toils of ignominious death and justice prove that truth will never depart from her firm seat the genuine sailors heart o ye our islands pride and natures boast whose peerless valor guards and gilds our coast ye gallant seamen in this trying hour remember union is the soul of power nor let dissension with infectious hand shake the firm strength of your fraternal band your injured country bids you join to throw avenging thunders on your common foe let anger scorn the rancorous debate the low and little jars of private hate and nobly sacrifice each selfish aim on the bright altar of britannias fame finis
